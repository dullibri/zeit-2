HEADLINE: Three Questions After the June Jobs Report

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: The three economic and political questions that are most pertinent in the wake of the jobs report. 

 BODY:
Payroll jobs increased by 80,000 in June, according to the government's survey of employers, marking the third consecutive month of tepid job growth. After revisions, job growth was 68,000 in April and 77,000 in May. 
There are three economic and political questions that I think are most pertinent in the wake of the news.
1. Will the Federal Reserve act? The stock market reacted harshly to the report, with the Dow Jones industrial average off by more than 100 points at the opening bell on Friday. This was despite the fact that investors, looking at the weak stream of data this month, had pegged the number fairly accurately. Consensus forecasts from Wall Street had called for 90,000 to 100,000 jobs to be added. On average, preliminary Wall Street estimates miss the payroll number by about 70,000 jobs, so a miss of 10,000 to 20,000 jobs is quite modest. 
The reason for the stock market's sharp decline, instead, may be the market's sentiment that, although the number is weak, it is not necessarily so weak to trigger additional stimulative actions by the Fed. I do not necessarily come to a judgment about whether the market is wise about anticipating Fed policy actions -- but perversely, a somewhat worse number might have met a more tepid reaction from the stock market.
The Federal Open Market Committee meets next on July 31 and Aug. 1, at which point it could consider additional quantitative easing programs or other stimulative actions.
2. Is this the new normal? Before the June jobs report was released, most economists had expected the payroll numbers to revert to something stronger, perhaps 150,000 jobs per month, over the remaining months of the year. 
Weakness in May and June had been observed in a number of economic indicators. But there were also glimmers of hope in measures that are arguably more forward-looking: some signs of a rebound in the housing market, a significant decrease in oil and energy prices, and relatively good news out of Europe.
Meanwhile, other indicators of job growth have been slightly stronger than the government's payroll report. The government's separate household survey, from which the unemployment rate is calculated, showed 128,000 jobs added in June, and 127,000 on average over the past three months -- although the household survey is associated with a larger sampling error than the survey of employers.
The ADP report on private-sector payrolls has shown about 140,000 jobs added per month since April.
Discrepancies like these are not uncommon; the number of jobs in the American economy is a hard thing to measure. Revisions to the government's payroll report are often quite substantial; since 1970, they have averaged 54,000 jobs per month. That means the margin of error on the jobs reports -- enough to cover 95 percent of all possible cases, as would be reported if they were political polls -- is even larger, in excess of 100,000 jobs per month.
Still, even if the government's payroll numbers are underestimating job growth slightly, the job market is not doing much more than treading water. Perhaps 125,000 jobs are needed to keep up with the growth in the population.
3. Is this a political 'game changer'? On Thursday night, I had written that a significant downside miss in the job numbers could change the prevailing sentiment about the state of the presidential campaign -- with the conventional wisdom becoming that the election had reverted into being a toss-up, after a solid string of news and polling numbers for President Obama in late June.
As I mentioned, I am not sure this qualifies as a significant miss relative to the market's expectations. Still, those expectations were quite low to begin with. These are certainly disappointing numbers as compared to what had seemed possible earlier in the year.
Before the January job numbers were released, I wrote that 150,000 jobs added per month would make Mr. Obama roughly break-even for re-election given his approval ratings at that time. Between the strong numbers in the first few months of the year and the weaker ones recently, almost exactly 150,000 jobs per month have been created so far in 2012.
However, Mr. Obama seems to have gotten the benefit of the doubt from voters. His approval ratings improved some early in the year, but have not yet declined much with recent jobs reports.
The June numbers, then, will represent another test of Mr. Obama's resiliency. Mitt Romney should have an opportunity to turn the conversation back to the economy over the next few weeks. If he is not able to take advantage of it, then it might be more appropriate for conservatives to fret about the state of his campaign -- concerns that seem a bit premature now.

HEADLINE: Book Review Podcast: Superman and Supremely Boring Books

BYLINE: JOHN WILLIAMS


HIGHLIGHT: Larry Tye talks about his new biography of the iconic American superhero. 

 BODY:
In The New York Times Book Review, James Parker reviews Larry Tye's new biography of Superman, the hero who is approaching his 75th birthday. Mr. Parker calls Superman "a lonely, lonely man-god. Was he even a real superhero? On his native Krypton (now destroyed) he would have been normal, after all: it was only Earth's 'slighter gravity pull' that gave him his superstrength. And Lois might dote upon the all-conquering Superman, but she despised Clark Kent. Was there anyone out there who could love them both - love him, that is, in the totality of his being?"
Elsewhere in the Book Review, Bruce Handy shares his collection of boring books, which he has gathered up from street vendors around his New York neighborhood. One of the books he picked up is a 1952 collection of speeches by Adlai Stevenson, about which he writes:
Though he lost consecutive elections to Dwight Eisenhower, Stevenson had a reputation as a gifted speaker, esteemed for his dry, self-deprecating wit. But did even his most fervent supporters really need unexpurgated texts of his "Farm Policy" speech or the Sept. 23, 1952, address on "The Control of Inflation"? Getting the party started in his foreword, John Steinbeck notes, "A year and a half ago, I had never heard of Mr. Stevenson."
On this week's podcast, Mr. Tye talks about Superman; Julie Bosman has notes from the field; David Haglund discusses Sheila Heti's new novel; Mr. Handy shares his thoughts about dull books; and Gregory Cowles has best-seller news. Sam Tanenhaus is the host.

HEADLINE: Who's in Charge of Fixing This?

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Those waiting for the Federal Reserve to take new action might do better to watch the inflation rate than the jobs numbers. 

 BODY:
Another month, another lackluster jobs report, and once again investors are lifting their eyes unto the Fed, whence cometh help. 
And perhaps those prayers will be answered. After all, the Federal Reserve is legally required to minimize unemployment.
But anyone counting on the Fed's policy-making committee to begin another round of "quantitative easing" when it meets at the end of the month should keep in mind a few reasons for caution.
Fed officials were not expecting the unemployment rate to decline. They predicted last month that the rate would stand between 8 percent and 8.2 percent at the end of the year, and that still looks like a pretty good guess.
Furthermore, that bleak outlook has so far not roused them to action. The Fed's policy-making committee did decide last month to extend a bond-buying program until the end of the year, but that was a placeholder intended to maintain that status quo, not improve it. 
Finally, the closer we get to a presidential election, the greater the potential political advantages of lying low and waiting another few months. Yes, the Fed is a nonpartisan body insulated from political pressure. So is the Supreme Court.
On the other hand, the surest trigger for Fed action during this long crisis has been the fear of deflation. The central bank has consistently responded when the predicted pace of inflation droops too far below the 2 percent annual rate that officials consider most healthy. And one crucial measure of those expectations, known as the five-year break-even rate, now stands at 1.78 percent.
That is certainly lower than the central bank would like to see. But is it low enough to spur fresh action? 
Before the Fed announced its current bond-buying program, Operation Twist, in September 2011, that rate had hit 1.39 percent. Before the Fed announced its last major portfolio expansion, QE2, in November 2010, the rate had fallen as low as 1.13 percent.

HEADLINE: India Weighs Providing Free Drugs at State-Run Hospitals

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: The proposal would fill a gap in health care, but be a blow to big pharmaceutical companies. 

 BODY:
"In what would be a landmark increase in the Indian government's spending on public health, New Delhi is completing a proposal to provide hundreds of essential drugs free to patients in government-run hospitals and clinics at a cost of nearly $5 billion over five years, officials said Thursday," Vikas Bajaj wrote in The New York Times. 
"The proposal, which could receive government approval next month, would try to fill a gaping hole in the provision of health care at state-owned hospitals, many of which require patients to buy their own drugs, including substances as basic as intravenous fluids," Mr. Bajaj wrote. 
Specialists say "it could also be the first step toward a more comprehensive universal health care system in India," which, with 1.2 billion people, is the world's most populous country after China, he wrote. 
Drugs account for more than 70 percent of out-of-pocket medical costs for Indians. Government hospitals and clinics provide free or low-cost care, but most of them struggle to keep up with demand, and the quality of care can be poor. 
For Western drug makers, which have long chafed at India's comparatively weak protection of their patents, the government's plan could be another blow. Although they only have a tiny share of the Indian market, Western drug companies are looking at India and other emerging markets as a vital source of growth as sales flatten in the United States and Europe. Under the proposal, the government would only buy cheap generic versions of drugs, making it more difficult for brand-name drugs to be sold.
The policy move is part of India's stated goal of increasing spending on health care to about 2.5 percent of its gross domestic product from about 1.4 percent. By contrast, the Chinese government spent about 2.3 percent of its G.D.P. on health care in 2009 and Sri Lanka spent about 1.8 percent.

HEADLINE: Making Way for More Bikes in National Parks

BYLINE: FELICITY BARRINGER


HIGHLIGHT: A rule will allow individual park superintendents to decide on increased bicycle use on back roads and trails. 

 BODY:
The debate over who should use the roads and paths of the country's national parks is consistently fraught. In California's Sequoia National Park, unkind words are sometimes exchanged when pack animals with their wide panniers encounter hikers kitted out with the latest R.E.I. gear on the trails behind Mount Whitney. The code of etiquette and safety governing such encounters is sometimes ignored, and there have been continual efforts to ban horses, burros and llamas because of their impact on the trails. 
This year Congress intervened to permit stock packing on national parklands in the Sierra after a court ruled in a lawsuit filed by the High Sierra Hikers that the current system for permitting stock violated the Wilderness Act.
Now bicycles are becoming part of the whose-trail-is-it debate. On Friday, the National Park Service published a final regulation in the Federal Register giving individual park superintendents the power to allow bicycles on existing or new roads and pathways.

The service's stated aim is to promote a healthy way to explore park areas where motor vehicles are not allowed. As the rule in the Federal Register noted, bicyclists already use "trails, fire roads, abandoned railroad right-of-ways and canal towpaths." 
The park service said the new rule would expand bicycle access "while preserving the service's responsibility to prohibit bikes in wilderness and other areas where they would have significant impact on the environment or visitor safety." 
The practical effect of the rule is to streamline the process of opening roads and trails to bicycles and to localize the decision-making, which had previously been handled by national officials and posed significant administrative hurdles to those seeking a change.
But Jeff Ruch, the director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, argues that the new rule poses a threat to backcountry areas that might some day be eligible for wilderness protections but are not now in line for official wilderness designation. 
Bicycle use is a form of mechanized transport prohibited in areas protected under the Wilderness Act, so new backcountry bike trails might disqualify some wilderness-quality lands from attaining wilderness status, he said.
The Association of National Park Rangers made the same point in a 2009 comment on the bicycle proposal. "All these potential N.P.S. wilderness acres are vulnerable under the proposed rule to have their character changed in such a way as might eliminate their consideration for inclusion into the National Wilderness Preservation System at some later date," it said. "Examples include the majority of acreage in some iconic national parks such as Yellowstone National Park and Great Smoky Mountains National Park."
Dave Barna, a spokesman for the National Park Service, said in an interview on Friday that no bicycles would be permitted "in any wilderness area, proposed wilderness area" or area formally identified as having wilderness characteristics.
But the rangers group said that it did not trust all park superintendents to resist outside influence from pro-biking interests in communities where bike rentals are a thriving business. "The proposed regulation opens the door to park management decisions that could permanently impair or impact potential wilderness acreage to a single decision maker, and that is a framework that can allow for disaster," it wrote.
Some have called for separating bikers and hikers on the trails, either by regulating the hours when each group can use them or segregating trails and allowing hikers on some and bikers on others. 
The park service responded that parks would consider "time-of-day or alternate-day authorization of uses, one-way riding requirements on loop trails, and requiring bicyclists to dismount and walk their bicycle through congested areas."
Thrill-seeking will be discouraged, the Federal Register notice said. "Individual parks may, for example, consider ways to accommodate the safe use of bicycle trails for slow- to moderate-paced access, sightseeing and exercise," it said. "Generally speaking, thrill-seeking at fast speeds would not be an appropriate activity in National Park System units."
Some commenters were concerned that bikes had been unfairly discriminated against and that the rule did not remedy this. But Mr. Barna of the park service described the new policy as "a reasonable compromise."

HEADLINE: Another Dismal Jobs Report, Another Misguided Attack from the Right

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: The latest unemployment numbers are disturbing--but so is the Republican Party's reaction. 

 BODY:
If you're following the political reaction tothe latest jobless numbers, you're probably having trouble separating reality from fantasy. 
Let's start with reality. The numbers are disturbing. Employers added a disappointing 80,000 jobs in June, leaving the unemployment rate where it was, 8.2 percent. There was a tiny increase from May, but we're still way below where we need to be for anything like a full recovery.
And that just covers those who are looking for jobs. If you add those who gave up looking for jobs or who are involuntarily working part-time, it's 14.9 percent - 23 million people. That's down from 17.4 percent in October 2009 but it's much higher than the 8.8 percent before the Great Recession began. 
It's obviously bad for a sitting president running for re-election. But there's one other bit of reality that Mitt Romney and his Republican backers don't want voters to think about. It's not all - or even mostly - President Obama's fault. Congressional Republicans and recklessly budget-slashing governors and state legislators are just as much, and in some cases more, to blame.

"This is a time for Americans to choose whether they want more of the same," Mr. Romney said from his vacation spot in New Hampshire, while delving deeply into fantasy. "It doesn't have to be this way. America can do better. And this kick in the gut has to end."
He means that if Mr. Obama is tossed out, he becomes president and Republicans get even more control over Congress, then the situation will change. It will. It will get worse. Republican economic policies got us into this mess and they will not get us out of it - the trickle-down delusion, wildly irresponsible deregulation, tax breaks for very rich people, two wars funded by debt but kept off the books by President George W. Bush. 
House Republicans want to exempt the Defense Department from the across-the-board cuts that they demanded to resolve the phony debt-ceiling crisis last year. They would put that additional burden instead on middle- and lower-income Americans.
America's income has plummeted. Cuts in federal programs, along with budget slashing at the state and local level, have built amountain of pink slips for teachers, firefighters and policemen, among other public employees. (Mr. Romney was fine with that, and even thought we could use fewer of all three.) There have been at least 100,000 education employees laid off nationwide in the last three years; the White House puts the figure at 250,000.
While we're on the matter of fantasy, Crossroads GPS, the Republican campaign organ founded by Karl Rove that pretends to be independent for tax purposes, has releaseda new videosaying that Mr. Obama has a lot of "excuses" for why he hasn't fixed the economy (as if it were merely up to the president). It doesn't mention, of course, Republicans' excuses for doing so much to create the country's economic pain, and for stymieing everything Mr. Obama has tried to do to alleviate it. Not that they're bothering to make excuses for that at all.

HEADLINE: Peering Into a Deepening Bank Scandal

BYLINE: ERIC OWLES


HIGHLIGHT: Banks are pushing to settle with regulators amid the deepening bank scandal that consumed the leadership of Barclays. Look back on our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance and mark your calendars for what comes next. 

 BODY:
Banks are pushing to settle with regulators amid the deepening bank scandal that consumed the leadership of Barclays. Look back on our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance and mark your calendars for what comes next.
A parliamentary committee will ensure that Barclays remains the focus of scrutiny next week. On Monday, Paul Tucker, the deputy governor at the Bank of England, will respond to testimony from Barclays former chief executive that placed some of the blame for the Libor manipulation on the country's central bank. The next day, Barclays' soon-to-be former chairman, Marcus Agius, will testify. Barclays' defense, that regulators implicitly approved the manipulation of key interest rates, portrays the bank as too cozy with authorities to fail.
Peter J. Henning, DealBook's White Collar Watch columnist, says that the investigation is likely to continue on two fronts in the coming months. "First, the criminal investigation will focus on other banks and individuals that were contributors to Libor to determine their role in submitting false interest rate data for setting the benchmark."
American and British regulators are investigating more than 10 big financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and UBS. DealBook's Ben Protess and Mark Scott reported that "American regulators have set their sights on a large European institution" and other British banks are pushing to negotiate a deal with authorities.
 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is building several investigations bank by bank, bit by bit, in a process that has drawn praise from editorial boards, but is not expected to deliver an immediate case. A report from a British parliamentary committee is due before the end of the year.
The second front, says Mr. Henning, "will be private lawsuits against the banks for manipulating Libor and its counterparts, Euribor and Tibor, for European and Japanese interest rate benchmarks."
"The settlements in the civil cases could cost banks a combined $6.1 billion," Mr. Scott reported. "The figure is based solely on one financial product, United States dollar interest rate swaps, that uses Libor as a benchmark."

 BODY:
Uproar Over C.E.O.'s Ouster at Merged Energy Giant | A former director involved in the merger that formed the nation's largest electric utility is lashing out at an abrupt leadership change at the combined company.
"This is the most blatant example of corporate deceit that I have witnessed during a long career on Wall Street," said John H. Mullin III, the former lead director of Progress Energy, which completed its merger with Duke Energy this week.
Duke said Tuesday that it had closed its merger with rival Progress, a $32 billion deal originally struck a year-and-a-half ago. As dictated in the merger agreement, William D. Johnson, the head of Progress, was to become chief executive of the combined company.
But in a news release announcing the deal's completion, the company's newly formed board named James Rogers, the chief executive at Duke, head of the merged business and said that Mr. Johnson was leaving the company "by mutual agreement."
The news of Mr. Johnson's ouster - and its unusual circumstances - sent shockwaves through the utility industry. On Thursday, several people connected to the deal expressed disapproval with the last-minute move, including Mr. Mullin, who did not join the merged companies' board.

HEADLINE: MyCar: An Electric Runabout With Bipartisan Support

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: The neighborhood electric vehicle, to be built in Mississippi, is backed by prominent politicians on both sides of the aisle. 

 BODY:
If a start-up car company's chances for success were correlated to the enthusiasm of its chief executive, then an electric-vehicle venture led by Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee chairman, would be a sure thing. It takes more than charisma to attract buyers, though, and while the enterprise in question enjoys support from prominent politicians in the Republican and Democratic parties, it also engenders skepticism from some analysts.
Mr. McAuliffe's GreenTech Automotive will unveil the two-seat, low-speed, Smart-size MyCar on Friday at a new plant in Mississippi. The event, he said in a telephone interview, would feature a barbecue and an appearance by the former president Bill Clinton, Mr. McAuliffe's longtime friend.
Mr. McAuliffe is a possible candidate for the Virginia governorship in 2013 -- he lost a three-way Democratic primary for the post in 2009 -- but he says he has a good reason for choosing to manufacture the MyCar in Mississippi.
"Haley Barbour put the most aggressive package on the table for us," he said, referencing the state's former governor, a Republican. "No one else's offer was even close to Governor Barbour's. We can disagree on political issues, but this is two people from different parties coming together. He's been very aggressive in bringing in the carmakers, so now he's saying, 'Let's try an electric.' It's a win-win for everybody."
Toyota and Nissan also operate plants in the state.
In a separate telephone interview, Mr. Barbour said he and Mr. McAuliffe had reached across the aisle before, since both were involved in the opening of the bipartisan Caucus Room restaurant in Washington in 2000. He said GreenTech received an "off-the-shelf package of incentives" to locate its plants in Mississippi. "It's not about politics," he said. "It's about economic development and higher-paying, higher-skilled job creation in my state. We have not, by a long shot, given up on manufacturing in Mississippi."
Mr. McAuliffe said the venture would employ 900 workers in Mississippi by the end of the year, as well as create many jobs indirectly. With an initial focus on fleet sales and the European market, he says he believes the company can produce 10,000 cars in 2013. GreenTech described its first Mississippi plant, a leased 400,000-square-foot former elevator factory in Horn Lake, as a pilot facility. A second plant, in Tunica, is expected to open in 2013.
Mr. McAuliffe quoted a price of $18,000 for a MyCar with an included lithium-ion battery pack, and $10,000 for the basic car, presuming a battery lease from the company. A version of the car with lead-acid batteries and 51 miles of range will sell in the mid-$15,000 range, according to Marianne McInerney, a GreenTech sales and marketing spokeswoman.
But prices and performance may vary. Chris Anthony, chief executive of Flux Power, said in a telephone interview that his California-based company had worked with GreenTech "for well over a year" on lithium batteries for the car and had developed 7-, 15- and 23-kilowatt-hour packs, the largest of which would give the car more than 100 miles of range. He also said several hundred packs had been delivered to GreenTech.
The MyCar is hardly a slam dunk for Western buyers. It is a neighborhood electric vehicle, or N.E.V., which means it is not allowed on interstates and is legally limited to 25 miles per hour in most states. In a majority of markets, statutes limit the cars to roads with posted top speeds of 35 m.p.h. or lower. Although it was designed by the noted Italian stylist Giorgetto Giugiaro, the MyCar was originally the product of a Hong Kong-based venture bought by Mr. McAuliffe and his partners for $20 million in 2010.
Mr. McAuliffe said in May that an early MyCar produced in Mississippi was delivered to Denmark, where the company has a relationship with an electric car distributor, Greenabout A/S. Last year, GreenTech said Greenabout would "purchase a sizeble percentage of production through 2014."
GreenTech is also building a factory in China to produce cars for that market. According to Mr. McAuliffe, he negotiated a contract requiring that core components for those vehicles be built at the plants in Mississippi. "The powertrain and guts of the car will be made in the United States," he said. "If we allow one more technology to escape overseas, shame on us."
There's some skepticism over the market for speed-limited cars. "It's a niche vehicle, and historically niche vehicles haven't done particularly well," Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at Edmunds.com, said in a telephone interview. She also noted that pricing for the soon-to-be-delivered Chevrolet Spark minicar would start at about $13,000, "and you can take it on the highway."
But Jay Friedland, legislative director of the advocacy group Plug In America, was more supportive. "It makes sense in some ways," he wrote in an e-mail. "The export market for these, as medium-speed vehicles, is pretty good. There is also a big market for neighborhood vehicles in Florida." He described annual sales of 5,000 to 10,000 N.E.V.'s as "probably doable." Anything beyond that, however, "is dreaming," he said.

HEADLINE: Groups' Praise for Cuomo? It Was Written by His Aides

BYLINE: DANNY HAKIM


HIGHLIGHT: A top aide to Gov, Andrew M. Cuomo suggested quotes to executives of independent groups and won approval to use them in a news release. 

 BODY:
ALBANY - Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's administration likes to hear compliments so much that it will write them for you.
The Democratic administration ghostwrote statements for two business groups that praised the state budget in a mid-April news release from the governor's office, according to e-mails obtained by The New York Times through a Freedom of Information request. The correspondence provides an unusual look at how elected officials try to burnish their images. 
The statements were written by Andrew Zambelli, a top aide to the governor, who e-mailed them to two business advocacy groups, the Business Council of New York State and Unshackle Upstate. In the e-mails to both groups, Mr. Zambelli wrote, "We have written a suggested quote," and he then asked the top official of each group to review the quote and "edit as you see fit." 
Mr. Zambelli also made it clear he needed a quick answer, telling Brian Sampson, the executive director of Unshackle Upstate, that "this is kind of a rush." 
No changes were made. Both statements appeared verbatim in the news release, under the names of Heather Briccetti, the president and chief executive of the Business Council, and Mr. Sampson. 
Rich Bamberger, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, defended the practice.
"Give me a break," Mr. Bamberger said. "Working with validators to put together quotes for press releases is standard practice for every level of government." 
The news release included praise from a number of other groups and officials, including former President Bill Clinton. Mr. Bamberger would not say whether the other quotations in the release were also written by the Cuomo administration. 
The quotation written for Ms. Briccetti said, in part, "The Business Council is pleased that by working together, Governor Cuomo and legislative leaders are continuing on the path to bringing fiscal stability back to New York." 
Robert M. Lillpopp, a spokesman for the Business Council, said, "We usually write our own quote," but not always.
"I would say we would agree with every single point that was in there and that's - again, it's our normal practice when asked to put a quote in, to communicate with the people who have asked us," he said. "In this case, they may have given it to us in a way that we felt was appropriate."
Mr. Sampson, with Unshackle Upstate, was quoted in the news release saying, in part, "For two years in a row, Governor Cuomo has shown New Yorkers that he is serious about rebuilding the state's fiscal house, and we applaud his leadership."
Mr. Sampson said Friday that it was "not a practice we normally do."
"I think what happened in that instance is what he wrote up was very similar to what we would have written," he added. "I believe I was traveling that day, so I believe it was easier."

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Unimpressed

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Rupert Murdoch isn't keeping his feelings about Mitt Romney's candidacy to himself, and signaling widespread concern about slowing economic growth, three central banks announced measures Thursday to encourage borrowing and spending. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:

        
Rupert Murdoch isn't impressed with Mitt Romney, and the media mogul hasn't been keeping those feelings quiet, with his criticisms echoing most recently in a harsh Wall Street Journal editorial about the Romney campaign on Thursday. The editorial served as a reminder of Mr. Romney's inability to win over the conservatives at the core of the Republican Party, Jeremy W. Peters reports.

        
Central banks in Europe and China announced efforts on Thursday to encourage borrowing and spending. But what was most striking was the fact that the response was uncoordinated, emphasizing the widespread concern about increasingly sluggish economic growth, Binyamin Appelbaum reports.

        
The Supreme Court's ruling on health care offered conservatives a chance to make a case against President Obama as a president who raised taxes. But now, joining the chorus of critics calling the individual mandate a tax, Mr. Romney is trying to draw a sharp distinction between the plan he put in place as Massachusetts governor and Mr. Obama's plan without getting into semantics, Michael D. Shear and Ashley Parker report.

        
Mr. Obama started a two-day bus tour through Ohio and Pennsylvania on Thursday, trying to highlight the differences between him and Mr. Romney in the hope that the Rust Belt can help carry him to re-election, Mark Landler reports.

        
Some political analysts say voters are more closely eyeing the jobs reports as they decide whom to support in November, with the unemployment numbers coming out on Friday - and over the next few months - holding a lot of sway among undecided voters, Annie Lowrey and John Harwood report.
Washington Happenings:

        
The Labor Department will release its unemployment numbers for June on Friday morning.

        
Mr. Obama is scheduled to tour a manufacturing plant in Ohio on Friday before speaking at campaign events at an elementary school in Ohio and at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Later, he will sign the transportation and student loan package Congress passed before recess.

HEADLINE: Romney and Republicans Criticize Obama Over Weak Jobs Report

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Republicans quickly seized on the third month of slow job growth to assail Mr. Obama's handling of the economy. 

 BODY:
11:11 a.m. | Updated Another weak jobs report on Friday returns the presidential campaign conversation to the sluggish economy, providing Mitt Romney a reprieve from several weeks of combat with President Obama on other topics.
Mr. Romney on Friday called the unemployment rate "unacceptably high" and blamed Mr. Obama for failing to put in place polices that would jump-start the slow economic recovery.
"The president's polices have not gotten America working again, and the president's going to have to stand up and take responsibility," he said from Wolfeboro, N.H., where he is vacationing.
Mr. Romney echoed the themes he has employed previously in response to weak jobs reports. He said the numbers in Friday's report "understate what people are feeling and the amount of pain" in the country.
"This is a time for Americans to choose whether they want more of the same," he said. "It doesn't have to be this way. America can do better. And this kick in the gut has to end."
Other Republicans also quickly seized on the third month of slow job growth to assail Mr. Obama's handling of the economy. The chairman of the Republican National Committee called it "devastating news" for the country.
"We cannot afford another term of this president because we cannot endure four more years of painfully high joblessness," said Reince Priebus, the party's chairman.
Crossroads GPS, the Republican group founded by Karl Rove, among others, released a video that criticizes the president for what it says are "excuses" for the slow exonomic recover.
Mr. Obama called the added jobs in June a "step in the right direction," citing the creation of 4.4 million jobs over the past 28 months, including 500,000 new manufacturing jobs.
But said that he is not satisfied with the pace of the economic recovery, which was highlighted by Friday's jobs report.
"We can't be satisfied because our goal was never to keep on working to get back to where we were in 2007," Mr. Obama said at an event in Poland, Ohio. "We've got to grow the economy even faster. And we've got to put even more people back to work."
Earlier Friday, the White House responded to the report by noting that the country's economy is "continuing to heal." In a statement, Alan Krueger, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said the president's policies are working.
"It is critical that we continue the policies that build an economy that works for the middle class and makes us stronger and more secure as we dig our way out of the deep hole that was caused by the severe recession," he said.
But the pace of improvement provides a difficult reality for the president, whose campaign has had some success in damaging Mr. Romney by shifting the conversation to other topics, including his work at Bain Capital, a private equity firm.
The jobs report is a reminder that jobs and the economy remain the most powerful and visceral subject for voters weary of a downturn that has lasted years and sapped their enthusiasm about the future.
If the economy remains weak in the months ahead, it could be hard for Mr. Obama to fight the campaign on the terms that his advisers want - by characterizing Mr. Romney as a wealthy, out-of-touch business executive.
For Mr. Romney, the sluggish numbers provide an opportunity to refocus his message even as some Republicans have been wringing their hands over the way he is running his campaign.
A Wall Street Journal editorial on Thursday gave voice to those concerns, suggesting that Mr. Romney is wasting the best opportunity Republicans have to retake the White House from the Democrats.
One challenge for Mr. Romney is to find an effective message in several battleground states where the local economies are doing much better than the national numbers would suggest.
Mr. Obama is on the second day of a bus tour through one of those states - Ohio - where unemployment is headed lower, in part because of an improving automobile industry.
The president's advisers believe that Mr. Romney's grim message will not be as effective in places where the economy has improved. Mr. Obama repeatedly pointed to the auto recovery during stops in Ohio on Thursday.
Aides to Mr. Romney have stressed that several of the states with improving economies have Republican governors, and have said the improvement is not because of Mr. Obama's national policies.

HEADLINE: Obama Promotes a Long View on Jobs

BYLINE: MARK LANDLER


HIGHLIGHT: On the heels of another anemic employment report, President Obama, on the campaign trail, found himself acknowledging again that the economy was not generating enough jobs, that the recovery was not taking hold fast enough, and that too many Americans lacked basic financial security. 

 BODY:
POLAND, Ohio - For President Obama, this is the new normal.
On the heels of another anemic employment report, the president found himself acknowledging again that the economy was not generating enough jobs, that the recovery was not taking hold fast enough, and that too many Americans lacked basic financial security.
"It's still tough out there," Mr. Obama said to a sympathetic crowd in an elementary-school gymnasium here, on the second day of his campaign swing through Ohio and Pennsylvania.
As he has after previous reports, the president took a glass-is-half-full approach to the numbers, pointing out that businesses generated 84,000 new jobs last month, and 4.4 million over all since the onset of the recession, of which 500,000 are in manufacturing.
"That's a step in the right direction," he said, "But we can't be satisfied because our goal was never to just keep on working to get back to where we were back in 2007."
Mr. Obama also took a longer view than the monthly report or even the election season: "I want to get back to a time when middle-class families and those working to get into the middle class have some basic security," he said. "We've got to deal with what's been happening over the last decade, the last 15 years."
With few signs that the labor market will strengthen appreciably before Election Day, Mr. Obama is honing a vocabulary to deal with a listless economy - one in which the difference between recovery and recession is hard to discern. One of his techniques is to focus not just on the latest indicators, but on longer-tem economic trends, which he said have deepened inequality and put at risk the future of the middle class.
Lengthening his frame of reference allows Mr. Obama to argue that the problems of today are not principally his fault, but the result of a Republican philosophy practiced by the Bush administration and advocated by Mr. Obama's challenger, Mitt Romney.
Still, the poor job numbers snuff out the after-glow from the Supreme Court's decision last week to uphold the president's health care law. The news also gave Mr. Romney a chance to seize the offensive again after days in which he and his aides got off track in their response to whether the part of the health care law that imposes a fee for lack of insurance is a tax.
"There's a lot of misery in America today," Mr. Romney said in New Hampshire, where he is vacationing this week. Calling the latest numbers a "kick in the gut," he said, "the president's policies have clearly not been successful in reigniting this economy, in putting people back to work and in opening factories across this country."
For Mr. Obama, the jobs report has become a nerve-rattling monthly reckoning that, for the last three months at least, has held almost no good news for him. White House officials insist that the president is not buffeted by the ebb and flow of monthly statistics, but even the longer-term trend, which they say is critical, has not been favorable.
"These numbers confirm that this economy is stuck just north of neutral," said Jared Bernstein, a former chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. "We're making progress, but it's much too slow."
Mr. Bernstein, who is now at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group that focuses on social programs and budget policy, said there was little point in Mr. Obama trying to sugarcoat the poor economic conditions. But he said the president could make a credible case that he had broken the Great Recession but, because of gridlock in Washington, had not been able to finish the job.
The White House made essentially that argument in a statement by Alan Krueger, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. He said Mr. Obama had proposed to give tax benefits to companies to move jobs back to the United States and funding for state and local governments to hire hundreds of thousands of teachers.
"It is critical that we continue the policies that build an economy that works for the middle class," Mr. Krueger said in the statement, "and makes us stronger and more secure as we dig our way out of the deep hole that was caused by the severe recession."
The White House sought a silver lining in the numbers, noting that the economy has added private-sector jobs for 28 consecutive months. It also noted that the economy added 11,000 manufacturing jobs in June - a relevant yardstick for Mr. Obama on his tour of the industrial Midwest.
The president began the day at a diner in Akron, eating breakfast with three workers from a Goodyear tire factory. His choice of dining partners served as a useful reminder that in 2009, the Obama administration filed a trade action against China for dumping tires in the American market.
Mr. Obama played up the blue-collar flavor of his trip with an oblique dig at Mr. Romney, who is vacationing at his lakeside compound in New Hampshire. The president's fondest memory of vacationing, he told the audience, was a trip around the United States when he was 11. His family traveled on Greyhound buses and stayed in Howard Johnson motels.
The president's forthright embrace of the somber economic reality may reflect the fact that voters continue to place much of the responsibility for the financial crisis and the recession on former President George W. Bush.
In a Gallup poll last month, 68 percent of respondents held Mr. Bush responsible for a "great deal" or a "moderate amount" for the economic woes, while 52 percent held Mr. Obama primarily responsible. Even among Republicans, the poll found, 49 percent blamed Mr. Bush, while 51 percent said he was not responsible.

HEADLINE: Peering Into a Deepening Bank Scandal

BYLINE: ERIC OWLES


HIGHLIGHT: Banks are pushing to settle with regulators amid the deepening bank scandal that consumed the leadership of Barclays. Look back on our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance and mark your calendars for what comes next. 

 BODY:
Banks are pushing to settle with regulators amid the deepening bank scandal that consumed the leadership of Barclays. Look back on our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance and mark your calendars for what comes next.
A parliamentary committee will ensure that Barclays remains the focus of scrutiny next week. On Monday, Paul Tucker, the deputy governor at the Bank of England, will respond to testimony from Barclays' former chief executive, who placed some of the blame for the Libor manipulation on the country's central bank. The next day, Barclays' soon-to-be former chairman, Marcus Agius, will testify. Barclays' defense, that regulators implicitly approved the manipulation of key interest rates, portrays the bank as too cozy with authorities to fail.
Peter J. Henning, DealBook's White Collar Watch columnist, says that the investigation is likely to continue on two fronts in the coming months. "First, the criminal investigation will focus on other banks and individuals that were contributors to Libor to determine their role in submitting false interest rate data for setting the benchmark."
American and British regulators are investigating more than 10 big financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and UBS. DealBook's Ben Protess and Mark Scott reported that "American regulators have set their sights on a large European institution" and other British banks are pushing to negotiate a deal with authorities.
 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is building several investigations bank by bank, bit by bit, in a process that has drawn praise from editorial boards, but is not expected to deliver an immediate case. A report from a British parliamentary committee is due before the end of the year.
The second front, says Mr. Henning, "will be private lawsuits against the banks for manipulating Libor and its counterparts, Euribor and Tibor, for European and Japanese interest rate benchmarks."
"The settlements in the civil cases could cost banks a combined $6.1 billion," Mr. Scott reported. "The figure is based solely on one financial product, United States dollar interest rate swaps, that uses Libor as a benchmark."

HEADLINE: Peering Into a Deepening Bank Scandal

BYLINE: ERIC OWLES


HIGHLIGHT: Banks are pushing to settle with regulators amid the deepening bank scandal that consumed the leadership of Barclays. Look back on our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance and mark your calendars for what comes next. 

 BODY:
Banks are pushing to settle with regulators amid the deepening bank scandal that consumed the leadership of Barclays. Look back on our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance and mark your calendars for what comes next.
A parliamentary committee will ensure that Barclays remains the focus of scrutiny next week. On Monday, Paul Tucker, the deputy governor at the Bank of England, will respond to testimony from Barclays' former chief executive, who placed some of the blame for the Libor manipulation on the country's central bank. The next day, Barclays' soon-to-be former chairman, Marcus Agius, will testify. Barclays' defense, that regulators implicitly approved the manipulation of key interest rates, portrays the bank as too cozy with authorities to fail.
Peter J. Henning, DealBook's White Collar Watch columnist, says that the investigation is likely to continue on two fronts in the coming months. "First, the criminal investigation will focus on other banks and individuals that were contributors to Libor to determine their role in submitting false interest rate data for setting the benchmark."
American and British regulators are investigating more than 10 big financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and UBS. DealBook's Ben Protess and Mark Scott reported that "American regulators have set their sights on a large European institution" and other British banks are pushing to negotiate a deal with authorities.
 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is building several investigations bank by bank, bit by bit, in a process that has drawn praise from editorial boards, but is not expected to deliver an immediate case. A report from a British parliamentary committee is due before the end of the year.
The second front, says Mr. Henning, "will be private lawsuits against the banks for manipulating Libor and its counterparts, Euribor and Tibor, for European and Japanese interest rate benchmarks."
"The settlements in the civil cases could cost banks a combined $6.1 billion," Mr. Scott reported. "The figure is based solely on one financial product, United States dollar interest rate swaps, that uses Libor as a benchmark."

HEADLINE: Another (Seasonally Adjusted) Slowdown

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Are job gains really withering as the recovery falters? Or is much of the reported change caused by misleading seasonal adjustments? 

 BODY:
The disappointing jobs report for June will increase pressure on the Federal Reserve to do more. It will add to hopes (among Republicans) or fears (among Democrats) that a slowing economy could damage President Obama's re-election prospects.
May I suggest an alternative explanation? The recovery has been chugging along slowly for a couple of years, and while it may have slowed a little in the last few months, that change has been minor. 
The reason that few doubt that the jobs picture is getting worse is that they look at the Labor Department's seasonally adjusted figures. But those adjustments most likely overstate reality these days. Employers are acting more cautiously than they did in previous cycles. They add fewer seasonal jobs than they used to, and they therefore get rid of fewer seasonal workers when the season is over.
The result is that the seasonal adjustments make things look better than they are in the winter, when fewer workers are being let go than the government expects, and worse in the spring and summer, when the workers who were not let go cannot be rehired. There is, of course, more than seasonal adjustment going on, but I suspect that the underlying swings are far more modest than the monthly figures seem to indicate. 
On a monthly basis, by the way, there were more than 800,000 private sector jobs added -- before seasonal adjustments -- in each of the last three months. But the seasonal adjustments reduced the monthly average to less than 100,000.
Below is a chart showing the annual change in actual private sector employment since January 2000. Looking at 12-month changes means you can ignore seasonal adjustments, so these are unadjusted figures. In June, the number of jobs was up 1.8 million from a year earlier, or 1.6 percent. The annual changes were a little higher in the winter, but the year-to-year change was the best for any June since 2006. 
June is the month when the seasonal adjustments call for the largest upward adjustment in private sector jobs, as students find summer work. If there are fewer summer jobs than there used to be, we would expect the June seasonally adjusted numbers to be disappointing. They have been so in each of the last three years.
If that analysis is correct, the job numbers are likely to seem poor for the next two months, but to pick up with the September report on Oct. 5, and then to look impressive in the October report, which will appear on Nov. 2, four days before the election.

HEADLINE: Libor's Dirty Laundry

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA. 
Charles M. Blow is off today.

 BODY:
Here in the early stages of the Libor scandal -- and, yes, this thing is far from over -- there are two big surprises.
The first is that the bankers, traders, executives and others involved would so openly and, in some cases, gleefully collude to manipulate this key interest rate for their own benefit. With all the seedy bank behavior that has been exposed since the financial crisis, it's stunning that there's still dirty laundry left to be aired. We've had predatory subprime lending, fraudulent ratings, excessive risk-taking and even clients being taken advantage of in order to unload toxic mortgages.
Yet even with these precedents, the Libor scandal still manages to shock. Libor -- that's the London interbank offered rate -- represents a series of interest rates at which banks make unsecured loans to each other. More important, it is a benchmark that many financial instruments are pegged to. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which doggedly pursued the wrongdoing and brought the scandal to light, estimates that some $350 trillion worth of derivatives and $10 trillion worth of loans are based on Libor. 
With so much depending on this one critical interest rate, there shouldn't ever be a question about its reliability. Yet beginning in 2005, according to the C.F.T.C. and the Justice Department, derivative traders at Barclays, the too-big-to-fail British bank, with the active involvement of traders at other yet-unnamed banks, persuaded their fellow bank employees to submit Libor numbers that were shaded in ways that would help ensure their trades were profitable. Even Robert Diamond Jr., the former Barclays chief executive who lost his job over the scandal, said that reading the traders' e-mails made him ''physically ill.''
In 2007, as the financial crisis was gathering steam, banks also began submitting false Libor rates for a different reason. Libor, you may recall, was a measure that gave the outside world a sense of how much trouble the banks were in; the higher the rate required to borrow, the worse shape they were assumed to be in. So Barclays -- with what appears to be the complicity of British bank regulators -- started submitting rates that were lower than the reality. Its executives said the purpose was to keep Barclays from ''sticking its head above the parapet.''
Even now, Barclays justifies the latter rationale as being a kind of emergency measure brought on by the financial crisis. But the bank is wrong about this. Submitting false data, for whatever reason, is a violation of the law -- not to mention a fundamental abuse of trust. Once again, it leads one to believe that bankers feel neither the constraints of the law nor of morality.
Which brings me to the second big surprise. Britain and America have reacted to the Libor scandal in completely different ways. Britain is in an utter frenzy over it, with wall-to-wall coverage, and the most respectable, pro-business publications expressing outrage. Yes, Barclays is a British bank, and the first word in Libor is ''London.'' But still: The Economist ran a headline about the scandal that read, in its entirety, ''Banksters.''
Yet, on these shores, the reaction has been mainly a shrug. Perhaps we're suffering from bank-scandal fatigue, having lived through Bank of America's various travails, and the Goldman Sachs revelations, and, most recently, the big JPMorgan Chase trading loss. Or maybe Libor is just hard to gets one's head around.
But the Brits have this one right. They may not understand the intricacies of Libor any better than we do, but they sense, powerfully, that banks have once again made a mockery of the role that society entrusts to them.
''Why has the scandal created outrage in Britain? Because it truly is outrageous,'' said Karen Petrou, the managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics. ''They weren't supposed to be fixing that rate -- no matter what the reason.''
She continued: ''If I give you my money, I need to be able to trust you with it. If you can only be trusted via regulation, then you might as well be a utility. And if banks can't be trusted to manage their trading desks, then we need to rethink our whole model of banking.'' Petrou is not an advocate of returning to the days of Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era law that separated investment banking and commercial banking. But with the Libor scandal, she said, she could certainly understand the growing calls for it.
Barclays, of course, is hardly the only big bank that manipulated Libor for fun and profit. It is simply the first to admit its wrongdoing and settle with the government. The word is that just about every big bank is under investigation for playing games with Libor, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and other American-based financial giants.
Which means there is going to be a lot more opportunities for Americans to become outraged over this scandal. And, maybe, to finally summon the will to change banking once and for all.

HEADLINE: Fewer Aircraft Orders Expected at Show This Year

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
The titans of the global aerospace industry will converge Monday at the Farnborough International Airshow, ready to talk shop and wow the crowds with impressive flying displays of the latest in civil and military aircraft. But inside the sprawling maze of corporate chalets and exhibition halls in Hampshire, England, the pace of deal making at the show -- the world's biggest aviation bazaar -- is likely to be more subdued than in recent years.
The announcement earlier this week of plans by the European plane maker Airbus to invest $600 million in a final assembly line in the U.S. state of Alabama -- its first industrial foray onto Boeing's American turf -- will almost certainly be the talk of the show, analysts said, and reflects the European jet maker's confidence in the long-term prospects for the commercial jet market there and elsewhere.
A frenetic buying spree by airlines over the past two years has left both Airbus and Boeing, the world's two leading aircraft makers, with order books fat enough to keep their assembly lines humming for much of the next decade. 
In the near term, however, the airline industry's future looks more uncertain than it did when the Farnborough show was last held, in 2010. A number of Europe's major economies are in recession, and fears about the region's debt crisis continue to reverberate globally. Worldwide airline profits are expected to shrink more than 60 percent this year to about $3 billion, despite steady demand for air travel and declining fuel bills as oil prices fall.
For now, a large commercial order backlog has helped cushion the blow of rapidly shrinking military budgets in the United States and Europe, the two biggest spenders on military aircraft. But those cuts are likely to accelerate amid increasing pressure to cut deficits.
And though much of that reduction will be offset by rising demand in emerging countries in Asia and the Middle East, analysts predict that worldwide military spending is likely to be flat to slightly lower this year than in 2011, after more than a decade of continuous gains.
''The feeling is that we are on an island of prosperity in a world of global doubt,'' said Richard L. Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group consulting firm in Fairfax, Virginia. ''And like all islands, you never know how high the next wave will be.''
Organizers of the biennial show, which takes place about an hour's journey from London, predict that attendance will be on par with that in past years, even though only three-quarters of the 1,400 exhibitors who attended in 2010 will be returning this year. Many of the major industry names have rented smaller exhibition and meeting spaces while a few -- notably Northrop Grumman, a leading U.S. military contractor -- will be staying home altogether. Taking their place will be hundreds of smaller suppliers of components and new technologies from emerging countries like Brazil, China, India and Russia.
''We are sold out,'' said Shaun Ormrod, chief executive of Farnborough International, the organizer of the show. ''But we are seeing a fragmentation in the sense that we are attracting a lot more SMEs'' -- small and medium-sized enterprises -- ''while the bigger players are having to make some changes.''
The uncertainty is particularly acute for American military contractors. Come January, barring congressional action, huge automatic spending cuts will hit the Pentagon, part of the 2011 Budget Control Act, which seeks $1.2 trillion in deficit reductions over 10 years. The cuts could reduce U.S. military spending 10 percent, or $60 billion a year.
''There is a lot of paralysis and uncertainty on the whole defense side of industry,'' said David A. Fitzpatrick, managing director and aerospace analyst at AlixPartners in San Francisco. ''They are all just sitting on their hands trying to decide what to do. And the default answer is nothing.''
It is a far cry from the buoyant mood at the Paris Airshow last year. There, Airbus and Boeing racked up a combined $93 billion in new jet orders and commitments, of which the overwhelming majority were for 150-seat single-aisle planes -- the most popular workhorses of air travel, because they are economical for both short and long flights.
Airbus in particular raised eyebrows with the success of its A320neo (the letters stand for new engine option), a revamped version of its A320 with a more aerodynamic wing and more fuel-efficient engines.
Boeing has since rolled out a souped-up version of its competing 737, also fitted with a next generation of engines, and is scrambling to catch up with Airbus, which has more than 1,300 orders for the A320neo. The American plane maker has so far received firm orders for just 450 of its new jet, dubbed the 737 Max, but says it expects that number to climb to about 1,000 by the end of this year.
Analysts expect that a large number of those 737 Max orders will be announced by Boeing's newly appointed chief executive, Ray Conner, during the Farnborough show.
Airbus, meantime, will be hoping that news of its plans to deliver as many as 50 of the A320 family of jets per year by 2017 from its Alabama plant will bring some new orders from American carriers. But most analysts say that the global economic slowdown and an ever-lengthening waiting list for new planes may keep many airlines from opening their checkbooks this year.
''It's very difficult to get aircraft today because of the backlog,'' said Damien Lasou, a managing director and aerospace analyst at Accenture in Paris. ''So what is the point of making an announcement now, when you can't get the aircraft anyway for three or more years?''
Such a pause, Mr. Lasou and others said, would probably be a good thing. New orders for Boeing and Airbus jets have well outpaced production for all but one of the past eight years and third-party suppliers of components including jet engines and the smallest precision parts are struggling to keep up.
Airbus recently shelved a plan to accelerate the production of its A320 to 44 planes per month in 2014 from its current target of 42, citing capacity constraints among suppliers. (It currently builds 40 of the 150-seat planes per month, a pace that already is an industry record.) Boeing has so far said it is standing by plans to increase 737 production from 35 planes per month currently to 38 in early 2013 and to 42 in 2014.
The recent spate of aircraft buying, particularly by carriers in emerging markets, also has many analysts worried that both companies are booking far more orders than they can reasonably expect to deliver -- or that airlines can expect to finance. That, some say, has raised the prospect of a speculative bubble that could have painful repercussions for manufacturers, airlines and leasing companies.
A major shock -- a fresh jump in oil prices, say, or a global recession -- could bring a sudden drop in air travel demand, prompting carriers to delay or cancel jet orders. If that happened, Airbus and Boeing could find themselves sitting on a glut of unsold inventory.
''My concern is, people will see what they want to see: That these huge orders are an endorsement of further production hikes, which they aren't,'' said Mr. Aboulafia of the Teal Group. ''They are positive endorsements of the long-term future that should not be confused with short-term reality.''
Of course Airbus and Boeing build wide-bodies, too. And while the companies have no new planes to introduce in the 250-500 seat category this year, analysts said they were eager for progress reports on Airbus's forthcoming A350-XWB, due out in 2014, and on Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, which entered service last year but still faces production and delivery delays.
Any new order announcements for these planes -- or indeed for the larger Airbus A380 or Boeing's 747-8 -- would also make headlines.
At the smaller end of the spectrum, analysts said they would be watching closely to see how many orders are received during the show by makers of regional jets, which typically seat between 100 and 200 passengers. Despite relatively weak growth in demand, the sector has become increasingly crowded in recent years, with manufacturers from Brazil, Canada, China, Japan and Russia.
Russia's regional jet program suffered a big blow in May when its flaghip Superjet 100, built by Sukhoi, crashed during a customer demonstration flight in Indonesia, killing all 45 people aboard. The company said it would provide an update on the program and hoped to have a Superjet on display at the show.
Meanwhile, for all the uncertainty, show organizers have lined up at least one guaranteed crowd pleaser: Virgin Galactic, Richard Branson's space-tourism company. It will be displaying the SpaceShipTwo, a six-passenger, sub-orbital ''space plane'' that the company hopes will begin carrying its first paying customers as early as next year.
''I can't think of anything more exciting than bringing this to a trade audience,'' Mr. Ormrod said of the Virgin Galactic craft. ''This is the future. It is our children's children's air travel.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: For Europe's Markets, Latest Gloom Is From U.S.

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
LONDON -- Europe's financial markets turned abruptly negative Friday, prompted for once by disappointing data from the United States -- rather than the euro zone -- but underlining the fragility of a currency union caught in the grip of a debt crisis and an alarming global economic slowdown.
The latest bout of gloom, darkened by a worse-than-expected jobs report from Washington, seems to have doused any residual glimmers of optimism that greeted last week's agreement by European Union leaders to use the region's bailout funds to prop up weak banks while beginning longer-term work toward a more fully integrated banking system for the euro zone. 
But since then there have been too many negative indicators, including the release of record-high unemployment data for the euro zone this past week and acknowledgment by three big central banks that additional measures were needed to stimulate moribund economies.
And on Friday, the head of the International Monetary Fund said the fund would cut its forecast for global economic growth when it releases its quarterly assessment later this month.
European stocks, which had already been listless, fell immediately when the American jobs figures were released Friday in Washington. Three major indexes -- the Euro Stoxx index of euro zone blue chips, the CAC in France and the DAX in Germany -- all ended the day down around 2 percent. Once again, a familiar, disturbing pattern seems to be unfolding in which any positive sentiment generated by European leaders evaporates as doubts grow about the details of what they intend to do and how soon they will be able to do it.
Pressure is now on euro zone finance ministers, who plan to meet Monday in Brussels, to drill into the details of Spain's request for a bank bailout of up to 100 billion, or $123 billion. The terms still need to be itemized in a formal agreement. A much smaller bailout for Cyprus's banks is also likely to be discussed.
And while the agenda will also include the next steps to the deal that was hashed out in principle at last week's E.U. summit meeting, with such much fine print left unresolved, analysts already fear that Monday's gathering will be a letdown.
''We have been through this so many times,'' said Kenneth Wattret, chief euro zone economist at BNP Paribas in London. ''As soon as there is an improvement in market conditions, there is a tendency towards complacency at the policy-making level.''
Significantly, Spanish bond yields, which had fallen during the enthusiasm over the E.U. summit meeting, have been rising steadily this past week. On Friday, they ticked back above 6.9 percent -- a measure of the Spanish government's borrowing costs that is close to levels considered unsustainably high.
Even the economic stimulus measures that the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and China's central bank announced on Thursday seem to have done little to calm markets. In the case of the E.C.B.'s decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-percentage point to an all-time low of 0.75 percent, Mr. Wattret said, investors seemed disappointed that the bank does not seem willing to consider more drastic ''unconventional measures.''
Much remains unresolved at the political level as well.At last week's summit meeting, following a concession by Germany, European leaders agreed to let the euro zone's bailout funds lend directly to struggling banks, rather than through governments. That new approach would avoid increasing the burden on governments like Spain that are already struggling to reduce their deficit and debt levels.
But that move is conditional on the creation of a pan-European supervisory structure for the region's banks. And it is an issue over which divisions within the euro zone are already emerging.
Finland's government, for example, has indicated its disagreement with some of the summit meeting's outcome. And this week Jyrki Katainen, its prime minister, said he would oppose the use of euro zone bailout funds to purchase weaker nations' government bonds.
The increasingly gloomy global outlook can only increase pressure on euro zone finance ministers, whose Monday gathering is the last one scheduled before the summer break. But Guy Schuller, the spokesman for Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the euro zone finance ministers, said Thursday that the group would remain ''on standby'' for additional talks, if necessary.
Mr. Wattret of BNP Paribas argued that there may be a silver lining to the mounting market anxiety because it might force reluctant European politicians to bury their differences.
''A lot of the easy things have been done and, in the euro area, you need a certain amount of market pressure,'' he said. ''It may be that the more the pressure in the markets, the better the outcome.''

HEADLINE: What Do the '60s Tell Us About Today?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Kurt Andersen (''The Downside of Liberty,'' Op-Ed, July 4) argues that left-wing social movements and right-wing economic greed are ''flip sides of the same libertarian coin,'' forged in the late 1960s. It's a clever argument, but it ignores the fundamental purpose of the left-wing causes he mentions, including women's rights, gay rights, ecology and multiculturalism.
These social movements are not about promoting ''hedonistic impulses'' or ''do your own thing,'' but a more just society for all. And these movements may offend but do not actually harm their critics. 
As it's often said, if you're opposed to abortion or gay marriage, don't have an abortion or marry a gay person. Economic greed, in contrast, eventually undermines the commonwealth as a whole. Left and right libertarianism are conceptually similar, but not morally equivalent.
MARK B. BROWN Davis, Calif., July 4, 2012
The writer is an associate professor of government at California State University, Sacramento.
To the Editor:
Kurt Andersen's argument, while cogent, is incomplete. No one can deny that untrammeled individualism is one legacy of the 1960s. But another is a heightened sense of social responsibility. For in truth, there were two revolutions in that tumultuous decade.
One involved stretching the boundaries of personal freedom; the other focused on the limits of freedom, on what individuals, and governments, could not do: oppress racial and sexual minorities, dump poisons into the air and water, and wage endless war based on lies.
It's not surprising that the second revolution has been less successful -- it is always easier for human beings to indulge and rationalize their impulses than to say no -- but it is by no means over.
PHILIP BERROLL New York, July 5, 2012
To the Editor:
Blaming the counterculture for the greedy individualism that has dominated the United States for the last few decades, as Kurt Andersen does, distorts the legacy of 1960s protest.
Hippies may have been self-centered, blind to the fact that there was little opportunity for poor people to ''do their own thing,'' but unshackled capitalism and social Darwinism are not a result of their nonconformity.
One of the major values they promoted was anti-materialism, as they rebelled against their parents' obsessive search for economic security. The counterculture's search, by contrast, was for meaning and authenticity, which admittedly could take selfish forms but never condoned the pursuit of individual profit at the expense of the community.
ROBBIE LIEBERMAN Carbondale, Ill., July 4, 2012
The writer, a professor of history at Southern Illinois University, is the author of ''Prairie Power: Voices of 1960s Midwestern Student Protest.''
To the Editor:
So Kurt Andersen lays today's corporate greed and the mega-indulgences of the 1 percent on the 1960s-era hippies who gave us organic farming, the feminists who created rape crisis centers, and the gay activists championing basic human rights.
A generation of free-market ideologues who hacked at regulations, unions and what was left of the New Deal plays no role in his account of the ascent of the corporate license to pollute, offshore jobs and overpaid executives.
The promotion of individual freedom is not incompatible with concern for the civic good, and never was. History is not so easily turned on its head.
JEREMY VARON Brooklyn, July 4, 2012

HEADLINE: Shares Are Lower on Weak Jobs Data

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Stocks sank about 1 percent on Wall Street on Friday as new unemployment data in the United States showed tepid job growth, sending financial markets another signal about the pace of the economic recovery.
The much anticipated Labor Department report said only 80,000 jobs were added in June, below analysts' forecasts for 100,000, but more than the revised total of 77,000 jobs created in May.
Paul Dales, an economist with Capital Economics, said that the latest payroll data provided further evidence that the economy had lost momentum, but that the recovery was ''not yet'' in danger of grinding to a complete halt. 
''The longer jobs growth stays in this subdued range, the less likely it is that the slowdown is due to the temporary effects of the unusual weather and previous rise in gasoline prices, and the more likely it is due to the more persistent issues of concerns over the global economy and the fiscal position at home,'' he wrote in a research note.
The few bright spots in the unemployment report were slight gains in average hourly earnings and the length of the typical private sector workweek. But as the report's dim picture of the economy settled on the markets on Friday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury declined to 1.55 percent, from 1.6 percent on Thursday, to its lowest level in about a month. The price on the note rose 15/32 to 101 27/32 as investors sought low-risk assets.
''As you can gather from today's strength in the Treasury market, the glimmer of hope provided by these results are far outweighed by depressing data found elsewhere in the employment report,'' said Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company.
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 0.96 percent, or 124.20 points, to 12,772.47 while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 0.94 percent, or 12.90 points, at 1,354.68. The Nasdaq composite index was down by about 1.3 percent, at 2,937.33. The price of West Texas crude oil sank more than 3 percent, to about $84 a barrel, reflecting market sentiment that demand could taper off as global economic growth slows.
Energy stocks were down by more than 1 percent, as were industrials and materials.
Technology stocks declined by more than 1.7 percent. Microsoft shed 1.68 percent to $30.18. Cisco was down 1 percent at $16.77. Oracle fell 1.8 percent to $29.18.
The latest report on the nation's unemployed raised speculation once again that the Federal Reserve would act and what, if anything, it would do, considering it had announced two weeks ago that it would extend its bond-buying program until the end of the year. ''The weak report increases the odds that the Fed will try another round of bond purchases, but we don't expect action soon,'' Nigel Gault, IHS Global Insight's chief United States economist, said.
Stocks in Europe finished the day lower. The Euro Stoxx 50 index fell 2.16 percent. The CAC 40 in France and DAX in Germany were each down about 1.9 percent.
The jobs report came at the end of a short trading week in the United States, where markets were closed for the Fourth of July holiday and lightly staffed on other days. The weakness in equities on Friday contributed to trimming gains in the main indexes for the four-day week. During the period, other measures of the economy were released, like a retail report on Thursday that showed sales had slowed in June as consumers held back on their spending.
Also this week, concerns over economic growth were reflected in the markets after three major central banks announced policy changes. China's central bank surprised the markets when it cut regulated bank lending rates for the second time in four weeks. The European Central Bank cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.75 percent, the lowest level in its 14-year history, while the Bank of England said it would expand its government bond holdings.

HEADLINE: Responsibility Begins At Conception

BYLINE: By SHARI MOTRO. 
Shari Motro is a law professor at the University of Richmond.

 BODY:
Richmond, Va.
FOR most of human history, a woman who became pregnant after sleeping with more than one partner had no way of definitively knowing the identity of the man with whom she had conceived. Likewise, a man whose lover became pregnant had no way of knowing for sure whether his or another man's DNA was gestating inside her.
Since the 1970s it has been possible to genetically link a father and his baby with increasing levels of accuracy. Then, a test using amniotic fluid let us test a baby's DNA before birth, but the procedure increased the risk of miscarriage. Now a prenatal blood test has made the process far easier. Since a small amount of fetal DNA is present in a pregnant woman's blood, the pregnancy can be genetically linked to her partner through a simple blood draw from the woman's arm. 
One of the potential ramifications is that men might be called upon to help support their pregnant lovers before birth, even if the pregnancy is ultimately terminated or ends in miscarriage. They might be asked to chip in for medical bills, birthing classes and maternity clothes, to help to cover the loss of income that often comes with pregnancy, or to contribute to the cost of an abortion.
Of course, plenty of men already treat the costs of pregnancy as a shared responsibility. But some do not, leaving the woman to shoulder the burdens alone.
Some version of this obligation already exists. The problem is that under current law, most states frame men's pregnancy-related obligations as an element of child support or as part of a parentage order, which generally kicks in only after the birth of a child and is limited to medical expenses. Until and unless the pregnancy produces a child, any costs associated with it are regarded as the woman's responsibility. The debate around the new technology has, unfortunately, so far adopted this frame, labeling the test a paternity test and the potential obligation as child support.
Rather than focusing on the relationship between the man and a hypothetical child, the new technology invites us to change the way we think about the relationship between unmarried lovers who conceive. Both partners had a role in the conception; it's only fair that they should both take responsibility for its economic consequences.
Former spouses are often required to pay alimony; former cohabiting partners may have to pay palimony; why not ask men who conceive with a woman to whom they are not married to pay ''preglimony''? Alternatively, we might simply encourage preglimony through the tax code, by allowing pregnancy-support payments to be deductible (which is how alimony is treated).
The most frequent objection I hear to this idea is that it will give men a say over abortion. A woman's right to choose is sometimes eclipsed by an abusive partner who pressures her into terminating or continuing a pregnancy against her will, and preglimony could exacerbate this dynamic. But the existence of bullies shouldn't dictate the rules that govern all of society. In the name of protecting the most vulnerable, it sets the bar too low for the mainstream, casting lovers as strangers and pregnancy as only a woman's problem.
It's also possible that preglimony could deter a different form of abuse by making men who pressure their partners into unprotected sex, on the assumption that the woman will terminate an unwanted pregnancy, financially liable for the potential result.
At the end of the day, preglimony stands to benefit men too, especially those who want to help but are turned away. How many well-intentioned men have been dismissed with ''I don't want your money'' or ''You've done enough damage; now stay away from my daughter''? Preglimony names and in that way honors the man's role in caring for his pregnant lover. A man and a woman who conceive are intimately connected. They are not spouses, and they may not even continue to be lovers, but they are not strangers either.
We've known this for a long time. Preglimony provides an opportunity for the law to catch up.

HEADLINE: Iran: Intelligence Chief Expands List of Suspects

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
Iran's top intelligence official on Friday accused Germany and France for the first time of participating in what the Iranian authorities had previously described as an Israeli-British-American plot aimed at assassinating Iranian nuclear scientists. The intelligence minister, Heidar Moslehi, left, made the accusation during a speech in Tehran, after increasingly bellicose statements by Iran in its dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear program. He also praised his agents for the breakup, first announced in April, of what Iran has called terrorist spy networks responsible for killing at least five nuclear scientists since 2007. Iran has said its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, while the United States, the European Union and Israel say it is a cover for developing the capacity to produce weapons. Western sanctions took effect this week against Iran's oil industry, the country's economic lifeline.

PERSON: Martin L. Swig 

HEADLINE: Martin L. Swig, 78; Started Vintage Car Rally

BYLINE: By DANIEL E. SLOTNIK

 BODY:
When seen today, rare cars like a 1925 Lancia Lambda, a 1941 Tatra T87 or a 1953 Alfa Romeo 1900Pininfarina Coupe are usually standing still, consigned to car shows, dealers' showrooms or inelegant trailers.
By founding the California Mille, an internationally known rally that runs vintage sports cars over 1,000 miles of hilly Northern California roads, Martin Swig ensured that people would see the cars doing what they were meant to do: devouring hot asphalt.
Mr. Swig, who died on Tuesday at 78, organized the first California Mille in 1991. The tour, for automobiles built in 1957 or earlier, lasts four days, starting on the last Sunday in April, and for many miles winds along strikingly scenic Northern California coastline. About 75 vehicles from all over the world join the tour every year, each owner paying about $6,000 to enter. 
Mr. Swig, who also owned one of the first major multiple-franchise car dealerships in the United States, died in Greenbrae, Calif., and lived in Sausalito. His son David said he had a stroke on Sunday.
The California Mille is based on the Italian Mille Miglia, an endurance race from Brescia to Rome and back that ran from 1927 to 1957. Mr. Swig and John Lamm of Road & Track magazine participated in a 1982 revival of the Mille in Mr. Swig's 1955 Alfa Romeo 1900 Zagato. He later drove in about 50 Mille events, in Japan and Australia as well as Italy and California.
The California tour requires unusually devoted drivers, Mr. Swig told Sports Car Digest in 2011. ''They have to have a car they drive and don't just take it out once a year,'' he said. ''You have to be at one with your car.''
Many car collectors focus on one make or model, but Mr. Swig's collection of some 30 automobiles is eclectic. In addition to the rarities listed above, he had five different models of Alfa Romeo's Giulietta, a pair of Datsun 510s and a 1968 Toyota Corona two-door hardtop. His most recent addition was a 2013 Subaru BRZ.
Martin Lewis Swig was born in northern New Jersey on Feb. 8, 1934, moved to Palo Alto, Calif., with his family in 1946. There he became involved in the burgeoning California auto culture as a teenager at Palo Alto High School. He worked at a used car lot in Menlo Park while studying at Stanford, graduating with a bachelor's degree in economics in 1956.
He bought his first dealership, a Datsun franchise, in 1969 and in 1982 opened the San Francisco Autocenter, which brought together in one showroom as many as 17 franchises, from Suzuki to Rolls-Royce.
In addition to his son David, a specialist in cars for Bonhams auction house, Mr. Swig is survived by his wife, Esta; another son, Howard, who sells cars and has written for Car and Driver magazine; a daughter from a previous marriage, Annalisa Poirel; four grandchildren; a brother, Richard; and a sister, Angel Bastek.
David Swig said that one of his father's favorite cars was one that had no chance of running in the California Mille anytime soon, a 2008 Mazda Miata.
Correction: July 10, 2012, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An obituary on Saturday about Martin Swig, the founder of the California Mille sports-car rally, misspelled the name of the city in California where he lived. It is Greenbrae, not Greenbray.

HEADLINE: Banks' Ability to Rig Rates Shows Need for Change

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
Is Libor -- the London interbank offered rate -- an idea whose time has passed? And if so, what can replace it?
The scandal that forced Robert E. Diamond Jr. to resign as chief executive of Barclays Bank has revealed that it -- and apparently other banks as well -- lied during the financial crisis about what it would cost them to borrow unsecured money. They did that to avoid the appearance that the quality of their credit was in question. It appears that bank regulators knew what was going on and did nothing to stop it.
But Barclays' settlements with regulators in the United States and Britain, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the United States, which led the investigation, revealed that the bank was lying well before the crisis. Then, it was submitting false numbers because the bank had taken speculative positions in derivatives that would profit if the number moved in the desired direction. 
Libor numbers are released each day by the British Bankers' Association, covering 10 currencies and 15 different maturities. More than $10 trillion in loans to businesses and consumers have interest rates based on Libor, with the borrowers paying more or less depending on where Libor is on a particular day. Many derivative contracts are also based on it.
The bankers' association collects the rates at which each bank says it could have borrowed money that day without putting up any security for the loan. The highest and lowest responses are thrown out, and the rest are averaged to produce a number. There is no need for any bank to show that it actually borrowed at the rate it claims.
The original idea was to have a market-based rate that amounted to a virtually risk-free private sector rate on which to base rates charged on other loans. But whatever sense that once made, it seems foolish now.
''The funding model that European banks have relied on since the adoption of the euro is largely broken,'' a report by Larry Cofsky of Bridgewater Associates, a sponsor of hedge funds, said this week. ''The unsecured bank market outside very short maturities'' of up to a week, he added, ''is now largely by appointment,'' and even secured funding is harder to obtain.
Once banks were viewed as safe because their governments would bail them out if necessary. Now, some of those same governments are in financial distress, able to borrow money only because those same banks will buy government bonds with money they borrow from the European Central Bank.
Before Libor, many loan rates in the United States fluctuated based on the prime rates charged by banks. That was supposedly the rate banks charged their best corporate customers, but over time banks discovered that it could be used as a powerful marketing tool. They began offering home equity loans at prime, or even lower. Borrowers clamored for a market-based rate that banks could not manipulate so easily, and flocked to Libor-based loans.
Now we know that banks could, and did, manipulate Libor rates.
It is interesting to note that even before the financial crisis, the manipulation was not, as one might expect from a lender, always in the direction of higher rates. The trading department at Barclays was rigging the report, and sometimes its trading positions called for lower rates, even though that might reduce the interest income received by the bank.
The accompanying chart looks at the market for credit-default swaps on debts issued by 15 international banks that are among the banks that set Libor. In early 2008, all of the banks were viewed as safe, and there was little difference in the cost of buying insurance on any of them. But since then, the costs have risen and become volatile. Last fall, the cost of insurance for debt issued by some banks rose to levels higher than it had been during the financial crisis.
The charts show that at the end of last month, the annual premium for insuring $10 million in debt was under $100,000 for only one of the banks, Japan's Norinchukin. The cost was over $200,000 for five of the banks. At the beginning of 2008, the rate was under $100,000 for all of them.
Even assuming that accurate Libor numbers could be produced, the resulting rate would reflect far more risk than it did a few years ago. And that means borrowers would be paying higher rates than they would pay if banks were in better shape.
It is not clear what can be done about that, but one step may be to take into account the prices of credit-default swaps when setting the Libor rate, perhaps by considering rates paid only by banks that the swap market clearly views as safe.
The Libor market also needs regulation -- and not by traditional bank regulators. It is no accident that it was the commodity futures commission, a market regulator, whose investigation revealed the abuses.
Bank regulators face serious conflicts when banks are under stress. They view their prime goal as keeping the banks healthy, or at least appearing to be healthy so as to not scare off customers and make a difficult situation worse. That has led them to put pressure on accounting rule makers to go easy on forcing banks to confess losses, and it seems to have led to a willingness to accept manipulation of the Libor market as a way to obscure the difficulties banks faced during the financial crisis.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A chart on Saturday with the Off the Charts column, about some banks' rigging of a benchmark lending rate known as the London interbank offered rate or Libor, misidentified the nationality of one bank that contributes to the setting of Libor. West LB is based in Germany, not Australia. A corrected chart can be found at nytimes.com/economy.

HEADLINE: The Square Off Over Jobs

 BODY:
There's no solace in the employment report for June, released Friday. The economy added a paltry 80,000 jobs last month, leaving no doubt that the economy is slowing. In the past three months, the economy averaged 75,000 new jobs a month, compared with 226,000 in the prior three months. The jobless rate in June held steady at 8.2 percent, which is down from the recession peak of 10 percent in October 2009 but still very high. 
Who is to blame?
How can it be fixed?
On the campaign trail, President Obama has explained correctly that recoveries from financial crashes are tortured affairs and that it was an achievement to get the economy growing again a mere six months after he took office. For that, he credits the 2009 stimulus he pushed through Congress, a point well supported by public- and private-sector economic analyses. It's also worth noting that job growth in the current recovery has actually outpaced the job growth following the Bush-era recession in 2001. The recovery is not unusually weak; what is atypical is the length and severity of the recession that Mr. Obama inherited.
Mitt Romney is having none of that. His campaign has centered on what he calls Mr. Obama's ''failed economic record.'' This from a man who says the stimulus was a failure and the rescue of the auto industry a mistake, whose prescription for stabilizing the housing market is to let it crash, whose plan for health care is to repeal the health reform law, and who clings to discredited policies, like more tax cuts for the rich and less regulation for the banks. Mr. Romney's proposals would take the nation back to the conditions that inflated the bubble and led to the bust.
The question then is why the recovery under Mr. Obama has not been stronger. Part of the answer lies beyond the control of any American politician, including the euro zone crisis and, more recently, the slowdown in China. But part is the result of obstructionist Republican politics, including the fiasco in 2011 over raising the debt ceiling, which dented confidence in Congress's ability to steer the economy.
Mr. Obama's big mistake was to turn prematurely from the need for stimulus to a focus on cutting the budget. He may have hoped to co-opt the Republican emphasis on deficits. He would have done better to slam them on their cynicism in lamenting the deficit after enabling the tax cuts, wars and financial crisis -- all Bush-era creations -- that have deepened the debt.
What he is not responsible for is the continued Republican obstructionism, even in the face of a weakening economy. Last fall, Mr. Obama returned to job creation, with a proposed package that would have created up to 1.9 million jobs, including aid to states to hire teachers and other public employees, investments in infrastructure and tax breaks for new hiring.
Republicans in Congress blocked the package and have balked at other plans from the administration ever since. Wed as they are to the notion that the weak economy is their best shot at victory in November, there is virtually no chance for change in the months ahead. And that means more jobs reports like the one for June.

HEADLINE: China Yawns as U.S. Complains About Auto Tariffs

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The Chinese government issued an uncommonly mild response on Friday to a United States trade complaint challenging China's imposition last December of steep tariffs on American-made sport utility vehicles and midsize and large cars.
The Obama administration told the World Trade Organization on Thursday that China's antidumping and antisubsidy tariffs, totaling as much as 22 percent, violated free trade rules. 
When the United States, the European Union and Japan filed a joint complaint with the W.T.O. in March accusing China of improperly restricting exports of rare earth metals, the Chinese government responded with a vigorous public denial of wrongdoing. But the response Friday to the automotive trade complaint was considerably more reserved.
Liu Weimin, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, said at a regularly scheduled briefing Friday afternoon that ''Sino-U.S. trade cooperation is beneficial to both countries, and as the two countries trade, it would be hard to avoid some friction and differences -- the important thing is that both sides act in ways that mutually benefit, show mutual understanding and allow mutual coordination.''
China's Commerce Ministry issued only a succinct statement that said, ''China will handle the consultation requests in line with the procedural rules of W.T.O. dispute settlement.'' The first step in a W.T.O complaint is a series of bilateral consultations, which almost always fail. After that, a panel of trade experts decides the issue.
China is trying to avoid making trade issues a big theme of the American presidential election campaign.
China's response had been especially vehement in September 2009 when President Obama imposed steep tariffs on Chinese exports of tires to the United States. The Commerce Ministry announced then that it was opening investigations into whether to impose tariffs on American exports, notably automotive products.
The auto investigation led to China's imposition last December of antidumping and antisubsidy tariffs on American-made sport utility vehicles and cars with large engines.
That move puzzled trade analysts because it was announced abruptly and did not seem to be in retaliation for any particular American trade move. Moreover, the tariffs antagonized a politically influential American industry and drew attention to a sector in which China enjoys a large bilateral trade surplus because of rapidly expanding exports of auto parts to the United States.
The United States assesses a tax of only 2.5 percent on imported cars, sport utility vehicles and minivans, while China imposes so many taxes on imported models that a Jeep Grand Cherokee that begins at $28,120 at dealerships in the United States costs $85,000 or more in China.
The antidumping and antisubsidy tariffs being challenged by the United States were imposed as a result of a domestic political struggle in China in which some factions wanted to show their willingness to confront the United States, said a person with a detailed knowledge of China trade policy who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the pending litigation.
One possible explanation for the mild official response from the Chinese government on Friday is that the Chinese public does not seem particularly offended by the American complaint to the W.T.O.
''The quality of American-made cars is very good. Why should there be such a large increase in the tariff?'' said one posting on Friday on Sina Weibo, a microblogging service. ''We, the car buyers, will ultimately have to bear the total increase in the tariffs which are imposed by our government.''

HEADLINE: Rail Project Is Approved In California

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Despite deepening doubts about the cost and feasibility of a $70 billion high-speed rail proposed to cross California, the State Senate on Friday narrowly approved legislation to spend $8 billion in federal and state money to begin construction, starting with a 130-mile stretch through the rural Central Valley. 
The vote came as the federal government threatened to withdraw $3.3 billion in financing for the 520-mile project if the Legislature did not approve the release of state bond money to begin construction. Democrats and Republicans expressed fear that the project could be remembered as a boondoggle passed when the state is struggling through a fiscal crisis.
Polls suggests that voters have turned against the project after voting for it in 2008. Several Democrats, in arguing against the expenditure, warned that voters would be less likely to approve a tax package on the ballot this fall that Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, said was necessary to avoid more cuts in spending on education and other programs.
The vote was a major victory for Mr. Brown, who had strongly urged lawmakers to approve the project, which eventually would link San Francisco to Los Angeles. He described it in keeping with the state's tradition of grand projects and said it would pump money into the ailing economy. It was passed in the Senate with 21 votes, one more than was needed. The Assembly passed the measure on Thursday.
''How many chances do we have to vote for something this important and long-lasting?'' said Darrell Steinberg, the Democratic president pro tem of the Senate.
Opposition cut across party lines. Speaker after speaker noted there was no source of revenue for the train line beyond the initial $8 billion, and that it was being built in rural California, far from where the bulk of the state's population lived. Several noted the incongruity of embarking on such a major project weeks after passing a budget that included deep cuts in spending on schools and other programs.
''This is a colossal fiscal train wreck for California,'' said Senator Tony Strickland, a Republican. ''Members, this bill is spending money we simply don't have here in California.''
Mr. Brown heralded the vote, saying, ''The Legislature took bold action today that gets Californians back to work and puts California out in front once again.''

HEADLINE: Weakness in Jobs Starts To Shape A Campaign Tone

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL; Mark Landler and Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
It is increasingly apparent what the economy will look like when President Obama faces voters in November: pretty much what it looks like today.
And that picture, a report from the Labor Department made clear on Friday, is far from the booming job growth that prevailed only a few months ago. In June, the economy added a meager 80,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate remained at 8.2 percent.
Early this year, optimists buzzed that the jobless rate might touch below 8 percent by the election, a milestone that would be a major symbolic victory for the incumbent. Then employment growth slowed in March and took a turn toward the paltry in April and May.
With Friday's report, what looked like a blip has now become a streak. And with a gridlocked Congress unlikely to pass any additional stimulus measures before the election, the president is stuck again with an economy in stall mode. 
June's job growth, after a revised increase of 77,000 in May, was just about enough to keep up with population growth, but not nearly enough to reduce the backlog of 13 million unemployed workers.
Economists have scaled back their expectations for the rest of the year and are now forecasting continued sluggishness.
''This economy has no forward momentum and little help from monetary or fiscal policy,'' said Kathy Bostjancic, director of macroeconomic analysis for the Conference Board. ''As if that were not enough, ill winds are blowing in from both a contracting Europe and slowing growth in emerging markets.''
Friday's report also put a chill on financial markets, sending stocks sharply lower on both sides of the Atlantic.
At a campaign stop in Poland, Ohio, on Friday, Mr. Obama urged voters to take the long view, and to be mindful of the economic state he inherited.
''I want to get back to a time when middle-class families and those working to get into the middle class have some basic security,'' he said. ''We've got to deal with what's been happening over the last decade, the last 15 years.''
Mr. Romney, on the other hand, emphasized the more recent string of weak job growth that has taken place under Mr. Obama's leadership.
''This is a time for Americans to choose whether they want more of the same,'' Mr. Romney said from Wolfeboro, N.H., where he is vacationing. ''It doesn't have to be this way. America can do better. And this kick in the gut has to end.''
The recent string of weak employment growth may work to political advantage for Mr. Romney.
From December through February, private companies added an average of 252,000 workers a month. But job growth slowed in March, leading some economists to wonder whether the unseasonably warm winter, rather than a fundamentally healthier economy, had been the real source of the short-lived employment surge.
''The net of it is not as if the economy is collapsing, but it wasn't really as strong as it looked in December, January and February,'' said Jim O'Sullivan, United States economist at High Frequency Economics.
The numbers themselves are also adjusted by season, and these adjustments themselves can be imprecise and open to interpretation.
By June, in any case, the payback from the unusually warm winter should have faded, indicating that the slowdown may reflect more serious underlying problems in the economy, Mr. O'Sullivan said.
One of the few industries with decent job growth was temporary help services, suggesting that employers were not confident enough of the recovery's sustainability to invest in permanent hires even if their order books were currently growing.
Among the few bright spots in Friday's report were ticks upward in average hourly earnings (to $23.50, from $23.44 in May) and the length of the typical private sector workweek (34.5 hours, from 34.4). Still, the overall weakness in the report may have nudged Federal Reserve officials toward additional monetary stimulus.
''The odds of QE3 happening before the election are clearly going up,'' said Jay Feldman, an economist at Credit Suisse, referring to the nickname for a third round of stimulus known as quantitative easing.
The Fed has been reluctant to inject more money partly because it has been hard to determine whether additional monetary stimulus is either effective or even needed.
Since the recovery officially began in June 2009, there have been several spates of promising job growth, which raised hopes of a strengthening recovery that were ultimately dashed. Each time economists attributed the hiring slowdown to one-time negative shocks, including last year's tsunami in Japan and the Arab Spring uprisings.
A healthier economy might have been able to withstand such shocks easily, but not one weakened by a debt overhang and a sea of underwater homes.
''At this point, expectations are pretty low, so anything that is moving the job market in the right direction would be welcome,'' said Sophia Koropeckyj, managing director at Moody's Analytics.
Economists worry that even modest acceleration in job growth could be derailed by additional shocks both abroad and at home.
Corporate profits fell in the first quarter of 2012, the first decline since 2008, the Commerce Department reported last week. The overall drop was entirely because of falling profits abroad. While there are challenges across the developing world, including China, the primary foreign drag on the American economy is still coming from Europe's protracted sovereign debt crisis.
''When you factor in the effect on U.S. trade, financial markets and credit availability, the Europe crisis is probably taking a percentage point off of U.S. growth,'' Andrew Tilton, a senior United States economist at Goldman Sachs, said of Europe's impact on America's gross domestic product.
There are plenty of homegrown risks, too.
Struggling local governments have been shedding workers. There was a brief respite in June, but economists generally seem to expect the layoffs to pick up again for the rest of the year.
Under current law, the end of 2012 will also bring a torrent of federal tax increases as the Bush tax cuts and temporary payroll tax reductions expire. The government is also scheduled to lop off a huge chunk of federal spending because of measures set in motion by Congress's inability last December to come up with plans for longer-term fiscal restructuring.
In addition to those components of the so-called fiscal cliff, the federal extension for unemployment benefits ends this year, meaning that, in most states, newly unemployed workers will receive no more than 26 weeks of jobless benefits, according to the National Employment Law Project.
Without extended jobless benefits, unemployed workers will have less disposable income, cutting their spending, and reducing employers' need to hire more workers.
''A lot of companies are not too clear about how all these policy issues are going to affect their bottom line,'' Ms. Koropeckyj said. ''Ultimately, demand determines what companies are going to do in the longer run in terms of hiring. But in the short run, companies are going to try to hold off as much hiring as long as possible.''

HEADLINE: Delicate Pivot As G.O.P. Blasts Rivals On Medicare

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For much of the past year, Republicans assailed President Obama for resisting the Medicare spending reductions they say are needed to both preserve health benefits for older Americans and avert a Greek-style debt crisis. Representative Paul D. Ryan, the House Republicans' point man on the budget, has called the president ''gutless.''
Yet since the Supreme Court upheld the Democrats' 2010 health care law, Republicans, led by Mitt Romney, have reversed tactics and attacked the president and Democrats in Congress by saying that Medicare will be cut too much as part of that law. Republicans plan to hold another vote to repeal the law in the House next week, though any such measure would die in the Democratic-controlled Senate.
''Obamacare cuts Medicare -- cuts Medicare -- by approximately $500 billion,'' Mr. Romney has told audiences. 
That is a reprise of Republicans' mantra of the 2010 midterm elections, which gave them big gains at both the state and federal levels and a majority in the House. Yet the message conflicts not only with their past complaint that Democrats opposed reining in Medicare spending, but also with the fact that House Republicans have voted twice since 2010 for the same 10-year, $500 billion savings in supporting Mr. Ryan's annual budgets.
The result is a messaging mess, even by the standards of each party's usual election-year attacks that the other is being insufficiently supportive of older people's benefits.
And in this year's contests, which both parties describe as a referendum on who can best correct the nation's economic course, such talk underscores how far Republicans and Democrats are from truly squaring with the public about curbing the growth of the major entitlement programs: Medicare, Medicaid and, to a lesser extent, Social Security. That growth is driving the projections of a federal debt that is mounting unsustainably as the population ages and health care costs rise.
''A pox on both their houses,'' said Ron Haskins, a former Congressional staff member who is now a scholar of social programs and budgeting at the Brookings Institution. Democrats and Republicans ''know they have to do something about Medicare, and then they harass each other about cutting Medicare. It's so discouraging to me, but I'm a Republican, so I'm much more distraught about Republicans.''
And, Mr. Haskins added, ''$500 billion is modest compared to what Ryan would do.''
Under Mr. Ryan's budget, which Mr. Romney has supported but which has been blocked each year in the Senate, Medicare would not pay for the medical fees of future beneficiaries, as it currently does. Instead it would provide ''premium support,'' limited payments -- vouchers, Democrats say -- that beneficiaries could use to buy insurance policies in the private sector. And Medicaid, which increasingly goes toward nursing home care for older people, would become a capped block grant to states, forcing them to make significant cuts.
In their attacks, Republicans have said in speeches and in television advertisements that the Democrats' projected $500 billion in Medicare savings will ''strip,'' ''gut,'' ''rob'' or ''raid'' older people's benefits.
''Ron Barber will hurt Arizona seniors,'' said an ad this spring from the House Republicans' campaign committee in support of the Republican who ultimately lost to Mr. Barber, a Democrat, in a special election to replace Representative Gabrielle Giffords.
Objecting to such attacks, Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said in an interview: ''There are two issues here: One, there were no cuts to Medicare benefits. And in fact, benefits were strengthened.''
Independent fact-checking groups have repeatedly knocked down the Republicans' claims. ''A discredited claim is making a comeback following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding most of the national health care reform law,'' PolitiFact recently wrote in one such analysis.
Republicans stand by their attack. They say the problem with the Democratic approach is that the reductions do little to bolster Medicare's stability, with the money diverted to initiatives in the health care law.
''Democrats are still the only party in Washington to cut $500 billion from Medicare in order to help pay for Obamacare,'' said Paul Lindsay, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee. ''It's a fact that did not go unnoticed among seniors in 2010, and one that we will continue holding Democrats accountable for in our ads this fall.''
But the $500 billion in reductions would come through cuts in the projected growth of Medicare and would mainly affect hospitals and other providers of medical care, some of whom supported the health care measure nonetheless because it would extend coverage to up to 30 million uninsured Americans, raising the number of paying customers. Other savings would result from lower subsidies for private insurers selling Medicare Advantage plans, which offer older people extra features like vision care and gym memberships. The insurers could not cut basic Medicare benefits.
Democrats used the projected $500 billion in savings to help pay for expanding older people's benefits. The health care law says that some preventive care services like mammograms must be free to patients, and it closed the ''doughnut hole'' in the Medicare prescription drug program, which had left many older people paying full price for prescriptions above a certain level.
While Republicans have backed the spending reductions, even as they have attacked Mr. Obama and the Democrats for enacting them, they would end the new benefits.
Mr. Ryan, of Wisconsin, was unavailable for comment, but, pressed on the issue on ABC's ''This Week'' on Sunday, he said: ''Well, our budget keeps that money for Medicare to extend its solvency. What Obamacare does is it takes that money from Medicare to spend on Obamacare.''
Robert Greenstein, the executive director of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, called Mr. Ryan's claim ''somewhere between a misstatement and a flat-out untruth.''
Mr. Greenstein, among others, said that Democrats were not double-counting the $500 billion in savings -- by claiming that it both improves Medicare's financial outlook and helps finance new benefits -- any more than were the Republicans, who say they would use the savings both to shore up the Medicare trust funds and to reduce the federal debt.
The Congressional Budget Office and the chief actuary for the Medicare and Medicaid programs, Richard S. Foster, have concluded that the $500 billion in savings would extend the solvency of Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund. Since the passage of the health care law, known as the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare trustees have shifted the projected date of insolvency to 2024 from 2016.
Mr. Foster, in this year's report by the trustees, wrote that ''the Affordable Care Act makes important changes to the Medicare program and substantially improves its financial outlook.''

PERSON: Joyce D. Miller 

HEADLINE: Joyce D. Miller, Breaker of Glass Ceilings, Is Dead at 84

BYLINE: By DENISE GRADY

 BODY:
Joyce D. Miller, an influential advocate for women who believed that equality for them in the workplace could be best achieved through labor unions, and who championed that cause when she broke into the male-dominated leadership of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., died last Saturday in Washington. She was 84.
The cause was a stroke, her son Joshua said. 
Ms. Miller was an advocate for women in the workplace for decades. She was a founding member and later president of the Coalition of Labor Union Women, a national group that since 1974 has helped organize women into unions.
In 1980, she became the first woman elected to the executive board of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations.
And in 1993, President Bill Clinton appointed her executive director of the Glass Ceiling Commission, created by the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to study the barriers to promotion that women and minority employees faced in large companies.
When she was elected to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. board, she had been in union management for about 20 years and used to working in a ''sea of men,'' The Associated Press quoted her as saying. She was 52 and divorced with three children. A 1981 photograph of the board shows her in a blue outfit and pearls, smiling, smack in the middle of 33 men in suits and ties.
Ms. Miller saw union membership, collective bargaining and labor contracts as the road to equality for working women, and she believed that women should be a part of union management to make sure that attention was paid to issues like equal opportunity, equal pay, parental leave, child care, health insurance and discrimination against pregnant women in the workplace.
She was a tall, formidable presence, possessed of a strong voice that carried well without a microphone (although she had avoided speaking out at her first A.F.L.-C.I.O. meeting because, she said, she did not want to seem like a ''pushy woman,'' The A.P. reported).
''Joyce didn't hesitate to speak out, to speak out when she thought something was going in the wrong direction,'' said John J. Sweeney, a former A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, adding, ''She was very focused on fairness and justice.''
In 1982, at a Manhattan conference on women's difficulties in being admitted to skilled union trades like construction and plumbing, Ms. Miller predicted a ''feminization of poverty.''
''Employers will say that no real woman wants to work in overalls,'' she said. ''The truth is that no real woman wants to starve.''
And to anyone who argued that women earned less than men because they tended to pick less challenging work, she had a reply.
''When secretaries were men, clerical work was well paid, upwardly mobile and high status,'' she wrote in a letter to The New York Times in 1985. ''When women became secretaries, they hit a low-paid dead end. The same thing happened when women replaced men as sewing-machine operators, bank tellers and telephone operators. The market seems to notice when the workers in a job undergo a sex change.''
Joyce Dannen was born in Chicago on June 19, 1928. Her mother was a teacher, and her father owned a dry-goods store. She was raised ''with a social conscience,'' she said in an oral history project in 2000. She received a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1950 and a master's in social sciences and education there in 1951.
Classes about factory workers and the unemployed seeded her ambition to become involved in the labor movement. But despite her education, the only union job she could find at first combined secretary, receptionist and switchboard operator -- even though she could not type or take shorthand -- at the Cooperative League of America, a group for jointly owned businesses.
Later, as a regional education director for a union in Pittsburgh, she found that its employees received food allowances, but that women were given less than men because it was assumed that men would take them out for dinner and pick up their checks.
In 1952, she married Jay A. Miller, who also worked for a union. They had three children and moved several times, and she held part-time teaching jobs at colleges and in the public schools. She also kept her hand in the labor movement, volunteering at union education conferences.
Everything changed in 1962, when the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America asked her to become its education director in Chicago. She took the job and rose to vice president.
She helped set up child care centers for the union, including one that a government report called ''the Rolls-Royce of day care,'' as well as housing, legal assistance and college scholarship programs for union members and their children.
After joining the Glass Ceiling Commission under President Clinton in 1993, she later became a special adviser to Robert B. Reich, the secretary of labor. Afterward she adjudicated disputes for the Labor Department's Wage Appeals Board until 1998, when she retired.
Her marriage to Mr. Miller ended in divorce in 1965. (He died this year.) Besides her son Joshua, Ms. Miller is survived by another son, Adam; a daughter, Rebecca; two granddaughters; and a brother, Avrum Dannen.
''I came to the labor movement with stars in my eyes,'' Ms. Miller told The Times in 1980. ''I saw it as a vehicle for social change, and I've never changed my mind.''

HEADLINE: Obama Urges Voters to Look Ahead on Economy

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
PITTSBURGH -- For President Obama, evangelist of hope and change, it's not easy to confront an election season with so little of either.
On Friday, after the release of the third straight anemic employment report, Mr. Obama found himself on a campaign bus tour, conceding that the economy was not generating enough jobs, that the recovery was not taking hold quickly enough, and that too many Americans lacked basic financial security.
''It's still tough out there,'' Mr. Obama said to a sympathetic crowd in an elementary school gymnasium in Poland, Ohio. Later, in Pittsburgh, he said, ''Too many of our friends and family members and neighbors are still out of work; too many folks still are seeing their home property values underwater.'' 
With few signs that the labor market will strengthen much before Election Day, Mr. Obama is honing a vocabulary to talk about the listless economy -- one that emphasizes a glass-is-half-full approach to the numbers and an appeal to voters to take the long view when assessing the nation's economic fortunes.
The president dug out the few tidbits of good news from the June report, pointing out that businesses generated 84,000 new jobs last month and 4.4 million over all since the end of the recession. Among those millions, he went on, 500,000 were in manufacturing -- a relevant yardstick on a whistle-stop tour of two industrial states.
''That's a step in the right direction,'' he said. ''But we can't be satisfied because our goal was never to just keep on working to get back to where we were back in 2007.''
The president then pivoted to longer-term economic trends, which he said have deepened inequality and put at risk the future of the middle class. Lengthening the frame of reference allows Mr. Obama to argue that the problems of today are not principally his fault, but the result of a Republican philosophy practiced by the Bush administration and advocated by Mr. Obama's challenger, Mitt Romney.
''We tried it and it didn't work,'' Mr. Obama said to 6,500 supporters under a scorching sun at Carnegie Mellon University. ''So why would we want to go backwards to the same theory that didn't work before?''
Still, the poor job numbers cast a shadow over a two-day swing that began in the afterglow from the Supreme Court's decision last week to uphold the president's health care law. The news also gave Mr. Romney a chance to seize the offensive again after days in which his campaign bobbled its response to whether the part of the law that imposes a fee for lack of insurance is a tax.
''There's a lot of misery in America today,'' Mr. Romney said in New Hampshire, where he is vacationing. Calling the latest numbers a ''kick in the gut,'' he said, ''the president's policies have clearly not been successful in reigniting this economy, in putting people back to work and in opening factories across this country.''
For Mr. Obama, the jobs report has become a nerve-rattling monthly exercise that, for the last three months at least, has held almost no good news for him. White House officials insist that the president is not buffeted by the vagaries of the statistics, but even the longer-term trend, which they say is critical, has not been favorable.
''These numbers confirm that this economy is stuck just north of neutral,'' said Jared Bernstein, a former chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ''We're making progress, but it's much too slow.''
Mr. Bernstein said there was little point in Mr. Obama trying to sugarcoat the economy. But he said the president could make a credible case that he had broken the Great Recession but, because of gridlock in Washington, had not been able to finish the job.
The White House made essentially that argument in a statement by Alan B. Krueger, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. He said Mr. Obama had proposed to give tax benefits to companies to move jobs back to the United States and to provide funding for local governments to hire hundreds of thousands of teachers.
Mr. Obama struck a modest blow for job creation after he returned to the White House on Friday evening. He signed a $105 billion transportation bill, which will finance highway, bridge and public transportation projects for 27 months.
The president began the day at Ann's Place, Josephine Harris's restaurant in Akron. He ate breakfast with three workers from a Goodyear tire factory. His choice of dining partners served as a reminder that in 2009, the Obama administration filed a trade action against China for dumping tires in the American market.
The visit had a sad epilogue when, hours after welcoming Mr. Obama, Ms. Harris, 70, died, apparently of heart failure. The president phoned Ms. Harris's daughter, Wilma Parsons, from Air Force One and ''expressed his sorrow and his condolences,'' said the White House press secretary, Jay Carney.
Mr. Obama played up the blue-collar flavor of his trip with an oblique swipe at Mr. Romney, who rode personal watercraft this week at his lakeside compound in New Hampshire. The president's fondest memory of a holiday, he told audiences, was a trip around the United States when he was 11. His family traveled on Greyhound buses and trains and stayed in Howard Johnsons.
The biggest thrill, Mr. Obama said, was ''to go to the vending machine and get the ice bucket and get the ice.''

HEADLINE: A Relic From Racing's Early Years, Repurposed

BYLINE: ROBERT PEELE


HIGHLIGHT: The old Occoneechee-Orange Speedway in Hillsborough, N.C., which hosted stock-car racing royalty during Nascar's first two decades, has been restored and transformed into a public park. 

 BODY:
In Sunday's Automobiles section, I write about Ace Speedway in Altamahaw, N.C., which like a lot of small racetracks struggled to stay afloat through the recession. Under the leadership of Brad Allen, its general manager, and with the continued support of the track's owner, Abraham Woidislawsky, Ace is showing signs of a rebound this year, with higher car counts and rising attendance figures.
Racing has always been an uncertain business, and even in the best of times some tracks don't survive. Such was the fate of Occoneechee-Orange Speedway in Hillsborough, N.C., just northwest of Durham along the Eno River.
The track's origins were closely tied to the birth of Nascar. In 1947, Bill France, Nascar's patriarch, spotted an old horse racing track while flying over a parcel of land known as Occoneechee Farm; eager to add new courses, he bought the property and converted the half-mile horse track to a one-mile dirt oval.
On Aug. 7, 1949, during Nascar's inaugural season, the Occoneechee Speedway held its first Strictly Stock race, a 200-mile event that was only the third race ever in what would become the Sprint Cup series. Bob Flock won in an Oldsmobile 88, taking home $2,000.
Nascar raced there twice a year for most of the next two decades, 32 times in all. Along the way, the track was renamed Orange Speedway, after the county where it was located - in part because no one could spell Occoneechee, joked LaVerne Zachary, president of the Historic Speedway Group, which has overseen the restoration and preservation of the former speedway site.
It's hard to name a legend from Nascar's early years who didn't race at Hillsborough Speedway, as it was generally known: Curtis Turner, Fireball Roberts, Lee Petty, Herb Thomas, Buck Baker and Junior Johnson all won races there, as did Ned Jarrett, David Pearson and Richard Petty. Other legends visited the track as well: according to Mr. Zachary, Jayne Mansfield attended the spring race in 1963, and even rode in the pace car.
(And while he was a household name only in our household, my father visited the track, too, a number of times, with a friend and a movie camera. The film excerpt below was shot on Oct. 27, 1963 - Joe Weatherly, No. 8, started on the pole and won the race.)
By the late 1960s, Mr. Zachary said, pressure from local church groups, who didn't like racing on Sundays, led Bill France to look elsewhere as he sought to build a larger, faster track. Unable to persuade local authorities to expand the Hillsborough site, he turned instead to a small town in Alabama and built the 2.66-mile Talladega Superspeedway.
Richard Petty won the final race at Occoneechee-Orange Speedway on Sept. 15, 1968; the next year, its slot in Nascar's schedule would go to Talladega.
Orange High School, which had used the infield for its football games since 1958, continued to play there until the early 1970s. After that, the site fell into disrepair. By the early 2000s, the track was almost completely overgrown. The forest reclaimed the site and the track surface was reduced to a small pathway, deeply rutted by 4-by-4s.
"The grand stands were so covered with weeds and briars you could hardly see them," said Mr. Zachary.
Restoration efforts began in 2006, led by Frank Craig, who attended races there as a youngster when his father worked on the track's security staff. With the permission of the trust that had acquired the property, the group cleared some of the trees and underbrush to widen the path, and later rebuilt the ticket and concession stands, which had fallen in.
The restoration is a continuing project, Mr. Craig said, and while honoring the track's storied history is an important goal, the group also considers it a part of its mission to respect nature's role in the site. And nature itself has done its part to preserve the old track, as Mr. Craig attests.
When asked about the gentle upward slope along the edge of the trail through each of its turns, Mr. Craig confirmed that it was part of the speedway's original banking.
"The trees saved it," he said.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at the president's weekly address. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
Reporting on thejobs numbersreleased Friday, Catherine Rampell writes that it is increasingly apparent what the economy will look like when President Obama faces voters in November: pretty much what it looks like today. Mark Landler writes that the release of the employment data report has become a nerve-rattling monthly exercise for President Obama, who found himself on a campaign bus tour conceding that the economy was not generating enough jobs, that the recovery was not taking hold quickly enough, and that too many Americans lacked basic financial security. Mr. Obama is hoping to emphasize a glass-is-half-full approach to the numbers, but the news Friday gave Mitt Romney another chance to seize the offensive.

        
For much of the year, Republicans assailed President Obama for resisting the Medicare spending reductions they say are needed to both preserve health benefits for older Americans and avert a Greek-style debt crisis, Jackie Calmes writes. Yet that message conflicts not only with their past complaint that Democrats opposed reining in Medicare spending, but also with the fact that House Republicans have voted twice since 2010 for the same 10-year, $500 billion savings in supporting Representative Paul D. Ryan's annual budgets.

        
The state Senate in California took a deep breath Friday and narrowly approved legislationto spend $8 billion in federal and state money to begin construction of a $70 billion high-speed rail that would eventually link Los Angeles and San Francisco. Adam Nagourney reports that legislators approved the spending, handing a victory to Gov. Jerry Brown, despite their fears that voters see the project as a boondoggle passed when the state is struggling through a fiscal crisis.
Weekly Address

        
President Obama used his weekly address to talk about what he describes as the nation's central challenge: "not just reclaiming all the jobs lost to the recession, but reclaiming the economic security that so many Americans have lost over the last decade." On Friday he signed into law a bill that will provide construction jobs to rebuild the nation's infrastructure and keep interest rates on federal student loans from doubling this year. "Those steps will make a real difference in the lives of millions of Americas," he said. "But make no mistake: we've got more to do." He is also calling on Congress to take half the money the country is no longer spending on war to create broader wireless networks and to encourage other nation-building projects. But the new law supporting construction efforts and student loan rates would not have been possible, he said, if it were not for those who reached out to their representatives and demanded action. "I want to thank every American who took the time to sit down and write a letter, type out an e-mail, make a phone call or send a tweet hoping your voice would make a difference," he told listeners. "And as long as I have the privilege of being your president, your voice will be heard in the White House."
Around the Web

        
The Columbus Dispatch is reporting that the Obama campaign pressured Greg Shultz, the chairman of the Franklin County Democratic Party, to step down from his post on Thursday amid allegations of payments made to a campaign fundraiser.

        
President Obama turned down a tempting offer from one Ohio man to arm-wrestle in exchange for a vote, Politico reports. "No, I'll play basketball for your vote," Mr. Obama replied.
Happening in Washington
The temperature is expected to soar to 106 degrees on Saturday, prompting the National Weather Service to issue an "excessive heat warning." The forecast for Sunday is slightly better, with a predicted high of near 100 degrees. A cold front will be moving in, bringing less searing temperatures but also the possibility of severe thunderstorms.

HIGHLIGHT: The 2012 campaign and the Republican agenda are hot topics this week, with top party leaders giving a peak into their election strategy on the Sunday talk shows. 

 BODY:
The 2012 campaign and the Republican agenda are hot topics this week, with top party leaders giving a peak into their election strategy on the Sunday talk shows. President Obama's campaign will be represented as well, discussing how the latest jobs report - and the four others that will be released before the general election - could shake things up for the president's efforts to hold on to the White House.
One man who is very familiar with the effect a stagnant economy can have on an election - Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona - will be on CBS's "Face the Nation" to offer advice to his party's presumptive nominee, Mitt Romney. Mr. McCain, who will be speaking from Monaco where he's attending a conference as part of an overseas trip, will also weigh in on recent developments from foreign hotspots like Afghanistan, Lebanon and Libya. Later, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and former Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi will be on to offer further insight into the current status of the November election.
The partisan debates will continue on ABC's "This Week," with Gov. Martin O'Malley, Democrat of Maryland, squaring off with Gov. Bobby Jindal, Republican of Louisiana, over another disappointing jobs report. Mr. Jindal will also speak on Mitt Romney's potential vice presidential nominees. FOX's "Fox News Sunday" will pit the Republican National Committee chair against the Democratic National Committee chair for an inside analysis on the state of the campaign from their respective party lines. The two chairs, Reince Priebus and Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, will also discuss health care reform ahead of the two other guests discussing the same topic: Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, and Representative Xavier Becerra, Democrat of California.
CNN's "State of the Union" will feature exclusive interviews from both the campaign trail and the United States Senate, with Robert Gibbs, the Obama campaign senior adviser, shedding light on how the president will proceed after the latest job numbers, and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky discussing how the Republicans are mobilizing their base to propel his party not only to the White House, but to a majority in the Senate.
C-SPAN's "Newsmakers" will have a sit down with Lee Saunders, the first African-American president of the American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees, to discuss his plans for the organization.
Univision's "Al Punto" will air an exclusive interview with Enrique Peña Nieto, the president-elect of Mexico. He is expected to respond to allegations that his party paid for votes, and he will discuss his strategy for fighting the violent drug cartels.
Bloomberg's "Political Capital" will feature an interview with John Podesta, chairman of the Center for American Progress and former chief of staff to former president Bill Clinton. TV One's "Washington Watch" will focus on entrepreneurship and job opportunities for African-Americans, with guests Sheila Johnson, co-founder of BET and Ice T, rapper and actor.

HEADLINE: History Hits the Campaign Trail

BYLINE: ADAM GOODHEART and PETER MANSEAU


HIGHLIGHT: Why are political candidates so eager to use, and abuse, the past? 

 BODY:
While it's been a long time since any of the founding fathers made a personal appearance on the campaign trail, they continue speaking from beyond the grave through the mouths of present-day candidates, weighing in on matters as disparate - and perhaps unimaginable to them in life - as health care reform, gay marriage and abortion rights.
Barely an hour after last month's Supreme Court ruling on the Affordable Care Act, Mitt Romney was promising to uphold "a course that the founders envisioned" by acting to repeal the law. On other occasions, Mr. Romney has cited America's 18th-century leaders in support of limited government and in opposition to same-sex marriage. 
Nor is it only Republicans who invoke the opinions of long-dead white males in powdered wigs: President Obama recently quoted George Washington in a speech calling for new taxes on wealthy Americans. 
In fact, history is often the lingua franca of our national politics. And the heroic rhetoric goes beyond just the 18th-century founders. In his campaign addresses, Mr. Obama has deployed a litany of 19th- and 20th-century accomplishments to claim precedent for his own grand initiatives (and grander intentions). "We built this country together," he said in a stump speech in Miami Beach last week. "We built railroads and highways, the Hoover Dam, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Interstate highway system, the transcontinental railroad - we built those things together." 
But the past is a slippery thing. Even the most anodyne-seeming statements, like Mr. Obama's, don't always hold up under the scrutiny of historians: the epic achievements he cites in his stump speech were often the products more of bitter partisan struggles than of national togetherness.
Take the transcontinental railroad, which was completed only in the course of a decades-long legislative ordeal stretching from the 1840s to the 1870s. Much as health care reform has been for Democrats in more recent times, the rail link to the Pacific was a tantalizing Holy Grail for generations of Republican lawmakers, forever slipping just out of their reach. 
Congressional bills to construct the rail line spent some 15 years deadlocked by endless bickering between Northern and Southern lawmakers over which region the route should cross. Only the Civil War settled that question. And even after the railway finally opened in 1869, its backers barely had a chance to savor their victory before it turned to ashes in their mouths amid an unfolding scandal over the line's financing, with accusations of enormous bribes paid to allies in Congress: "The King of Frauds," announced a headline in the New York Sun. The so-called Crédit Mobilier affair became America's first great corporate scandal and nearly destroyed the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant. It marked the Republicans with a seemingly permanent stain as the party of big government, wasteful federal subsidies and special interests.
The story of the Hoover Dam has also been heavily tinted in rose and sepia. Asian-Americans were forbidden from working on the project, while African-Americans were limited to menial labor and accounted for less than 1 percent of the work force. In August 1931, work halted as construction bosses faced off against striking laborers, who had just seen their wages slashed even as the punishing heat of the Nevada summer killed more than a dozen men in barely a month. (Dozens more are believed to have died from other hazardous work conditions covered up by the project managers.) The heroic endeavor only got back on track after all the workers were threatened with immediate dismissal.
Even the interstate highway system and the Golden Gate Bridge had their rabid detractors. When Franklin D. Roosevelt first proposed a mammoth road network in the late 1930s - a project that today is usually associated with Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Republican who brought it to fruition - one frugal-minded critic derided the plan as "another ascent into the stratosphere of New Deal jitterbug economics." Around the same time, environmentalists and aesthetes like Ansel Adams were trashing the bridge project as a desecration of one of America's greatest natural landscapes.
It's strange, then, that Mr. Obama, whose health care legislation was born amid similar bombastic accusations, dire predictions, and back-room dealing, should miss one of the perennial lessons of American history: our national achievements have usually been propelled forward by contention, not consensus.
Yet Mr. Romney, too, sometimes talks about history in ways rooted more in wishful thinking than in actual fact. Speaking before a veterans' group in San Diego on Memorial Day, for example, he made the seemingly uncontroversial assertion that the United States is "unique" and "exceptional in the history of the world" as the only nation that "has been willing to lay down the lives of hundreds of thousands of sons and daughters and take no land in return." (It is a line he had used on previous occasions, attributing it to Israeli President Shimon Peres.)
No one in the crowd seemed to notice the incongruity of Mr. Romney's making this declaration on soil that once formed part of the Republic of Mexico. San Diego fell to the United States after troops under Capt. John C. Frémont marched into the city in July 1846, hauled down the Mexican flag and imposed martial law. Over the following six months, American troops fought intermittent skirmishes against local partisans, culminating in a pitched battle in which 21 American soldiers were killed. American control of California - along with other lands making up more than half of Mexico's prewar territory - was confirmed in 1848 when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican-American War. 
In the months between now and the presidential election, Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama will no doubt focus on efforts to propose contrasting programs for the years ahead. But they will sometimes offer conflicting interpretations of history, too. Over the next several months, each installment in this series will examine a statement about history made in the course of the campaign and offer commentary from a range of experts, along with primary and secondary sources. To open the series, we asked several historians to offer observations on the uses of history in politics and the recent comments by President Obama and Mitt Romney.
History was a reliable old friend when I was a speechwriter in the Clinton White House. All of the speechwriters, and the president himself, read widely in the founders. Earlier presidents were equally bedeviled by opposition politics, so there was a feeling of solidarity. And there is no doubt that a well-placed, strategic allusion to a beloved American can strengthen a thought - it sounds better if someone in a periwig said it's O.K. 
Sometimes the relationship between quoter and quotee is surprising: Ronald Reagan loved Thomas Paine, a curious sort of founder, not very American, who almost certainly would have disapproved of the modern Republican Party, but might have liked the Tea Party. Bill Clinton admired Alexander Hamilton, not a classic Democratic choice, but an appealing figure in fast economic times, and an inspiration for fatherless boys.
But there are pitfalls, too. A quote that oversimplifies can seem naïve. And we should be mindful that some of the worst leaders ever found history congenial to their ends. Hitler loved the founders, too - not Washington and Jefferson, but Charlemagne and Frederick the Great. Yet having said that, a strong knowledge of history is an essential part of the citizen's tool kit. Just as we can vote for our favorite founders, we can vote for the next generation of people quoting them. To know where we come from helps us to understand who we are, and that is the question we ask of ourselves every four years. 
As much as I appreciate President Obama's sentiment about great national endeavors of the past, and agree that federal intervention can be essential to the economy, the transcontinental railroad does not help his case. The transcontinental rail lines did not advance the common good. The Pacific Railroad - the combination of the Union Pacific and Central Pacific - was the product of some of the worst legislation that money could buy. Built too late to fulfill its original rationale of keeping California in the Union, it was justified by its promoters as a vehicle for conquering Indians, and helped precipitate a series of shameful and tawdry wars. 
The Union Pacific and Central Pacific made their promoters rich through insider dealing, but not the country nor even their investors. Both were mismanaged and corrupt; they were plagued by scandal, the Crédit Mobilier being only the most well known. They promoted disastrous developments that contributed to the destruction of the bison, the failed settlement of arid lands, the collapse of the Great Plains cattle industry and the bust of silver mining. Both were among the most hated corporations in American history.
President Obama's use of the Hoover Dam and the transcontinental railway to show how Americans "worked together" is great for speechmaking, but makes for a one-dimensional history. These public works achievements were fraught with the moral tensions of their time. African-Americans only represented a small percentage of workers at the Hoover Dam, and Asian workers on the transcontinental railroad were abused and underpaid. These projects, while important, were not about "togetherness." While these engineering monuments may outlive us all, history is not often made in the calm moments, but the churning moments of uncivil discourse and disunion. 
Obama probably wished he had a project like the Hoover Dam to point to in his own stimulus program. The great thing about that earlier era is that they were building new things, while today's stimulus pays for repairing existing things rather than building new ones. Painting bridges, fixing highways - it's easy for skeptics to portray those kinds of things as a waste of money, or as nothing, since there's less that's dramatic to point to. 
But the dam fits very well within a list of projects that resulted in major economic development that could not have been built by private enterprise. Government had to step in. The dam filled a real need and it had a huge economic effect, not only regionally but nationally. Even when it was contentious, its controversy was less over whether it should be built or not than over how it should be built and how to pay for it. Obama is right to mention it in the context of investments we can't afford not to make.
Blame President Obama's edifice complex on DeWitt Clinton and the Erie Canal, one of America's first public works programs. Clinton, New York governor and a failed presidential candidate, conceived and completed the canal from 1817 to 1825. It generated surplus revenue, drew the produce of the Midwest to the port of New York and inspired politicians in other states - including a young Abraham Lincoln - to build canals of their own. But weak credit, poor terrain and bad timing drove many of the wannabe-Erie projects into bankruptcy. Still, the urge to build big has tempted the ambitious ever since.
Mitt Romney expresses a split in the way Americans see Europe and the rest of the world. To us, Europe is the home of corruption, monarchy and (later) totalitarianism. Who would want a piece of that? But the Western Hemisphere and the Pacific are our lands of opportunity. So, despite two world wars and a cold war, our only real estate in Europe is cemeteries. But when we looked west, from Louisiana to the Philippines, we took a shopping list.

HEADLINE: The New Elitists

BYLINE: By SHAMUS KHAN. 
An assistant professor of sociology at Columbia and author of ''Privilege: The Making of an Adolescent Elite at St. Paul's School.''

 BODY:
YOU can tell a lot about people by looking at their music collections. Some have narrow tastes, mostly owning single genres like rap or heavy metal. Others are far more eclectic, their collections filled with hip-hop and jazz, country and classical, blues and rock. We often think of such differences as a matter of individual choice and expression. But to a great degree, they are explained by social background. Poorer people are likely to have singular or ''limited'' tastes. The rich have the most expansive.
We see a similar pattern in other kinds of consumption. Think of the restaurants cherished by very wealthy New Yorkers. Masa, where a meal for two can cost $1,500, is on the list, but so is a cheap Sichuan spot in Queens, a Papaya Dog and a favorite place for a slice. Sociologists have a name for this. Today's elites are not ''highbrow snobs.'' They are ''cultural omnivores.'' 
Omnivorousness is part of a much broader trend in the behavior of our elite, one that embraces diversity. Barriers that were once a mainstay of elite cultural and educational institutions have been demolished. Gone are the quotas that kept Jews out of elite high schools and colleges; inclusion is now the norm. Diverse and populist programming is a mainstay of every museum. Elites seem more likely to confront snobbish exclusion than they are to embrace it.
This was not always the case.
In 1880 William Vanderbilt tried to buy one of the 18 coveted boxes at the New York Academy of Music on 14th Street by offering $30,000 for it. Vanderbilt represented new money, and to the old families controlling the academy his attempt to buy his way into a place reserved for them was a crass affront to their dignity. Money may be king in certain parts of New York society. But not everything can be bought.
Or so it seemed. After his bid was rejected, Vanderbilt joined other nouveaux riches families like the Goulds, Rockefellers and Whitneys and founded the Metropolitan Opera House Company. With 122 private boxes, there was plenty of space for the city's expanding elite.
This new elite sought to supplant the old families from their long-held seats, but the transformation was hardly radical. While the old elite was ultimately forced to join the new elite at the Metropolitan Opera after its academy collapsed in financial ruin, they did so in a space that was still comfortable: an opera house. Modern temples of power were built on the foundations of the old. New elites were often conservative in their tastes -- building mansions that emulated those of European aristocrats, buying up old masters and building shrines to European art forms.
In his brilliant work on the Gilded Age, ''The Monied Metropolis,'' the Harvard historian Sven Beckert argues that this era helped consolidate the American bourgeoisie. Originally, the old families of New York formed an elite caste defined by their lineage and were not threatened by the fact that they shared many of the same tastes as common men. Through much of the 19th century, cultural differences between elites and the rest were not so great. Shakespeare and opera held mass appeal. To attend an evening's concert at the New York Academy of Music might mean hearing Verdi, but also some church music and perhaps vaudeville-esque interludes by popular comedians of the day.
It was the robber barons' joining of the elite that forced a change. As access to elite status became less limited through family ties and more open to men of new wealth, New Yorkers found a new mechanism of social closure. They created an exclusive culture distinct from that of the common American, the result of which was something far more elitist. Through snobbery elites became a class. They developed a shared culture and sensibility. They also shared common enemies.
The Rockefellers were not the only ''new men'' on the scene. Others were pouring into Lower Manhattan. Elites feared the rabble who flowed ashore on boats from Europe -- eight million people between 1855 and 1890. The wealthy moved uptown. Among their mansions they built an armory in 1880, ''defensible from all points against mobs.'' Many sent children away to boarding schools to escape the corruptions of the city.
Elites built moats and fences not just around neighborhoods but also around cultural artifacts. The Metropolitan Opera made cultural performances more ''pure,'' dropping the vaudeville. High ticket prices made the popular music of Verdi less accessible; soon it was the rich and not the rest who enjoyed this music. Even great public institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art were only nominally so. It was far from the homes of workers, closed on the one day they had free (Sunday) and known to remove working-class patrons for, as the director of the museum put it, ''offensive odors emitted from dirt on their apparel.'' The sociologist Nicola Beisel has shown how the fine-art nudes that had once circulated among workers on postcard replications were banned as pornography through the Comstock laws and limited to an imposing building that only ''respectable'' New Yorkers would enter.
This was the birth of the modern upper-class elite; its own schools, clubs and cultural artifacts made it quite distinct from other Americans.
HOW far we've come! Our modern omnivores have filled in the moats and torn down the fences. With exclusion and snobbery a relic, the world is available for the most talented to take advantage of. To talk of ''elite culture,'' it seems, is to talk of something quaint, something anti-American and anti-democratic. Whereas the old elites used their culture to make explicit the differences between themselves and the rest, if you were to talk to members of the elite today, many would tell you that their culture is simply an expression of their open-minded, creative, ready-to-pounce-on-any-opportunity ethic. Others would object to the idea that they were part of an elite in the first place.
But if you look at the omnivore from another point of view, a far different picture emerges.
Unlike the shared class character of Gilded Age elites, omnivores seem highly distinct and their tastes appear to be a matter of personal expression. Instead of liking things like opera because that's what people of your class are supposed to like, the omnivore likes what he likes because it is an expression of a distinct self. Perhaps liking a range of things explains why elites are elite, and not the other way around.
By contrast, those who have exclusive tastes today -- middle-class and poorer Americans -- are subject to disdain. If the world is open and you don't take advantage of it, then you're simply limited and closed-minded. Perhaps it's these attributes that explain your incapacity to succeed.
And so if elites have a culture today, it is a culture of individual self-cultivation. Their rhetoric emphasizes such individualism and the talents required to ''make it.'' Yet there is something pernicious about this self-presentation. The narrative of openness and talent obscures the bitter truth of the American experience. Talents are costly to develop, and we refuse to socialize these costs. To be an outstanding student requires not just smarts and dedication but a well-supported school, a safe, comfortable home and leisure time to cultivate the self. These are not widely available. When some students struggle, they can later tell the story of their triumph over adversity, often without mentioning the helping hand of a tutor. Other students simply fail without such expensive aids.
These are more than liberal platitudes. Look at who makes up the most ''talented'' members of society: the children of the already advantaged. Today America has less intergenerational economic mobility than almost any country in the industrialized world; one of the best predictors of being a member of the elite today is whether your parents were in the elite. The elite story about the triumph of the omnivorous individual with diverse talents is a myth. In suggesting that it is their work and not their wealth, that it is their talents and not their lineage, elites effectively blame inequality on those whom our democratic promise has failed.
Elites today must recognize that they are very much like the Gilded Age elites of old. Paradoxically the very openness and capaciousness that they so warmly embrace -- their omnivorousness -- helps define them as culturally different from the rest. And they deploy that cultural difference to suggest that the inequality and immobility in our society is deserved rather than inherited. But if they can recognize the class basis of their success, then perhaps they will also recognize their class responsibility. They owe a debt to others for their fortunes, and seeing this may also help elites realize that the poor are ruled by a similar dynamic: their present position is most often bound to a history not of their own choosing or responsibility.
It is past time for elites to give up the cultural project of showing how different they are from others. They should commit themselves instead to recognizing that there is a commonweal that we all have a responsibility to improve.

HEADLINE: Wed, in All but Finances

BYLINE: By VICKIE ELMER

 BODY:
AFTER the wedding and the honeymoon, many couples will face a different kind of commitment issue: Should they take out a mortgage together? And if one spouse already has a home loan, does it make sense for the other to be added onto it?
While the inclination may be to combine finances, some couples may want to keep them apart, financial experts say, especially if this is a second marriage, or if one spouse has experienced a spate of unemployment and a less-than-stellar credit report. 
''Leave well enough alone,'' said Lori Price, who runs the Price Financial Group, a financial planning service in Wilton, Conn. ''If one person is good enough to qualify for the mortgage, you don't need them both on the mortgage.''
Ms. Price says it makes more sense to have one partner unencumbered with debt. ''I would never look to put someone's name on a liability,'' she said, unless perhaps that person was needed to qualify for a favorable refinancing.
Neal Diamond, a mortgage broker and real estate investor in Commack, N.Y., advises against commingling for those who are self-employed. He said he was in the process of transferring to his wife the deed to the home that he and she had jointly owned for years, so that a lien cannot be placed on the home should he face a lawsuit or other issues in his business.
Nearly 2.1 million couples were married in 2010, the latest year for which data were available from the Centers for Disease Control, which tracks this information. The median age for a first marriage has been steadily rising for both men and women, to 26 for a woman and 28 for a man, from 20 and 23 in the 1950s, according to census data, while almost a quarter of adults 50 and older have been married at least twice. This increases the likelihood that one or both newly married spouses may already own a home.
''It's way more complicated for a second marriage,'' said Ms. Price, noting that both partners may also have other family needs to consider. Several of the couples she has counseled, she said, have chosen to keep their finances separate.
This approach may be especially worthwhile in the event of a short sale, when a property is sold for less than the balance of the mortgage, or a foreclosure. Both transactions remain on a credit report for seven years.
Some lenders allow a new borrower to be added to a loan; others do not, because they no longer own the loan or because the loan has a provision that prohibits it, said Edward Ades, a partner in Universal Mortgage in Brooklyn. The surest way to bring both borrowers together on the home loan is to refinance, especially now with very low rates, he added.
Before couples double up on the mortgage, they may want to consider whether they expect to move into a bigger home in the near future or whether the mortgage is more than halfway paid off (in which case the principal is being paid down more rapidly), Mr. Diamond said. They could place the second person on the deed and title to the property, he said, or they could put together an agreement giving the person whose name is not on the mortgage a percentage of the home's market value in the event of death or divorce.
Lenders sometimes require the second person to be on the deed for six months before they can be added to the mortgage, often via refinancing, said Erin Lantz, the director of Zillow Mortgage Marketplace.
''If your partner has good credit, it may be helpful,'' she said, adding that a partner with poor credit could hinder refinancing or another house purchase.
Couples who want to buy a home together should discuss their credit scores and what they want in a home, Mrs. Lantz said. Then they need a plan for the down payment, which is typically 20 percent of the purchase price.

HEADLINE: Rent-Stabilized Apartments, Ever More Elusive

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA

 BODY:
IN the often desperate hunt for an affordable place to live in Manhattan, the rent-stabilized apartment retains a strong hold on the imagination. It is so hard to find one that newcomers may think they have gone the way of subway tokens and Automats.
But even in Manhattan, nearly half of all rental apartments are rent-stabilized. And last year, lawmakers in Albany strengthened protections for tenants, raising the rent ceiling to $2,500 a month from $2,000 before an apartment can be deregulated, and the annual income limit to $200,000 from $175,000. In Manhattan, the new rules affect nearly 250,000 apartments.
Those rules mean that rent-stabilized apartments may be even more difficult to come by as people stay in them longer. What with the overall rental vacancy rate of about 1 percent in Manhattan, when one does come up for lease, prospective tenants are likely to discover themselves facing nearly the same level of scrutiny as condo or co-op buyers, agents say.
The appeal of a rent-stabilized unit is obvious. Landlords of stabilized units are allowed to raise the rent by only a few percentage points, as determined by the city's Rent Guidelines Board. Tenants do not have to move out until their income tops the state limit. 
And in Manhattan, the price gap between a rent-stabilized and a market-rate unit has never been greater, according to a study released this spring by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University.
Even before the spike in market-rate rents over the past year, rent-stabilized rates were, on average, $1,245 a month cheaper.
''The competition for a $4,000 one-bedroom is now fierce,'' said Yuval Greenblatt, a vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''So you can imagine how strong competition is for something below market value.''
The study also found that, despite the widespread impression that stabilized apartments are meant to provide affordable housing (and they certainly keep housing prices stable for hundreds of thousands of people), many of those fortunate enough to land one in recent years have been relatively well off.
Whereas the median income of all renters of stabilized apartments in the Manhattan core -- defined as below 96th Street -- is $57,780, the median income of those moving in in recent years is closer to the average Manhattan income of about $100,000, said Vicki L. Been, the director of the Furman Center.
''Some people who enjoy the benefits of rent stabilization are not low-income households,'' the report revealed.
In New York City outside of core Manhattan, the difference is less pronounced, the study found. There, the average stabilized rent is $250 cheaper than the market rate. And the median income of stabilized tenants is $8,000 below that of market-rate ones; south of 96th Street, the income difference is much greater.
Finding a stabilized apartment remains a challenge. The city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development has a list of all the buildings that have at least some stabilized apartments, but it provides no data on how many of the apartments in the building are regulated and how many are market-rate. It is also not a listing service.
And as for the city's major brokerages, few if any keep track of stabilized units.
''I have people all the time who come to me and ask me to find them a rent-stabilized apartment,'' said Alexis Fleming, a broker at Citi Habitats. ''I tell them good luck. It is a needle in a haystack.''
In seven years, she said, she has rented just seven stabilized apartments.
For those fortunate enough to come upon one, that may be just the beginning of the struggle. Potential renters are likely to face stiffer competition than ever as landlords sort through well-qualified bidders.
Jack Freund, the executive vice president of the Rent Stabilization Association, which represents 25,000 landlords and property owners, says it is in the interest of landlords to be even more selective than market-rate landlords.
''In the free market, you get a tenant in, and if it turns out bad, you simply do not renew that lease,'' he said. ''As a rent-regulated landlord, the owner does not have that option.''
Potential renters must be fully prepared. Not only do you need to have a check in hand to cover the application fee and deposit, but as an applicant you will also be expected to have earned an annual income of 45 to 50 times the monthly rent for the past three years. If the apartment, for example, costs $2,000 a month, an applicant, or an applicant and a roommate, need to show a salary exceeding $90,000. Landlords are also closely scrutinizing credit history, looking for a score over 700.
For many young people moving to the city, salary and credit history can be a problem, so they must produce a guarantor to pay the rent if the tenant cannot. Some landlords would prefer to deal with a qualified tenant. Others like guarantors, since they add an extra level of protection. Landlords generally like guarantors to show at least 100 times the monthly rent in income.
Brokers say that in small buildings, landlords are often more interested in the type of tenant one might make and therefore more understanding if all the criteria are not met exactly.
A raft of rules and regulations protects stabilized tenants, including the mandatory offer of a lease renewal, but no laws govern the application process. Although some landlords take the first qualified applicant who comes along, others take multiple applications, hoping to find the most qualified tenant.
Mr. Greenblatt, the Prudential broker, said that when he first moved to the Manhattan in 1993, the landscape was vastly different.
Without much searching, he found a lovely studio apartment with a working fireplace at 53 Irving Place for just over $700 a month.
Now, when people come to him in the hopes of finding a similar deal, he offers a harsh reality check.
''The same opportunities are not available,'' he said. ''Period.''
The vast majority of regulated apartments are rent-stabilized. It is much harder to find anything rent-controlled -- apartments in buildings that went up before 1947 and have been occupied continuously by a tenant (or family member, spouse or lifetime partner) since 1971. There are only about 38,000 of these units left in the city.
Shannon Aalai, a broker at Citi Habitats who specializes in finding apartments for people relocating for work, says the first thing she has to do is educate a client about the realities of the market.
''People have this notion that they are going to find this great, cheap rent-stabilized apartment,'' she said.
It is understandable, she said, since many people either know someone or have heard a story about a successful search for a stabilized apartment.
''But the reality is, the really cheap stuff never even hits the market,'' she said.
She should know.
Ms. Aalai found her $1,300 rent-stabilized apartment in the Gramercy area because other brokers lived in the building, knew the landlord and gave her a heads-up when an apartment became available.
It is the kind of story that inspires hope, providing proof that deals can be found, and envy, as the reality sinks in that not everyone has an equal opportunity.
Mr. Greenblatt says that those who have only a few weeks to secure an apartment will find it nearly impossible to find a stabilized one.
''If your timing was right and you got here 20 years ago,'' he said, ''you could be living in a three-bedroom on Park Avenue.'' Those larger units, however, rarely turn over. And if a renter does leave, it is often in the landlord's interest to do extensive renovations -- enough to legally move the apartment out of stabilization to market rate.
However, if a person has months to search, he said, the best bet is to focus on studios and small one-bedrooms in older tenements or brownstones.
Often, when those kinds of apartments turn over, the renovation that would be required in order to charge market rate is too costly, given what the unit could command in rent, so it is kept in the stabilization system.
Of course, there is always luck, and a good broker.
Just ask Matt Held, 22, and his college buddy, Matthew Fox, also 22.
They both wanted to live in Manhattan, and Mr. Fox, a student at the New York University School of Law, was hoping to be close to the West Village campus.
For more than a month, they pounded the pavement in frustration.
''It was really difficult to even find a decent convertible one-bedroom apartment for less than $4,000,'' Mr. Held said. Some apartments they saw had been advertised as two-bedrooms but had no living room. Others had no real kitchen, or an impossibly cramped bathroom.
They seriously doubted that they would find anything.
Mr. Held was also wary of brokers, wanting to do things on his own. So when Mr. Fox contacted Ms. Fleming of Citi Habitats, he was skeptical.
When she called him on a recent Saturday morning, telling him he needed to rush down to the West Village immediately, with a check in hand, Mr. Held asked if she was sure the place was decent.
''She told me, 'I will not waste your time,' '' he said. She also made it clear that he had better be the first one in the apartment that morning, since it would go fast.
When he arrived at the apartment on Barrow Street, he was stunned.
It not only had two full bedrooms, a living room, and a kitchen with decent appliances, but it was also rent-stabilized with a monthly price of $2,800.
Mr. Fox said that when Mr. Held called him about the place, his first reaction was to wonder what was wrong with it.
''You don't want to find that there is no door,'' he said.
But there were no problems, and because Ms. Fleming had a good relationship with the landlord, the application went smoothly. The two men recently moved in, and they know how lucky they are.
''We were sitting around with some friends and we would not shut up about it,'' Mr. Held said. ''Finally, they were like: 'Enough already, you got a great deal. We get it.' ''

HEADLINE: Ups and Downs Now Confined Mostly to Rides

BYLINE: By JAKE MOONEY

 BODY:
MERMAID AVENUE, the main commercial street through Coney Island's largest residential section, stretches two dozen blocks west from the faded, raucous amusement park district, past telltale evidence of the area's varied past.
There are brick tenement buildings with storefronts that, in the mid-20th century, housed the bakeries, butcher shops and luncheonettes that were staples of a thriving neighborhood. There are empty lots remaining from Coney Island's worst years, in the 1960s and '70s, when much of the neighborhood drifted away or went up in smoke. And there are tidy one-family houses, white with red awnings -- block upon block of them, built beginning in the 1980s by a community development organization seeking to fill the emptiness.
Today's Coney Island, according to residents, officials and real estate brokers, is in yet another phase: safer and more stable than at its low point, populated largely by middle-class homeowners, yet still without the full complement of infrastructure that such a community needs. At the same time residents are holding their breath for a long-planned but recently delayed reinvention of the amusement district, along with construction of thousands of housing units near the boardwalk. The city government approved plans in 2009, though the timetable for those undertakings is unclear. 
Over the course of this metamorphosis, waves of Chinese and Russian immigrants have been moving to the residential blocks. Charles Denson, a Coney Island native who runs the nonprofit Coney Island History Project and wrote ''Coney Island: Lost and Found,'' said the more active Mermaid Avenue had begun to remind him of the district during his childhood.
Mom-and-pop stores ''have brought fresh produce back, and fresh bread, and it's really nice to see that,'' said Mr. Denson, who until last year rented an apartment on Stillwell Avenue, but who now splits his time between California and Sea Gate, a gated community west of Coney Island. ''It's just amazing to be able to walk around and feel safe in the neighborhood, and friendly.''
Eddie Mark, a Department of Transportation sign painter and the chairman of Community Board 13, which represents the area, lives in one of the nearly 1,000 row houses that the Astella Development Corporation built in the 1980s and '90s. The three-bedroom house, for which Mr. Mark, now 47, paid about $110,000 in 1995, is worth about $300,000, he said. Buyers like himself ''were all working-class citizens, and basically wanted the American dream, wanted to own their own house.''
As Gamal Hasan, a broker at Century 21 Block and Lot Real Estate, put it: ''These are the houses that really changed the area. They brought in working families.''
Some buildings have changed hands in recent years, Mr. Hasan said, but many original buyers remain in place. Mermaid Avenue's commercial corridor is still in a state of transition, he added, citing the persistent uncertainty over Coney Island's development.
The higher rate of homeownership has improved the look and stability of the neighborhood, but even so, ''a lot of people are just sitting back and waiting. They're not putting too much money into their properties because they're not sure what's coming in.''
Charles Reichenthal, the community board's district manager, sees residents' fortunes as inextricably tied to the thrill rides and midways that made the area famous. With the fate of local businesses, and local jobs, tied to tourism, he said, ''what's good for the amusement area is good for the community at large.''
The amusement area, for its part, still has empty and underused properties. Bought in recent years by Thor Equities, a developer, they have been cleared and in many cases kept vacant, although some have had part-time tenants like flea markets or petting zoos.
Still, Mr. Reichenthal said, the allure of the ocean is strong. ''People are coming. The crowds are large, and this is only the beginning of the season.''
WHAT YOU'LL FIND
For most of its length Coney Island is only three blocks wide: Mermaid Avenue runs horizontally down the middle, with Neptune Avenue to its north and Surf Avenue to its south. Sea Gate is at the western border, and Brighton Beach is to the east. The area covers roughly one mile, with a population of about 45,000.
Several high-rise New York City Housing Authority developments, dating to the 1950s and housing thousands, stand near the western end. High-rises including the Trump Village co-op complex -- near Ocean Parkway to the east, in an area bordering Brighton Beach known as West Brighton -- are privately owned and more expensive.
Peter Bacarella, the owner of Brooklyn's Scenic View Real Estate, says that although West Brighton is by many definitions part of Coney Island, numerous residents of Russian extraction have spilled over from Brighton Beach and identify more closely with that community. A three-year-old building he has been marketing at 3080 West First Street has been selling briskly, he said, adding that the appeal was the same as in Brighton Beach: ''The Russians love the water.''
Mr. Bacarella, who once worked as a parking lot attendant across Surf Avenue from the remains of the old Steeplechase Park during the 1970s, said Coney Island's western end had improved since that era. ''Drugs, prostitution, no rides -- it was horrible,'' was how he remembered it.
Still, the eastern side, with its demand for housing near Brighton Beach, is higher-end, he said, adding: ''All in all, I think Coney Island's revitalizing. I think it's going to be at least 10 years down the line.''
Mr. Reichenthal cited challenges: water and sewer lines are in need of work; parking is difficult, as is getting out of the area by car when the amusement district is in full swing. Still, he said, there are signs of progress: Y.M.C.A. is scheduled to open a facility on Surf Avenue at West 29th Street in 2013, replacing one that closed years ago.
WHAT YOU'LL PAY
Single-family houses tend to be small, Mr. Hasan said. Most of those built by Astella have three or four bedrooms and two or two and a half baths. Many have private driveways, but newer houses lack basements.
Such houses often cost less than $400,000, he added. In the last six months, the median sale price for single-family houses in the 11224 ZIP code was $420,000, and that includes pricier Sea Gate properties. He also said a handful of two-family houses had sold recently in the $400,000-to-$500,000 range. Delton Cheng, the owner of Century 21 Homefront, says prices on multifamilies can reach $550,000 to $600,000.
One-bedroom rentals on Craigslist go for as little as $1,200 a month. For $1,750, one- and two-bedrooms can be found near Brighton Beach, or four-bedrooms west of the amusement district.
THE COMMUTE
The Stillwell Avenue subway station lies at the end of the D, F, Q and N lines. The N runs express through part of Brooklyn. The Q also stops at Ocean Parkway and the F at Neptune Avenue. Both stop at West Eighth Street. A typical subway ride to Midtown takes about an hour. The Belt Parkway, with connections to the Gowanus Expressway, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and eastern Long Island, passes just north of the neighborhood.
WHAT TO DO
Coney Island's rides and boardwalk draw tourists from around the world, and in the summertime are busy even on weekdays. Mr. Reichenthal said one of the goals of the Coney Island Development Corporation, which was formed by the city in 2003 and of which he is a board member, was to foster year-round activity in the entertainment district. An increasing number of restaurants are remaining open year-round, he said, and neighborhood renovation plans call for some indoor attractions.
Kaiser Park, on 26 acres at Neptune Avenue and Coney Island Creek, has recently restored basketball and handball courts, a running track, sports fields and playgrounds -- and a view of the Verrazano. The new Y.M.C.A. is to have two pools, one Olympic-size.
THE SCHOOLS
The westernmost end of the neighborhood is zoned for Public School 188 on Neptune Avenue -- one of various elementary options. To the east is No. 329, on West 30th Street, or No. 288, on West 25th, which also serves the middle school grades.
Middle schools include Mark Twain Intermediate School 239 for the Gifted and Talented on Neptune Avenue, which got an A on its city report card, with 92.1 percent deemed proficient in English, 95.4 percent in math.
For Grades 9 through 12, one option is the Rachel Carson High School for Coastal Studies on West Avenue, where SAT averages last year were 389 in reading, 406 in math and 383 in writing, versus 436, 460 and 431 citywide.
THE HISTORY
''Coney'' is a name for the wild rabbits that once predominated in the area, according to The Encyclopedia of New York City -- which also says the first roller coaster arrived here in 1884. Interest in the amusement district declined after World War II, and Steeplechase Park and its parachute jump closed in 1964.

HEADLINE: Molly Pringle, John Van Sickle

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

 BODY:
Molly Ashlyn Pringle, the daughter of Elizabeth Henry Pringle of Kirkland, Wash., and David A. Pringle of Seattle, was married Saturday evening to John Carey Van Sickle, a son of Carey Ann Van Sickle and Dr. Greggory J. Van Sickle of Topeka, Kan. Andrew Grant Morse, a Universal Life minister, officiated at Sodo Park, an event space in Seattle.
Mrs. Van Sickle, 30, is a financial analyst in the Jersey City office of TD Ameritrade, part of Toronto-Dominion Bank. She graduated from Gonzaga University in Spokane, Wash. 
Until 2010, her father was a vice president in the trusts department of U.S. Bank in Seattle. Her mother is a senior editor at Becker & Mayer, a provider of book-producing services, including illustration and design, in Bellevue, Wash.
Mr. Van Sickle, 32, is a vice president with Sentinel Capital Partners, an investment firm in New York, where he evaluates small to midsize companies in North America. He graduated summa cum laude from Emory and received an M.B.A. from Harvard.
His mother retired as a social worker from the Topeka public schools system. His father is a pediatrician in private practice in Topeka.
The couple met in 1995 when Mr. Van Sickle, then 15, went to an Christmas party in his hometown, Topeka, that was hosted by an aunt of Ms. Pringle's, a friend of his family. Ms. Pringle, then 14, and her mother traveled each year from Seattle to attend. Though Ms. Pringle's aunt encouraged it, a courtship seemed unlikely as both were too young and living in different cities.
''I thought she was very pretty, and she thought I was too strait-laced,'' Mr. Van Sickle said. ''Plus, she lived in Seattle and I lived in Kansas before moving to the East Coast for school and work. So, we were pretty far apart.''
Still, they continued to see each other once a year, at the Christmas party.
Fourteen years later, amid the financial crisis in 2009, Ms. Pringle found herself out of work. ''I had the freedom to take time off and to travel,'' she said.
That year, she went to New York to visit a cousin who is also a friend of Mr. Van Sickle's from Topeka.
After showing Ms. Pringle around New York, her cousin had a date of his own and asked Mr. Van Sickle if he would mind taking Ms. Pringle to dinner.
''There was only one answer to that question,'' Mr. Van Sickle recalled.
They went to a restaurant and ''it felt like a date, but I don't think either one of us was calling it a date,'' Ms. Pringle said. ''He seemed nervous and didn't finish his dinner, so I finished it for him.''
They saw each several more times and Ms. Pringle extended her visit by a day.
''It felt as if there was a bubble around us that entire weekend,'' she said. ''All we saw was one another.''
In 2010, Ms. Pringle moved to New York, and the two began dating steadily.
''I'm organized to a fault,'' Mr. Van Sickle said. ''She's a tornado of clothes flying out of the closet, always missing one shoe. I tend to be more of a skeptic, a dark cloud, and she has a wonderful, insuppressible optimism. I try to borrow a bit of that from her, but I don't think she wants to borrow any of my organizational skills.''
Last December, Ms. Pringle and Mr. Van Sickle returned to the annual Christmas party in Topeka where they first met, this time as a newly engaged couple. VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

HEADLINE: Struggling in the Suburbs

 BODY:
Hardship has built a stronghold in the American suburbs. Whatever image they had as places of affluence and stability was badly shaken last year, when reports analyzing the 2010 census made it clear that the suburbs were getting poorer.
While the overall suburban population grew slightly during the previous decade, the number of people living below the poverty line in the suburbs grew by 66 percent, compared with 47 percent in cities. The trend quickened when the Great Recession hit, as home foreclosures and unemployment surged. In 2010, 18.9 million suburban Americans were living below the poverty line, up from 11.3 million in 2000.
It is possible to see this struggle just beyond New York City in a quintessentially suburban place, Long Island. There have long been pockets of poverty there, created by race and income segregation. But it is not just in pockets anymore. These days the struggle has metastasized: foreclosed homes are just as empty in the better-off subdivisions, with the same weed-choked yards, plywood windows and mold-streaked clapboard siding. 
Long Island's two counties, Nassau and Suffolk, have the second- and third-highest foreclosure rates in New York State, behind Queens. Debt counselors across the island juggle a mix of clients: immigrant families undone by predatory lenders and middle-class professionals impoverished by illness, layoffs or credit-card bills. Families who once donated food now wait in line to receive it at pantries that empty out week after week. Homeless women with children move in with relatives or into motels, the government-paid shelters of last resort.
The deepening of suburban poverty is putting new strains on government agencies, parish outreach programs and other institutions in the suburbs' gauzy safety net. At the Suffolk County Department of Social Services, which handles programs like food stamps, Medicaid, emergency housing and cash assistance, needs have increased across the board.
The number of food stamp cases reached 40,699 in April, compared with 26,193 two years ago. Almost 195,000 people in a county of 1.54 million are on Medicaid. More people are asking for help to cover emergency bills for rent or heat; more than 10,500 did so in the first quarter of 2012, an 8 percent increase over 2010. The county's emergency-housing caseload hit a 10-year peak in January, with 488 families and 261 individuals living in shelters and motels.
But the Social Services Department has not been able to stay ahead of demand. It has been under a court order since 2009 to shorten egregious delays in processing applications for food stamps and Medicaid. The average wait for Medicaid applicants fell to 29 days last year from 83 days in 2007, but that is still bad. One of the groups that brought the lawsuit, the Empire Justice Center, is planning to go back to court to force the county to meet its obligations.
These services apply primarily to the poorest Long Islanders, many of whom earn less than the federal poverty line ($22,113 for a family of four) and qualify for government aid. Those above that income level often don't qualify. About 468,000 people in Suffolk and Nassau, out of a total population of about 2.7 million, live in households earning up to 200 percent of the poverty line, or about $45,000 a year for a family of four. They are barely scraping by, but are often ineligible for programs like food stamps and subsidized housing and child care because their incomes are too high.
In May and June, a commission set up by the Suffolk Legislature held hearings on poverty. County and nonprofit officials warned of problems on multiple fronts -- of hundreds of working parents losing subsidized child care, for example; of low-paid social-service employees buried under growing caseloads while heading toward the brink of poverty themselves.
This month, the county announced that because of reduced state aid, it was tightening day-care eligibility rules for the third time in six months. Up to 1,200 families may be losing child care in summer, the worst possible time.
The suburbs were not designed for the poor. And even now, local governments are not equipped to see, much less answer, a lot of their needs. Nassau is having its own fiscal paroxysms, battling with a state control board over budget deficits and overborrowing. An untested new county executive in Suffolk, Steve Bellone, is trying to recover from damage caused by a predecessor who left behind deep structural budget problems. While the island's economy sputters, town and village governments are considering more layoffs.
Of course, there are things to be done -- smarter use of social-service resources, more economic development, a stronger public commitment to mass transit, housing and job training. But those are long-term challenges atop an immediate crisis, which must be addressed by more spending and more staffing to fix the safety net. Solving these problems must begin with an admission that suburban officials and residents have been reluctant to make: Poverty is growing, and it is not going away.

HEADLINE: Meandering With a Purpose

BYLINE: By ANNE R. PRAMAGGIORE. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
MY career has not been a straight path, which I attribute to my family's penchant for experimenting. My mother was a Girl Scout leader who later worked on political campaigns and then became president of the Ohio Genealogical Society. My father was a civil engineer with an interest in the arts. My sister moved from a business career to the arts. Although I majored in theater at Miami University in Ohio, I chose a business career.
I have skills and experiences from several different jobs and industries. After graduating from college in 1981, I completed a management training program at a department store in Ohio, then worked as a buyer for Snyder's department store in Louisville, Ky. 
I learned business basics in that job. A buyer supervises a small business. You're in charge of a department, you have a budget and you have to buy the right items and set the right price.
In 1989, in line with my divergent interests, I left and enrolled in DePaul University College of Law in Chicago. The Watergate proceedings of the 1970s had prompted my interest in policy, and that interest surfaced again. I served on the law review board at DePaul and as editor of the Law Journal. It was an intense experience to pull together and update the journal while attending law school full time -- a good lesson in assembling a team and achieving a goal.
After getting my law degree, I clerked for a federal judge for a year, then worked for a law firm and practiced antitrust law for eight years. In 1997, Illinois passed legislation deregulating the electric industry; in 1998 I was recruited by Commonwealth Edison to help in the transition. We're a division of Exelon. We don't generate power; we own the wires and poles that deliver the energy from the power plant to customers. Our service territory is northern Illinois.
The move to ComEd was a great opportunity to work in the last fully regulated industry, to get in on the ground floor of a monumental shift in the Illinois economy. I started as senior counsel in the legal department and became associate general counsel two years later.
Frank M. Clark, vice president of the regulatory department at the time, would often call on me to help decipher the deregulation process and ensure that it went smoothly. On one hand, Frank was my boss, but he also became the best mentor I could ask for.
I held increasingly responsible executive positions and was promoted to president and chief operating officer in 2009. Last year, when Frank announced his retirement as C.E.O., I was appointed in his place. I officially took over in February this year.
Last year, we proposed an investment plan to the Illinois legislature to upgrade our power grid to improve service. It will also help our state economy because so much commerce involves the Internet and relies on the grid. Our plan became law last October.
Technology is changing the game for our industry. Smart switches on power lines can now isolate a fault and reroute power, and digital meters on houses will eventually allow customers to adjust or customize their power plans.
When I moved from president to the top role, I was surprised at how many more people wanted to interact with me. I had been in one lead position already, so I didn't think the top job would be that dissimilar. We're such a part of our community that even as president I connected with people. But they react to me differently now and reach out to me more. The C.E.O. sets the tone. When you lead a company, people want to know what you're about. Leadership is personal. Customers and employees decide whether to follow you based on who you are as much as what the company's path looks like.

HEADLINE: The Wary Detente That Saved a Racetrack From Extinction

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEELE

 BODY:
ALTAMAHAW, N.C.
BRAD ALLEN has no time to stand around and talk. Friday is race night at Ace Speedway, so there's a drivers' meeting to convene and prerace activities to coordinate. A representative from a national racing series is waiting up in the track office, meanwhile, to discuss a coming event.
And at some point Mr. Allen, Ace's general manager since 2010, will need to meet with the track's owner, Abraham Woidislawsky, who is making a rare visit from up north. If recent experience is any guide, it should be a friendly discussion.
As if that weren't enough, Mr. Allen entered his own car tonight, his first race in more than a year, so he needs to touch base with his pit crew, otherwise known as his father and his uncle. They'll have to shout -- practice has begun, and cars are already screaming around the 4/10-mile paved oval at up to 120 miles an hour. There are five races on the schedule, with nearly 60 entries in three divisions. 
It's a blessing to be busy again at Ace, a 56-year-old bullring about an hour west of the Research Triangle here in the Piedmont region of North Carolina. Only a few years ago the speedway was verging on collapse, weighed down by debt, losing fans and competitors in equal measure. The recession that began in late 2007 hit hard; even major series like IndyCar and Nascar Sprint Cup suffered in attendance and TV ratings, intensifying the challenge of retaining the support of sponsors and automakers.
Down at the grass-roots level, where the racing hews closest to its rough-and-tumble origins and where future stars are groomed, the very existence of some tracks has been threatened. According to the National Speedway Directory, by 2011 the number of active racing facilities in the United States and Canada fell by nearly 100 from its peak of about 1,600 in 2004.
Most of those tracks are short ovals like Ace, which draw drivers, fans and sponsorship dollars almost entirely from their local communities. Even in the best of times profits can be thin, and for many small racetracks survival has long been a week-to-week proposition.
Known as Southern Speedway when it opened in 1956, Ace started out as a dirt track. In 1990 it was paved and gained Nascar affiliation; an expansion and renovation in 1999 brought it to its current seating capacity of 5,000.
Ace remained under local ownership until 2006, when Mr. Woidislawsky, a 72-year-old Philadelphia real estate developer, bought the speedway with a partner for $2.1 million. With his Eastern European accent -- he was born in Russia and raised in Poland and Israel -- he would never be mistaken for a local resident. Meandering through the pits on race night he seemed at ease, trading greetings and well-wishes with drivers, crew members and track officials.
Mr. Woidislawsky, who concedes that he knows almost nothing about racing, said his involvement with Ace resulted in part from his love of the spectacle and his admiration for the hardworking families who participate.
''I was hooked,'' he said of his first visit to Ace, in 2006. ''The noise, the people. It was beautiful to see.''
But the allure of track ownership quickly collided with reality. His partner exited a few months after the purchase; early capital investments like new computer systems piled on debt, as did the construction of go-kart and tractor-pull courses on the 50-acre property.
Meanwhile, the economic downturn was taking its toll, with unemployment in Alamance County, Ace's home, rising above 13 percent in early 2010. Racing is expensive -- perhaps $30,000 a year for a Late Model competitor -- and when a local economy suffers, drivers, sponsors and fans all cut back.
Trying to reverse a steady decline in attendance and revenue, Mr. Woidislawsky hired and fired several track managers in his first three years as owner. The track's debts mounted, and according to Mr. Allen, then only a competitor at Ace, some checks to vendors and drivers bounced.
Disputes over money -- and whom to blame when there isn't enough of it -- are something of a tradition in the racing business, and the he-saids and she-saids of Ace's troubles during those three years could fill a bank vault.
No matter where the fault lies, those dark days demonstrate how quickly the financial food chain that supports a small racetrack can spiral toward collapse. Fewer cars mean fewer fans and a loss of incentive for sponsors; a loss of sponsors means lower payouts. By the fall of 2009, the number of weekly competitors had plummeted, Mr. Allen said, down to 10 or 12 cars in the pits on some nights, and the crowds in the stands thinned as well.
The low point came on a Friday night late in that season when Mr. Allen counted about 200 people in the stands. ''And half of them were Cub Scouts who just happened to be camping on the grounds,'' he said.
Through it all, Mr. Woidislawsky's reputation in the community suffered. That he was trying to run the business remotely from Philadelphia -- visiting the track only four times a year, by his estimate -- didn't help.
Finding the right person to handle day-to-day operations was essential.
Mr. Allen, 47, was not the most likely candidate to reverse Ace's fortunes. He'd never run a racetrack before, and like the speedway itself, he'd been through a tough spell -- divorce and unemployment -- and was paying his bills by working odd jobs.
Still, he brought a lifelong love of Ace Speedway -- he remembers watching his uncles race there as a child, and he won Modified championships at the track in 2006-8 -- and he was trusted within the local racing community. When Mr. Woidislawsky hired him for the 2010 season, his job, in essence, was to rebuild that community and in the process revive the track's fragile financial ecosystem.
He started by cutting ticket prices, and he gave discount rates to local sponsors to encourage their loyalty. He called drivers who had left the speedway, inviting them to return.
To Mr. Allen, this was the main issue. ''If nobody's going there to race, nobody's going to watch,'' he said.
Higher car counts would lure more fans to the track, which would attract sponsors, which would in turn allow Ace to offer higher purses. Not incidentally, back gate revenue -- the entry fees paid by drivers and team members, $25 to $30 a head -- would increase as well.
As Mr. Allen would learn, though, it's not as simple as promoting the next week's event and selling tickets. Unforeseen costs, from digging a new well to repairing a broken speaker system, crop up. There are vendors to pay, sponsors to court and weather forecasts to watch -- rainouts are a huge setback.
If this race night is any indication, his duties never stop. He dons a rainbow wig and overalls to join in prerace antics for the fans, and leads them in a kind of pep-rally chant; he even joins the track's announcer in singing the national anthem.
There's an awkward moment, too, when the owner's visit is announced. Mindful of the moment, Mr. Allen reminds the fans of Mr. Woidislawsky's continued support of Ace and coaxes a polite round of applause from them.
The disparate cultures represented by the two men, the local boy with the Carolina drawl and the northerner whose strained English can come across as blunt, couldn't be more obvious. Both agree that the relationship has involved some push and pull, culminating last fall in what Mr. Allen described as an angry exchange over the last-minute cancellation of a big race.
Mr. Allen said he was prepared to leave Ace at the end of the season -- he had offers from three other tracks, he said -- but on a November visit to Philadelphia the men found common ground.
''I realized this guy's really not too different than I am,'' Mr. Allen said. ''We're just in different worlds.''
Their continued partnership appears to be working. Two of this season's early races drew about 2,000 fans, according to Mr. Allen, and attendance since then has averaged about 1,800. And for the first time in years, the track is operating within its budget, Mr. Allen said.
Talk about money long enough and you see nothing but dollar signs around the track -- one can only imagine how much it costs to rent one of those track-sweeping trucks for a night, or replace those light bulbs.
Once the green flag drops, none of it matters. Nobody comes to Ace Speedway to get rich, anyway. They're here to nurture a dream or keep one alive, or because they've been coming for generations, whether they love it or love someone who does.
And short-track racing almost never disappoints. The corners are tight and the drivers get feisty, as do the fans.
Out on the track tonight, the Extreme class clatters around the oval like a junkyard raised from the dead. The Modifieds are a more serious affair -- after a few too many shenanigans among drivers the flagman jumps onto the track during a caution-flag period and halts an oncoming car like a traffic cop. There's an altercation in the pits after three cars are thrown out of the race, prompting fans to rush the fence along the front straight for a look.
Meanwhile, Mr. Woidislawsky's good-will tour of the grandstands continues, including a summit meeting of sorts with Miss Ace Speedway, a student at nearby Elon University. Even if it seems at times that folks still don't quite know what to make of him, there's a grudging respect for what Mr. Woidislawsky has done for Ace.
''I never feel like they don't like me,'' he said. ''Every time I see them, 'Hi Abraham, thank you for staying with us, and bearing with us.' ''
For Mr. Allen, who finished sixth in his first race back, the larger implication can't go unstated.
''In the end, he could have closed the thing down,'' he said. ''He could have turned it into a mobile home park, or just bulldozed it. But he kept it open.''

HEADLINE: The Shifting Meanings of 'Confidential'

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

 BODY:
IN the world of high-end New York real estate, keeping the identity of buyers a secret can often be an exercise in futility. Brokers talk, developers talk, lawyers talk, and certainly you can't always trust envious acquaintances. And sometimes, it turns out, word getting out about who is buying in a building is not such a bad marketing strategy.
That certainly was the case with 15 Central Park West, where a steady flow of leaks about the famous and the powerful who were buying into the Robert A. M. Stern-designed structure helped build buzz around the building early on.
''Everyone knew everyone that was buying,'' said Howard Lorber, chairman of Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''It became like a club. If you wanted to join the club you had to know who the other club members were.'' 
By mid-2007, reports had already been published that Denzel Washington, Gordon Sumner (a k a Sting), Norman Lear, Bob Costas, the Nascar racing champion Jeff Gordon, and the banking titans Lloyd Blankfein and Sanford I. Weill had all agreed to spend many millions to live there.
As 15 Central Park West ''was rising out of the ground it was being defined by the slow accretion of names that were buying there,'' said Michael Gross, who is writing a book about the building. ''There was a constant drip, drip, drip of information that made 15 seem like the most fascinating building in New York.''
(The building was developed by Arthur and William Lie Zeckendorf, who did not respond to requests for a comment.)
In sharp contrast to that approach stands New York's latest ''it'' building -- One57, the 90-story structure at 157 West 57th Street -- whose cloak of secrecy has started to make the Extell Development Company, its developer, seem almost like the Kremlin.
In the more than six months since Extell began selling what will -- for a while, at least -- be the city's tallest residential structure, barely a drop has fallen from the information faucet.
Other than one buyer -- Richard Kringstein, the co-owner of Herman Kay Company, which makes women's and men's outerwear -- not one name has surfaced as a confirmed future resident of One57. Mr. Kringstein bought a 3,228-square-foot apartment with three bedrooms and park views for an undisclosed price. The least expensive apartments have sold for about $3,000 a square foot, said Gary Barnett, Extell's president.
Earlier this week there was a flash of excitement when The New York Post reported that a sheik from Qatar had agreed to buy the duplex penthouse on the 89th and 90th floors. Mr. Barnett called the report ''totally not true'' when I contacted him. In fact the Qatari, Sheik Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani, who is the country's prime minister, has not bought anything in the building, a person familiar with the matter said Thursday.
The penthouse buyer remains a mystery, although Mr. Barnett said that it was ''not a Russian and not a Middle Easterner.'' The sheik, who had been looking in the building, was still ''welcome'' to buy there, Mr. Barnett said.
Another apartment at One57, the Winter Garden, a 13,554-square-foot duplex with a private solarium that was listed at $115 million (the city's most expensive apartment listing), has gone into contract for an undisclosed sum, the person familiar with the matter said, confirming a story first reported by The Wall Street Journal.
Big sales are clearly happening. Mr. Lorber told me one Chinese company with offices in New York, which Elliman represented, agreed several months ago to pay $150 million to buy four apartments at One57 -- two full floors and two half-floors. Extell officials declined to comment.
Back in May, when I first reported that the penthouse had gone into contract for $90 million to $100 million, which would be a record sale in the city, Mr. Barnett sounded like a beaming papa when describing his success in keeping buyers' names secret.
''I am very proud of this,'' he said. ''There has not been one disclosure of anybody who has bought in the building. We have sold well over 40 units and not one disclosure.''
Fewer than a handful of people associated with Extell know who the actual buyers are, said Jeff Dvorett, One57's project manager. Some members of Extell's own sales team aren't in the circle of trust. Neither is Rubenstein Associates, Extell's outside public relations firm, said Tamar Rothenberg, Extell's vice president for marketing.
Mr. Barnett said Extell had sold more than half of its 92 condominiums in the building since One57 opened for sales in December. He insists that Americans have bought about half of those condos, even though many prominent people in the industry, including Mr. Lorber, are skeptical.
''To date, I would be surprised if that were the case,'' Mr. Lorber said of the 50-50 claims. ''At the end of the day, my guess is it would be 75 percent foreign and maybe 25 percent locals.'' (He based that prediction on the flow of sales his brokers have made in the building, which have been predominantly to foreigners, he said.)
Mr. Lorber says the stark difference in how the 15 Central Park West and One57 sales stories are playing out reflects different moments in the global economy. In 2012 more and more superwealthy foreigners, many of them billionaires looking for places to park their cash in the United States, are demanding that brokers sign confidentiality agreements, and it is no longer chic on Wall Street to brag about big property purchases, he said.
Extell doesn't see it that way. ''We don't think this high-end market has changed,'' Ms. Rothenberg said. ''We just choose to handle that information differently, in a more confidential manner. We truly feel that this buyer, this high-net-worth individual, greatly appreciates remaining confidential.''
Donald J. Trump, who knows a thing or two about hype, said One57 probably didn't need celebrity buzz or clever marketing strategies to sell.
''I have always felt the most important element is the marketplace, and then it is location and building quality,'' Mr. Trump said. ''But the marketplace supersedes everything, and the market right now in New York is very good.''
Still, I wondered, given the success of 15 Central Park West, could the supersecret strategy at One57 backfire? How will the most prominent of potential buyers know this is a club they want to join?
''If anything, you can see by the pace of sales and our success so far, we really do not think that this strategy is going to backfire.'' Ms. Rothenberg said. ''It is exactly working in our favor.''
Some brokers murmur around town that Mr. Barnett may be trying to avoid revealing the number of foreign buyers at the building, because that might scare off other potential domestic buyers who, like many co-op boards, don't want to deal with the private security issues that some foreigners bring.
For now, we'll all just have to take the tiny group at Extell that's in the know at its word. Closings don't begin until the summer of 2013, with contracts on the higher-floor residences (like the penthouse) not expected to wrap up until after March 2014, Mr. Dvorett said.
Mr. Kringstein, for one, says he doesn't understand what all the fuss is about. He has told friends and family he is moving into One57 with his wife. Confidentiality -- aside from the exact price he paid for his apartment -- ''is not such a big deal,'' he said.
''It is a little surprising,'' Mr. Kringstein said, upon being informed that he was the first confirmed buyer in the building. Other than one friend, another American who has also bought in the building, he hasn't a clue whom else he'll see there.
But then again, he said, ''When you move into a building do you ever really know the names of the people living there?''

HEADLINE: Why Conservatives Are Happier Than Liberals

BYLINE: By ARTHUR C. BROOKS. 
The president of the American Enterprise Institute and the author of ''The Road to Freedom'' and ''Gross National Happiness.''

 BODY:
WHO is happier about life -- liberals or conservatives? The answer might seem straightforward. After all, there is an entire academic literature in the social sciences dedicated to showing conservatives as naturally authoritarian, dogmatic, intolerant of ambiguity, fearful of threat and loss, low in self-esteem and uncomfortable with complex modes of thinking. And it was the candidate Barack Obama in 2008 who infamously labeled blue-collar voters ''bitter,'' as they ''cling to guns or religion.'' Obviously, liberals must be happier, right?
Wrong. Scholars on both the left and right have studied this question extensively, and have reached a consensus that it is conservatives who possess the happiness edge. Many data sets show this. For example, the Pew Research Center in 2006 reported that conservative Republicans were 68 percent more likely than liberal Democrats to say they were ''very happy'' about their lives. This pattern has persisted for decades. The question isn't whether this is true, but why. 
Many conservatives favor an explanation focusing on lifestyle differences, such as marriage and faith. They note that most conservatives are married; most liberals are not. (The percentages are 53 percent to 33 percent, according to my calculations using data from the 2004 General Social Survey, and almost none of the gap is due to the fact that liberals tend to be younger than conservatives.) Marriage and happiness go together. If two people are demographically the same but one is married and the other is not, the married person will be 18 percentage points more likely to say he or she is very happy than the unmarried person.
The story on religion is much the same. According to the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey, conservatives who practice a faith outnumber religious liberals in America nearly four to one. And the link to happiness? You guessed it. Religious participants are nearly twice as likely to say they are very happy about their lives as are secularists (43 percent to 23 percent). The differences don't depend on education, race, sex or age; the happiness difference exists even when you account for income.
Whether religion and marriage should make people happy is a question you have to answer for yourself. But consider this: Fifty-two percent of married, religious, politically conservative people (with kids) are very happy -- versus only 14 percent of single, secular, liberal people without kids.
An explanation for the happiness gap more congenial to liberals is that conservatives are simply inattentive to the misery of others. If they recognized the injustice in the world, they wouldn't be so cheerful. In the words of Jaime Napier and John Jost, New York University psychologists, in the journal Psychological Science, ''Liberals may be less happy than conservatives because they are less ideologically prepared to rationalize (or explain away) the degree of inequality in society.'' The academic parlance for this is ''system justification.''
The data show that conservatives do indeed see the free enterprise system in a sunnier light than liberals do, believing in each American's ability to get ahead on the basis of achievement. Liberals are more likely to see people as victims of circumstance and oppression, and doubt whether individuals can climb without governmental help. My own analysis using 2005 survey data from Syracuse University shows that about 90 percent of conservatives agree that ''While people may begin with different opportunities, hard work and perseverance can usually overcome those disadvantages.'' Liberals -- even upper-income liberals -- are a third less likely to say this.
So conservatives are ignorant, and ignorance is bliss, right? Not so fast, according to a study from the University of Florida psychologists Barry Schlenker and John Chambers and the University of Toronto psychologist Bonnie Le in the Journal of Research in Personality. These scholars note that liberals define fairness and an improved society in terms of greater economic equality. Liberals then condemn the happiness of conservatives, because conservatives are relatively untroubled by a problem that, it turns out, their political counterparts defined.
Imagine the opposite. Say liberals were the happy ones. Conservatives might charge that it is only because liberals are unperturbed by the social welfare state's monstrous threat to economic liberty. Liberals would justifiably dismiss this argument as solipsistic and silly.
There is one other noteworthy political happiness gap that has gotten less scholarly attention than conservatives versus liberals: moderates versus extremists.
Political moderates must be happier than extremists, it always seemed to me. After all, extremists actually advertise their misery with strident bumper stickers that say things like, ''If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention!''
But it turns out that's wrong. People at the extremes are happier than political moderates. Correcting for income, education, age, race, family situation and religion, the happiest Americans are those who say they are either ''extremely conservative'' (48 percent very happy) or ''extremely liberal'' (35 percent). Everyone else is less happy, with the nadir at dead-center ''moderate'' (26 percent).
What explains this odd pattern? One possibility is that extremists have the whole world figured out, and sorted into good guys and bad guys. They have the security of knowing what's wrong, and whom to fight. They are the happy warriors.
Whatever the explanation, the implications are striking. The Occupy Wall Street protesters may have looked like a miserable mess. In truth, they were probably happier than the moderates making fun of them from the offices above. And none, it seems, are happier than the Tea Partiers, many of whom cling to guns and faith with great tenacity. Which some moderately liberal readers of this newspaper might find quite depressing.

HEADLINE: Paths Around Investment Gloom and Doom

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
HERE'S a depressing thought:
''Investors should anticipate and prepare for another 'lost decade' for stocks. In fact, we believe that the next 10 years will be even more difficult than the last 10 because of a new emerging menace -- inflation.''
So argue Martin J. Pring, Joe D. Turner and Tom J. Kopas in ''Investing in the Second Lost Decade'' (McGraw-Hill, $30). The first ''lost decade'' refers to January 2000 to December 2009, which ''goes down as one of the worst 10-year investment periods ever for stocks,'' the authors write. Over that time, the total return of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, for example, was a negative 9 percent, even when including dividends. 
As technical analysts, the three authors rely primarily on past performance to make a persuasive case that we are in for another 10 bad years.
First, they point out that, historically speaking, ''lost decades tend to occur back-to-back.'' Second, they see nothing on the horizon that leads them to believe that the economy is going to buck the trend. The United States' national debt is so big -- and growing only bigger -- that it will be a huge drag on future growth. What's worse, they say they believe that at some point the government will start printing even more money to try to revive the economy, a move that could set off the inflation they are worried about.
So, given all this doom and gloom, how do they justify their subtitle? It says the book is ''a survival guide for keeping your profits up when the market is down.''
They offer two reasons. Even during long-term bear markets, they point out, there are brief periods when stocks rise. And if you can anticipate when markets are going to fall again, you can take measures to protect whatever gains you have -- and to keep your losses to a minimum.
The secret, they contend, is in understanding business cycles.
Here, however, the reading becomes dense, and charts and graphs proliferate. But the basic thought is this: Business cycles are predictable. On average, over a four- to five-year period, the economy will go from expansion to contraction and back again. If you know where we are in a cycle, you can invest accordingly.
For example, when the economy begins to contract, you buy bonds, the authors write. At the nadir of the cycle, you buy stocks, and as expansion gets under way again, you buy commodities. Because expansion is the mirror image of contraction, the moves during the upside of the cycle are the opposite of what happens during declines. You sell bonds as the economy starts to improve and you sell stocks at the peak of expansion.
All of this is clear, but there are a few rather large problems with pursuing their strategy and expecting riches to follow.
First, cycles don't always follow the prescribed pattern, as the authors note. ''It is not unprecedented for markets to reverse direction out of sequence,'' as they put it.
Second, cycles are perfectly obvious -- in retrospect. While there is a chapter devoted to ''how to identify the business cycle stages,'' the authors acknowledge that their suggestions are not foolproof.
For example, they are big believers in charting ''moving averages'' of stock, bond and commodity prices, which is another way of saying that you track average values over a certain period to see if trends are bearish or bullish.
But, as the authors say, ''more often than not the market in question will already have moved before the evidence becomes conclusive,'' so you need to begin your asset shifting ahead of the change in sentiment you think is coming. And, of course, you could be very wrong.
Finally, this is not exactly unplowed territory. The idea of buying stocks when they are out of favor is well known. That means you will have much competition as you try to put the book's strategy into effect.
But if you believe that we can expect another 10 years of negative investment returns, alternatives to buy-and-hold are welcome.
Another new book, ''The Chinese Way to Wealth and Prosperity'' (McGraw-Hill, $22), by Michael Justin Lee, fits into this idea well.
Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the book is this: Of its ''eight timeless strategies for achieving financial success,'' a majority -- five, to be exact -- deal with creating human capital. For example, Mr. Lee says, you should want to achieve true mastery of your profession or trade. And you should go wherever necessary to find opportunity, and understand the importance of having a strong personal network.
When it comes to specific financial advice -- keep debt to an absolute minimum and defer gratification -- his most interesting chapter is ''Play Financial Defense,''an idea that boils down to saving a lot during good times in order to offset the bad.
''The undeniable truth is that from time immemorial, there has been only one sure way to ensure personal prosperity,'' writes Mr. Lee, who teaches finance at George Mason University and the University of Maryland. ''This one-way ticket to prosperity has been the consistent savings of a portion of one's earnings. It's been called the American way, but lately I feel that non-Americans have learned this lesson better than we have in this country.''
Save more. Invest in yourself, hope for the best, and plan for the worst. That's never bad advice, and it's where you end up after reading these two books.

HEADLINE: Click Here for an Offbeat Tour

BYLINE: By DAVID PAGE

 BODY:
A NEW generation of travel-sharing Web sites matches travelers with knowledgeable locals for offbeat, authentic and mostly very economical experiences -- across the globe or across town.
Witness, for example, Kieren Wuest, a business analyst from Sydney, Australia, who was in San Francisco not long ago for work. On his one morning off, Mr. Wuest, an amateur photographer, was looking for something slightly grittier than riding cable cars and shooting Victorian painted ladies. An Internet search led him to Vayable.com, where he found a $37 walking tour led by an author and artist who had spent 15 years documenting the city's street art scene.
The guide, Russell Howze, is one of a growing number of artists, chefs, biologists, college students, authors, urban beekeepers, expats or hobbyists of one kind or another who are using travel-sharing platforms like CanaryHop, Gidsy, SideTour and Vayable to market their particular brand of expertise.
For the package-tour averse, this means a vastly expanded menu of opportunities. Want to take a private lesson with a Mongolian circus contortionist in Las Vegas? Learn about New York City's garment district with a costume and wardrobe stylist? Fish a private bay off Qamea Island with Fijian royalty? 
''Each experience is as unique as the person offering it and the person taking it,'' said Jamie Wong, who co-founded Vayable last year. ''It's the way we all want to travel but haven't been able to until now.''
These new services rely on free listings to fill out their catalogs. Some (SideTour, Vayable) put considerable effort into curating their offerings, vetting guides to be sure that they can deliver what they offer. Others (CanaryHop) leave it to peer reviews and the judgment of its users. Each handles online transactions between the parties, often charging travelers a small service fee and taking a 10 to 20 percent commission from guides on confirmed bookings.
Below, an overview of four travel-sharing services.
CanaryHop.com
One of the newest players in the field, CanaryHop started in March with a slick YouTube video starring the ''Saturday Night Live'' star Andy Samberg, who is also a founder of the site. In it, Mr. Samberg awakens to find he's had an array of surprising experiences that could have been scenes from the Todd Phillips movie ''The Hangover.''
In essence, CanaryHop works as a searchable list of some 2,500 guides and travel service providers, as well as a handful of vacation-rentals-by-owner.
Damon Spiegel, a founder, calls it ''a modern-day classifieds for travel.'' Guides and service providers are referred to on the Web site as ''canaries.'' Travelers are ''hoppers.'' The majority have yet to be reviewed by travelers, so you're on your own to check the operator's bonafides.
Sample experiences: Circus training in Las Vegas (one hour, $100); camping in the Mojave Desert with a botanist (seven days, $495); Amsterdam ''Bar N Culture Tour'' ($6.61 an hour); tuk tuk ramble in Bangkok (five hours, $39); New York City makeup and accessories tour (three hours, $250); home cooking and eating with a family in Delhi (six hours, $37).
Gidsy.com
Gidsy, headquartered in Berlin, was founded by brothers from Amsterdam, Edial and Floris Dekker, who came up with the idea when they wanted to pick wild mushrooms for a risotto but didn't know how to distinguish edible from poisonous varieties.
''Google-ing around,'' Edial wrote in an e-mail, ''we found that it was nearly impossible to find someone to schedule a mushroom picking tour.''
With high-profile investment funds from the actor Ashton Kutcher and others, the platform has grown in its first year to include offerings in nine cities, including Istanbul, San Francisco and Hasselt, Belgium. Gidsy charges its hosts and organizers a 10 percent fee and withholds payment until after the activity to encourage accountability.
Sample experiences: Istanbul street photography workshop with a professional photographer (three days, 300 euros, about $367); chocolate and grappa tasting in Hasselt (two to three hours, 35 euros); challah braiding and baking in New York (two to three hours, $5). Also, a tour of the red-light district in Amsterdam with a former police officer (1 1/2 hours; 12.50 euros); tango lesson in London (1 1/2 hours, $:22, about $34); trend forecasting workshop in Ghent, Belgium (four hours, 10 euros).
SideTour.com
''The idea for SideTour was born of a trip my wife and I took two years ago,'' Vipin Goyal wrote to me in an e-mail. ''We left our jobs, sold almost all of our stuff and bought two plane tickets around the world. When I got back, I really wanted to continue that sense of exploration.''
Although there are plans to expand into other cities, SideTour's current bailiwick is New York City -- the idea being that there's a world of experiences to be had just within the five boroughs.
Mr. Goyal started SideTour last July with a mission to dig up and package one-of-a-kind experiences. Its guides -- all vetted by SideTour staff -- include authors, artists, musicians, professional chefs, bartenders and restaurateurs, a farmer, a monk, a concert pianist and a handbag designer. Listings are updated weekly. The most popular activities sell out weeks in advance.
Sample Experiences: Craft beer brewing in Brooklyn (one day, $35); street art tour and graffiti demonstration in Long Island City, Queens (1 1/2 hours, $35); foraging for edible plants in Brooklyn (two hours, $20); urban beekeeping in Fort Greene, Brooklyn (3 hours, $50). Also, butchering in Greenwich Village (three hours, $45); a conversation with the musician David Sanborn at the Core Club (1 1/2 hours, $200); drinks at the Knickerbocker Bar and Grill with a journalist from Rolling Stone (1 1/2 hours, $20); dinner with an investment banker turned bhakti yogi (1 1/2 hours, $20).
Vayable.com
When Jamie Wong was 8 years old, her third-grade class from the San Francisco area spent a week in Arizona with their pen pals on the Hopi reservation.
''We got an inside look into their lives, their families, their cultural traditions,'' she said. ''That was my first impression of what traveling was. That was what we wanted to do with Vayable: to link up travelers who wanted to go deeper with local experts worldwide.''
Years later, she gave up a job at ''The Daily Show'' in New York, moved back to the Bay Area and started building Vayable. The platform has grown to 1,500 guides on every continent but Antarctica. Users -- either ''explorers,'' as Vayable calls them, or guides -- create profiles and agree to follow guidelines. Travelers can search activities by city, then book their own experience or join another tour. All guides are screened.
Sample Experiences: Hookah and tea tour in Istanbul (three hours, $45); fly-fishing with the mayor of Kenai, Alaska (two days, $1,350; includes lodging and jet); dining with a Fijian king ($250 for up to six people). Also, a tour of East London street food ($48); a midnight street-food crawl in Queens (three hours, $48); a Harley-Davidson motorcycle tour of Versailles and Rambouillet (six hours, $310).

HEADLINE: The British, At Least, Are Getting Tough

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
THE unfolding story of how Barclays -- and, in all likelihood, other big banks -- rigged interest rates is full of telling tidbits about the way Wall Street works. It also represents yet another teachable moment.
By now the world knows that Barclays manipulated the most widely used benchmark rate, the London interbank offered rate. But Barclays is just one member of the cozy club that sets the Libor, which is supposed to be based on the average rate at which large banks can borrow money overnight. It's not based on actual transactions, however -- and that leaves room for mischief.
And mischief there was, according to e-mails and other documents that Barclays has turned over to regulators in the United States and Britain. The upshot: traders colluded by posting rates that either helped their bets in the markets or their bank's perceived financial strength during the harrowing days of 2008. 
Manipulating the Libor is a big deal because it affects the cost of money for almost everyone. The Libor is used to set rates on mortgages, credit cards and all manner of loans, personal and commercial. The amount of money affected by the phony rates is at least $500 trillion, British regulators have estimated.
Barclays is not the only bank under investigation for rigging the Libor. It was simply the first to own up to the behavior and settle with regulators, paying $450 million. Other banks will almost certainly follow, and the documents bound to bubble up in those cases will surely prove fascinating.
One of the most revealing exchanges in the Barclays documents came when a bank official tried to describe why Barclays's improper postings were not as problematic as those of other banks. ''We're clean but we're dirty-clean, rather than clean-clean,'' an executive said in a phone conversation. Talk about defining deviancy down.
''Dirty clean'' versus ''clean clean'' pretty much sums up Wall Street's view of cheating. If everybody does it, nobody should be held accountable if caught. Alas, many United States regulators and prosecutors seem to have bought into this argument.
British authorities have not. Last week's defenestrations of Marcus Agius, the Barclays chairman; Robert E. Diamond Jr., its hard-charging chief executive; and Jerry del Missier, its chief operating officer, apparently occurred at the behest of the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority, the nation's top securities regulator. (Mr. del Missier also seems to have lost his post as chairman of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the big Wall Street lobbying group. His name vanished last week from the list of board members on the group's Web site.)
MR. DIAMOND seemed shocked to be pushed out. An American by birth, he probably thought he'd be subject to American rules of engagement when confronted with evidence of wrongdoing at his bank. You know how it works on this side of the Atlantic: faced with a scandal, most chief executives jettison low-level employees, maybe give up a bonus or two -- and then ride out the storm. Regulators, if they act, just extract fines from the shareholders.
British officials are taking a different approach with this scandal. George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, was direct in his assessment of Barclays's activities. ''It is clear that what happened in Barclays and potentially other banks was completely unacceptable, was symptomatic of a financial system that elevated greed above all other concerns and brought our economy to its knees,'' he said in a statement on June 28. ''Punish wrongdoing. Right the wrong of the age of irresponsibility.''
Later, in a speech to Parliament, Mr. Osborne voiced the question that so many have asked recently in the United States. ''Fraud is a crime in ordinary business -- why shouldn't it be so in banking?'' he asked.
Perhaps the biggest lesson from the Libor scandal is how dangerous it is to rely on interested parties to set interest rates or prices of financial instruments, rather than on actual transactions conducted by investors. The Libor has been set in the current and vulnerable manner since the late 1960s. Maybe it has never been rigged before, but who knows?
It is far better to have the transparent and verifiable record of prices created by a tape of electronic trading. Such records are standard pricing mechanisms for many securities. But not all.
Prices of derivatives, especially credit default swaps that trade one-to-one, can still be based on one dealer's say-so. That's why a rule proposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that would require pretrade price transparency in the swaps market is so important.
But it is also why Wall Street is pushing back, especially on the commission's proposal that swap execution facilities provide market participants, before they buy or sell, with easily accessible prices on ''a centralized electronic screen.'' The commission's rule would eliminate the one-to-one dealings by telephone that are so lucrative to traders and so expensive to investors.
A bill intended to gut the commission's proposed rule and to maintain dealers' profits in derivatives failed to go anywhere after being passed last year by two committees in the House of Representatives -- Financial Services and Agriculture. That was a good thing.
But there are rumblings in Washington that this bill has resurfaced and that it may be quietly attached to a House Agriculture Committee appropriations bill scheduled for a vote this month. The bill, if passed, would bar the requirement for a centralized pricing platform to shed light on the enormous swaps market. It would also prevent regulators from requiring that a number of participants provide price quotations to customers, a way to ensure fairness.
It's hard to believe, in the wake of the Libor mess, that Wall Street and its supporters in Congress would continue to battle against price transparency in any market. Then again, that's precisely what they did after the credit crisis.
With each new financial imbroglio, the gulf widens between Main Street's opinion of Wall Street and the industry's view of itself. When Mr. del Missier, the former Barclays chief operating officer, took over as chairman of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association last November, he said: ''We will continue to work on maintaining and burnishing the level of confidence investors have in our markets, in our own financial institutions, and in the general economic outlook for the future.''
Given the Libor scandal, let's just say good luck with that.

HEADLINE: Help on Selling, Before Buying In

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
STAMFORD
BEATRICE FOREMAN had always thought she would live out her days in the comfortable three-bedroom Cape that she and her husband settled into some 45 years ago. And at 94, she has come pretty close.
But now, with her health deteriorating, she is trying to sell -- and it's not easy. She will miss her breezy porch, and looking out from it on the backyard where she and her husband, who died six years ago, used to entertain. But she is more worried about the fact that the house, now priced at $365,000, has been sitting on the market since March and isn't readily attracting potential buyers. She can't make the move to assisted living until it sells.
The interior is clean, and she has removed much that might be considered clutter. But the '70s-era kitchen, with its harvest gold appliances, seems to be a turnoff. ''I was comfortable working in there,'' said Ms. Foreman, a former teacher and community volunteer, ''but people want a whole lot now. They want granite tops on the counters and the island in the middle.'' 
Ms. Foreman's predicament is one that assisted-living and other such communities are trying to help their prospective residents get the better of, or avoid altogether. Increasingly, consultants are being hired by the facilities to help owners prepare their houses for sale well ahead of time -- a job that may also entail preparing the owners themselves.
''We're still dealing with the 'greatest generation,' if you will, for whom that home was the American dream,'' said Bob Kramer, the president of the National Investment Center for the Seniors Housing and Care Industry, a research organization based in Annapolis, Md. ''You might have worked most of your life to achieve it. And to move out of it is traumatic.''
The economic woes of recent years have acted as a further deterrent, making elderly homeowners fearful that ''they won't be able to sell their home, or will have to give it away for a song,'' Mr. Kramer said.
Occupancy rates at housing facilities for the elderly dipped along with the housing market, but New England facilities have held up better than those in the rest of the country. In Connecticut, rates have crept back up from their 2009 lows to a healthy 91 percent occupancy for the first quarter of 2012, versus 89 percent nationally, according to the investment center.
Still, many Connecticut retirement communities are actively involved in facilitating the moving process for new clients.
Pomperaug Woods, an independent and nursing-care community in Southbury, draws many of its residents from a nearby 55-plus condominium community that often has a lot of units for sale. Pomperaug contracts with Pearce Plus, a relocation firm in North Haven, to guide future residents on how to make their condos more salable and oversee the sales process.
''A lot of seniors have let their house go into disrepair or never bothered to update it,'' said Carol Ann McCormick, the director of sales and marketing at Pomperaug. ''We do see a lot of instances where seniors need help.''
Karen Bernetti, a home stager in Southington who specializes in working with older sellers, has found that her clients frequently need more time. ''Often, they're overwhelmed by the amount of stuff they have,'' Ms. Bernetti said, ''and they don't know what they should repair or update.''
Ideally, emotional and physical preparations for such a momentous move ought to begin long before it becomes a necessity, said Barbara Perman, the president of Moving Mentor, a moving management firm based in Amherst, Mass., and active in Connecticut. Her company works with senior housing facilities to help them figure out why people who have expressed interest in an apartment haven't put their houses on the market.
''We go in and talk to them in their homes,'' Ms. Perman said. ''So much of it is emotional. We're trying to investigate the reasons, and help them move along.''
Ms. Foreman says she has come to terms with moving. She has held several tag sales to clean out the house, and to streamline its appearance, she took down the many wall plaques lauding her years of community service. The walls are freshly painted and the finished basement is emptied of stuff. All she needs is a buyer.
She hopes her home will sell for enough to repay the reverse mortgage that has covered the cost of in-home aides, and still allow her to move into Brighton Gardens of Stamford.
Her listing agent, Kimberly Tapscott of Keller Williams Realty, says Ms. Foreman is up against considerable competition. ''Buyers are looking for value,'' Ms. Tapscott said, ''so it's a price war and a beauty contest.''
At the McLean Care community in Simsbury, would-be residents who haven't sold their homes by the time an apartment becomes available have the option of deferring the entry fee until after the sale, said Freddi Hoffmann, the vice president for marketing, sales and new business.
McLean often invites downsizing experts in to give lectures, and offers the services of One Full House, a relocation consultancy in Farmington, to help candidates ensure a speedier sale.
''It's not always about the dollar amount they can get for the house,'' Ms. Hoffman said. ''It's convincing them that they can sell the house.''

HEADLINE: In a Tough World, Fewer Places to Hide

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
OVER the years, stock investors have grown accustomed to looking abroad for bigger gains. But with large swaths of Europe now in recession, and with China slowing considerably, it's hard to make any money overseas.
''I can't think of any corner of the world that's really done well,'' said Thomas H. Forester, chief investment officer at Forester Capital Management. And without a single region or sector performing strongly in the second quarter, there really wasn't any place for foreign stock fund managers to hide.
No wonder many international stock funds sank in the quarter, with the average foreign fund down 6.1 percent, according to Morningstar. Funds that focus on European equities fared worse, losing 8.4 percent in the quarter and 16.6 percent over the last 12 months. 
Some international funds, though, managed to minimize losses through a combination of small steps that helped insulate them from the one-two punch of the sluggish global economy and the rapidly rising dollar, which made investing even harder for Americans in foreign markets.
Mr. Forester's fund, Forester Discovery, for instance, fell 2.1 percent in the quarter, beating 98 percent of its peers that invest in foreign blue-chip stocks. He attributes some of this performance to longstanding bets on consumer staples companies that, by their nature, are more defensive and tend to hold up in weak economies.
These are companies like Diageo, the world's largest maker of spirits. Shares of this British giant, whose brands include Johnnie Walker and Guinness, gained around 7 percent in the quarter.
To be sure, around one-tenth of the company's sales come from some of the most economically challenged parts of Europe: Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain, according to Morningstar. Yet, about a third of revenue comes from the faster-growing emerging markets -- and that figure is climbing fast.
Forester Discovery wasn't the only fund to benefit from this defensive-oriented approach. Robert Q. Wyckoff Jr., co-manager of the Tweedy, Browne Global Value fund, said that ''in general, food, beverage and tobacco stocks held up pretty nicely.''
Indeed, the fund's biggest holdings include Diageo, Heineken and British American Tobacco. All three stocks gained ground in the quarter.
Those holdings, as well as the fund's stakes in defensive-oriented pharmaceutical companies like Roche and Novartis, which don't require a strong economy for profits to grow, held its losses to 1.5 percent for the quarter.
Mr. Wyckoff's and Mr. Forester's funds had two other things in common. Both are underweighting the financial sector. In fact, neither owns a single bank based in the euro zone, given the uncertainties surrounding that group. Last month, for instance, Moody's, the credit rating agency, downgraded 28 banks in Spain, citing financial weakness of the lenders and of the government, which may be required to support them.
And both funds are benefiting from the dollar.
In Tweedy, Browne Global's case, it wasn't so much a matter of a direct bet on the dollar's rise as it was general practice. The fund has historically hedged its overseas bets. This means that every time the managers convert dollars in order to invest in international stocks, they take measures to buffer the fund against currency fluctuation.
This strategy is a headwind in periods when foreign currencies are gaining on the dollar -- at which point investors can make money simply by owning assets not denominated in dollars. But in periods when the dollar is strengthening, as in the second quarter, it can work to the fund's advantage.
Forester Discovery bet on the dollar in a more conscious fashion. How? The fund is currently keeping around 40 percent of its assets in cash.
That was partly a defensive strategy -- Mr. Forester noted that he was ''very concerned about the uncertainties in the world.'' But it was also an opportunistic move, he said, to bet on the relative health of the dollar versus global currencies.
''We could have held that cash in euros if we wanted, but we are choosing to hold that cash in dollars,'' he said. ''Right now, we believe the dollar is a better holding than the euro.''
SIMON HALLETT, chief investment officer at Harding Loevner, agrees that economic risks throughout the world are heightened. But he said investors shouldn't be worried only about Europe.
Mr. Hallett argues that the risks in China, for instance, are ''grossly misunderstood.'' Yes, China is an exporter that stands to lose if its major trade partners in Europe are mired in recession. So part of the slowdown is tied to the global troubles plaguing Europe.
But he argues that the real risks in China, the world's second-largest economy, stem from overinvestment -- ranging from the government's huge infrastructure projects to overdevelopment of residential housing.
''At some stage, investments in things like infrastructure become less and less productive,'' he says. That means that even if policy makers in China decide to be aggressive with stimulus, they may not be able to re-accelerate growth as quickly as some investors assume.
Not surprisingly, Harding Loevner International Equity has very few direct investments in China, preferring instead to bet in the developing world through large multinationals that sell into those markets. These are companies like LVMH, the French luxury goods maker whose brands include Louis Vuitton and Fendi.
Alex Tedder, co-manager of American Century International Growth, cautions that while the defensive-oriented investments won out in the quarter, that may not continue to be the case for the remainder of the year.
He noted, for instance, that in June, some economically sensitive areas of the market, like the industrial, materials and technology sectors, appeared to gain some traction. The question is whether enough bad news has already been priced into the market for stocks in those areas to build on those short-term gains.
''We're at an interesting phase in the markets,'' Mr. Tedder says. ''There's maximum uncertainty, but my view is that these are precisely the points where the opportunity set is the biggest for investors who can look ahead.''

Francine Prose's most recent book is a novel, ''My New American Life.''

 BODY:
TRUE BELIEVERS
By Kurt Andersen
431 pp. Random House. $27.
I was glad to be immersed in Kurt Andersen's ''True Believers'' when I happened to watch, on a television news show, an upsetting segment about school systems around the country deciding that elementary-grade students are reading way too much fiction. Why shouldn't they multitask and get practical ''hard'' information along with their phonetics? Goodbye, Curious George, farewell Amelia Bedelia! Hello solar system and the social organization of the ant farm!
Andersen's ''True Believers'' is, among other things, a novel about the powerful influence literature can exert on life. Its main characters are convinced they'd have turned out very differently if not for the fiction they read when they were young. For the narrator, Karen Hollander, and for Alex Macallister and Chuck Levy, the two friends she grows up with in the Chicago suburb of Wilmette, this formative education is delivered by James Bond. 
Over the years, I've heard several people I respect (my husband among them) thank Ian Fleming for having forged one of their earliest links between pleasure and reading. But for Andersen's characters, the Fleming novels are a lot more than entertainment. Starting in the summer after sixth grade, the three friends follow Bond's adventures the way fundamentalists study holy texts -- for an explanation of how the world works and a code to live by.
Near the end of the novel, Karen reflects on how Bond's voice still echoes in her consciousness, so many decades later: ''Once I became a corporate lawyer, wearing fancy clothes, meeting zillionaires, traveling first class, I experienced a James Bond moment every month or so -- benign and imaginary, brief, silent, impromptu one-woman replays of our childhood games. . . . I'd feel Bond-/girlish when I drove a European car with a stick shift on a European road, and when I ordered a martini at a revolving restaurant in Tokyo or Cape Town or overlooking Iguazu Falls in Brazil. It happened almost every time I passed through a big new airport, especially in China or the Middle East.''
Karen's embrace of Bond precedes and survives the turmoil of the 1960s, when it seemed as if the skills of a superspy (nerve, conviction, a gift for designing and carrying out covert, heroic, subversive acts) might be useful tools for coping with the high drama of daily existence. As the three suburban kids share their generation's intense response to the escalating war in Vietnam, its rage at lying and meretricious politicians and its determination to correct social and economic inequities, the heavy dose of James Bond lingering within them interacts with the ideas and emotions crackling through the atmosphere of the country at large, leading Karen and her pals to plan an act that's not just insanely risky but simply insane.
As the novel begins, Karen is writing a memoir -- a book in which she's finally going to confess, tell the whole truth and implicate her co-conspirators. The present action of ''True Believers'' deals largely with the new information her research into the past uncovers and its occasionally drastic consequences for her friends and former friends.
If you sat next to Karen on an airplane, you'd most likely know her whole history before the flight was cleared for takeoff. On the novel's first page we get her prospective blurb. A ''candid and inspirational memoir by one of the most accomplished leaders and thinkers of our times'' is what Karen's publishers are expecting. Then comes the narrative tease. ''Let me cut to the chase: I once set out to commit a spectacular murder, and people died.'' And, soon after, the bio: ''I was a reliable U.S. Supreme Court clerk and then a reliable Legal Aid lawyer, representing with all the verve and cunning I could muster some of the most pathetically, tragically unreliable people on earth. I have been a reliable partner in America's 19th largest law firm, a reliable author of four books, a reliable law professor, a reliable U.S. Justice Department official, a reliable law school dean.'' Meanwhile Karen has also become ''the coolest grandma on the planet.'' Her 17-year-old granddaughter, inspired by passions that appear to have skipped a generation, takes Karen along as a parentally mandated chaperon when she travels to Miami to protest at a G-20 summit.
Karen couldn't be chattier, and at moments you wish she had more faith in the reader's ability to remember the critical details of her story without having them repeated. But regardless of how you feel about time spent in Karen's company, you wind up thinking that Andersen is doing something harder than the novel's amiable, energized surface might suggest.
It turns out to be very difficult to write fiction (or, for that matter, make films) about the 1960s. I don't say this only because I lived through them and have tried. Nonfiction, like Jenny Diski's memoir ''The Sixties,'' more often gets it right. Maybe that's because the fictive narratives about the era must navigate the narrow passage between the overly goofy and the excessively earnest, both aspects of those times, though clearly there were other forces -- compassion, historical consciousness, a belief in education and justice -- at work.
Karen herself is sort of goofy, and her narrative takes turns that seem as improbable as the switchbacks in a magic realist fairy tale. Even those of us who believe that people aren't always what they seem may be surprised by how many of the novel's characters are discovered to have had secret agendas and hidden identities. Ultimately, though, you want to give Andersen credit for choosing to write about an era when many young people cared deeply about what happened to human beings in both a faraway country where we were fighting a war and also in our own inner cities -- a moment before those concerns were replaced by a cultural obsession with shopping, stylish new restaurants and celebrity gossip.
Forty years in the past, that time is already historic. By the end of his novel, Andersen's radicals have metamorphosed into rich art collectors and Supreme Court nominees. But Karen hasn't forgotten the significance of what she witnessed. She wants to tell people what her youth was about and to weave its events into a thread that pulls readers past its historical markers: the summer riots of the mid-'60s; the marches on Washington against the war in Vietnam. And, of course, the sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll.
The opening lines of L. P. Hartley's beautiful novel, ''The Go-Between'' -- ''the past is a foreign country: they do things differently there'' -- could serve as this novel's epigraph. In fact, ''True Believers'' has three: one from Mark Twain, another from Wordsworth and the last from Mick Jagger's ''Sympathy for the Devil'' -- the bit about it being ''you and me'' who killed the Kennedys.
In ''True Believers,'' Andersen has written a historical romance about the 1960s. It reminded me slightly of the James Michener epics I read and loved when I was around the age at which Andersen's characters fall for James Bond. For better or worse, Michener's novels forever influenced my thinking about the history and landscape of places like Afghanistan and Hawaii, just as they helped inspire a lifelong desire to travel and compare reality with the imaginative fictions that illuminated, enlivened -- and informed -- my childhood.

HEADLINE: Three Funds That Turned Back the Tide of Losses

BYLINE: By TIM GRAY

 BODY:
RALPH STANLEY, the bluegrass artist, sings that he is a ''man of constant sorrow.'' If he were a money manager, he would have felt right at home in the financial markets in the second quarter, which gave many investors nothing but woe. The average return in nearly every mutual fund sector tracked by Morningstar was negative.
Still, some managers found a few profitable places in an otherwise doleful time. Two of them work in sectors seen as safe harbors -- utilities and health care stocks. A third, whose fund ended up with a small loss in the quarter, trades in currencies.
A Nuclear Bounce 
Lately, bad news has indirectly helped Douglas C. Simmons, manager of Fidelity Select Utilities Portfolio. For him, the nuclear disaster in Japan last year brought a chance to buy good companies at bargain prices. After the accident, investors dumped United States utilities that generate a lot of their power with nuclear plants.
But Mr. Simmons said he believed that American utilities weren't exposed to the same risks as their Japanese kin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ''looked at Fukushima and said, 'We're different than Japan,' '' he said, referring to the accident site. ''We've since seen a rebound'' in stocks of utilities with exposure to nuclear power.
One of Mr. Simmons's bigger holdings -- Duke Energy in Charlotte, N.C. -- benefited in the second quarter. Thanks to its merger with Progress Energy in Raleigh, N.C., Duke is the largest electric utility in the United States, with 7.1 million customers in six states in the Southeast and Midwest.
''Duke is aspiring to be the next gold standard'' in its industry, he said, adding that ''the ascension to quality is where you make the most money'' in utilities stocks.
Many investors buy utilities for their dividend yield. Mr. Simmons says he differs in that he's drawn more to total return: the combination of a dividend and price appreciation. He also concentrates his portfolio, betting big on his favorite stocks. He held shares in only 30 companies as of April 30, compared with more than 100 for the average stock fund followed by Morningstar.
To hedge his bets, he gives his top holdings roughly equal weight, he said. His largest, FirstEnergy in Akron, Ohio, accounted for about 10 percent of the portfolio at the end of April, while the next three -- NextEra Energy, Edison International and Duke -- each accounted for more than 8 percent.
His fund, which carries an expense ratio of 0.86 percent, returned 7 percent in the second quarter.
Seeking Breakthroughs
Where some funds can benefit from bad tidings, Kris H. Jenner, manager of the T. Rowe Price Health Sciences fund, typically gains his fund's profits from happy ones. His specialty is finding companies with drugs, devices and even business processes that can radically improve the treatment of diseases.
''It's unusual to find something transformational,'' he said, ''but that's our holy grail.''
One of his larger holdings, Gilead Sciences in Foster City, Calif., already managed one such transformation in H.I.V. therapies and is working toward another in the treatment of hepatitis C. ''In the mid-90s, H.I.V. therapy was multiple pills a day,'' he said. ''In 2012, it's one a day. The company that has led the way has been Gilead, and they're poised to do it again with hepatitis C.''
Gilead's hepatitis drug is in what Dr. Jenner, a physician, called the ''sweet spot'' for identifying promising treatments that may become profitable investments: the two years before and the two years after Food and Drug Administration approval. ''The reason is that you still have some uncertainty about the product -- how good it is, how safe it is, how commercially successful it will be,'' he said.
Unlike Mr. Simmons, Dr. Jenner spreads his bets among many stocks. His fund had more than 200 at the end of March.
But once he buys, he tends to stay. His most recent stock turnover ratio was less than 20 percent a year; on average, he held each one for more than five years.
''Breakthrough therapies often create more value than I expect,'' he said. ''I'm willing to let that play out a little longer than someone else might.''
Dr. Jenner's fund, which has an expense ratio of 0.82 percent, returned 5.8 percent in the second quarter.
Confidence in the Dollar
Stocks, whether shares in workaday utilities or breakthrough-seeking drug makers, are standard fare in investing. The currencies traded by Dori Levanoni, a manager of the John Hancock Currency Strategies fund, are considered racier -- typically tools for hedging, not building a college fund or retirement trove.
But Mr. Levanoni said currencies might have a place in retail investors' portfolios because they could provide both return and diversification.
''We think about a currency in the same way we think about any asset: someone is buying or selling, and we're trying to figure out who's trading and why,'' he said.
Mr. Levanoni can bet that particular currencies will rise and buy them, or he can bet that they will fall and sell them short. He said he uses only the most common derivative securities, such as currency options and forwards, in his trades to keep his fund as simple and transparent as possible.
''People think of currencies as an alternative asset class,'' he said, ''but we're trying to be the most boring alternative investment you can have.''
In the second quarter, his shareholders benefited from his bullish view of the American dollar and his bearish view of the Australian dollar and the Swiss franc.
He liked the American dollar because he thought investors would continue to flock to United States Treasuries as financial difficulties abounded elsewhere. Domestic growth may be slow, and government debt may be growing, but other major economies have fared worse. And even growth in China, long a darling of investors, has slowed lately.
Mr. Levanoni's bearishness about the Australian dollar sprang from China's slowdown. Australian commodity exports to China had boomed, and ''the Australian dollar got above our judgment of its long-term fair value,'' he said. ''Versus the U.S. dollar, it has ranged form 60 cents to $1.10. At 60 cents, we thought it should rise, but parity with the dollar was too high. About 80 cents is reasonable.''
At the end of the second quarter, the Australian dollar was still trading at rough parity with the American dollar.
Mr. Levanoni's fund, which has an expense ratio of 1.56 percent, lost 0.52 percent in the second quarter.

HEADLINE: Once Just a Stopover for Drug Traffickers, Argentina Is Now Their Destination

BYLINE: By EMILY SCHMALL

 BODY:
BUENOS AIRES -- Hector Jairo Saldarriaga, alias the Dagger, changed his address here three times in the weeks before his killer finally caught up with him in April in front of a family-run cafe in the middle-class neighborhood of Barrio Norte.
While investigating his death, the police discovered that he had three Argentine passports under false names but was really a Colombian who had once worked as an assassin for a prominent Colombian drug trafficker.
As the trafficking of illegal drugs picks up in Argentina, residents are growing accustomed to front-page news of drug raids, shootouts and the grim reality that the country is no longer simply a transit point for the world's most-wanted drug traffickers from places like Mexico and Colombia. For many of these outlaws, Argentina has become home base, a comfortable refuge where many of them lie low while keeping a hand in the industry.
Mr. Saldarriaga, 39, who was living in an unassuming area of Buenos Aires, had been among the most feared assassins working for Daniel Barrera Barrera, a second-generation Colombian drug lord nicknamed the Crazy One, the authorities here said. 
A former fighter for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, Mr. Saldarriaga was believed to have coordinated the assassination of two former members of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia -- a right-wing paramilitary group that acts as security for traffickers -- in the parking garage of a Buenos Aires shopping mall in June 2008, the Argentine authorities said.
But then, the police said, Mr. Saldarriaga may have betrayed his boss by losing or stealing half a ton of cocaine. Another theory is that Mr. Saldarriaga had tried to branch out as a trafficker in his own right in an area of Argentina controlled by Mexico's Sinaloa drug gang and was punished for trespassing.
Mr. Saldarriaga is by no means the only notorious foreigner involved in the drug trade to make the news. Days before Mr. Saldarriaga was killed, Ruth Martinez Rodriguez, a Colombian who was once married to Mr. Barrera, was arrested in an upscale suburban home outside Buenos Aires, accused of fronting a business that tried to export 280 kilograms, or about 617 pounds, of cocaine to the United States, Europe and Asia hidden in Louis XV-style furniture. From Nordelta, a gated community with a private golf course, Ms. Martinez was said to have laundered money through real estate and a furniture business.
Because she was pregnant, she was sentenced to house arrest.
In another episode, in 2010, Argentine security officials arrested Angie Sanclemente Valencia, a onetime Colombian beauty pageant winner, on suspicion of running a ring of drug-smuggling models, including a 21-year-old Argentine woman who was caught trying to fly to Cancun, Mexico, from Buenos Aires with 55 kilograms, or about 121 pounds, of cocaine in her checked luggage. The young woman gave up information on Ms. Sanclemente, who was tracked down, with the assistance of Interpol, five months later at a Buenos Aires youth hostel and is currently serving a prison term of six years, eight months.
With drug gangs looking to expand their operations, Argentina, which was a transit point in the 1990s, has turned into a profitable marketplace. There is a huge local demand for drugs. And unlike governments in some other countries in the region that are engaged in aggressive drug wars, the government here has not yet aimed the full might of its military on traffickers.
''They haven't come up against any problems with the courts -- there is no war on narcos in Argentina -- so they operate here with total ease,'' said Claudio Izaguirre, the president of the Antidrug Association of the Argentine Republic.
Argentina's Security Ministry, in an effort to show its resolve in taking on traffickers, makes near daily announcements of its latest cocaine or marijuana raid, or discovery of a synthetic-drug laboratory.
In recent weeks, the authorities have found seven tons of marijuana in a house in Posadas, just across the Parana River from Paraguay; arrested a corporal of Argentina's gendarmerie for carrying 110 kilograms, or about 243 pounds, of cocaine in his car; and apprehended a government ambulance, its sirens blaring and a patient in the back, with 25 kilograms, or about 55 pounds, of cocaine.
''Drug trafficking responds to the logic of globalization. It doesn't recognize boundaries,'' said Nilda Garre, Argentina's security minister.
''The growth and rate of domestic consumption sustained in Argentina since 2003 may be attracting money with an illicit origin,'' Ms. Garre said in a statement. ''The situation is being carefully monitored by Justice Ministry authorities. Nevertheless, I must emphasize that Argentina, a country of 40 million, is a market of marginal interest for drug traffickers intent upon reaching areas of mass consumption in the United States and Europe.''
In June, the police seized 20,000 doses of paco, a highly addictive, smokable cocaine residue, and arrested seven Peruvians with ties to the Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla group, on suspicion of running a home-delivery service in Buenos Aires. Buoyed by global commodity prices, Argentina's economy grew at an average rate of 7.7 percent from 2004 to 2010, lifting millions out of poverty after the 2002 economic collapse.
Lately, though, the economy has cooled, which has made the fast money of drug dealing more appealing. Some of the drugs on the streets are imported, but others are local, including synthetic products created with the cheap, pirated pharmaceuticals that are widely available here.
In many pockets of this sprawling country, government officials and services are largely absent. Drug gangs have moved in to provide services to marginalized areas in exchange for silence, said Edgardo Buscaglia, a law professor in Mexico and a former United Nations official who completed a research mission in Argentina last year.
''This is a place where the probability of indictment is extremely low, where the authorities in the provinces don't have any capacity to investigate complex crimes, and which doesn't cooperate much internationally,'' Mr. Buscaglia said.
The Sinaloa drug gang has infiltrated poor communities in the densely tropical area that borders Paraguay and Brazil in the north, where, with the complicity of local authorities, it can act with impunity.
Police officials say that Colombian and Mexican traffickers live quietly with their families in some of the most exclusive areas of Argentina, which they consider safer than their home countries. They appoint local intermediaries to run their drug operations.
With large quantities of dollars nearly impossible to obtain legally in Argentina, traffickers frequently pay retailers in drugs, contributing to a growing problem of domestic consumption, the police and prosecutors say. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Argentina had the highest prevalence of cocaine use in South and Central America among 15- to 64-year-olds, with 25 percent of the region's users -- second only to Brazil.
''In terms of accessibility, you have it on every street corner,'' said Martin Iribarne, an addiction specialist and the director of the San Camilo Foundation, which operates a residential drug rehabilitation center in Buenos Aires Province. ''In the beginning, we accepted that the cartels came here on their way to other places. Afterward, it was our market.''

HEADLINE: When The Crowd Isn't Wise

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
Washington
IN the days leading up to the Supreme Court's health care decision, rumors began to circulate in Washington that the justices had decided to uphold the law. Liberals around town who might have reason to know the outcome seemed happy, according to the gossip, and a couple of conservative justices had seemed angry when the court met three days before the announcement. On the eve of the ruling, a few respected court watchers went so far as to predict publicly that the law would be upheld.
It is impossible to know how much of the gossip sprang from actual information. Several dozen people -- the justices, their clerks, other members of the court staff -- did indeed know the outcome in advance. Although they have a record of discretion exceeding even that of some parts of the national security apparatus, they are human. They have friends and relatives, and they have emotions.
With the rumors swirling, I began to check the odds at Intrade, the online prediction market where people can bet on real-world events, several times a day. The odds had barely budged. They continued to show about a 75 percent chance that the law's so-called mandate would be ruled unconstitutional, right up until the morning it was ruled constitutional. 
The market -- the wisdom of crowds -- turned out to be wrong.
I have since come to think of the court's ruling as the signature example of the counterattack of the insiders. After the better part of a decade in which various markets, from Intrade to the stock market, became many people's preferred way to peer into the future, a backlash is clearly under way. Not so long ago, knowing about the existence of Intrade was a mark of being in the vanguard. Today, mocking Intrade, ideally on Twitter, is a sign of sophistication.
This development matters because predictions matter. They allow government officials, corporate executives and citizens to plan for the future. They are an unavoidable part of life.
The rise of prediction markets started in the middle of the last decade, brought about by a combination of politics, psychology and technology. The politics came mostly from the aftermath of the Iraq war, when the collective, pro-invasion opinion of Washington experts came to look tragically wrongheaded. The psychology came from a barrage of research, often called behavioral economics, that created a science of human foibles. People were systematically too confident, the research found. They put too much weight on information they liked and too little on data that contradicted their assumptions.
The only good alternative to a few flawed opinions, some researchers argued, was a vast number of flawed opinions. The biases often canceled one another out. The legitimate information rose to the surface. It was the wisdom of crowds, as the writer James Surowiecki called his 2004 book.
The Internet made collecting the wisdom of crowds vastly easier than before. Intrade, Betfair and other British and Irish betting sites became the public face of prediction markets. Google and other companies started their own internal prediction markets to help them make decisions about where to invest. The Pentagon planned one, to track threats, before deciding it did not like the image of American officials making bets about war and famine.
The early successes of prediction markets were notable. To take a small personal example, my wife and I, not exactly frequent moviegoers, twice won money in a large Oscars pool simply by hewing to the British odds. Much more significantly, Intrade was a more reliable guide to the 2006 midterm election than cable networks. On election night, its odds showed that the Democrats had become the favorites to retake the Senate, while television commentators were still telling viewers it was unlikely.
But the crowd was not everywhere wise. For one thing, many of the betting pools on Intrade and Betfair attract relatively few traders, in part because using them legally is cumbersome. (No, I do not know from experience.) The thinness of these markets can cause them to adjust too slowly to new information.
And there is this: If the circle of people who possess information is small enough -- as with the selection of a vice president or pope or, arguably, a decision by the Supreme Court -- the crowds may not have much wisdom to impart. ''There is a class of markets that I think are basically pointless,'' says Justin Wolfers, an economist whose research on prediction markets, much of it with Eric Zitzewitz of Dartmouth, has made him mostly a fan of them. ''There is no widely available public information.''
These flaws have become fodder for the markets' critics. On the day of the health care ruling, the widely read financial writers Barry Ritholtz, Felix Salmon and David Wessel all took to Twitter to point out that Intrade looked bad. Tony Fratto, a former aide to President George W. Bush, noted his ''real glee'' that ''Intrade was wrong, again.''
But such schadenfreude raises a question: once you accept that prediction markets are flawed, do you turn back to the inside experts?
ALAS, the experts' overall record remains as poor as the behavioral economists maintained -- and often worse than the markets' record. Mutual fund managers, as a class, lose their clients' money because they do not outperform the market and charge fees for their mediocrity. Sports pundits have a dismal record of predicting games relative to the Las Vegas odds, which are just another market price. As imperfect as prediction markets are in forecasting elections, they have at least as good a recent record as polls. Or consider the housing bubble: both the market and most experts missed it.
The answer, I think, is to take the best of what both experts and markets have to offer, realizing that the combination of the two offers a better window onto the future than either alone. Markets are at their best when they can synthesize large amounts of disparate information, as on an election night. Experts are most useful when a system exists to identify the most truly knowledgeable -- a system that often resembles a market.
Sometimes, this approach involves a wisdom-of-crowds approach to experts. My colleague Nate Silver, whose book on prediction comes out later this year, has found that a simple average of well-known economic forecasts is substantially more accurate than individual forecasts. Other times, the approach might involve as much art as science -- and, again, the Internet allows for strategies that once would have been impossible.
Think for a moment about what a Twitter feed is: it's a personalized market of experts (and friends), in which you can build your own focus group and listen to its collective analysis about the past, present and future. An RSS feed, in which you choose blogs to read, works similarly. You make decisions about which experts are worthy of your attention, based both on your own judgments about them and on other experts' judgments.
Their predictions now face a market discipline that did not always exist before the Internet came along. ''Experts exist,'' as Mr. Wolfers says, ''but they're not necessarily the same as the guys on TV.''
After several years in which the market was often celebrated as a crystal ball, the Supreme Court ruling was a useful corrective. The prediction-market revolution, like so many others, initially promised more than it could deliver. But it's not as if the old order was working particularly well.

HEADLINE: Another Spring, Another Fall Back

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
PEAKS in the stock market have become a sign of spring, just like robins and daffodils. For the third year in a row, the second quarter provided the start of a swift and nerve-racking plunge.
If the pattern in prices seemed familiar, so did the economic and political backdrop: debt and politics in the United States and Europe sowed doubt among consumers, businesses and mutual fund investors.
The prospect that Greece would renege on an austerity pledge, the condition for a huge international aid program, roused fear that the euro zone would fragment. A coalition in favor of keeping the euro triumphed in the Greek election late in the quarter, but doubts about the currency's future remain.
Elections are four months away in the United States, but a grim possibility weighed heavily on the markets: that unless there is political cooperation in Washington, the economy is headed off a fiscal cliff. Yet another concern was that strength was being sapped from emerging economies, especially China. 
With so many worries in so many places, the American economy suffered a marked loss of momentum. As job creation slowed and claims for unemployment benefits rose, unemployment edged up in May -- and it remained at 8.2 percent in June. Michael Spangler, president of the Nationwide Investment Management Group, attributed the sluggishness partly to attitudes in the boardroom matching those in the living room.
''Corporate earnings and balance sheets are stronger than they've ever been,'' Mr. Spangler said, ''but corporations are acting very much like individuals: very risk-averse and short term in their thinking.''
The risk fear among individuals was evident in weaker readings of retail sales and consumer confidence. On the sparsely populated bright side, the housing market showed signs of life seldom seen in the last seven years.
The preponderance of gloomy developments sent the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down 10 percent in the quarter before it rebounded to narrow the three-month loss to 3.3 percent. In another sign of doubt about the global economy, the 10-year Treasury note yield fell as low as 1.44 percent, a record low.
Strategists and fund managers differ on how much of the world's woes are reflected in stock and bond prices, but there is little dispute that the trouble will continue into 2013. Still, they report a wary optimism toward stocks. Conditions have been so difficult for so long, they say, that investors are becoming used to it, as if they're bringing a chronic illness under control and beginning to thrive in spite of it. In this view, sick is the new healthy.
''The markets are basically saying, 'I'm not scared,' '' said Jonathan Golub, chief United States equity strategist at UBS. Investors have come to understand that ''we're going to have a meaningfully prolonged period of discomfort associated with macroeconomic events,'' he said, ''with lower-than-normal returns and 10 percent moves up and down.''
After recouping most of one of those down moves, the average domestic equity fund in the database of Morningstar lost 4.2 percent in the quarter. International stock funds fared worse, falling 6.1 percent, dragged down by funds focused on Europe and emerging markets. Bond funds remained a haven, rising 1.3 percent, led by portfolios of American government issues.
James T. Swanson, chief investment strategist at MFS Investment Management, contends that there is less for investors to fear in the United States than in other places. Unit labor costs -- the cost to produce each dollar's worth of goods -- have declined for American manufacturers in the last decade, while they have risen almost everywhere else, especially in Europe, he said. As a result, he said, the United States is unusual among developed countries for having net economic growth since before the 2008 Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.
Lower labor costs have allowed the United States to create more growth and to have more momentum than other countries, Mr. Swanson said. ''You want to bet that U.S. companies, when we come out of this slow patch, will show profit resilience?'' he asked. ''They have already shown amazing resilience. Something's going on here.''
ANOTHER reason for American stocks' relative strength is that sources of danger like the federal deficit and Europe's indebtedness have been so well flagged for so long that the shock value has eroded, said William Riegel, head of global equities at TIAA-CREF.
''One thing to remember is that a lot of uncertainties are already known, so the risk-reward balance is quite good from an equity market perspective,'' Mr. Riegel said. ''I'm not saying there's not risk, but the focus and fear of a breakup'' of the euro zone ''have driven valuations down dramatically. The probability is that it will hold together.''
Still, when it comes to year-end fiscal issues in the United States, there are many possible outcomes. Taxation and government spending could vary greatly, depending on who wins the White House and Congress in November, Mr. Golub said. Weaker economic growth between now and then could reduce tax receipts and raise government spending, forcing new debate about the debt ceiling and related issues between the November election and early January, when the new Congress takes over.
And the problems confronting emerging economies may also be more intricate than many people realize, said Elizabeth Morrissey, managing partner at Kleiman International Consultants, a Washington firm specializing in developing markets. Their stocks and bonds have suffered from fear that a global recession, with its focal point in Europe, will curtail the exports on which many emerging economies depend. Weakness among European banks is a threat, too.
''Across the emerging-market universe, they're worried that European banks are not going to roll over loans anymore, they're going to take the money home,'' she said. ''Emerging economies are going to suffer as badly as Western Europe.''
Ms. Morrissey added that each of the BRIC nations -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- ''is having its own domestic slowdown not necessarily attributed to global risk'' aversion. Europe accounts for particularly large proportions of exports from Brazil and Russia. As for the other BRICs, India has disappointed Western investors who say it hasn't delivered economic reform, while China is cooling down from a spending boom that left it with immense excesses of real estate and infrastructure projects.
But Ms. Morrissey said smaller markets ''have held up amazingly well, despite the potential contagion.''
''If you're a long-term investor,'' she observed, ''some of these markets look like fabulous bets.''
But with fear of risk widespread and global growth iffy, she finds emerging-market debt denominated in hard currencies like dollars or euros more fabulous than equity. She said she most favors Mexico, which she said had been hurt by falling oil prices and concerns ahead of recent elections.
Funds that hold bonds issued in the developing world rose 0.3 percent in the second quarter, according to Morningstar, while stock funds there were down 8 percent.
MR. SPANGLER, at Nationwide, also advocates middling levels of risk. He recommends shares of ''quality dividend-paying companies,'' as well as tech stocks, which he expects to benefit when businesses start spending their hoards of cash, and commodity-related stocks as an inflation hedge.
Funds in those sectors had a tough second quarter. Natural-resource funds fell 10.8 percent, on average, while energy funds were off 8.6 percent and tech funds were down 8.2 percent. The few winners included health, up 2.2 percent; utilities, up 2.6 percent, and consumer staples, up 1.3 percent.
Mr. Swanson also favors tech stocks and high-quality dividend payers, adding that in China, a migration from rural to urban living is fueling demand for electronic devices. He also said that tech trades at a lower valuation than the broad market -- and with less volatility.
Mr. Riegel saw several types of investments that, in his view, could benefit from a revival in economic growth and investor sentiment and were reasonably priced, if not bargains. The mix includes Japanese exporters and European multinationals with non-European businesses. He finds companies in Spain and Italy particularly cheap.
''If you're a brave person, make your purchases and close your eyes,'' he advised. ''You could get very good returns.''
Mr. Riegel would avoid government bonds after the run they have had, as would Mr. Golub. It is not their high prices that bother Mr. Golub as much as their paltry return.
''If you want to put your money in a safe harbor, you need to be really scared or really rich,'' Mr. Golub said. ''Your chances of retiring on a 1.6 percent yield -- if you can do that, then God bless you. Ultimately equities are the only game in town for most people.''
He prefers energy and European multinationals, which are ''global in nature and just happen to be in Europe,'' he said. He finds the health sector particularly appealing.
Mr. Golub expects the S.& P. 500 to reach 1,475 this year, an 8.3 percent gain from the end of June. He alluded to another pattern in the market that could be playing out for a third consecutive year: a rally to fresh highs after springtime declines.
''Three months from now, the level of concern that investors have will be lower than today,'' Mr. Golub predicted. Despite evidence of ''tremendous risk in sovereign markets and Greece threatening the world order,'' he said, investors are saying, '' 'That's par for the course; I'm in.' Otherwise you're leaving after the collapse and getting in after the rebound.''

HEADLINE: Tiny Yields Pose Risks for Bond Funds

BYLINE: By CARLA FRIED

 BODY:
BOND funds thumped stock funds in their risk-off during the second quarter, but you'll be hard-pressed to find a bond fund manager in a celebratory mode.
The BlackRock Global Allocation fund provides a window into how professional managers are sizing up bonds today. The fund has the flexibility to invest in a mix of stocks and bonds, based on the investment team's assessment of relative values. Currently, the fund has just 27 percent riding on bonds, well below its neutral target of 40 percent.
''We don't think fixed-income instruments provide yield or price value at these levels. Period. Full stop,'' says Dennis Stattman, a senior portfolio manager of the fund. 
That's in large part a function of what has happened to Treasury rates. Growing concerns about economic slowdowns in the United States, Europe and China set off a flight-to-quality rally in Treasuries during the spring. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell from 2.25 percent in early April to a low of 1.47 percent on June 1. At the end of the quarter, the Treasury note had inched up to 1.65 percent. When yields decline, bond prices rise. Total return is a combination of earned interest and the bond-price change. In the second quarter, the average return for funds focused on long-term government bonds was 10.2 percent. That would be a solid return for two years, let alone a quarter.
While Treasuries may seem to be a haven, today's minuscule yields pack palpable risks for bond managers. Those low yields aren't even keeping pace with the 2 percent inflation rate. And when interest rates rise, Treasuries will be hit hard. The current yield payouts will provide scant cushion against the falling prices.
Bill Gross, manager of the huge Pimco Total Return bond fund, says it's becoming ''harder and harder'' to generate inflation-beating returns in a low-rate world, without exposing the fund to sharp price declines if rates rise.
''It's a delicate walk, like Mr. Wallenda on the wire over Niagara Falls,'' he said, referring to Nik Wallenda, who walked over the Niagara Gorge last month. ''You have to be very careful and keep your eyes on the wire.''
Despite the drop in yields, Mr. Gross says the fund is keeping about 35 percent of the portfolio invested in Treasuries -- in line with the benchmark Barclays aggregate bond index. The fund abandoned Treasuries for a while last year, but performance suffered. ''They are insurance,'' he said. ''That insurance has become more expensive now, but on a day when you need that insurance you're glad to have it.''
Other fund managers aren't so sold on Treasuries. The Dodge & Cox Income fund is investing only 3 percent of assets in them, said Dana Emery, a manager of the fund. ''We may underperform if Treasury yields fall even further, but given our long-term perspective, we just don't like the risk-reward,'' she said.
The Loomis Sayles Bond fund is designed to be a swashbuckler, less concerned about what might work in the short term and with a mandate that permits it to invest in just about any segment of the bond market. Currently the fund does not own Treasuries.
''We have positioned the portfolio to capture yield today and benefit from rising rates,'' said Kathleen Gaffney, co-manager of the fund. It doesn't see Treasuries as delivering on either score.
FOR the most part, managers seem to agree that it is best to limit a fund's duration, or sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The longer the duration, the more yield you get today, but with the trade-off of a bigger price decline if rates rise.
The Barclays aggregate bond index has an average effective duration of about five years. If rates were to rise one percentage point in a year, the price of the underlying bonds in the index would decline by 5 percent.
The Fidelity Total Bond fund has a duration of 4.5 years, but Ford O'Neil, its lead manager, says its Treasury stake is invested in longer-term issues maturing in more than 10 years, to wring out more yield. ''That's where the value is'' he says. That long-maturity Treasury stake -- about 30 percent of the portfolio -- is offset by short-term mortgage-backed securities, which comprise about 20 percent of the fund. The fund's yield as of June 30 was 2.5 percent.
For some fund managers, mortgage-backed securities have become the sector du jour. Those backed by federal agencies, including Fannie Mae, currently have yields 1.5 percentage points or so higher than Treasuries.
Mortgage-backed securities account for more than half of assets for Pimco Total Return, helping it register a 3 percent yield as of June 30. If the Federal Reserve were to step in with a third round of quantitative easing that focused on buying mortgage securities -- which would push prices up -- Mr. Gross says that would ''be the cherry on the sundae.''
High-yield corporate bonds, or junk bonds, have been a favorite yield generator, but some managers are cooling on the sector. Mr. O'Neil said Fidelity Total Bond had 12 percent invested in this bond segment, versus 18 percent three years ago.
The average yield of 7.4 percent for these issues is enticing, but if economic growth stalls, junk bonds could falter. Mr. Gross says he is waiting until we ''get an all-clear'' that another recession isn't lurking before he would move heavily into them.
Bob Persons, co-manager of the MFS Bond fund, says a sweet spot in corporate bonds are those that are rated one rung below investment grade but could soon be upgraded. Investment-grade bonds -- those rated AAA, AA, A and BBB -- typically yield 3 percent to 3.5 percent these days. Mr. Persons's favored segment, which comprises about 20 percent or so of the MFS fund, yields 5 percent to 5.5 percent.
''When the bond rating agencies catch up to us and upgrade a BB to investment grade,'' he says, ''it suddenly becomes the highest yielder in that universe, and funds that only buy investment-grade bonds get interested.'' He says that this typically drives prices higher, adding 1.5 to 2 percentage points of return.
Ms. Emery says the investment team at Dodge & Cox is finding compelling bond investments in the debt of money center banks like Bank of America and Citigroup. Before the financial crisis, the banking bond sector typically yielded 70 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, more than Treasuries. The sector now yields about 300 basis points more.
''Many companies are in much better financial shape but their bond spreads are still wide,'' she says. She notes that the higher yields also provide a fatter income cushion to mitigate price declines when rates begin to rise.
Ms. Gaffney, at the Loomis Sayles Bond fund, says European sovereign debt is ''getting pretty close'' to looking enticing. Meanwhile, her fund is investing in European utilities and telecommunications debt.
''There are companies we believe will be able to retain their investment-grade rating through the crisis, but right now they are trading at yields that are comparable to high-yield issues,'' she says. ''We see the risk-off environment as a buying opportunity.''

HEADLINE: Office Space for the Wandering Worker

BYLINE: By JOSHUA BRUSTEIN

 BODY:
APP Loosecubes
PLATFORM Web, with iPhone in development
PRICE Free
I wrote this column from the office of CleanEdison, a green energy consultancy on Fifth Avenue. The company has a spare room that it uses to store old office supplies, collect cardboard boxes and host members of a mobile work force. On Monday, when I visited, I worked quietly as three women had a meeting about their event-planning business and a Labrador retriever wandered in and out.
We all ended up at CleanEdison through Loosecubes, a start-up that matches people looking for a place to work for the day with businesses that have desk space to offer -- except for the dog, who apparently is always there. On Sunday night, I pulled up Loosecubes's mobile Web site, chose an office that had open space and booked myself a desk. With the confirmation, I was sent the name of the contact with whom I would check in when I got there. (The company is planning a full iPhone app.) 
Loosecubes has about 120 spaces in New York City, from a home office in Flushing to shared working spaces in the meatpacking district. About 70 percent of the available desks are full on any one day, the company said.
When Loosecubes started, companies could set a price for a spot in their office, but many companies quickly made it zero, because they found the service useful as a networking tool. All spaces are now free.
The current crop of technology start-ups is full of variations on this idea. People rent out their apartments on Airbnb, hire one another to do chores on Taskrabbit and bum rides around San Francisco on Sidecar. The trick is finding a way to balance the needs of people on both sides of the transactions, and to maintain the trust that keeps them going.
In the case of office space, the problem is that there are more willing guests than there are hosts. So on Wednesday, Loosecubes is going to change its model. Companies that host guests will gain access to the network of offices for their own employees. Loosecubes also plans to rent office spaces and then manage them as shared facilities.
People just looking for a place to lay their laptops can request an invitation, but those kinds of slots will be limited. Later this year, Loosecubes plans to start charging subscription fees.
''Our objective is not to leave people out; our objective is to balance the supply-demand economics of the community,'' said Campbell McKellar, the founder of Loosecubes.
But do not despair, freeloaders. If you sign up for the service before the changes go into effect, you will be grandfathered in.
I worked in two places, each with its own personality. First was REV, a shared working space in the lower level of Vitra on Ninth Avenue in the meatpacking district. There were free snacks, Mac computers and couches for meetings. Also, because Vitra is an upscale furniture store, the chairs at REV are really comfortable -- something I took for granted until my spine came under attack at CleanEdison. In each place, though, the basics were there: Wi-Fi, bathrooms and water. I even had a few minutes of friendly banter with my temporary colleagues.
Of course, people are mostly in these offices to work. When I first sat down at REV, I clearly projected the vibe of a guy getting ready to start a conversation. The man sitting nearest to me took one look and immediately put on his headphones.

BYLINE: By IHSAN TAYLOR

 BODY:
STATE OF WONDER, by Ann Patchett. (Harper Perennial, $15.99.) In Patchett's incisive novel, Marina Singh, a cloistered medical researcher at a pharmaceutical company in Minnesota, is sent deep into the Amazon basin to investigate the death of a friend and colleague. She's also tasked with completing her colleague's assignment: persuading a brilliant but despotic scientist, who is also Marina's former mentor, to yield up a potent (and potentially lucrative) fertility drug she has been developing.
RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT: How Outsized Ambition, Greed, and Corruption Created the Worst Financial Crisis of Our Time, by Gretchen Morgenson and Joshua Rosner. (St. Martin's Griffin, $15.99.) Morgenson, a Pulitzer-winning business reporter and columnist at The New York Times, and Rosner, a housing-finance expert, trace the beginnings of the collapse to the mid-1990s and the cozy connections among Washington, Wall Street and mortgage giants. 
MAINE, by J. Courtney Sullivan. (Vintage Contemporaries, $15.95.) Three generations of women take secrets and old wounds to their family's summer beach house in Sullivan's novel: Alice, the 83-year-old matriarch; her pregnant granddaughter, Maggie; Maggie's mother, Kathleen, the black sheep of the family; and Ann Marie, Alice's tightly wound daughter-in-law. Told from their rotating perspectives, the story ''sizzles as the tension between the women's love and anger toward one another tightens,'' Lily King wrote here.
THE END OF ANGER: A New Generation's Take on Race and Rage, by Ellis Cose. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $14.99.) Cose's 1993 book ''The Rage of a Privileged Class'' examined the simmering anger of America's black middle class in the post-civil-rights era. ''The End of Anger'' finds that the resentment that seemed a permanent part of the black experience in the 1980s and '90s has given way to a new optimism.
ORIENTATION: And Other Stories, by Daniel Orozco. (Faber & Faber, $13.) A sense of workplace alienation permeates the stories in this first collection. Orozco's bridge painters, warehouse crews and paralegal assistants have no control over their professional destinies, and life piles on with a series of banal indignities on the clock and crises off it.
CONSCIENCE: Two Soldiers, Two Pacifists, One Family -- A Test of Will and Faith in World War I, by Louisa Thomas. (Penguin, $16.) Thomas considers how questions of conscience guided America's thinking about war and dissent in this intimate history of her great-grandfather Norman Thomas, the Socialist leader and pacifist, and his three brothers (two were soldiers and one a conscientious objector).
COMPLETE POEMS, by C. P. Cavafy. Translated by Daniel Mendelsohn. (Knopf, $35.) With his distinctive tone -- wistfully elegiac but resolutely dry-eyed -- the Alexandrian Greek poet Constantine Cavafy (1863-1933) has captivated English-language poets from W. H. Auden to James Merrill to Louise Gluck. This elegant volume includes the first English translations of Cavafy's final ''unfinished'' poems.
IN SPITE OF MYSELF: A Memoir, by Christopher Plummer. (Vintage, $17.95.) The great actor's finely observed memoir is a dishy treat for anyone who loves the theater, or the vanished New York of the 1950s and '60s.

JONATHAN BRAND has vivid memories of the moment the engine hoist broke. In an instant, a 500-pound V-8, freshly extracted from the 1969 Ford Mustang he was restoring, fell and pinned him between the floor and wall of his parents' garage. Remarkably, he was not hurt.
The incident remained ever-present, though. A decade later, Mr. Brand, an artist and sculptor, reimagined the experience of rebuilding that Mustang by rendering a full-scale paper sculpture of the car, including a finely detailed replica of the 302-cubic-inch engine that could have killed him.
On view at the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Ridgefield, Conn., through Sept. 30, Mr. Brand's life-scale paper Mustang represents a part-time effort that stretched nearly two years. 
Working from photos and recollections of his own Mustang, he first made computer drawings of the car's individual parts using illustration and 3-D modeling programs, and then made printouts on a large-format inkjet printer. He cut, folded and glued the paper sheets together, building them up into larger components, which were finally joined into a finished work of art.
The process inspired Mr. Brand, 32, to title his sculpture ''One Piece at a Time'' after the 1976 Johnny Cash hit that tells of a Cadillac factory worker who sneaks enough parts out of the assembly plant over two decades to assemble a complete, if mismatched, car.
Completed in September 2011, Mr. Brand's piece is part of a larger series -- seven solo exhibitions and 12 artists' projects -- the Aldrich calls ''united states.'' Richard Klein, the museum's exhibitions director, said the artworks fall within a theme of objects that depict a diverse American experience, with the United States economy and manufacturing, and the nation's history, as subthemes.
''Jonathan's piece fit all three of those,'' Mr. Klein said of the artwork, adding that the Mustang was ''a piece of history, an iconic American car.''
Mr. Klein also praised the artist's vision and talent. ''We were looking for art that is visually compelling, and this certainly is,'' he said. ''It's a spectacular object.''
Mr. Brand said he did not make ''One Piece at a Time'' as a tribute to the Mustang, but rather as a way to preserve the experience of restoring his own car with his father. He grew up in a car-oriented family. His grandfather built assembly lines at auto plants. As a teenager, Mr. Brand helped restore another 1969 Mustang belonging to his father, as well as his mother's 1965 model.
He never finished the real Mustang, instead selling the just-painted car in 2003 to buy an engagement ring. For that reason, he did not make every piece for the paper car, which is displayed as a work in progress. There is no transmission, for example, and no suspension. ''I only made what we worked on in the original car,'' he said.
Born in Ontario, Mr. Brand earned a bachelor's degree in studio art from the University of Guelph in Ontario in 2003 and a master's in fine art from Yale in 2007. Now living in New Haven, he teaches 3-D art in Manhattan, as an adjunct professor at Pace University and at Parsons the New School for Design. His wife, Jaclyn Conley, also an artist, teaches at the University of Hartford.
The scale and subject of Mr. Brand's ''One Piece at a Time'' might, for some, recall ''Elvis,'' a sculpture by Richard Prince based on the body shell of a first-generation Chevrolet Camaro. ''When I first decided to do something with the car, a retrospective of Richard Prince's work was up at the Guggenheim,'' he said.
Mr. Brand, who said he did not consider himself a car enthusiast, added that his influences usually depend on the medium he's working in, citing Tom Sachs's large-scale dioramas and the work of Charles Ray, known in part for his 47-foot replica of a toy fire engine.
Mr. Brand began drawing the parts for ''One Piece at a Time'' in December 2009.
''I started with the tires, because I knew it would be challenging and would give me an idea whether or not the whole thing was possible,'' he said. It took him three months to draw, print, cut and assemble one tire, then one week each for the other three, as he was essentially duplicating the first. Mr. Brand drew each side of the car in a program called Rhino, which allowed him to set dimensions using a grid based on the Mustang's 108-inch wheelbase. He subdivided large parts into smaller sections to make them printable on 17-by-22-inch or 11-by-14-inch paper.
''I only had to draw half the car and then mirror it,'' he explained. ''The same goes for everything that is symmetrical or in multiples, like the valve covers.''
After a year of drawing, Mr. Brand spent $400 for a used Epson 4000 photo printer that sold new for $1,800. The printer came with a full set of ink cartridges, which, along with an extra black cartridge, proved just enough to complete the project.
Making the four tires used the 10 boxes of heavyweight paper the seller included; the hood required nine 17-by-22-inch sheets of paper. Each front fender took 12 sheets.
Output files from Rhino were imported into another program, Autodesk 3ds Max, for making the three-dimensional parts. The resulting 3-D computer files then went into a Japanese program called Pepakura, which ''unfolds'' 3-D objects along their edges to make flat, printable parts, and adds numbered tabs to the edges. Mr. Brand used Adobe Illustrator to adjust colors and print the final layouts.
He fastidiously folded and glued matching-number tabs to form individual body and mechanical parts. For each tire, 20,000 such numbers indicated 20,000 edges to be glued together.
When cutting out parts by hand proved too time-consuming, Mr. Brand bought a vinyl cutter. But because it was designed to leave a white edge around printed graphics on decals and stickers, Mr. Brand had to trick its laser eye to follow the lines of his parts by printing special crop marks on them. He also devised a way for the vinyl cutter to score both sides of parts, making it easier to fold them cleanly.
Clues to the construction process were intentionally left in plain sight, including dotted and dashed lines and the tiny numbers on the folding tabs, to make the process part of the viewable art. The white lines seen throughout the black interior are the cut and folded edges of each part.
The parts have no underlying framework for support; the heavy paper, like the sheet metal used in real cars, gains strength once it is pressed or folded into shape, Mr. Brand explained. Two foam-core ribs support the 50-pound car body for display.
Mr. Brand described his process as one of trial and error, an approach he considered integral to the art and his own enjoyment of it.
''Starting each part, I'd know what it was supposed to look like,'' he added, ''but I wouldn't know how I was going to get there,'' he said.
Parts did not always go together as planned. ''The thickness of paper, when folded, adds to an object's size. So, I'd have to make adjustments to drawings,'' he explained.
He challenged himself, too, producing even unseen details -- for instance, the holes where the carburetor bolts to the engine and the folding sun visors inside the car. The engine's custom valve covers, with their raised ribs and Ford logo, were more difficult to make than simple stamped covers would have been.
Mr. Brand said the spark plugs were the most intricate parts in the project. Using tweezers, he made four of the eight; each required 12 hours.
''I learned a lot about making objects while working on the real car,'' he said. ''You also learn patience working on an old car.''
Some Mustang buffs have politely pointed out inaccuracies in the sculpture, including an incorrect fitting on the engine's fuel pump, but Mr. Brand welcomes the scrutiny. ''I like that people look that closely.''
''One Piece at a Time'' is on display through Sept. 30 at the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, 258 Main Street, Ridgefield, Conn. Admission for adults is $7; college students $4. Free on Tuesdays. More information is at aldrichart.org.

HEADLINE: Message In A Bottle

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is a co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
It has been years since anyone said anything positive about the Greek economy. But as one Greek economist recently told me, there's a local saying that when a spring is pressed down hardest, it can spring back the fastest. Let's consider the country's natural resources, or at least two of them. Feta cheese, which is increasingly popular throughout the world, is mandated by an E.U. ruling to come from Greece. The country also harvests arguably the best olives for making olive oil. Yet somehow Greece has only 28 percent of the global feta market and a mere 4 percent share of the international olive-oil industry.
How is this possible? In the last decade or so, companies in the United States, France, Denmark and elsewhere flouted the feta ruling and invested in their own food-science research and manufacturing equipment. They subsequently turned the salty, crumbly cheese into spreadable, grillable, fat-free and shelf-stable forms. In Italy and Spain, small olive-oil producers merged into globally competitive conglomerates and replaced presses with more efficient centrifugal technology. The two countries now provide nearly all the world's supply. And the Greeks, despite their numerous inherent advantages, remain in the least profitable part of the supply chain, exporting raw materials at slim margins. 
Tassos Chronopoulos, owner of Tassos, a Greek food importer based outside Chicago, says that the country's disorganized agricultural business all but disqualified itself from partaking in the fancy-food craze of the past few decades. Greek growers never banded together to establish uniform quality standards and trade rules. (Chronopoulos often found bottles spiked with cheaper vegetable oil.) Frequent strikes at large ports damaged food and reputations. Until he found a reliable partner, Chronopoulos says that he constantly opened new shipments to see bottles with labels askew, wrinkled or missing. ''They do not understand,'' he says, ''that a label not applied properly will make the sales suffer.''
In a recent report on Greece's economy, the consulting firm McKinsey recasts these challenges, among others, as opportunities. With just a bit of investment, new management and quality control, it says, the olive and feta industries can increase their profitability significantly. The same is true for Greece's tourism industry, which, according to the report, remains stubbornly focused on budget travelers even though a yacht full of millionaires can bring a lot more revenue than a cruise ship of middle-class people.
Consulting firms are constantly issuing utopian national-economic strategies. What makes the McKinsey plan stand out is that it feels plausible. The greatest returns may come from investing in things the Greeks already know how to do -- no matter how distressed or unloved they have become. This could have a significant impact. Greece is a small country with 11 million people and 5 million workers. Reasonable success in a few sectors could create decent jobs and more tax revenue. Greece could start to grow again.
The biggest challenge to this plan involves confronting a more distressing aspect of the Greek economy. It's hard to believe now, but Greece outpaced the average European growth rate for much of the last 60 years. Its farmers turned bombed-out fields into modestly productive farms. The government rapidly shifted parts of the country from an agrarian economy into an industrial one that developed specialties in construction materials -- concrete, aluminum, rebar -- and generic drugs. Greece also benefited greatly from the rapid growth in global trade. Greece is now responsible for the largest shipping fleet in the world. No other nation besides Japan even comes close.
Yet Greece still joined the euro zone as the second-poorest country in Western Europe. That's because the Greek economic miracle came during some disastrous governance from both left-leaning leaders and an anticommunist dictatorship. As often happens with unstable governments, a winner-take-all system developed in which new officials and private-sector cronies tried to capture as much money as they could during their time in office. Nikos Ventouris, an economist at Greece's independent Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research, told me that during these postwar decades, the incentive structure went upside down. Business leaders learned that they could make a whole lot more money a lot more quickly through contracts with a ''friend'' in the government (who wasn't particular about things like skewed labels) than by trying to compete globally.
One of the most destructive developments, Ventouris says, came when Greece joined the European agricultural-subsidy system in 1981. Money from richer European taxpayers flowed to Greek farmers to upgrade their farms, ''but the Europeans and the Greek government had no control mechanism,'' he says. Instead of investing in new tractors, ''the farmers were taking the money and buying things like Mercedeses.'' Entrepreneurs who avoided the easy riches of government contracts or E.U. subsidies were often punished by Greece's nonsensical regulatory system. Megan Greene, of the research firm Roubini Global Economics, once famously recounted visiting a bookstore and cafe in Athens only to learn that it was not allowed to sell books after 6 p.m. or coffee -- ever. At the same time, those breakthroughs in olive-oil and feta technology were taking place everywhere but Greece.
Ventouris, whose boss was recently named Greece's new finance minister, also happened to advise McKinsey on its report. So I asked him if he thought the country might adopt any of its recommendations. He sighed and said that Greece was locked in a vicious cycle. After all, growth requires investing in the future, and investment requires faith in the political system. And right now, nobody has faith in anybody. Sales of olive oil and feta cheese and tourism packages might provide a short-term spark, but the McKinsey report is notably vague about who might be willing to provide the capital. ''It would be very useful if we had an inspiring leader,'' Ventouris says.
It's easy to mock the Greeks with their inefficient businesses, lifetime government jobs and absurd public-sector projects. But average citizens have been beleaguered for too long by forces beyond their control. They were occupied by three different countries in World War II. Afterward, Europe's richest countries subsidized Greek farmers. When Greece later joined the European Union, it was lent huge amounts of money. (As many Americans learned, debt-fueled spending can feel like hard-earned success, at least for a while.) Now Greece is again waiting for other Europeans -- especially the Germans -- to decide precisely how miserable their next decade will be. The problems are overwhelming, but it's somewhat satisfying to know that the solutions might be based on things the Greeks have long known how to do themselves, like processing olives and brining cheese.
GO, GREECE LIGHTNING
Greece's natural resources are profoundly underused. According to the pressed-spring theory, that may be good news for a recovery. Percentages are the products' share of total Greek exports.
2%: Fresh Fish
Exports of fresh fish, mainly to neighboring countries, have grown by double digits, but fish exports are still a meager piece of the country's export portfolio.
2%: Feta Cheese and Extra-Virgin Olive Oil
Rather than ship raw olives abroad, Greece could process and package the goods at home and sell them for a premium.
2.5%: Aluminum
A mainstay of Greece's export economy. The country has rich deposits of aluminum ore.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. Greece was once one of Europe's fastest-growing economies.
2. Seriously.
3. Now it can't compete.
4. Its best shot at a comeback may be grabbing more of the global Greek-food market.

HEADLINE: A Gallery Of Rogues To Root For

BYLINE: By TERRENCE RAFFERTY

 BODY:
AMONG the less widely celebrated but somehow cherished truths that Americans hold to be self-evident is this: There's a sucker born every minute. It is perhaps significant that those stirring words have long been attributed to a man in the entertainment industry, which has a history of treating its target audience as, well, targets.
Most of the people who attended P. T. Barnum's 19th-century traveling circus extravaganzas didn't mind being suckered a little, if the show was good; their credulity was part of the contract they entered into when they bought their tickets. We were, as a nation, rather partial to flimflam and fraudulence, and clearly we still are, if the amount of entertainment we now consume is any indication. 
None of that actually explains why there are at this moment so many shows about con artists on television. (It was just a spiel to get you into the tent.) Right now ''Suits,'' on USA, is in midseason, and that network's ''White Collar'' begins its fourth season Tuesday; TNT's ''Leverage,'' the most elderly of these series, cranks up again next Sunday. That's a lot of deceit every week. It helps fill the void left by ''Revenge'' and ''The Borgias'' anyway.
''Leverage'' began in late 2008, not long after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the beginning of the global financial crisis, and because it was about conning corporate greedheads out of their ill-gotten gains, the show seemed eerily timely. The hero, Nate Ford (Timothy Hutton), is a career insurance investigator who turns to crime after the death of his young son; the company he worked for wouldn't pay for the treatments that could have saved the boy's life.
So Nate gathers a gang of crooks -- in his line of work he has made the acquaintance of quite a few -- and gets to work hatching elaborate ''Mission: Impossible''-like schemes to take down at least a few of the piggier honchos: the plots require a lot of effort and ingenuity, because marks like these tend to be awfully well protected.
His crew consists of an actress named -- perhaps -- Sophie (Gina Bellman), who is terrible onstage but Meryl Streep when she's working a con; a cocky computer geek named Hardison (Aldis Hodge); a near-sociopathic thief named Parker (Beth Riesgraf), who spends a fair amount of time crawling through air-conditioning ducts and rappelling down skyscrapers; and an ex-soldier, Eliot (Christian Kane), who beats people up.
They're good company. Nate and his merry men and women turn over a hefty share of their take to the victims of the evil businessmen, which is gratifying, in a post-2008 sort of way. But the week-to-week satisfactions of ''Leverage'' have less to do with social justice than with aesthetic justice, the beautiful machinery of the con games themselves.
That's a difficult standard to meet consistently, and although the series's creators, John Rogers and Chris Downey, have managed it more often than not over 40-some episodes, ''Leverage'' is starting to show signs of fatigue in its fifth season. The banter is a little more forced, the cons a shade less intricate. The Ford gang still steals from the rich and gives to the poor, but there's a danger when criminals become too virtuous: neither they nor the actors playing them get to have quite as much fun. Crime is, after all, about joy.
That was, at least, always the idea of the gentleman thief, the popular literary type that broke into the public imagination in the late 19th century and never left. The best exemplar of the species is probably E. W. Hornung's Raffles, who was educated at the best schools, plays cricket for England, moves among the upper classes and discreetly purloins their jewels.
This appealing creature may not exist in nature, or even in England, but he's not hard to find in pop culture. Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer), the charming hero of ''White Collar,'' is an outstanding specimen: a Raffles who has, in the spirit of the early 21st century, diversified his larceny. He is, as another character says, ''quite the Renaissance criminal'' -- a thief, of course, but also a gifted con artist and an expert forger of art, rare documents and other items of negotiable value.
When the series began three years ago, Neal had been forcibly retired, to prison, and then given an odd sort of work release: Peter Burke (Tim DeKay), an agent in the white-collar-crime division of the F.B.I., enlists him to help catch some of his slipperier suspects. Neal, for his own reasons, complies, and goes semistraight, using his arcane skills and exquisite sense of gamesmanship to thwart cons perpetrated by people who are, in many cases, just like him. He often consults, on the sly, with another of his kind, a smart thief named Mozzie (Willie Garson). A tracking anklet keeps Neal from straying far physically, but he remains unfettered mentally. He still thinks like a crook, which is just what Peter wants. Up to a point.
The show, which was created by Jeff Eastin, is less about confidence schemes than about the minds of the schemers. It treats Neal as an artist of crime and one whose art has the power to transform the worldviews of his audience -- to seduce it into seeing things as he does. Little by little Peter, a classic straight arrow (Mozzie calls him ''Suit''), comes to appreciate the pleasures of deviousness. He goes semicrooked, and his guilty joy is something to behold.
''White Collar'' is all about the aesthetics of duplicity: a con-man show for connoisseurs. ''Suits,'' now in its second season, isn't like that at all, but its hero is a fraud, which counts for something. The setup here is that Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams), an amiable young stoner who happens to have an photographic memory, is working as an associate at a top corporate law firm without the benefit of any actual legal education, much less the Harvard law degree he claims to have. His mentor, a sleek, arrogant litigator named Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht), knows his secret, and they conspire to keep the rest of the firm in the dark.
The series, created by Aaron Korsh, is a witty exploration of a new, weirdly pervasive kind of fraudulence, based on a more contemporary, and more American, model than Robin Hood or Raffles: the principle expressed by the inspired phrase, ''Fake it till you make it,'' which may one day take a place of honor beside ''There's a sucker born every minute'' in our national consciousness. These days there's a con artist born every minute too.

HEADLINE: New Frontier For Tourists: Your Home

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
Every time I see a tourist in New York City in July, I am taken with an urge to hand them a travel brochure for somewhere else. ''Summer in Helsinki is supposed to be just great,'' I might say, to anyone who does not appear to be from Finland. As I write this, it is 94 degrees in New York; it is 63 degrees in Helsinki. And yet despite the significant climatic advantages of many, many other places, the number of visitors coming to the city each summer exceeds the permanent population by more than a quarter.
Growth in tourism has been one of the Bloomberg administration's undeniable successes. Five years ago, the mayor introduced the city's first global advertising campaign, with the hope of bringing 50 million spendthrift visitors a year to New York City by 2015. That number was surpassed last year, with Brazilians, for example -- one of the targets of the city's travel promoters -- now coming in enormous numbers. 
As more and more hotels have been erected, the nicer ones have tried to distinguish themselves from the generic Starwood model. In March, the Out NYC opened in Hell's Kitchen to cater to gay tourists. The new Wythe Hotel in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in a building built as a cooperage in 1901, offers rooms with bunk beds -- for bands or, presumably, multiple sets of twins. By the end of 2014, the city will lay claim to 36,000 more hotel rooms than it did in the middle of the past decade. There are new hotels now in boroughs Scandinavians have never heard of.
And yet to some the very idea of a hotel feels fraudulent. Paradoxically, the rise in tourism has been accompanied by a growing global aversion to identify as a tourist.
Recent years have witnessed the blossoming of what the travel industry calls ''immersion'' or ''experiential travel.'' A movement that implicitly shuns sightseeing as bourgeois pillage, experiential travel is meant to sink you deep into whatever world you're visiting, pushing a vacation toward anthropology.
The experiential traveler does not arrive at Kennedy Airport and immediately go shopping on upper Madison Avenue. She takes a drawing class; she rides the Lexington Avenue line at rush hour; she embeds, and presumably returns to Brussels or Seattle with an impressively nuanced understanding of the differences in commercial enterprise between Fifth Avenue and Broadway in the 20s.
The interest in this kind of travel is, in part, what led to the opening here a few weeks ago of a potentially popular service called One Fine Stay. Having originated in London in 2010, it is a kind of virtual hotel service that situates guests in well-appointed houses and apartments when their regular occupants are elsewhere. (Last year New York State passed legislation aimed at dismantling illegal hotels and certain short-term rentals managed as investments, but you are not breaking the law if you rent out a place you actually live in, with some restrictions.)
Craigslist and various other online services that match renters and homeowners with those looking for accommodation offer this kind of shelter voyeurism, too, but those require patience, luck and a trusting heart, while One Fine Stay requires only money. It serves as the middleman, ensuring that the place you plan to stay in actually exists and is as described, and that the owner's Riedel wine glasses will be replaced if they're broken.
The company seems to realize that people do not want to immerse themselves in another family's lifestyle to the degree that they use that family's towels. So high-end linens and bath products are provided in every space; so too is a locally functioning iPhone filled with the homeowner's restaurant suggestions. To greet the arrival of an Australian family at a four-bedroom town house that was offered for $900 a night on Washington Street in the West Village, minions for the company stocked the fridge with organic milk, chicken, corn and other groceries the guests had requested.
What precisely was the authentic New York experience the Australians were about to receive? Arguably, the experience you get when you pay to stay at a stranger's West Village town house, or TriBeCa loft, is the reality of affluence as it is lived here, which is to say that even the affluent feel they can make use of an extra buck.
Most of the year, a lawyer, his stay-at-home wife and three children live in the Washington Street house, a dwelling that was at once enviable and comfortingly imperfect, the furniture in some instances too big for the scale of the rooms, the kitchen perhaps six months away from feeling passe. The family was in the country, but the economics of the arrangement compelled one to wonder: Could they really afford to be wherever they were?
And what of the couple who planned to rent out their Fort Greene duplex, with its lush garden and distressed leathers and ethnic-travel mementos? Who were they, and why didn't they have a television?
Of course, this line of thinking submerges you perfectly within the mind-set of a certain kind of New Yorker, for whom there are few questions worth greater consideration than how the guy across the street managed to buy a five-story brownstone when he doesn't seem to leave for work before noon. This may be where One Fine Stay truly succeeds as immersion travel: it provides users with the opportunity to simultaneously covet and judge, to lust after the 12-foot ceilings and denounce the granite. If only it provided you with the owner's tax returns.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 15, 2012

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Big City column last Sunday about visitors to New York City who stay in houses and apartments while the regular occupants are elsewhere referred imprecisely to a 2011 state law aimed at dismantling illegal hotels and certain short-term rentals. While occupants can legally rent out their residences, there are some restrictions; it is not the case that ''you are not breaking the law if you rent out a place you actually live in.''

HEADLINE: Watching Behavior Before Writing The Rules

BYLINE: By RICHARD H. THALER. 
Richard H. Thaler is a professor of economics and behavioral science at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago.

 BODY:
AS a general rule, the United States government is run by lawyers who occasionally take advice from economists. Others interested in helping the lawyers out need not apply.
Of course, there are some exceptions. The government employs scientists of many varieties in technical capacities, from estimating the environmental toxicity of a chemical to the structural soundness of a bridge. But when it comes to forming policies, these scientists and, especially, behavioral scientists are rarely at the table with the lawyers and the economists.
Economists teach us that monopolies are harmful, and this is no exception. Are they really the only social scientists with anything useful to contribute to the efficient running of a government? Imagine that along with the Council of Economic Advisers, a Council of Behavioral Scientist Advisers also provided counsel to the president. What might emerge from such a group?
Thanks to an initiative of the British government, we have some evidence about the benefits that might emerge. Shortly after his center-right coalition took office nearly two years ago, David Cameron, Britain's Conservative prime minister, established a tiny branch of government called the Behavioral Insights Team. It is led by David Halpern, a social psychologist who has a deep understanding of the workings of government, having previously served in the Labor government of Tony Blair. 
Dr. Halpern has a staff of eight civil servants, in addition to a few visiting doctoral students on short-term leave from their universities. The team also has a group of unpaid academic advisers, including me -- showing that economists will elbow their way into any activity. As I have been involved with this effort from the beginning, and because I am an economist who also teaches behavioral science -- I am not an unbiased source. But having recently returned from a week in London working with the Behavioral Insights Team, I am in a good position to report on some of its progress.
During these team visits -- this was my fourth -- I make the rounds from one branch of government to another, accompanied by someone from the team. We usually meet with a minister and some senior staff members. (Although the team has delved into many policy areas, it has not become involved in macroeconomic policy or foreign affairs.)
In these meetings, I have found myself proposing two guidelines so often that they have come to be known as team mantras:
If you want to encourage some activity, make it easy.
You can't make evidence-based policy decisions without evidence.
The first mantra has guided many of our most successful interventions. The second has made one of the team's explicit missions to conduct randomized controlled trials for the initiatives we suggest, whenever possible. Indeed, the team has recently released a white paper, called ''Test, Learn, Adapt,'' extolling the use of such trials in government policy-making.
One early success story involves an attempt to collect taxes from people who fail to pay on time. Most British citizens pay their taxes promptly because it is a simple tax system with few deductions, so that most taxes are collected via payroll withholding. (That's ''make it easy'' in action.) But small-business owners and individuals with significant nonpayroll income are expected to save up the money to write a check to the government, and some of them fail to pay on time.
In such cases, the government's first step is to send a letter asking for payment within six weeks, after which sterner, more expensive measures are taken. The tax collection authority wondered whether this letter might be improved. Indeed, it could.
The winning recipe comes from Robert B. Cialdini, an emeritus professor of psychology and marketing at Arizona State University, and author of the book ''Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion.''
People are more likely to comply with a social norm if they know that most other people comply, Mr. Cialdini has found. (Seeing other dog owners carrying plastic bags encourages others to do so as well.) This insight suggests that adding a statement to the letter that a vast majority of taxpayers pay their taxes on time could encourage others to comply. Studies showed that it would be even better to cite local data, too.
Letters using various messages were sent to 140,000 taxpayers in a randomized trial. As the theory predicted, referring to the social norm of a particular area (perhaps, ''9 out of 10 people in Exeter pay their taxes on time'') gave the best results: a 15-percentage-point increase in the number of people who paid before the six-week deadline, compared with results from the old-style letter, which was used as a control condition.
The tax authorities estimate that this initiative, if rolled out across the country, could generate $:30 million of extra revenue annually. And note that sending an effective letter doesn't cost any more than sending a bad one. Did I mention that the entire budget for the team is less than $:1 million?
In some domains, team members have different intuitions about what will work best, so randomized trials can be used to determine which interventions are most successful -- and also to decide who has to buy the first round of drinks at the pub.
One example was an effort to encourage homeowners to utilize a government program that offers subsidies for installing better insulation in their attics, locally known as lofts. An experiment tested the existing standard offer against either a group discount offer (you get this deal if enough of your neighbors also sign up) and an attic cleanup program provided at the supplier's cost.
In the cleanup program, someone would come to a home to remove everything from the attic, allowing the insulation to be installed; help the homeowner sort through which stuff to keep, discard or donate to charity; and then put the good stuff back in the attic when the job was over. This ''make it easy'' promotion turned out to be the big winner, and it is now being used more widely.
The government is sufficiently convinced of the value of these activities that it announced last week that behavioral science is to be included in the required curriculum for civil servants.
CLEARLY, initiatives like all of these will allow the team to pay for itself many times over. But the most lasting impact will probably be that policy makers will consider randomized trials as a way to discover what works.
Such experimentation is rare in government policy, where neither legislators nor bureaucrats are eager to acknowledge that they don't already know the best way of doing things. Yes, here in the United States we sometimes let states try a variety of approaches to policies for health care and education, for example, but differences among states can make comparisons difficult. And people choose where they live -- rather than being assigned to states at random as in a proper experimental design.
Other countries, including our own, should take note. In these difficult times, increasing tax revenue without raising rates is a trick worth learning.

HEADLINE: Creating His Own Gravity

BYLINE: By JON CARAMANICA

 BODY:
Los Angeles
ON a recent Saturday morning here Frank Ocean was up early, well rested and ready to walk Everest, his Bernese mountain dog, through the up-and-down streets near the modest and modern home he's been renting near the foot of the Hollywood Hills.
For five and a half years he's lived in this city, since he drove west from New Orleans with $1,200 in his pocket, spending $400 on the way for gas. In that time he's become an in-demand songwriter and now a rising star in his own right. With that success has come a roller coaster of love and letdown, and that is why, he said, it's now time to go. Maybe to New York, or more likely to Toronto, which is more car friendly -- outside the house were parked two BMWs, one red and newish and one silver and oldish -- and which Mr. Ocean has fallen for based on Google searches, even though he's never been there. 
''When I think about the term 'running away,' probably it's not the right one,'' Mr. Ocean said as Everest was sniffing at some greenery. ''It's more I decided to do something different, so that I might have a different outlook.'' He added, ''When they're emotional things you can't run away from them anyway.''
It's certainly tougher to do so when they've been etched into song. ''Channel Orange'' (Island Def Jam), his beautiful first full-length studio album, will be released this month, and it's rife with the sting of unrequited love, both on the receiving and inflicting ends. Mr. Ocean, 24, is an extremely unflashy songwriter, avoiding big proclamations and broad brush strokes, instead leaning on conversational gambits and the power of detail. He makes warm, cloudy soul with echoes of Stevie Wonder, Prince and Pharrell Williams that's almost never about seduction. In Mr. Ocean's universe, pretty much everyone is broken beyond repair. While clearly part of a robust historical lineage Mr. Ocean is also at the forefront of a larger push-back against the stasis in contemporary R&B, something in evidence in his organic vamps but also in the Weeknd's narcotized lust and even mainstream dance music hybrids. And Mr. Ocean's dissents are starting to have wider effect. He's written for Beyonce and has collaborated with Jay-Z and Kanye West.
Back in the house he slid into the bench behind the huge slab of wood that serves as the dining room table, while Everest lolled outside in the patio area. His ''gloriously painful love life,'' as he described it, has left its mark on his songwriting, particularly as he's made the shift from writing for others to writing for himself. Two particular relationships haunt this album: one in which he was in control, one in which he wasn't.
''I'm getting away from both,'' he said, using his hands to gesture at two imagined people in front of him, explaining his circumstance to the one he's disappointed: ''You'll say anything to keep me around. I'll say anything to keep this one around.''
Finding a way to detach, he admitted, is part self-preservation, part strategy, but he knows it's better for him to make a clean break. He's tried going cold turkey before. A few months ago on his Tumblr he started a countdown: ''Day 1,'' ''Day 2.'' At ''Day 7,'' he added ''It gets easier.''
''Zero contact -- that's what that was,'' he said. After ''Day 8'' the trail went dry.
''I've given three and a half years of my life to that situation and situations like it,'' he said. On Tuesday night, Mr. Ocean took to his Tumblr to tell the story of his first love, which was with a man. ''I don't have any secrets I need kept any more,'' he wrote. (That was too late to include in the print version of this article, which will appear in the Arts & Leisure section on Sunday.)
''I've written some great things,'' he added. ''That's a gift, but there's consequences. Yeah, you get this great work, but you suffer. You really, really suffer.''
That's absolutely clear from ''Channel Orange,'' which is filled with lovers who tantalize but remain at arm's length. On ''Pyramids,'' a long, astral trip of shimmery funk, he laments a woman who gets dressed up for her job at a strip club while the protagonist agonizes at home, unemployed:
I'll watch you fix your hair
Then put your panties on
In the mirror
Cleopatra
Then your lipstick
Cleopatra
Then your six-inch heels
Cleopatra
She's headed to the Pyramid
She's working at the Pyramid tonight
On both ''Sweet Life'' and ''Super Rich Kids'' the well-off are presented as both alluring and dangerous. On ''Pilot Jones'' it's drugs that create an impregnable wall: ''Tonight you came stumbling across my lawn again/I just don't know why/I keep on trying to keep a grown woman sober.''
When he was young, Mr. Ocean, born Christopher Breaux, would accompany his grandfather to 12-step meetings, where, he said, his grandfather, who had struggled with alcohol, heroin and crack, served as a mentor for other addicts.
''It totally ingrained this fear of addiction and of anything that could cause me to be addicted,'' he said -- love included.
Mr. Ocean comes from a big family; his mother still lives in New Orleans, and his grandfather took on the role of father figure after Mr. Ocean's own father disappeared when he was 6. He took to singing and songwriting at a young age, paying for his first studio sessions with money he earned washing cars. His mother wasn't thrilled, at least in part because his father was ''a keyboardist and vocalist that never popped off,'' he recalled.
When he was a teenager, Mr. Ocean began to find ways to hide in plain sight. After being booted from a small private school for fighting, among other things, he transferred to a big public high school. ''I remember getting there,'' he said, ''and being so happy to be there 'cause I could disappear.''
That began a theme. Plenty of times things come out in songs that he hasn't been able to articulate to the people in his life, he said. ''I wouldn't do it all if there wasn't that catharsis,'' he said of songwriting. ''It's definitely an extension of my talk therapy.'' Mr. Ocean isn't quite a stoic, but he moves with a reserve that keeps people at a distance until he feels comfortable, at which point his arms open wide. ''I'm extremely compassionate, loving, all of those warm fuzzy things, but the outer shell doesn't project that all the time,'' he said.
In Odd Future, the Los Angeles hip-hop collective, he plays the role of big brother. ''He's what I imagine Rick Rubin's like, all-wise,'' said Earl Sweatshirt, who, after returning from Samoa earlier this year, became close with Mr. Ocean. ''He's the voice of reason.''
As a young songwriter Mr. Ocean was profligate, writing for and with a variety of artists, hoping to establish himself. Songs he wrote were recorded by Brandy and Justin Bieber, among others. ''I had to change my circumstance,'' he said of the urgency that gripped that part of his life. ''The artist in me hates to say that now, but it was about money, it was about access, it was about nice things.''
Songs from this era were collected in ''The Lonny Breaux Collection,'' an easy-to-find samizdat zip file put together by fans online, the existence of which still makes Mr. Ocean wince a bit. (Many of the songs are reference vocals Mr. Ocean wrote for other singers, and most are unfinished.)
Last year, after languishing on Def Jam, to which he had been signed for some time, he released ''Nostalgia, Ultra,'' a sumptuous mixtape full of left-field soul, interpolations of notable rock songs and deeply mature songwriting. Aided by his affiliation with Odd Future, it arrived with impact; ''Novacane,'' a song from that album, even landed in the Billboard Hot 100.
Soon Mr. Ocean was wanted on his own terms. He contributed two hooks to ''Watch the Throne''(Roc-A-Fella/Def Jam/Roc Nation), last year's collaborative album by Jay-Z and Kanye West, and was invited to work with Beyonce in the studio for a week, resulting in ''I Miss You,'' which appeared on her latest album, ''4'' (Columbia).
''She came in and heard the song, and she shed a tear and recorded it,'' he recalled, ''and I wanted to shed a tear.''
There was also a collaboration with Nas, ''No Such Thing as White Jesus,'' that was unfortunately lost to a technological mishap. Mr. Ocean expressed regret that album deadlines prevented him from recreating the song from scratch, and he broke into song to capture what was lost:
Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead
Young queen, cross your legs,
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
'Cause even diamond chains are for slaves,
Don't set foot in no penitentiary
And don't taste the poison
Don't you bail on your families
It's signature Frank Ocean: dignified, quasi-political, cerebral without being disdainful, fleetingly hopeful. If that bears little resemblance to the center of what's happening on the radio -- the same can certainly be said for the bulk of ''Channel Orange'' -- so be it: Mr. Ocean appears to be creating his own gravity.
''When I did have some success, it further emboldens you to be like, 'No, I'm just going to write what I feel I should write,' '' he said. ''Channel Orange'' is full of such gestures, buffered with warm guitars and keyboards, often with urgent drums clamoring for attention underneath. Large parts of the album were recorded at Eastwest Studio here, in rooms where the Beach Boys and Frank Sinatra recorded, and where some of the equipment remains unchanged.
That furthers the intimacy of this album, as does the spare and judicious use of guests: Earl Sweatshirt, dissolute and tart on ''Super Rich Kids''; John Mayer, who briefly adds flair to ''White Heat''; and Andre 3000, whose verses on ''Pink Matter'' are dryly boastful, and whose offhand splays of guitar outshine Mr. Mayer's.
There's also a series of interludes, inspired by television, that stitch the album into a unified whole that, again, Mr. Ocean hopes speaks loudly enough that he can disappear behind it. ''The work is the work,'' he said. ''The work is not me. I like the anonymity that directors can have about their films. Even though it's my voice, I'm a storyteller.''
Accordingly, his name's not on the album cover. It appears in the television ads, but he had to be talked into it.
''As a lifestyle you always being the focal point is innately unhealthy,'' Mr. Ocean said.
Everest is credited as the album's executive producer.

HEADLINE: American History Hits The Campaign Trail

BYLINE: By ADAM GOODHEART and PETER MANSEAU. 
Adam Goodheart is the director of Washington College's C. V. Starr Center for the Study of the American Experience, where Peter Manseau is a scholar in residence. Kathy Thornton, a student associate at the center, contributed to the research.

 BODY:
While it's been a long time since any of the founding fathers made a personal appearance on the campaign trail, they continue speaking from beyond the grave through the mouths of present-day candidates, weighing in on matters as disparate -- and perhaps unimaginable to them in life -- as health care reform, gay marriage and abortion.
Barely an hour after last month's Supreme Court ruling on the Affordable Care Act, Mitt Romney was promising to uphold ''a course that the founders envisioned'' by acting to repeal the law. On other occasions, Mr. Romney has cited America's 18th-century leaders in support of limited government and in opposition to same-sex marriage.
Nor is it only Republicans who invoke dead white males in powdered wigs: President Obama recently quoted George Washington in a speech calling for new taxes on wealthy Americans. 
In fact, history is often the lingua franca of our national politics. And the heroic rhetoric goes beyond the 18th-century founders. In his campaign addresses, Mr. Obama has deployed a litany of 19th- and 20th-century accomplishments to claim precedent for his own grand initiatives (and grander intentions). ''We built this country together,'' he said in a stump speech in Miami Beach last week. ''We built railroads and highways, the Hoover Dam, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Interstate System of highways, the transcontinental railroad -- we built those things together.''
But the past is a slippery thing. Even the most anodyne-seeming statements, like Mr. Obama's, don't always hold up under the scrutiny of historians: the epic achievements he cites in his stump speech were often the products more of bitter partisan struggles than of national togetherness.
''What Obama wants to muster is this time when Americans worked together to achieve certain goals,'' said Richard White, a historian of the American West at Stanford. ''But the actual story was much more tawdry and often revolved around people making a lot of money.''
Take the transcontinental railroad, completed only after a legislative ordeal of decades stretching from the 1840s to the late 1860s. Much as health care reform has been for Democrats in more recent times, the rail link to the Pacific was a tantalizing holy grail for generations of Republican lawmakers, forever slipping just out of their reach.
Congressional bills to construct the rail line spent some 15 years deadlocked by endless bickering between Northern and Southern lawmakers over which region the route should cross. Only the Civil War settled that question. And even after the railway finally opened in 1869, its backers barely had a chance to savor their victory before it turned to ashes in their mouths amid an unfolding scandal over the line's financing, with accusations of enormous bribes paid to allies in Congress: ''The King of Frauds,'' announced a headline in The New York Sun.
The so-called Credit Mobilier affair became America's first great corporate scandal and nearly destroyed the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant. It marked the Republicans with a seemingly permanent stain as the party of big government, wasteful federal subsidies and special interests.
THE story of the Hoover Dam has also been heavily tinted in rose and sepia. Asian-Americans were forbidden from working on the project, while African-Americans were limited to menial labor and accounted for less than 1 percent of the work force.
In August 1931, work halted as construction bosses faced off against striking laborers, whose wages were slashed even as the punishing heat of the Nevada summer killed more than a dozen men in barely a month. (Dozens more are believed to have died from other hazardous work conditions project managers covered up.) The heroic endeavor got back on track only after the workers were threatened with immediate dismissal.
Yet the dam's mythic stature in American memory has proved irresistible to latter-day politicians. ''Obama probably wished he had a project like it to point to in his own stimulus program,'' said Michael Hiltzik, the author of ''Colossus: Hoover Dam and the Making of the American Century.''
''The great thing about that earlier era was that they were building new things,'' he said. ''Today's stimulus pays for repairing existing things rather than building new ones: painting bridges, fixing highways. It's easier for skeptics to portray those kinds of things as a waste of money, or as nothing, since there's less that's dramatic to point to.''
Even the Interstate System of highways and the Golden Gate Bridge had their rabid detractors. When Franklin D. Roosevelt first proposed a mammoth road network in the late 1930s -- a project that is usually associated with Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Republican who brought it to fruition -- one frugal-minded critic derided the plan as ''another ascent into the stratosphere of New Deal jitterbug economics.'' Around the same time, environmentalists and aesthetes like Ansel Adams were denouncing the bridge project as a desecration of one of America's greatest natural landscapes.
It's strange, then, that Mr. Obama, whose health care legislation was born amid similar bombastic accusations, dire predictions and back-room deals, should overlook one of the perennial lessons of American history: Our national achievements have usually been propelled forward by contention, not consensus.
Yet Mr. Romney, too, sometimes talks about history in ways rooted more in wishful thinking than in actual fact. Speaking before a veterans' group in San Diego on Memorial Day, for example, he made the seemingly uncontroversial assertion that the United States is ''unique'' and ''exceptional in the history of the world'' as the only nation that ''has been willing to lay down the lives of hundreds of thousands of sons and daughters and take no land in return.'' (It is a line he had used on previous occasions, attributing it to the Israeli president, Shimon Peres.)
No one in the crowd seemed to notice the incongruity of Mr. Romney's making this declaration on soil that once formed part of the Republic of Mexico.
San Diego fell to the United States after troops under Gen. John C. Fremont marched into the city in July 1846, hauled down the Mexican flag and imposed martial law. Over the following six months, American troops fought intermittent skirmishes against local partisans, culminating in a pitched battle in which 21 American soldiers were killed. American control of California -- along with other lands making up more than half of Mexico's prewar territory -- was confirmed in 1848 when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican-American War.
In the months between now and the presidential election, Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama will no doubt focus on efforts to propose contrasting programs for the years ahead. But they will sometimes offer conflicting interpretations of history, too. ''If you control a vision of America's past, it's much easier to control a vision of its future,'' Mr. White said.
''History was a reliable old friend when I was a speechwriter in the Clinton White House,'' said Ted Widmer, a historian who directs the John Carter Brown Library at Brown University. ''But there are pitfalls, too.'' As both candidates have already shown this season, the events of centuries past can be as open to debate as yesterday's headlines.

HEADLINE: A Lost Deal for South Korea and Japan

 BODY:
Nearly 70 years after World War II, old animosities are still making it difficult for South Korea and Japan to establish a reliably productive relationship. The result is self-defeating for both countries and for regional security. 
Last week, at the last minute, South Korea postponed signing a limited military agreement with Japan. The deal would have encouraged the direct sharing and protecting of sensitive military data about North Korea and China and missile defenses. Such intelligence is now shared indirectly through Washington. The agreement was supported by the Obama administration, which has been working to strengthen a trilateral alliance with the two countries, America's most important Asian allies.
Although Japan's cabinet approved the deal, a political firestorm erupted in South Korea, and now its fate is uncertain. That is a huge embarrassment, for Seoul and Tokyo, creating more bad feelings between the two. President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea clearly mishandled the politics. The deal was negotiated in secret, with officials informing the public and Parliament just one day before it was to be signed. This is an election year in South Korea; Mr. Lee's five-year term ends early next year after a successor is chosen in December. He should have anticipated that his political opponents would lash out as they have, accusing the government of being pro-Japanese. Instead of presenting the agreement as completed, he should have made the case for it publicly and worked to build support for it in advance.
Even then, it would have been a tough sell because animosity toward Japan remains very much alive in South Korea. Japan ruled that country as a colony, often brutally, for several decades until the end of World War II. Although the two nations have growing economic and cultural ties, they still have bitter disputes over a set of islets and Tokyo's rejection of talks on compensating Korean women used by Japan as military sex slaves during the war.
The United States and Japan have said little publicly to avoid inflaming the situation. But we hope they are working to calm the waters on this issue. South Korea and Japan need to find a way to recognize their history, but not to allow it to remain an obstacle to cooperation on critical regional challenges.

HEADLINE: The Price Of Power

BYLINE: By ROBERT DRAPER

 BODY:
One day in April, Paul Begala, a former Bill Clinton political strategist and CNN analyst, placed a phone call to a wealthy and left-leaning 41-year-old Houston lawyer named Steve Mostyn. Begala is himself a Texan, albeit one who gives off the jittery vibe of a Catskills comedian, and the two men have a few friends in common. But Mostyn, a frequent giver to Democratic causes, quickly intuited that this wasn't a social call. Begala reminded Mostyn that he was now working as a consultant for Priorities USA Action, a so-called super PAC run by Bill Burton and Sean Sweeney, former White House senior staff members, that was committed to Barack Obama's re-election. He and Burton would be coming to Houston on Friday, April 13, Begala said. Could they arrange for a meeting?
''I'll be in Fort Lauderdale that day on my boat,'' Mostyn replied. ''You're welcome to join me there.'' 
The invitation was not thoroughly sincere, evidenced by the fact that Mostyn did not inform Begala where his boat would be docked. Nonetheless, at noon sharp on Friday the 13th, Begala (who is prone to seasickness) and Burton (who had taken a red-eye flight from San Francisco, where he spent the previous afternoon giving his pitch to wealthy progressives at the Telegraph Hill home of the Taco Bell heir Rob McKay), materialized at the correct Fort Lauderdale marina, each wearing jeans and bearing iPads.
For the uninitiated, ''boat'' is Texan for ''yacht.'' Burton and Begala climbed aboard the outsize Mostyn vessel, All or Nothing, and the attractive first mate handed them cans of Michelob Ultra. A four-hour conversation ensued. Mostyn and his wife, Amber (who is also an attorney), were congenial but blunt. They were not fans of super PACs -- political action committees that can receive unlimited donations from individuals, corporations and unions, usually for the purpose of saturating the airwaves with attack ads -- and were appalled by the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision in 2010, which made such entities possible. For that matter, the Mostyns weren't entirely happy with Obama. The president had been far too accommodating to Republicans -- ''naive,'' as Amber Mostyn expressed it.
''We hear that a lot,'' Burton conceded. Burton was a White House deputy press secretary under Obama, and at age 34, he has spent his career as a happy warrior spewing Democratic messages from behind a lectern or on cable TV. But a big part of his new role involves shutting up and listening to rich Democrats vent about his former boss's deficiencies. Gently he reminded his hosts, ''But things will only be worse if he's not re-elected.''
The Mostyns acknowledged not wanting to see Mitt Romney in the Oval Office. Still, they wondered how any donation could possibly make a difference. ''They're spending ridiculous amounts of money on the other side,'' Amber Mostyn said. ''All the crazy commercials they're going to put up -- how do you combat that?''
Burton was ready for this question. ''You don't do it dollar for dollar,'' he said. He whipped out his iPad and showed the Mostyns a few slides from his PowerPoint presentation. The slides included polling data indicating voters' lack of familiarity with Romney's business record at the private-equity firm Bain Capital, as well as financial figures from the 2010 midterm election showing how well-spent donations could help a Democrat prevail over a better-financed Republican opponent.
Then Burton pulled up something else on his screen: raw video footage that Priorities intended to use for attack ads against Romney. Appearing were the somber images of several men and women who were laid off by Bain. The individuals were tracked down by Brennan Bilberry, the super PAC's 26-year-old research director, and persuaded to tell their stories on camera. One of these was a middle-aged paper-mill worker named Mike Earnest, who had been asked to help build a 30-foot stage that Bain officials would later stand upon while announcing to Earnest and other millworkers that they were being laid off. ''Turns out that when we built that stage,'' Earnest said in a flat Midwestern cadence, ''it was like building my own coffin.''
Steve Mostyn was impressed by their research. He asked them what sort of donation they were talking about.
''One million dollars,'' was the reply. The Mostyns had never given anywhere near that kind of money to a candidate in the past.
''And we'd like it right away,'' Burton said. He explained that TV ad rates were cheaper to buy far in advance.
Defining the opponent early was crucial, Begala pointed out. ''That's what we did to Bob Dole in 1996,'' he said. ''It's what the Bush campaign did to John Kerry in 2004.''
Burton added, ''Because voters at this point don't know much about Romney, every dollar we spend now is worth more, exponentially.''
Amber Mostyn wanted to know how they were going to re-energize a Democratic base that has been disillusioned.
That's not our role, Burton explained. Though presidential campaigns and their supporting super PACs are forbidden to communicate with one another, a division of labor was mutually understood. It was up to the Obama campaign to be the keeper of the president's story, Burton said. Priorities would focus on ''defining'' Romney, and in the process, destroying him. And to do that, it needed the Mostyns and many people like them to get over their distaste for the Citizens United decision and their frustration with the president and write a very large check, because that's what was happening every day on the other side.
Burton and his best friend, Sean Sweeney, are knockaround political operatives from working-class backgrounds who had never spent a day in the genteel stratum of fund-raising before they started their super PAC 16 months ago. Their chief qualification for the job, beyond the fact that no one else wanted it, was their shared appreciation for the devastating work that well-financed outside groups can do.
Burton and Sweeney both worked for Rahm Emanuel during the 2006 midterm elections, when Emanuel was directing the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's successful drive to win back the House. Unions and other outside groups played a huge role during that cycle by tarring-and-feathering Republicans as corrupt and wedded to the increasingly unpopular policies of President George W. Bush. In the spring of 2008, a Democratic PAC calling itself Progressive Media USA, whose advisers included Begala, began to raise tens of millions of dollars from big-name donors to pay for attack ads against John McCain. The intent was to keep Progressive Media in place well after the election as a magnet for deep-pocketed progressives; as one of its organizers wistfully told me, ''Imagine where we'd be if we had that in place four years later.'' But the Obama campaign -- which was building its own fund-raising behemoth, even at the expense of the candidate's earlier pledge to accept public financing and the spending cap that came with it -- didn't want outside interference. The campaign sent out a 30-year-old spokesman named Bill Burton to shut Progressive Media down by telling the press, ''From the beginning of this race, Obama has told supporters that if they want to help his effort, they should do so through his campaign.''
Two years later, President Obama repeatedly denounced the conservative super PACs that had cropped up in the wake of the Citizens United decision. In so doing, Obama ended up unilaterally disarming Democrats while animating Republicans. ''When Obama attacked us by name in the fall of 2010, accusing us of taking money from the Chinese, it was basically the best fund-raising pitch we could've made,'' says Jonathan Collegio, a spokesman for American Crossroads, the conservative super PAC conceived by Karl Rove and the Republican consultant Ed Gillespie. ''We raised $13 million the week after they attacked us.'' Burton and Sweeney watched from the White House -- more with rueful admiration than moral outrage -- as the Republicans turned the tables, outspending Democratic groups by $100 million and taking back the House.
Three months after the midterms, Burton learned that he was not chosen to succeed Robert Gibbs as White House press secretary. Gibbs had not recommended his deputy for the job (which went to Vice President Joseph Biden's spokesman, Jay Carney) -- perhaps, as some have suggested, because of Burton's youth, or because the deputy had openly campaigned for the job after having been requested not to do so. Several in the White House, including the president, urged Burton to stay on. Whatever Gibbs and others might have found lacking in him, he had proved himself to be an agile stand-in for the press secretary, one who seemed to relish trading punches with Fox News hosts.
Burton is one of those ever-ascending Washingtonians whose brazen optimism seems not to have been dampened in the slightest by the cynical world he inhabits. When asked how he's doing, he routinely, and often defiantly, replies, ''Best day of my life.'' He has been a political spokesman his entire adult life and is married to a former Clinton White House aide, Laura Burton Capps, herself the daughter of Congresswoman Lois Capps and Congressman Walter Capps.
The son of a metal-foundry worker in Buffalo who, Burton says, ''was on his feet on concrete floors all day, carrying 50-pound bags of different chemical alloys and inhaling the world's worst pollutants,'' Burton learned two things by the time he was 11. The first -- which arrived as an epiphany while watching the 1988 vice-presidential debate between Lloyd Bentsen and Dan Quayle on the family's black-and-white TV -- was that ''I wanted to be in politics, and I wanted to be at the highest level.''
The second revelation was that he was black. Burton's father was African-American and his mother was Polish. One day in elementary school he identified himself as ''other'' on a standardized test. ''My fifth-grade teacher said, 'No, you're black -- mark that you're black,' '' he told me. ''I was just like, 'Oh, I'm black.' Just another piece of information.'' With little effort, he navigated both sides of the racial divide, reserving his energies for political climbing. After graduating from the University of Minnesota in 1999, he made repeated visits to the campus office of Al Gore's presidential campaign, wearing them down until they gave him the title of deputy press secretary. At age 22, he took a job on the Hill as a Congressional aide.
But presidential politics was Burton's goal. Leveraging every Washington contact he had, Burton persuaded Senator Tom Harkin (who campaigned for the presidency in 1992) to hire him as his press secretary. When Harkin elected to stay out of the 2004 race, Burton jumped ship and became Dick Gephardt's communications director in Iowa. When Gep/hardt faltered, the gabby and incessant Burton joined the Kerry campaign.
In late 2006, Burton managed to network his way into a job interview with Senator Barack Obama, whose famous speech at the 2004 Democratic convention Burton watched ''over and over, the way some kids have seen 'Star Wars' a hundred times,'' he told me. The two men spoke only briefly of their shared biracial experience. Instead, the Iowa caucuses were on the senator's mind. Burton had experience there. He recalls suggesting that Obama shoot for ''a respectable third place, maybe an unlikely second.'' Obama disagreed. He assured Burton that he would win Iowa. Soon after, Burton became one of the earliest senior staff members to join Obama's underdog campaign.
Though his ambitions eventually met a brick wall with the news that he would not be the White House's top spokesman, Burton was not going to let a bruised ego befoul relationships that he spent years cultivating. As the deputy press secretary was leaving the building in February of last year, it happened that his pal Sean Sweeney -- who had been the top aide to Rahm Emanuel, until Emanuel decided to run for mayor of Chicago -- was also in search of a new career. Sweeney is 40, dry-witted and a career backstage political technician, more than content to cede the limelight to the Burtons and Emanuels while immersing himself in the minutiae of precinct voting data and efficient ad markets. The two ex-Obamaites spent the month of February at Tunnicliff's Tavern on Capitol Hill and halfheartedly mulled over opening a consulting shop together. But Burton had not lost his appetite for presidential politics.
Sweeney and Burton kicked around the idea of starting a pro-Obama super PAC with fellow Democrats. None of them fretted aloud that going toe to toe with Karl Rove and the Koch brothers would amount to fighting above their weight -- that, as one conservative super PAC affiliate would say to me, ''the more appropriate analog to Rove and Gillespie would be James Carville and Ed Rendell,'' the former Pennsylvania governor. But if the chief function of a super PAC is to kneecap an opponent, the two campaign veterans seemed to have ample experience. That their profiles were relatively obscure, their financial resources meager and their fund-raising experience nonexistent did not apparently deter them.
Because they lacked the money for an office (and because, as Burton told me, ''it's a little too obvious to meet at Starbucks''), Burton and Sweeney took all of their early meetings in the lobby of the Mayflower Hotel. Begala was the first to sign on as a paid consultant; Terry McAuliffe, the former D.N.C. chairman, was the first to say no, citing other commitments. Teddy Johnston, the Obama campaign's Florida finance director, became their chief fund-raiser. Sweeney knew Geoff Garin, a Democratic consultant, from when they worked together for Senator Charles E. Schumer and persuaded him to handle their polling. Ellen Malcolm of Emily's List and the America Coming Together PAC agreed to provide regular consultation. Harold Ickes, the former Clinton White House deputy chief of staff and Media Fund PAC president, became president of Priorities USA Action. He recalls warning them: ''It's hard, fund-raising. You have to raise it in big chunks. Of the $200 million we raised, $95 million of that came from five sources. And you don't just walk in and ask for that.''
It took several weeks for Burton and Sweeney to come up with a name for their start-up. To their irritation, every slogan they considered had already been trademarked by Republicans. ''We gave our lawyer 10 more names,'' Burton recalls. ''Then like 50. We're literally trying every combination of whatever. You can't come up with a name that has the word 'future' in it that the Republicans don't control. Romney's Restore Our Future -- that doesn't even make sense, and that's probably why they were able to get it.''
Eventually they settled on Priorities USA Action. As a backhanded homage to Karl Rove, Burton and Sweeney explicitly modeled the two-headed corpus of their brainchild after American Crossroads. One side would consist of a tax-exempt political action committee covered by section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code, to which named individuals and groups could donate in unlimited amounts. Its companion entity, Priorities USA, permissible under section 501(c)(4) of the tax code, could, like its counterpart Crossroads GPS, receive unlimited funds by undisclosed donors, provided that the ''social welfare'' organization did not pursue political activities as its ''primary purpose.'' (The two phrases in quotation marks are, needless to say, hazily defined. ''Priorities USA, like Crossroads GPS, has one purpose, and that's to elect and defeat candidates,'' says Fred Wertheimer of the campaign watchdog group Democracy 21. ''They're blowing smoke when they claim they're a 'social welfare' organization in the business of discussing issues.'')
There was, however, one fundamental difference between Priorities and its conservative counterparts. According to Politico, Rove's organization had vowed to raise $300 million for the 2012 election -- which, when coupled with Restore Our Future ($100 million) and the outside groups of oil and chemical billionaires Charles and David Koch ($400 million), would amount to an $800 million war chest. Burton and Sweeney's stated goal was $100 million.
Having conceded the arms race before it even began, the Priorities team recognized that its only hope lay in asymmetrical warfare. Making a virtue of their relative puniness, Begala told me: ''Karl's trying to be too comprehensive, playing in too many places on too many levels. He believes in throw-weight, the way the Soviet space program worked: they believed in brute force, while we believed in precision and perfection.'' Priorities would be selective in its ad buys. Knowing that Obama had to keep Pennsylvania in the win column, it would reach for undecided voters in the Pittsburgh exurbs instead of playing in the expensive Philadelphia market. Similarly, Priorities would not bother trying to persuade the elderly (a group whose low support for the president has seemed immovable) but would instead pursue more promising demographic targets (non-college-educated young women in the suburbs, working-class Hispanics in Florida and the West). The pro-Obama super PAC would take dead aim at these very specific pockets of swing voters. Their weapon would be, in Begala's words, ''ruthless, relentless storytelling.''
Last December -- specifically, on Pearl Harbor Day -- Burton and Sweeney met with a few other Priorities advisers in the Dupont Circle office of the pollster Geoff Garin to decide just what their Romney story would be. They quickly discarded the Romney-as-flip-flopper leitmotif. To say that the Republican lacked a firm set of positions was to concede that he couldn't be defined. Better, they concluded, to assert that Romney in fact possessed beliefs -- very extreme ones.
Burton and his colleagues spent the early months of 2012 trying out the pitch that Romney was the most far-right presidential candidate since Barry Goldwater. It fell flat. The public did not view Romney as an extremist. For example, when Priorities informed a focus group that Romney supported the Ryan budget plan -- and thus championed ''ending Medicare as we know it'' -- while also advocating tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, the respondents simply refused to believe any politician would do such a thing. What became clear was that voters had almost no sense of Obama's opponent. While conducting a different focus group -- this one with non-college-educated Milwaukee voters on the eve of Wisconsin's April 3 primary -- Burton and Sweeney were surprised to learn that even after Romney had spent months campaigning, many in the group could not recognize his face, much less characterize his positions. Compounding the Republican nominee's strangely persistent obscurity is that, as Garin told me, ''Romney is not a natural politician in the sense of embracing opportunities to talk about himself.''
That left an opening for the Democrats to tell Romney's story, and over the spring they figured out how to do so. Obama's opponent was not an ideologue per se, the Priorities team decided, but instead someone who knows and cares only about wealthy Americans. Burton describes the distinction as ''a top/bottom rather than left/right approach'' -- also known in Republican circles as class warfare.
The best explanatory tool for this narrative would prove to be Romney's tenure at Bain Capital. In this recasting of Romney's self-described chief qualification to be president, the candidate may well be someone who understands how the economy works but cares only about making it work for rich guys like himself. As one participant in the Priorities focus groups told me, ''Businessmen are often highly admired, but there's no real template for somebody with Mitt Romney's type of business experience getting embraced.''
Bain-bashing is not exactly a novel gambit. Ted Kennedy employed it during Romney's first campaign, the 1994 U.S. Senate race, and succeeded wildly. Newt Gingrich also tried it during this year's Republican primaries, and the tactic blew up in his face, when a pro-Gingrich super PAC released an anti-Bain video full of inaccuracies, which Gingrich then disavowed. To the Beltway press, and perhaps to others as well, what Romney's business did or didn't do two decades ago is old news. Burton and Sweeney acknowledged this problem to me and postulated -- sounding somewhat like Karl Rove as they did so -- that the threat of having one's steel mill shut down doesn't resonate with the elite media.
But, they insisted, the message would penetrate the membrane of their target audience. More than one member of the Priorities team told me that Romney reminded them of another wooden and reserved Massachusetts politician, Burton's former candidate in 2004, John Kerry -- who, history shows, was defined and thereafter demolished by a masterful if venal tag-team consisting of the Bush campaign and the proto-super PAC Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. And, as the Priorities team well knew, the Swift Boat assault on Kerry's war record was waged with one-twentieth of the backing that the Democrats raised for their anti-Bush PACs. In other words: ruthless, relentless storytelling could be done on the cheap.
During the first 10 months of its existence, Priorities USA Action managed to raise only $7 million. (Of this, $2 million was seed money from Jeffrey Katzenberg, the C.E.O. of DreamWorks Animation; another $1 million came from the comedian Bill Maher.) Their travails to some degree reflect the Democratic Party's greater struggle with its prim self-perception. From the perspective of many Democrats, this year's foray into post-Citizens United campaigning calls to mind an ''Apocalypse Now''-like journey into the maw of something darker than death itself -- namely, a morality-free zone in which Republicans alone can thrive. ''I think that many Democrats feel that participating in the system would be validating Citizens United, which was a bad and destructive decision,'' Geoff Garin says.
A sentiment commonly held by Democrats -- so much so that it's part of the standard Priorities pitch to donors -- is that their only motivation to contribute is a moral one, while Republicans like the Koch brothers donate because they stand to make gobs of money if their pro-business candidate is elected. One of Priorities' big donors told me another reason that conservatives are more suited to a post-Citizens United climate than progressives. ''To me, a lot of the super-PAC money on the Republican side comes from hatred,'' he said. ''We Democrats just don't hate like that.''
The idea that Democrats abhor big money and scorched-earth campaigning requires more than a touch of amnesia. ''In 2004, we had all this energy coming from the horror at what Bush was doing -- we were furious,'' recalls the liberal activist Ellen Malcolm, whose America Coming Together PAC benefited from millions in donations from wealthy Democrats like George Soros. ''George came out of Nazi Europe and looked at this so-called war on terrorism as an all-too-familiar dynamic of governments taking control. Fear and anger are the great motivators in fund-raising. And right now Karl Rove has the fear and anger on his side.''
Lacking this sort of emotional edge, Priorities struggled against a confluence of inhospitable factors. First among those is that, as Jonathan Collegio of American Crossroads observes, ''Outside money tends to flow toward the party out of power, and to causes to stop things rather than to promote things.'' Burton and Sweeney had to contend with the widely held assumption that the Obama campaign was raising enough money on its own anyway. ''These big donors are smart -- they look at the numbers,'' a prominent Democratic fund-raiser told me. ''They say, 'How's this money they want from me going to have any impact, compared to the $750 million Obama says he's raising?' '' It also did not help that for most of its young life, Priorities operated not only without Obama's endorsement but also in the face of his implicit disapproval -- at least until late last December, when Obama's campaign manager, Jim Messina, showed his fellow adviser David Axelrod the gross disparity in fund-raising between conservative and liberal groups, prompting an alarmed Axelrod to murmur, ''We've got to show this to the president.''
Over and over, Burton and Sweeney heard Democrats express distaste for super PACs, disillusionment with Obama and -- during the primary season, anyway -- disbelief that the president was in any danger of losing. (''It's been difficult,'' Sweeney told me in early spring, ''to make the case that Romney's a juggernaut when he's within 2,000 votes of losing Ohio to Rick Santorum.'') As one lackluster monthly F.E.C. disclosure followed another, a new narrative rippled through Washington, and it wasn't about Bain Capital: the Priorities team, it was suggested, was not ready for prime time.
''It's a personal process, asking for checks of this size,'' says Susan McCue, one leader of the Democratic Senate super PAC. ''You need to take the time to talk about the stakes and how their support will make a difference. And you need to assure them that their money will be used efficiently.'' Arguably, the skill sets of driving home a rapid-response message to a roomful of deadline-crazed journalists and charming a tycoon into parting with a million dollars could not be more different. Burton and Sweeney were novices at asking for money, and apparently it showed. Upper-tier Obama associates told me that in the eyes of donors, Burton and Sweeney lacked Rove's stature and Begala's natural salesman's touch. In April, after an attack ad by American Crossroads compelled the Obama campaign to respond by spending its own money for additional TV time -- knowing that Priorities lacked the money to do so -- a clearly annoyed official told me, ''If we had a Karl Rove of our own out there, we wouldn't have had to do this.''
As the super PAC's public face -- a ubiquitous MSNBC talking head, blogger and cajoler of the Washington news media -- Burton bore the brunt of the criticism. The ongoing insinuation that he was out of his depth did not outwardly jostle the spokesman's best-day-of-my-life unsinkability. (''If you didn't read the story and just looked at the pictures . . . I feel like I came out pretty good,'' he wrote me after one particularly withering article.) Burton and Sweeney repeatedly insisted to me that what they termed the ''education process'' was mainly about converting super-PAC-averse Democrats rather than learning on the fly themselves.
Still, they knew they needed help. By the end of the spring, Priorities had beefed up its fund-raising team to include Diana Rogalle (from the ACT PAC), Susan Holloway Torricelli (former Senator Robert Torricelli's ex- wife and longtime fund-raiser) and Kathleen Daughety (who was previously Senator Michael Bennet's finance director). Mary Beth Cahill, who was Burton's boss on the Kerry campaign, also signed on as a strategic adviser.
''Look, Sean and Bill make no bones about it: they'd been on the spending'' -- meaning messaging -- ''side, not the fund-raising side,'' Harold Ickes told me. ''I think they decided to do it because no one else was doing it. It was clearly necessary, and I encouraged them to do it. That said, there are techniques, and it's an art form . . . there's a minuet, almost. And it takes a lot of time, you bet.''
On April 14, the day after their get-together aboard the boat, Steve Mostyn called Begala to say that he would soon be wiring Priorities a million dollars. A month later -- 25 weeks before the general election -- Mostyn's donation would help finance a $10 million TV blitz in the swing states of Colorado, Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Each week featured a somber new anti-Romney testimonial. On May 22, it was that of Loris Huffman, who worked at the Ampad paper mill for 34 years before being laid off by Bain. On June 10, a former steel-mill employee, Donnie Box, appeared in ads.
Three days later, The Wall Street Journal reported that the conservative casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson had just pledged money to the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future. The amount Adelson was donating was $10 million -- 10 times that of the Mostyns' hard-won contribution, and the sum total of Priorities USA's entire ad buy. A couple of days later, The Huffington Post reported that Adelson might also be cutting $10 million checks to American Crossroads and the Koch brothers' Americans for Prosperity. All told, the casino magnate was telling friends, his contributions to right-leaning candidates and causes might well reach $100 million -- a figure by a single Republican donor that matches the amount Priorities has set as its financial goal for the entire 2012 cycle.
After Burton read the story about Adelson's contribution to the Romney super PAC, he could think of only one thing to do. ''I sent that article out to every single Democratic donor that I know,'' he would later recall. The subject heading of Burton's e-mail -- minus a profane verb -- was: ''So apparently they're not messing around.''
But in late May and early June, it wasn't Sheldon Adelson who was drowning out the Priorities ads. Rather, the Obama campaign was inadvertently doing so. Apparently the campaign did not know or did not care about Priorities USA Action's planned mini-blitz, for it released its own two-minute attack video focusing on Bain's closure of GST Steel, which concluded with, ''I'm Barack Obama, and I approved this message.''
Reaction to the ad was swift and overwhelmingly negative. A procession of Democrats -- starting with the Newark mayor and Obama surrogate Cory Booker, followed by former Congressman Harold Ford Jr., the former U.S. Treasury adviser Steven Rattner and former Governor Ed Rendell -- publicly criticized the president for speaking so harshly of private-equity firms.
Burton and Sweeney waited out the chatter. They knew that Booker and the rest had deep associations with the financial sector. They also believed in their polling data -- which would be validated in early June by focus groups of suburban mothers conducted in Richmond, Va., and Las Vegas, and also by an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll showing that voters were twice as likely to have a negative opinion of Bain's practices. Besides, beneath all the bluster coming from Obama's fellow Democrats lurked a basic political verity: the leader of the free world is widely seen as having better things to do with his time than trash Mitt Romney's past business life. It was beneath him. But it was hardly beneath Obama's friends residing in the shadows of super PAC world. Quite the opposite: this was exactly what Priorities was set up to do.
Burton and Sweeney's creation now appears to be on relatively solid footing. As of late June, the super PAC has amassed a total of $40 million, with almost $20 million in the bank and about a dozen million-dollar donors onboard. Among the most recent is Qualcomm's co-founder Irwin M. Jacobs and his wife, Joan, newcomers to the world of political mega-giving, whom Burton and other Priorities surrogates spent a year courting in person, on the phone and by e-mail before the couple relented and gave $2 million. Priorities' $100 million goal is within reach but by no means assured. ''In order to do that,'' Ickes says, ''we're going to have go get some $5 million and $10 million donors.'' Another Priorities representative says wistfully: ''Maybe there's someone we never heard of. Is there a Charles Koch out there on our side?''
On June 21, Burton returned to Buffalo to deliver the commencement address at City Honors School, from which he graduated in 1995. ''While men and women are remembered for how they succeed,'' the former White House spokesman told his young audience, ''they are defined by how they fail. And by how they come back.'' Late that evening, while Burton was dining out with old high-school buddies and faculty members, a Washington Post article about Romney and Bain Capital appeared on the paper's Web site. The story analyzed filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that showed Bain to have ''owned companies that were pioneers in the practice of shipping work from the United States to overseas call centers and factories.''
From the restaurant, Burton e-mailed Sweeney and their team. By 10:45 p.m., they had drafted a memo that would be sent to the e-mail addresses of several hundred political reporters by 7 the next morning: ''Despite his phony rhetoric on standing up for American workers, today's Washington Post details how Mitt Romney directly profited from the outsourcing of American jobs overseas.'' Soon they would be adding more Bain-related questions to their polls, seeking to add depth to their narrative, the one best shot their modestly financed super PAC had at persuading swing voters and thereby making a difference in a closely contested presidential election. Burton and Sweeney were doing what they do best, telling the story -- though when it came down to it, getting enough people to listen would still be the hardest part.

HEADLINE: On Tricky Terrain of Class, Contrasting Paths

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON; Reporting was contributed by Mark Landler from Oak Harbor, Ohio; Jim Rutenberg from New York; and Jeremy W. Peters from Wolfeboro, N.H.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The complex and fraught politics of wealth and class, undercurrents all along in the race between President Obama and Mitt Romney, are surfacing in increasingly visible ways in the presidential campaign, presenting big risks and opportunities to both sides.
The contrasting images of the week could hardly have been more evocative.
There was Mr. Obama on Thursday at a carefully scouted location, the Kozy Corners diner in Oak Harbor, Ohio, downing a burger and fries and chatting with a group of working-class voters about pinochle and trips to Disney World. The next day, as he continued a campaign swing, he reminisced about a Greyhound-and-train trip he took around the country with his grandmother when he was 11, staying at Howard Johnson and getting a thrill from leaping into the motel pool and fetching ice from the ice machine.
And there was Mitt Romney on Thursday, roaring across Lake Winnipesaukee on a powerboat large enough to hold two dozen members of his family who had gathered for a weeklong vacation at his estate in New Hampshire. On Sunday, Mr. Romney will raise money among wealthy Republicans in the Hamptons, with his final stop a $75,000-per-couple dinner at the home of David Koch, the billionaire industrialist, who with his brother Charles has been among the leading patrons of the conservative movement. 
It was a vivid manifestation of calculations made by both camps.
Mr. Obama and his allies are testing the proposition that they can avoid tripping over the line into a full-tilt attack on the wealthy and still make an aggressive case that Mr. Romney's success came at the expense of American workers and that the Republican Party is doing the bidding of its wealthy benefactors.
Mr. Romney's bet is that with the economy failing to gain steam and Americans deeply concerned that the nation is on the wrong track, voters will not really care if he jets across a lake on a water scooter during his vacation and once had a Swiss bank account as long as he can credibly promise to spur job creation and economic growth.
Implicit and explicit efforts by the president and his inner circle to advance the argument that Mr. Romney is an out-of-touch and rapacious capitalist, in the Romney team's view, will be seen by voters as a transparent and hypocritical attempt by a group of Democrats, millionaires themselves, to divert attention from Mr. Obama's failure to preside over more job creation.
''I don't think what they're talking about is relevant to people's lives,'' said Stuart Stevens, the chief strategist for Mr. Romney's campaign. ''This race is about the economy and Barack Obama's responsibility for the economy.''
Presidential campaigns are never just about policies or even personalities. They tend to turn as much as anything on values, and the values in this case go to central questions about the psyche of the American electorate in 2012.
In an era of populist backlashes against the 1 percent and increased concern about the economic and social ramifications of income inequality, will the long-held assumption that the United States is an aspirational society that admires rather than resents success hold true? At a time when individual billionaires and moneyed interests can play an outsize and often shadowy role in shaping politics and policy, do political leaders have less incentive to put the needs of the poor and the middle class ahead of the agendas of their benefactors?
Those questions provide a particular opportunity for Mr. Obama, who is eager to raise the stakes in the election and make it something more than a march through four more months of unemployment and job creation reports.
Without explicitly invoking Mr. Romney's wealth as a reason to oppose him, Democrats have sought to portray him as the embodiment of a kind of capitalism that works only for the megarich.
''Mitt Romney made over $100 million by shutting down our plant and devastated our lives,'' a worker from a factory closed by Bain Capital, Mr. Romney's private equity firm, says in an advertisement by Priorities USA Action, the pro-Obama ''super PAC.''
That leaves Mr. Obama free to make the more elevated pitch that his policies would give a fair shot to the middle class, while suggesting that Mr. Romney would put the nation on a path back to the policies that brought about widening inequality, stagnant wages and corporate malfeasance.
''The viability of the middle class is not a class issue,'' said David Axelrod, the Obama campaign's senior adviser. ''It's an American issue.''
Polling suggests that the Bain-based attacks on Mr. Romney are filtering through to voters in swing states. But wealth, class and politics are a combustible mix that can blow up in unpredictable ways, and Mr. Obama is not without his vulnerabilities on that score.
Like Mr. Romney, he has spent a good part of the campaign prospecting for donations among the 1 percent, rubbing shoulders with Anna Wintour and George Clooney and exhorting his wealthiest backers to give more.
Although he canceled plans to spend time on Martha's Vineyard this summer and is emphasizing his real-guy side on the campaign trail, he has had troubles connecting with the white working-class voters who are likely to decide the election.
The question of how hard to press the wealth and class argument has already created splits within the Democratic Party; it was only weeks ago that Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark said the Bain-centered attacks on Mr. Romney were as ''nauseating'' as attacks on Mr. Obama over his association with the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., his former pastor.
Most of all, even Mr. Obama's inner circle seems cognizant of the risks of making wealth an issue. Asked whether Mr. Obama's emphasis on fairness for the middle class and his contrast with Mr. Romney pushed that line, Mr. Axelrod replied: ''It is not right to say that to work for and hope for and fight for some basic economic security means that you resent people who've done very, very well.''
Mr. Romney even invoked the aspiration defense when asked about his vacation on Friday. ''I hope that more Americans are able to take vacations,'' he told reporters after criticizing Mr. Obama's record on job creation. ''And if I'm president of the United States, I'm going to work very hard to make sure we have good jobs for all Americans who want good jobs -- and, as part of a good job, the capacity to take a vacation every now and then with their loved ones.''
But Mr. Romney faces the challenge of appealing to the middle class as head of a party that is increasingly reliant on wealthy interests that are powering super PACs and other outside groups advertising heavily on behalf of Republicans.
His stewardship of Bain brought populist-themed attacks from within his own party during the primary season. His own words -- challenging a rival to a $10,000 bet, citing friendships with Nascar owners, casually mentioning his ownership of ''a couple of Cadillacs'' and asserting that ''corporations are people'' -- have given Democrats ample fodder to portray him as detached from the anxieties of middle-class life. In a New York Times/CBS News poll in April, 34 percent of respondents said Mr. Romney was someone they could relate to; the figure for Mr. Obama was 47 percent.
''Being rich is not a problem,'' said Bob Shrum, a Democratic consultant who helped Senator Edward M. Kennedy defeat Mr. Romney in their 1994 Senate race in Massachusetts. ''Being rich and out of touch is a problem.''
Mr. Romney's campaign has pushed back hard against some of the wealth-themed attacks, which have included assertions that at Bain he enriched himself by promoting the outsourcing of American jobs. Increasingly the Romney campaign is turning Mr. Obama's attacks back on him by suggesting that the president is in denial about his record and is out of touch with the economic strains felt by most Americans.
''They just can't come to grips with the reality of what's happening out there and the president's responsibility for it,'' said Mr. Stevens, the campaign strategist.
But for the most part, Mr. Romney has tried to refocus attention on the economy and avoid tussles that detract from his central message that Mr. Obama has failed.
Some Republicans say his strategy amounts to a low-risk, run-out-the-clock approach that could give Democrats more room to define him on their terms.
''It just seems there's been a hole in Romney's biography that invites this stuff,'' said Nelson Warfield, a Republican strategist who last worked on the presidential campaign of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas.
''It invites a shorthand: He's the fat cat from the Monopoly board who has stacks of cash and doesn't care about someone like me,'' he said. ''How effective it will be, I don't know. But my suspicion is it probably works because the Obama people are pretty smart and there's got to be a reason they're doing it.''

HEADLINE: For Clinton, an Effort to Rechannel the Rivalry With China

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Bree Feng contributed research.

 BODY:
TOKYO -- At a gathering of business executives in Cambodia this week, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton plans to urge the expansion of American trade and investment across Asia, particularly in Southeast Asian nations on the periphery of China.
It has become more common these days for the nation's chief diplomat to play a role as a business booster. But the extra attention devoted to economics is intended to send a message that Washington recognizes that it initially overemphasized the military component of its new focus on Asia, setting up more of a confrontation with China than some countries felt comfortable with. 
''There's a nervousness that the two of them shouldn't get into a fight,'' said a senior Southeast Asian diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity according to protocol. ''No one wants to choose sides'' between China and the United States, he said.
Indeed, both sides have an interest in channeling their rivalry into trade more than weaponry, even as it is clear that China sees itself as increasingly having the upper hand in the region.
''China is the biggest trading partner of Asean, Japan, Korea, India and Australia,'' Cui Tiankai, a Chinese vice foreign minister, said in a speech in Hong Kong at the Asia Society on Thursday, ''and the biggest source of investment for many countries in the region.'' Asean is the acronym for the 10-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
Mr. Cui, while speaking broadly about the need for ''sound interaction'' between the United States and China, took subtle aim at the Obama administration, which often emphasizes the role of the United States as a Pacific power.
''For China, an Asian country located on the Pacific coast,'' Mr. Cui said, ''the Asia-Pacific is our home and our root.''
Mrs. Clinton arrived in Tokyo for a meeting on Sunday of multinational donors that is intended to raise billions of dollars for Afghanistan's post-2014 civilian government. But much of the rest of her trip in Asia this week will focus on building economic ties to the fast-growing nations of Southeast Asia that are becoming increasingly bound by trade with China. She plans to visit Vietnam for an American Chamber of Commerce event, Cambodia to participate in meetings of the Asean foreign ministers, and Laos, which has not received an American secretary of state since 1955, when John Foster Dulles visited the newly independent country.
That was another era. Mr. Dulles's mission -- his plane landed on a World War II steel mat runway only after buffalo were chased away -- was to coax Laos into the anti-Communist camp in the cold war. Mrs. Clinton's purpose, though unstated, will be to encourage Laos, now largely supported by Beijing, to see the United States as much of a friend as it does China.
Mrs. Clinton is popular in Asia, in part because she shows up. In China and Singapore, she is seen as a powerful presidential contender in 2016. Wherever she goes, she will try to repair the impression that the Obama administration, in turning its attention to shoring up American military prowess with new weaponry and expanded agreements with Asian allies, is devoting itself to a strategy of containing the growing Chinese military at the expense of integrating Beijing into the global economic order.
The decision by the United States Pacific Command not to invite China to a major American naval exercise off Hawaii last month that included Russia and India, China's regional rivals, stung even some pro-American policy makers in China who saw it as further evidence of a deliberate containment policy.
Another chore for Mrs. Clinton will be to allay anxieties about whether Washington, given mounting budget constraints, can follow through on its promises.
''The 2013 question that we hear a lot more of is: Can the United States sustain a higher level of commitment as we go forward in the Asian-Pacific region?'' said Kurt M. Campbell, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, at a conference at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington last week.
Administration officials acknowledge that more ground in Asia has been ceded to China during the Obama administration, a decline that began as the Bush administration became preoccupied with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In an echo of Mr. Cui's statement in Hong Kong, Ernest Z. Bower, an American expert on the Southeast Asian economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted that the United States was Asean's largest trading partner in 2004, with total trade of $192 billion. But now China, which was an inconsequential trading partner of Asean as recently as the late 1990s, is by far the region's largest trading partner, with two-way trade of $293 billion in 2010.
President Obama, fearful that the United States risked being shunted aside in Asia, embraced an initiative last fall known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership that aims to create a new free trade group among some Asian countries, several Latin American nations and the United States. Canada and Mexico were invited to join the talks at the recent G-20 summit meeting in Mexico.
But by not inviting China to participate, Washington again raised suspicions among Chinese economists and political analysts about its intentions.
''It's much ado about nothing,'' said Fred Hu, the chairman of the financial advisory firm Primavera Capital Group, and former chairman of Goldman Sachs in greater China. ''How can you have a credible trade organization if you exclude the biggest trading nation?'' Mrs. Clinton's Asia tour is seen in the region as being prompted in part by China's success in turning itself into the engine of Asia's economic powerhouse.
At the turn of the century, ''China's rise was viewed by many of its neighbors as a potential threat,'' said Peter Drysdale, editor of the East Asia Forum at the Australian National University in Canberra. ''But when economies from South Korea to Thailand revived and the regional production-sharing networks matured, and China embraced an activist economic diplomacy to open its markets toward Southeast Asia, everyone seemed to benefit.''
Now Washington is worried about being left on the outside, looking in.
''Asian integration without the United States is the real competition,'' said Liu Xuecheng, one of China's leading experts on America. That, he said, is ''the real challenge to the United States.''

FOR DRUG TRAFFICKERS,
ARGENTINA IS A DESTINATION
As the trafficking of illegal drugs picks up in Argentina, residents are growing accustomed to the reality that the country is no longer simply a transit point for the world's most-wanted drug traffickers from places like Mexico and Colombia. For many of these outlaws, Argentina has become a comfortable refuge where many of them lie low while keeping a hand in the industry. Page 6

BACK TO THE SMALL SCREEN
Far back in the history of the Big Screen, back to the 1890s, one looked through a peephole at the top of a Kinetoscope, a waist-high cabinet in which a light illuminated the frames of a continuous film loop.

HEADLINE: A Northwest Pipeline to Silicon Valley

BYLINE: By NICK WINGFIELD

 BODY:
Seattle
SOME budding entrepreneurs and computer whizzes based here in the Pacific Northwest are starting to turn heads down in Silicon Valley.
They are professors and students at the University of Washington, home to what may be the best computer science department you've never heard of.
Although Stanford is considered the Hogwarts of techdom, U.W. has quietly established itself as the other West Coast nexus of the information economy. And while Seattle-area tech icons like Microsoft and Amazon have long relied on U.W. -- pronounced ''U-dub'' by locals -- as an incubator of talent and ideas, the Valley's hottest companies have been getting the message, too.
Their executives have begun streaming up the coast to Seattle, fueled by a talent arms race for programmers. Facebook, Zynga and Google have opened offices in the area, trying to woo U.W. engineers who'd rather live here, where taxes and home prices are lower, even if mist and dark skies envelop the scenery for much of the year. 
''It's the most underrated computer science department I've seen,'' said Ari Steinberg, a Facebook engineer who runs the company's Seattle office, which opened in early 2010.
The university's computer science and engineering department, ensconced on a patch of land near Husky Stadium and Lake Washington, has come a long way since the early 1970s. During that time, two Seattle teenagers, Bill Gates and Paul G. Allen, honed programming skills by sneaking into the department to tinker on its computers. The department's stature began to pick up in the 90s, as the university began to significantly expand its computer science faculty with new stars like Oren Etzioni.
At the same time, Microsoft, the company that Mr. Gates and Mr. Allen founded, jump-started the Seattle technology scene and many fortunes along with it. Mr. Gates, Mr. Allen and others became big contributors, helping the university build a new home for its computer science program.
In recent years, the department has deepened its ties with tech companies like Google, helping to gain an edge in teaching programming for the cloud, a big trend in computing.
In the most recent rankings by U.S. News & World Report, the graduate program placed seventh in the nation, right behind Cornell and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. (Tied for first were Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of California, Berkeley.)
The U.W. department's growing recognition has been a blessing for its students, who are getting juicier job offers with top companies. But some Seattle technology executives say the competition is crimping the city's homegrown technology scene, making it into something like a colony of Silicon Valley.
According to the university, some 35 percent of its computer science graduates end up working at Amazon, Google or Microsoft in a typical year; 15 percent go to other big companies and 30 percent to small companies or start-ups. More than 80 percent of the program's students come from Washington State, and the same percentage end up staying in the state after graduating, even if they work for companies based in Silicon Valley.
The biggest problem with the university's program is that it can't turn out graduates fast enough. Engineers are in short supply in the computer field generally, but this is a particular concern in the Seattle tech market.
''We need that program to be a lot bigger,'' says Spencer Rascoff, chief executive of Zillow, a real estate Web site based in Seattle.
IN a conference room at the university, overlooking the sparkling waters of Lake Washington, Christophe Bisciglia told a crowd of dozens of students what his secret weapon was: them.
Mr. Bisciglia, 31, an entrepreneur and former star Google engineer, was visiting during the spring to speak on a panel about start-ups to computer science students. He said he has gained an ''unfair advantage'' for WibiData, his new San Francisco-based company, by recruiting from the university's computer science department, where two-thirds of his employees once studied.
''Down in the Valley, it's all Stanford this and that,'' said Mr. Bisciglia, himself a U.W. graduate. ''While they turn out students that are good, U.W. turns out students that are every bit as good.''
The deep connections between U.W.'s computer science program and the Seattle tech scene are written on the wall, literally. The department is housed in the Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science and Engineering, a brick-and-glass building with a soaring, six-story atrium in the center of campus.
The building, which opened in 2003, provided a big boost to the program, adding lab space for robotics experiments and replacing a structure that ''was falling down around us,'' said Ed Lazowska, who joined the computer science department in 1977, and was chairman for eight years.
Mr. Allen was the leading donor for the construction of the building, along with Mr. Gates. Mr. Lazowska holds the Bill & Melinda Gates Chair in Computer Science and Engineering. Many other notables from Seattle tech companies have also contributed money.
Like their peers at Stanford, U.W.'s computer science faculty members say that one of their program's strengths is the engagement between professors and the tech industry that will one day employ most of the graduates. Henry M. Levy, the current department chairman, is a co-founder of two tech start-ups. Mr. Etzioni is a co-founder of several Internet companies that were later acquired, including Farecast, an airfare price prediction service that Microsoft bought for $115 million in 2008.
Along with four Washington graduates, Mr. Etzioni recently formed another company, Decide.com, which helps consumers time their purchases of iPads and other electronics to avoid missing price drops. He is a venture partner at Madrona, a Seattle venture capital firm that invested in Decide.
While Stanford is a famously entrepreneurial environment, where business plans are hatched in dorm rooms, the rap on U.W. computer science students is that they tend to be more risk-averse, reflexively gravitating toward bigger companies for employment.
Mr. Etzioni, though, pushes students to jump into the start-up world. In May, he moderated a panel at the university on the subject with Mr. Bisciglia; Glenn Kelman, C.E.O. of the Web real estate company Redfin; and others. About 60 students peppered the executives with questions about start-up life.
''He's done a great job of creating successful start-ups and of bringing along others,'' said Brad Silverberg, a former Microsoft executive who is now a venture capitalist at Ignition Partners in Bellevue, Wash.
In an interview in his office on campus, Mr. Etzioni conceded that the U.W. brand ''is definitely weaker'' than that of Stanford in computer science, but he says the department has become increasingly competitive. ''The students are so much stronger than they were five or 10 years ago,'' he said.
In May, Seth Cooper, a Washington professor who earned his Ph.D. from the department last year, won the Association for Computing Machinery doctoral dissertation award, one of the field's most prestigious prizes. His dissertation described how video games could be used to solve complex scientific problems. He was a co-creator of one game, Foldit, that harnessed the efforts of tens of thousands of players to solve the structure of a protein useful in the fight against H.I.V.
Sidhant Gupta, a Ph.D. student in computer science, is working on low-cost sensing technologies that can help people monitor their energy use. Mr. Gupta, who received his master's degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology, said U.W. is a collegial environment where experts in different computer science disciplines are encouraged to collaborate.
''It feels like one big family,'' said Mr. Gupta, who passed up offers at M.I.T. and other schools to study at Washington. ''No one is trying to back-stab you to get ahead of you. That's really different than other programs.''
Still, when Mr. Gupta went back to his native India and told his friends he was going to U.W., they told him they had never heard of it.
WASHINGTON was one of the earliest schools to teach undergraduates how to program for the cloud, where software sometimes needs to run on thousands of machines at the same time, rather than on a single one. In 2006, Mr. Bisciglia, then a Google engineer, persuaded his boss to let him teach a course at his alma mater about writing software for huge clusters of computers.
Mr. Bisciglia said he taught the course for three academic quarters. By the end, Google had hired half the students in the classes, an unusual move. ''Google doesn't hire half of any group of people,'' he said.
Mr. Lazowska said the university turned away about three-quarters of all U.W. students who apply to major in computer science because it doesn't have the faculty to educate them, even though there is huge demand for engineers. Belt-tightening has reduced state money for U.W. as a whole by nearly 50 percent since 2009, according to the university.
''This is having a serious impact,'' he said, ''on the ability of small companies to grow and succeed and big companies to hire locally.''
Recognizing this, the university recently agreed to increase the budget of the computer science department, which will allow it to grant a third more degrees over the next few years, according to Mr. Lazowska.
He is also looking elsewhere for help. This year, he sent an e-mail to Jeff Bezos, the Amazon C.E.O., asking if he would endow two professorships for experts in the field of machine learning whom the university wanted to hire: Carlos Guestrin of Carnegie Mellon and Emily B. Fox of the University of Pennsylvania. Within 48 hours, Mr. Bezos responded that he would not personally finance the positions, but that Amazon would, Mr. Lazowska said.
Ty Rogers, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment on Amazon's funding of the professorships and Mr. Bezos's involvement in recruiting the professors. In an earlier interview, Susan Harker, director of global talent acquisition at Amazon, described the U.W. as one of the Internet retailer's ''very top pipelines'' for talent.
In March, as they were considering the offer, Mr. Guestrin and Ms. Fox, who are engaged, visited the university and were impressed that Amazon's C.E.O. personally showed up to help persuade them to join the school. ''I've never heard of this,'' Mr. Guestrin said. ''It made a tremendous difference for us.''
The two, part of a wave of new hires in the past few months, begin teaching at the university in the fall.
Correction: July 15, 2012, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the computer science program at the University of Washington misstated the amount of time that Christophe Bisciglia, an entrepreneur and engineer, taught a course there. It was three academic quarters, not semesters; the university uses a quarter system.

HEADLINE: The Times Does Iceland

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Bruised but healing? Not too bad. 

 BODY:
A nice piece. By the way, here are some comparative unemployment numbers (experimenting with the OECD graphics; maybe not again):
I put in Estonia because it's suddenly fashionable; for some reason the OECD didn't have Latvia. Anyway, I think the interesting contrast is between Ireland and Iceland; remember, Ireland was supposed to be a role model.
I guess I should say some more about the relevance of the Icelandic sort-of miracle. For the most part, Iceland's lesson is relevant to countries that experienced big capital inflows followed by a sudden stop -- that is, the European periphery, not the US or the UK. What it demonstrated was the usefulness of devaluation (and therefore of having your own currency), and the case for temporary capital controls in an emergency. Also the case for letting creditors of private banks gone wild eat the losses.
Iceland did not engage in fiscal stimulus; it didn't have to, given the kick from a huge depreciation of the currency. It did, however, have a quite effective program of mortgage debt relief that is a role model for countries like the United States.
And more broadly, Iceland is a dramatic demonstration of the wrongness of conventional wisdom in these times. Ireland did everything it was supposed to; nobody would describe it as "healing". Iceland broke all the rules, and things are not too bad.

HEADLINE: Banking Official Faces Panel in Barclays Scandal

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Paul Tucker, a deputy governor of the British central bank and considered a candidate to succeed the current governor, will testify on the Barclays rate-rigging scandal on Monday. 

 BODY:
10:15 a.m. | Updated 
LONDON - The scandal over the manipulation of global interest rates until now has mostly put bankers in the spotlight. But the focus on Monday will turn to the regulators, both on what they did and what they did not do.
Paul Tucker, a deputy governor at the Bank of England, will give evidence on whether senior government officials put pressure on Barclays to lower its submissions to the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. Barclays agreed in late June to pay some $450 million to settle accusations from United States and British authorities that its traders and senior executives had manipulated the rate, which underpins trillions of dollars of corporate loans, home mortgages and derivatives around the world.
On Monday, the European Commission waded into the fray after Michel Barnier, the financial services commissioner, said he would propose amendments to draft market abuse legislation that would outlaw the manipulation of Libor and other benchmark rates. 
Mr. Tucker's testimony could put him at loggerheads with Robert E. Diamond Jr., the former chief executive of Barclays, who told the same committee last week that the Bank of England, as well as the Financial Services Authority of Britain and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, had repeatedly been informed about the issue, but had not moved to stop it. 
 After resigning last Tuesday, Mr. Diamond released an e-mail last week that indicated that Mr. Tucker had questioned why the bank was submitting rates consistently higher than rivals, a sign of relatively poor health. 
How Mr. Tucker responds promises to be a pivotal in the central banker's career. The 54-year-old Cambridge graduate is a leading candidate to replace Mervyn King next year in the top job as the governor of the Bank of England, one of the world's most important central banks. 
 "The focus will be on whether his recollection tallies with what Bob Diamond told us," said Pat McFadden, a Labour member of Parliament who sits on the committee overseeing Mr. Tucker's testimony. "We want to know if anyone at the Bank of England or in other government departments asked Barclays to lower its Libor submissions."
Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Tucker declined to comment.
The intense scrutiny confronting Mr. Tucker follows a career spanning more than three decades at the Bank of England. After brief stints in the 1980s at the British bank Baring Brothers and with the Hong Kong government, he rose through the ranks to become the British central bank's deputy governor in charge of financial stability in 2009. 
Mr. Tucker also is a leading figure in global efforts to overhaul financial regulation. Along with his Bank of England duties, he currently holds senior positions at both the Financial Stability Board and the Global Economy Meeting, whose memberships comprise officials from the world's leading central banks.
Unlike some other regulators, Mr. Tucker is known for his practical understanding of both the financial markets and the current effort to provide extra financing support to prop up British banks, according to several of his current and former colleagues, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the importance of his testimony on Monday.
"He would be a good man for the top job" at the Bank of England, said one of the people. "He understands banks and is a naturally bright guy who gets how the financial system works." 
Mr. Tucker's reputation, however, has been tarnished by the Libor scandal. The British government will start its search for a new central bank chief toward the end of the year. 
Analysts say other potential candidates, like Gus O'Donnell, a recently retired high-ranking British civil servant, may benefit from Mr. Tucker's involvement in the Barclays' rate manipulation affair. "Intellectually, he's not up to the job," said David Blanchflower, a British economist who sat on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee with Mr. Tucker from 2006 to 2009. "Every single call since 2007, he has got wrong."
 Mr. Blanchflower points to a Bank of England meeting in November 2007 led by Mr. Tucker when a number of officials raised concerns that Libor submissions were lower than market rates. "He was told about the problem, but didn't do anything about it," Mr. Blanchflower added.
A lot now depends on Mr. Tucker's testimony. In a highly unusual step for a British government official, the central bank's deputy governor released a statement last week, requesting to give evidence to the British parliamentary committee "as soon as possible."
His testimony is expected to center primarily on a phone call with Mr. Diamond in late October 2008. Last week, the former Barclays chief told the parliamentary committee that Mr. Tucker had expressed concerns from senior British politicians that Barclays' Libor submissions were higher than those of rivals.
Mr. Diamond then e-mailed Jerry del Missier, a top deputy, about the conversation, saying that Mr. Tucker had stated that it "did not always need to be the case that we appeared as high as we have recently," according to documents released by Barclays.
Mr. del Missier, who also resigned last week because of the rate manipulation scandal, then directed employees to keep the submitted rates lower, or at least in line with rivals. His actions, some regulators say, were a result of a "miscommunication," rather than instructions from Mr. Tucker.
Mr. Diamond has said that he did not tell senior executives to lower the bank's Libor rate submissions. The former Barclays chief also said that he had been told only last month about the activity, which occurred amid the financial crisis.
"I was unaware that Jerry had the impression that Tucker's phone call was taken as an instruction" to alter the rate, he told the committee.
The involvement of senior British officials has appeared to deflect some of the attention of the scandal away from Barclays. Some of the firm's traders also had been altering Libor to benefit their own trading positions as far back as 2005.
Yet British politicians have expressed skepticism that the Bank of England actually put pressure on Barclays to change its Libor rates. Some contend that the conversations were part of officials' ongoing checks on one of the country's largest financial institutions at the height of a financial crisis.
"I doubt the Bank of England was leaning on Barclays to lower its Libor submissions," Mr. McFadden, the British politician, said. "In the end, Barclays already had been doing that for years."

HEADLINE: Our Spoiled, Rotten Children

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: We know we're terrible, overindulgent parents raising a generation of spoiled kids, but some of us are still happy to read about it again. 

 BODY:
How many people have sent you a link for Elizabeth Kolbert's "Spoiled Rotten" from The New Yorker? How many times has it rolled by your Facebook page (98,000 likes and counting)? And how did you feel about your parenting after you read it, assuming you're still actively in the game? 
"With the exception of the imperial offspring of the Ming dynasty and the dauphins of pre-Revolutionary France, contemporary American kids may represent the most indulged young people in the history of the world," Ms. Kolbert writes, early on. "It's not just that they've been given unprecedented amounts of stuff," adding, "They've also been granted unprecedented authority." American parents are raising a generation of "adultescents," she writes. We don't say no. We tie their shoes. We do their chores. And so it goes, until the final self-condemnatory passage (Ms. Kolbert says she's by no means innocent of committing our national failure): 
Letting things slide is always the easiest thing to do, in parenting no less than in banking, public education and environmental protection. A lack of discipline is apparent these days in just about every aspect of American society. Why this should be is a much larger question, one to ponder as we take out the garbage and tie our kids' shoes. 
You would think that by now, the response to this might be a collective yawn. Yes, yes, we know. We are all terrible parents: we hover too much, except when we spend too much time texting while we ignore our little darlings shouting "watch me, watch me!" in the park. We (this is an upper-middle-class "we," of course) do their homework for them, except when we push them too hard to do too much homework to get into college. We're a nation of schizophrenic enablers, raising children who will be economically defenseless in the face of French children who could make cupcakes at age 3 and the children of the Matsigenka tribe in the Peruvian Amazon: calm, self-sufficient and boiling crustaceans at 6. We know all that. Time to accept it, or change.
Still, every time I read an article like Ms. Kolbert's, instead of shrugging, I panic. I lie awake for hours, obsessing. My children clear their plates, but one keeps forgetting to put them in the dishwasher. They take out the trash, but sometimes not without protest. They can get through an amusement park without asking for a souvenir, but put up an unholy fuss at bedtime. Are we doing enough, or doing too much? Surely that Matsigenka child, transplanted to our home, would not only throw away her Popsicle stick (a standard it took years of nagging to achieve) but would also make sure there was a trash bag in the can.
The result is usually renewed effort to achieve some unquantifiable standard of "right": a refreshed chore chart, like the one pictured, listing the same chores and responsibilities, with a new rule -- do them without being reminded or we'll dock your $1-per-year-of-age allowance by 50 cents. Conversations, after bedtime, about what we have done to prompt one child's nightly insistence that she cannot sleep (she cannot, not ever), and how to make it stop, or about how to end the inevitable jockeying over the one step stool and the one sink that nearly always ends in tears. Attempts to reduce the buying of birthday presents, and to encourage valuing and caring for the things we have.
Those shifts and conversations (which I'm reasonably sure are echoed in, at the very least, the houses of every fellow parent who forwarded me the article), and the excellent writing that Ms. Kolbert brings to every subject are the reasons I read, and reread, "Spoiled Children." They are the reasons I have already pre-ordered "Life at Home in the 21st Century," even though I already have "Affluenza." They are also the reasons "Teach Your Children Well" and the guest poster Kay Wyma's "Cleaning House" are on my nightstand, while "Slouching Toward Adulthood" waits in my Kindle, though I already own "Too Much of a Good Thing" and many more.
Every time we reconsider, we do things a little differently. Every book I buy or article I read isn't so much a mistake I won't make as much as it is more time I've spent thinking about how I want to do this thing that my husband I have taken on: raising four children into resilient, self-supporting, connected adults capable of eventually raising children of their own. 
So, fine. Bring on my spoiled, horrible children (actually, at the moment, three of mine and two friends are swarming the playhouse on the lawn, waiting for me to take them to the pool). I will remember, again, that they have an allowance so that they can buy their own candy at the snack bar. I will have them carry the chairs and the bag. I will remember that it is their privilege to have a pool to go to, and tomorrow morning, when it's cool, we will each weed one bed of the vegetable garden.
Ms. Kolbert is right about one thing, for certain: it's easier to let those things slide (especially the garden). Today is one more day when I know I won't. By next month, or next year, I may need another book or article reminding me of my failures to push me where I hope to go. I'm not worried, though: when I need it, it will be there.

HEADLINE: The Hollowing Out

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: Is technological innovation driving a permanent future of joblessness? 

 BODY:
Menlo Park, Calif.
It has become a campaign ritual. Immediately after the release of unemployment figures on the first Friday of every month, Democratic and Republican spin shifts into high gear.
"Our mission is not just to get back to where we were before the crisis. We've got to deal with what's been happening over the last decade, the last 15 years - manufacturing leaving our shores, incomes flat-lining - all those things are what we've got to struggle and fight for," Obama declared at the Dobbins School in Poland, Ohio.
Romney took the opposite tack in Wolfeboro, N.H.: "This is a time for America to choose whether they want more of the same; whether unemployment above 8 percent month after month after month is satisfactory or not. It doesn't have to be this way. America can do better and this kick in the gut has got to end."
Both candidates are only tinkering at the edges of the most important issue facing the United States: the hollowing out of the employment marketplace, the disappearance of mid-level jobs.
The issue of the disappearing middle is not new, but credible economists have added a more threatening twist to the argument: the possibility that a well-functioning, efficient modern market economy, driven by exponential growth in the rate of technological innovation, can simultaneously produce economic growth and eliminate millions of middle-class jobs.
Michael Spence, a professor at N.Y.U.'s Stern School of Business, and David Autor, an economist at M.I.T., have argued that this "hollowing out" process is a result of twin upheavals: globalization and the hyper-acceleration of technological progress.
Just two weeks ago at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Alan Krueger, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, stressed this theme:
If you look at the decade before the recession, the U.S. economy was not creating enough jobs, particularly not enough middle class jobs, and we were losing manufacturing jobs at an alarming rate even before the recession. And I would also put together, combined with those two problems, the polarization of the U.S. job market, the fact that we are getting more and more people at the very top and the very bottom and the middle has been shrinking.
In recent months, Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, and Andrew McAfee, a research scientist at M.I.T.'s Center for Digital Business, have raised the stakes in this discussion with the publication of "Race Against the Machine" and a collection of accompanying essays and papers by the authors.
McAfee has graphically illustrated the key findings that worry him and Brynjolfsson. The red line in the figure below, the employment to population ratio, tracks the ratio of the number of people working to the total number of working-age men and women in the United States.
On his blog, McAfee explains the graphic:
Since the Great Recession officially ended in June of 2009 G.D.P., equipment investment, and total corporate profits have rebounded, and are now at their all-time highs. The employment ratio, meanwhile, has only shrunk and is now at its lowest level since the early 1980s when women had not yet entered the workforce in significant numbers. So current labor force woes are not because the economy isn't growing, and they're not because companies aren't making money or spending money on equipment. They're because these trends have become increasingly decoupled from hiring - from needing more human workers. As computers race ahead, acquiring more and more skills in pattern matching, communication, perception, and so on, I expect that this decoupling will continue, and maybe even accelerate.
This view is controversial - especially McAfee's argument that the decoupling of jobs from other positive economic developments "will continue, and maybe even accelerate." In other words, the downward employment and jobs spiral will keep going, driven by structural forces. Policies to ameliorate the process - a shorter work week, a massive investment in education (for example, at the community college level), the disaggregation of complex tasks into simple functions that could be executed by mid-skill workers - may only slow the decline, not stop it. This is a deeply pessimistic vision.
"In my dystopian vision of the future, that red line (in the chart) keeps falling down - or suddenly drops off a cliff," McAfee told The Times, adding: "All of the trends that I see and can identify are contributing to the hollowing out of the economy."
In a videotaped interview on Bloomberg News, Brynjolfsson was somewhat more cautious:
I have to be brutally honest, I don't think Andy and I are sure whether it's different this time around. If you look at the data, this time it seems to be a lot more difficult. So it's possible we are facing a regime change, a fundamental change in the way technology and employment interact with each other.
The Brynjolfsson-McAfee message has been generally well received in the high-tech community. On July 5, McAfee held the attention of an audience of young researchers and prospective entrepreneurs here at Singularity University. For over an hour after his lecture, students met with McAfee to explore the consequences of his argument.
The students' questions:
How much can wealth accumulate for a small slice of the population at the top, while large numbers of people are forced to work for ever lower pay or to drop out of the workforce altogether? For such a future society to function, would wealth need to be (coercively) redistributed from the top to those below, in order for the mass of the jobless population to survive? Who would have power and how would tax and spending policies be determined in such a radically bifurcated, automated, workless society?
Many reviews of "Race Against The Machine" have been favorable, including those in publications supportive of free markets, including the Economist and the Financial Times.
McAfee noted in our interview that some critics have accused him and Brynjolfsson of accepting the "lump of labor fallacy" (the idea that there is a fixed amount of work available) in defiance of economic history. In the aftermath of major periods of technological advance, including the transition from agriculture to industry, employment has grown enormously.
James Hamilton, an economist at the University of California, San Diego, challenged the "Race Against The Machine" thesis in an e-mail to The Times:
I am very skeptical of the claim that technology itself is the problem. In 2005, the average U.S. worker could produce what would have required 2 people to do in 1970, what would have required 4 people in 1940, and would have required 6 people in 1910. The result of this technological progress was not higher unemployment, but instead rising real wages. The evidence from the last two centuries is unambiguous - productivity gains lead to more wealth, not poverty. The unemployment since 2007 was not caused by gains in productivity or increased automation, but instead by loss of demand for the product that the workers had been producing, for example, a plunge in the demand for new home construction.
Amar Bhidé, author of the book "The Venturesome Economy," and senior fellow at the Center for Emerging Market Enterprises at Tufts, did not mince words responding to a request for comment from The Times:
As you might guess I find the storyline rather unconvincing and Luddite. What's new about automation? I've been banging away for years about the phenomenon of non-destructive creation as a vital complement to creative destruction. The two don't move in lock step but I have no reason to believe that non-destructive creation has ceased. Until someone persuades me it has, I will limit my anxieties to global warming, financial misregulation, a screwed up health care system, etc.
McAfee countered in an e-mail that "this time really is different," arguing:
All previous waves of automation affected only a small subset of human skills and abilities. To oversimplify a bit, the industrial revolution was about building machines that had (much) more brute strength than we did. For all mental work, the industrial revolution was meaningless - you still needed people.
Until recently, the digital revolution also didn't affect that many human skills and abilities. Computers became better at math, and at some clerical abilities, but we people were still miles ahead in other areas. So employers needed to hire humans if they wanted to listen to people speak and respond to them, write a report, pattern-match across a large and diverse body of information, and do all the other things that modern knowledge workers do.
Employers also needed people if they wanted lots of physical tasks done, including driving a truck or vacuuming a floor. The same with most tasks involving sensory perception, such as determining if a soccer ball has crossed a goal line.
All of the above abilities have now been demonstrated by digital technologies, and not just in the lab, but in the real world. So employers are going to switch from human labor to digital labor to execute tasks like those above. In fact, they're already doing so. I expect this process of to accelerate in the future, perhaps rapidly, because computers get cheaper all the time, are very accurate and reliable once they're programmed properly, and don't demand overtime, benefits, or health care.
Brynjolfsson, who is more optimistic, said in an interview with The Times, "we are hopeful that that (job growth) will happen, but there is no guarantee of it. There is no economic law that says everyone benefits from technological improvement." He also pointed out that the surge in inequality driven by rising incomes at the very top of the distribution suggests strongly that the benefits of digitization have not been widely spread.
"The problem is not tech stagnation," as some have argued, "but the opposite," Brynjolfsson contends. "Technology is rushing ahead faster than humans can adapt." The difficulty of human adaptation is, in turn, likely to get worse, he added, because technological innovation - as in Moore's Law (predicting a doubling of computer capacity roughly every two years) - grows exponentially in scope. The total number of non-farm jobs in the country is now 5 million less than in January, 2008. The 3.7 million jobs added to the economy have not been enough to make up for the 8.7 million jobs lost in 2008-9.
Brynjolfsson and McAfee have a list of 19 proposalsthat they support - which range from massive investment in education, infrastructure and basic research, to lowering barriers to business creation, eliminating the mortgage interest deduction and changing copyright and patent law to encourage new (as opposed to protecting old) innovations.
Any effort to ameliorate the damaging consequences to the employment marketplace stemming from technological innovation, according to Brynjolfsson, requires substantial government action at a time when "the political system is the most dysfunctional part of our society."
McAfee and Brynjolfsson argue that in a race against machines, humans will lose. In their view, "the key to winning the race is not to compete against machines but to compete with machines." The question, then, will be whether humans can adapt at anywhere near the pace needed to keep up.

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The car was unloaded by midafternoon, heat rising off the concrete in the vast stadium parking lot on a stifling day in mid-June when burgers might have grilled on the ground. Richard Mize had come early to tailgate and ponder a rare Royals game that had the feel of a special occasion.
''Greinke pitching against us tonight,'' he said, referring to Milwaukee's Zack Greinke, a former Cy Young Award winner with the Royals who lobbied hard after the 2010 season to be traded from one of baseball's worst teams. ''Should be pretty good.''
Mize, 37, had driven with a friend from Boonville, Mo., about 100 miles east of Kansas City, and they were far from alone in a section of the lot that was filling up fast. 
''We're good fans, even though it's been painful to watch for a long time,'' he said. ''I've been following the Royals since the early '80s, back when they were bigger than anybody, when Mr. K was around.''
The spirit of Mr. K, a k a Ewing M. Kauffman, hovers over the modest but charming ballpark that bears his name, though more paternally than hauntingly. Even his shortened handle, which is still spoken here with reverence, suggests organizational ubiquity and baseball immortality.
Twenty-seven years after his greatest triumph, and 19 after his death, Kauffman, the Royals' founding owner, remains the patron saint of Kansas City baseball, the city's guiding luminary as it prepares to host Tuesday night's All-Star Game, its first since 1973.
In the last six years -- or since Kauffman's successor, David Glass, hired Dayton Moore as his general manager -- the long-downtrodden Royals have built one of baseball's best farm systems. With players like third baseman Mike Moustakas, first baseman Eric Hosmer and catcher Salvador Perez, the Royals are believed to be nurturing several future All-Stars. For now, they will be represented Tuesday by designated hitter Billy Butler, a six-year veteran and a rare organizational asset when Moore took over.
While the former Royals outfielder Willie Wilson laments the fact that ''kids born in the '90s have never even seen the Royals win,'' many older fans like Mize, while hopeful that the young Royals are coming, remain tethered to the days when Kansas City was the small-market model, courtesy of Mr. K.
''It all felt so special, so local,'' said Buddy Biancalana, who played shortstop for the Royals' 1985 championship team and fondly recalled Kauffman and his wife, Muriel, poking their heads out of their suite and engaging the crowd during seventh-inning stretches.
The last time baseball's best converged here, in 1973, the Royals were a fifth-year expansion team and moving toward the postseason, which they reached in 1976. During a decade-plus run of excellence, when fans packed what was then Royals Stadium to watch their pitching-rich team play speed ball on artificial turf, Kansas City produced or acquired George Brett, Hal McRae, Amos Otis, Frank White, Dennis Leonard and Bret Saberhagen.
With its crown-topped scoreboard and aesthetically pleasing outfield fountains, Royals Stadium had the feel of a big-league field of dreams.
''Once school was out, from 1977 to 1989 or 1990, every Thursday, Friday and Saturday night was sold out, didn't matter who we were playing,'' said Brett, whose entire 21-year Hall of Fame career was spent in Kansas City and who remains with the Royals as the vice president for baseball operations. ''It became a destination for people from Nebraska, Kansas, from miles and miles away. They would go to amusement parks, take a little family vacation. We had turf for that reason. You'd get torrential downpours, but it could stop at 7, and we'd be playing by 8.''
Back then, the Royals' front office was expertly anchored by Joe Burke and John Schuerholz. The team was assertively managed by Whitey Herzog, Jim Frey and Dick Howser, who died in 1987. Kauffman, a billionaire pharmaceutical magnate and renowned philanthropist, generated fierce loyalty from those who worked and played for him.
''All I can tell you is that my father died when I was 4, and he was the father I never had,'' said Art Stewart, who scouted for the Yankees 50 years ago, signing pitchers Jim Bouton and Doc Medich, before spending the last four decades with Kansas City.
Stewart said that he had seen it all but that he had never known anyone in baseball quite like Kauffman.
''Talk to him for five minutes, and you're ready to run through the center-field wall,'' he said.
Before a spectacular crash, the Royals won six division titles from 1976 to 1985. They took the 1980 pennant, having lost three American League Championship Series to the Yankees, and won it all five years later after rallying from a 3-1 deficit to edge the cross-state St. Louis Cardinals in what was known as the I-70 World Series.
But Kauffman died in 1993, never to know of the two decades of woeful baseball that were to come in his baseball-loving hometown.
''Losing is contagious, and once they started, they couldn't stop,'' said Wilson, the former fleet center fielder who recently returned to live in Kansas City after spending time in Toronto. ''It's been sad to watch.''
The Royals became one of the majors' most consistent ne'er-do-wells, losing 90 or more games 11 times and 100 or more four times. They have not made the postseason since winning the World Series in 1985, and only the Washington Nationals have gone longer without a postseason appearance (1981), dating to their time in Montreal.
After Kauffman died, Glass, a former Wal-Mart executive based in Arkansas, led a board that oversaw operations while an owner was sought to keep the team in Kansas City, as Kauffman had formally stipulated when he put the team into a trust.
''We didn't have an owner for seven years,'' said Stewart, the scout. ''That's what killed us.''
But Schuerholz, who left the Royals in 1990 to build the Atlanta Braves into a National League powerhouse, said that anyone would have paled after Kauffman, who developed baseball's first training academy (in Florida, producing White, a second baseman) and pushed for a baseball-only facility, next door to where the Kansas City Chiefs play football, at the dawn of the era of drab, multipurpose stadiums.
''His mandate for everyone he hired was to be dynamic,'' Schuerholz said. ''He was unique, a visionary, and he had to be to do what he did with an expansion team in that market. People like Mr. K pass our way very infrequently, and when you lose someone like that, the sky is going to dim.''
The $96 million -- what Glass paid for the Royals in 2000 -- question is whether their fate would have been different had Kauffman lived several years longer. His adopted daughter, Julia Irene Kauffman, suggested it might have been, noting that he considered Marion Laboratories to be the family business and the Royals his personal passion.
''This is how baseball happened,'' she said. ''He had some kind of a stroke over in Europe. The doctors ran tests; he had something -- plaque -- flake off and go through his brain. They told him to give up coffee, do some exercise and stop working so damn hard.''
The Royals became so much her father's pride, she said, that he threw parties after the 1985 World Series in which the championship trophy was displayed like a pagan centerpiece. Until his death, Ewing Kauffman watched tapes of the Series while musing aloud, ''I wonder if we're going to score here.''
Julia Irene Kauffman sat at the head of a long table decorated with a bowl of baseballs, and with a miniature replica of the 1985 World Series trophy encased in a corner of the conference room at the headquarters of the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, a nonprofit group that supports education and entrepreneurship.
There is another family foundation in the name of her mother and Ewing's second wife, Muriel McBrien Kauffman, focusing on the arts. There is also the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts in downtown Kansas City and the sprawling Kauffman Gardens across the street from the foundations' building.
The K in Kansas City does not stand for Kauffman, but still, as Julia Irene Kauffman said, ''he touched a lot of lives here.''
In addition to overseeing her father's foundation, she has a seat on the Royals' board of directors. But her exposure to baseball is limited to attending board meetings, raising a few questions about expenditures and collecting stories around town about the glory years when even she addressed the boss -- in the workplace, at least -- as Mr. K.
She had not heard the one about how her father brought the free-agent pitcher and Kansas City native David Cone into his office before the 1992 season and offered him a $9 million signing bonus to return to the organization in which he had started his career.
Ewing Kauffman told Cone that he regretted trading him to the Mets, because Cone was a local boy. ''He wanted to make up for it,'' Cone said. ''He opened his checkbook and said: 'This is coming out of my account. I'll write you the check right now.' ''
Julia Irene Kauffman laughed, smacking the table with her palm. ''What a salesman,'' she said. But it was true, she added, that in the Royals' heyday, Kauffman willingly tapped his personal fortune in his continuing pursuit of George Steinbrenner's Yankees.
On principle, Kauffman was generally loath to playing the free-agent market as it developed from the mid-1970s. In his office at the Royals' stadium, Brett said he believed the Cone signing, as well as some others in the early 1990s, more reflected Kauffman's desire to keep the Royals in contention when he became ill with bone cancer.
''I mean, if you're going to give as much as he did to charity and you're as competitive as he was -- and if you ever played golf or gin with him, you'd know -- it's a good question what he would have done had he lived longer,'' Brett said. ''Would our payroll be $150 million if he were alive today?''
Avron Fogelman, a Memphis-based real estate magnate who purchased almost half of the team in the 1980s and was being groomed as Kauffman's replacement, said the mere suggestion that Kauffman would have gone anywhere near the financial level of where the Steinbrenner family took the Yankees was absurd.
''Ewing and I had discussions about it all the time, and he could see where it was going and that the economics of baseball were only going to get worse,'' Fogelman said in a telephone interview. ''He didn't want to leave the team to his estate; he believed it was time to get out.''
Fogelman's plan to buy out Kauffman disintegrated with heavy real estate losses, and he sold his share in 1990. With the payroll growing and the Royals operating in the red and fading in the standings, Kauffman was one of the earliest owners to rail against the revenue disparities between big and small markets, which would carry the sport to its calamitous players' strike in 1994 and force the cancellation of the World Series.
''Nobody wanted to buy the team,'' Julia Irene Kauffman said. With his time growing short, her father created the trust, handpicking Glass as its overseer, a choice probably related to Glass's experience at Wal-Mart, long considered to be an enemy of organized labor.
Much as he loved his players, Kauffman, like Glass, was no great fan of their union.
''Never had one at Marion -- he was proud of that,'' Julia Irene Kauffman said. ''He said if you take care of your people, you don't need it.''
But what happens when the company can no longer compete in the prevailing market? It was with that question that the beloved Mr. K made his exit and the newly appointed board -- with Glass as its chairman and each of its well-leveraged members investing money for operational expenses -- took a figurative cleaver to the payroll.
With what he called his succession plan, Kauffman in a sense set up Glass to destroy the Royals, with the long-term goal of saving major league baseball in Kansas City. When Glass formally purchased the team in 2000 -- with net revenue going to charity, as mandated by Kauffman -- he made as much an attempt to compete with the ghost of Mr. K as with the rest of the American League.
''He wasn't around much; it was mainly his son,'' Wilson, the outfielder, said, referring to Dan Glass, who is the Royals' president. ''It was kind of run like a corporation.''
In the early years of David Glass's ownership, the Royals not only lost most of their quality talent, including Johnny Damon and Carlos Beltran, but also let their farm system badly deteriorate. They invested little in the fertile territory of Latin America.
In a 2011 article, former employees told The Kansas City Star that scouts and others were denied basic equipment, even company cellphones, as the Royals cut costs. Brett, who fronted a group that failed in a bid to buy the team, said he had heard that the Royals, in the early 2000s, would pay no more than a $1,000 signing bonus to any drafted player taken after the fifth round.
''Not going to find many good players to sign for that,'' he said. ''You just don't need bodies; you need players.''
Teams like the Oakland Athletics, the Minnesota Twins and the Tampa Bay Rays cultivated young talent, or acquired it for veterans, and were able to win for sustained periods in markets or stadiums less attractive than Kansas City's. Criticism mounted that Glass was mainly interested in profiting from baseball's growing revenue-sharing program, designed to encourage small-market teams to invest in talent.
In 2011, Forbes magazine pegged the Royals' worth at $351 million -- 26th out of the 30 major league teams but far more than Glass had paid 11 years earlier. Forbes added that the Royals were ''among the biggest recipients of welfare from the league's richer teams'' and were likely to turn a healthy profit after payroll reductions. That came after $225 million in taxpayer-financed renovations to Kauffman Stadium in 2009.
Also galling for Kansas City fans was the Cardinals' success -- they have appeared in three World Series since 2004 and won two -- in St. Louis, which has a smaller city but a larger metropolitan-area population.
''I own a lot of apartment developments in both cities, so I know the demographics and economics, and they're quite similar,'' Fogelman said. ''I'm not going to get into it other than to say that it's an astute analogy.''
In the trust, Kauffman had stipulated that a new owner could not quickly profit by reselling the team -- a provision intended to prevent the franchise from being flipped. Lou Smith, who was on the board with Glass during the trust years, said that the profit resale ban had expired but that it might have factored into Glass's reluctance to invest in baseball operations sooner. ''He is a very smart businessman, and I think he was operating in a difficult situation,'' Smith said. ''But I do think he always had the intention of fulfilling Mr. K's wishes and to keep the team in Kansas City.''
For his part, Glass has publicly acknowledged some regrets and mistakes from the early years of his ownership. Early this season, he denied renewed speculation that he was exploring a sale, telling The Star: ''Everybody in baseball knows that I'm committed, and my family is committed, that we're going to own the Royals, and that the Royals are going to be in Kansas City and that we're going to make the team a contender again.''
Glass rarely does interviews and declined one for this article while attending a home series against Milwaukee in mid-June. Before the Royals faced Greinke in the opener, he watched batting practice behind the cage, chatting with Moore, the general manager, who, it has turned out, has become the Royals' best pitchman since Mr. K. Industry colleagues told Moore that he might be committing career suicide if he accepted Glass's offer in 2006 to run the Royals. It made little sense to them that one of baseball's bright young executives, who had already turned down a similar deal with the Boston Red Sox and was comfortably entrenched as Schuerholz's protege in Atlanta, would work for someone with Glass's track record.
But Moore, who grew up a Royals fan in Wichita, Kan., took the same long view he had as an 18-year-old on Oct. 27, 1985, when Saberhagen and the Royals demolished the Cardinals, 11-0, to win the World Series.
''I was right up there watching the game,'' he said while sitting in the dugout, pointing beyond the left-field fence. ''I was up on the I-70 ramp -- seemed like 400 to 500 people. You could see everything but Lonnie Smith in left field.''
Moore had rationalized turning down the Red Sox by telling himself that they had already done the once-in-a-generation thing in 2004, winning the Series after an 86-year wait. Staying in Atlanta to succeed Schuerholz seemed like the safe, comfortable track. But what more could he build? Where was the challenge?
Hence, the old Royals fan was drawn to Kansas City. Moore had heard all about the passionate Royals fan base from Schuerholz and thought: Why not try to do something special? Why not build from the ground up?
Moore recalled Schuerholz telling him: ''I have no doubt that you'll build a system because you know how to do it. But at some point, you're going to have to win at the major league level.'' Moore needed to know that Glass understood how long a process it is to develop potential into major league talent.
Five amateur drafts later, Baseball America ranked the Royals' farm system No. 1 in the majors. Moore said Glass kept his promise to spend on development, open a new academy and bulk up international scouting.
Position players have surged through the system, some more rapidly than others. Raving about Perez, 22, a Venezuela-born catcher who last month came off the disabled list to hit at a torrid pace, Stewart, the scout, said, ''If he doesn't go to the Hall of Fame, I'll go into the furniture business.''
Keeping an eye on his hometown team while broadcasting Yankees games, Cone said, ''Their pitching prospects haven't really come through yet, but their young position players are some of the best in the game, in my opinion.''
Yet the Royals lost 91 games last season, and this season began with a record of 0-10 in their first homestand, making their marketing slogan of ''Our Time'' sound embarrassingly premature. Arm injuries to two of their more heralded young pitchers, Danny Duffy and John Lamb, have not helped.
Nor has Jonathan Sanchez, who has gone 1-5 with a 6.75 earned run average since being acquired from San Francisco for outfielder Melky Cabrera. (Cabrera will return to Kansas City as an All-Star for the N.L.)
Moore said that Schuerholz's warnings of impatience have not materialized.
''Our owner has been very supportive with what we've had to do,'' he said, adding that he had told Glass that the Royals could be a .500 team this season ''if everything goes right,'' which it has not.
But on the night the Royals faced Greinke, handing out promotional ''Hometown Heroes'' T-shirts to fans, Glass watched them play a crisp game, winning, 2-1. The next night, with the Royals trailing by two runs in the ninth inning against the Milwaukee closer John Axford, the homegrown infield corners Moustakas and Hosmer were on base with two outs. Shortstop Alcides Escobar was at the plate.
Escobar, 25, came in the Greinke deal, along with outfielder Lorenzo Cain, pitcher Jeremy Jeffress and a top pitching prospect, Jake Odorizzi. With Escobar entrenched at short and hitting .307, Moore hopes the trade will eventually be viewed as the kind of chicken salad made by the shrewdest small-market general managers -- his Billy Beane baptism.
Against Axford, Escobar tripled in two runs, and the Royals won the game in 11 innings, celebrating at home plate as if they had clinched a divisional title. By the end of June, they had surged to four games below .500 before dropping back to 10 under going into the All-Star break.
''There's no doubt we're making progress, and everybody knows it,'' Butler, an All-Star and a veteran of more losing baseball than he cares to remember, said in the postgame clubhouse. ''We have so much talent up here and more coming up that we didn't have before.''
If and when that talent matures, the question will be to what extremes Glass will go to retain it. Moore acknowledged that the market size would preclude keeping everyone and that it would be up to the scouts to keep the assembly line moving.
For now, he gauges the Royals' progress as much in perception as in reality.
''One thing that's occurred -- and it's the best feeling I've had since I've been here -- is we now have young kids in Kansas City between the ages of, say, 5 and 13, who, if you ask, want to have lunch with Brett and White or Salvador Perez and Mike Moustakas, they're going to choose one of those young guys,'' Moore said. ''And that's the key thing that's happened here and what it's all about for us, to move beyond what was here in the '70s and '80s, beyond Mr. K.''
Last year came reports that Glass was considering peddling corporate naming rights to the ballpark that was renamed for Kauffman one month before his death in 1993. How that revenue-generating strategy, common elsewhere, would play in Kauffman-loving Kansas City remains to be seen.
In the meantime, while the young Royals and their long-suffering fans wait for their time, memories of the good old days and Mr. K still shimmer like twinkling stars across the nighttime Midwestern sky.

HEADLINE: Mitt's Gray Areas

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Once upon a time a rich man named Romney ran for president. He could claim, with considerable justice, that his wealth was well-earned, that he had in fact done a lot to create good jobs for American workers. Nonetheless, the public understandably wanted to know both how he had grown so rich and what he had done with his wealth; he obliged by releasing extensive information about his financial history.
But that was 44 years ago. And the contrast between George Romney and his son Mitt -- a contrast both in their business careers and in their willingness to come clean about their financial affairs -- dramatically illustrates how America has changed. 
Right now there's a lot of buzz about an investigative report in the magazine Vanity Fair highlighting the ''gray areas'' in the younger Romney's finances. More about that in a minute. First, however, let's talk about what it meant to get rich in George Romney's America, and how it compares with the situation today.
What did George Romney do for a living? The answer was straightforward: he ran an auto company, American Motors. And he ran it very well indeed: at a time when the Big Three were still fixated on big cars and ignoring the rising tide of imports, Romney shifted to a highly successful focus on compacts that restored the company's fortunes, not to mention that it saved the jobs of many American workers.
It also made him personally rich. We know this because during his run for president, he released not one, not two, but 12 years' worth of tax returns, explaining that any one year might just be a fluke. From those returns we learn that in his best year, 1960, he made more than $660,000 -- the equivalent, adjusted for inflation, of around $5 million today.
Those returns also reveal that he paid a lot of taxes -- 36 percent of his income in 1960, 37 percent over the whole period. This was in part because, as one report at the time put it, he ''seldom took advantage of loopholes to escape his tax obligations.'' But it was also because taxes on the rich were much higher in the '50s and '60s than they are now. In fact, once you include the indirect effects of taxes on corporate profits, taxes on the very rich were about twice current levels.
Now fast-forward to Romney the Younger, who made even more money during his business career at Bain Capital. Unlike his father, however, Mr. Romney didn't get rich by producing things people wanted to buy; he made his fortune through financial engineering that seems in many cases to have left workers worse off, and in some cases driven companies into bankruptcy.
And there's another contrast: George Romney was open and forthcoming about what he did with his wealth, but Mitt Romney has largely kept his finances secret. He did, grudgingly, release one year's tax return plus an estimate for the next year, showing that he paid a startlingly low tax rate. But as the Vanity Fair report points out, we're still very much in the dark about his investments, some of which seem very mysterious.
Put it this way: Has there ever before been a major presidential candidate who had a multimillion-dollar Swiss bank account, plus tens of millions invested in the Cayman Islands, famed as a tax haven?
And then there's his Individual Retirement Account. I.R.A.'s are supposed to be a tax-advantaged vehicle for middle-class savers, with annual contributions limited to a few thousand dollars a year. Yet somehow Mr. Romney ended up with an account worth between $20 million and $101 million.
There are legitimate ways that could have happened, just as there are potentially legitimate reasons for parking large sums of money in overseas tax havens. But we don't know which if any of those legitimate reasons apply in Mr. Romney's case -- because he has refused to release any details about his finances. This refusal to come clean suggests that he and his advisers believe that voters would be less likely to support him if they knew the truth about his investments.
And that is precisely why voters have a right to know that truth. Elections are, after all, in part about the perceived character of the candidates -- and what a man does with his money is surely a major clue to his character.
One more thing: To the extent that Mr. Romney has a coherent policy agenda, it involves cutting tax rates on the very rich -- which are already, as I said, down by about half since his father's time. Surely a man advocating such policies has a special obligation to level with voters about the extent to which he would personally benefit from the policies he advocates.
Yet obviously that's something Mr. Romney doesn't want to do. And unless he does reveal the truth about his investments, we can only assume that he's hiding something seriously damaging.

HEADLINE: Pondering Solitary Future for Gangster Held in Isolation for Years

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN WEISER

 BODY:
The plea bargaining was long and difficult. The defendant, Peter Rollock, the leader of a Bronx narcotics gang, had been charged in seven killings. Federal prosecutors wanted the death penalty; any plea deal would have to include a mandatory life sentence.
But prosecutors had another demand: because Mr. Rollock, then 25, had been accused of ordering some of the killings from jail, he would be placed in solitary confinement and barred from communicating with virtually all outsiders.
Pistol Pete, as Mr. Rollock was known, agreed to the deal, and in late 2000, he was sent to the federal Supermax prison, as the Administrative Maximum, or ADX, facility in Florence, Colo., is known, and where some of the nation's most infamous criminals are housed. With that, he might have retreated from public view forever.
But Mr. Rollock, now 37, has not retreated. In his nearly 12 years in isolation at the Supermax, he has maintained a spotless record, his lawyers say. He has spent countless hours taking adult education courses through a closed-circuit television in his cell. He has even written a novel, ''Trigga,'' described by his lawyers as a cautionary tale for young gangsters. His family self-published the book; it is available on Web sites like Amazon.com. 
Still, Mr. Rollock's behavior has not led to the most important change he seeks: relaxing the harsh conditions of his confinement and allowing him to enter the prison's general population.
Although Mr. Rollock's deal with the government mandated a review of his status after 18 months, the Bureau of Prisons has consistently refused to ease the restrictions, even though one Supermax supervisor recommended in 2005 that he be placed in the general population.
Federal prosecutors have not wavered in their concerns. To them, Mr. Rollock was a ruthless killer whose gang, Sex, Money and Murder, or S.M.M., terrorized parts of the Bronx and made its presence felt everywhere, ''in the shot-out streetlights, the bullet-riddled buildings and the graffiti with which S.M.M. members memorialize their gang on every available wall,'' the government has written.
The prosecutors argue that their concern about Mr. Rollock's ability to communicate with outsiders, or even with fellow prisoners, is well founded. They have said in court, for example, that while Mr. Rollock was jailed in New York before his sentencing in November 2000, he gave an interview to a magazine that is popular in prisons and disclosed the names of former gang members who had cooperated against him; as a result, the government says, it had to place people in the witness protection program.
''Mr. Rollock's name still has significant cachet on the streets in the Bronx,'' a prosecutor at the time, David M. Rody, told a judge in 2010. He said that he had no doubt what would happen if Mr. Rollock decided to place ''a hit'' on a witness and the message got out to his gang.
''I am not saying he is ordering anything,'' Mr. Rody said, ''but our concern is that if he did, these people would act on it in a heartbeat.''
Mr. Rollock spends 23 hours a day in his cell at the Supermax, and is allowed one hour for exercise. He receives meals through a slot in his door. He is allowed limited calls.
''To me, it's inhumane to keep anybody in solitary confinement for this long,'' Avraham C. Moskowitz, one of Mr. Rollock's lawyers, said. ''He's done everything they've asked of him,'' Mr. Moskowitz added. ''My concern is that he's going to lose his mind.''
Mr. Rollock's story is not that of an innocent man wrongly convicted. When he pleaded guilty in 2000, he admitted in Federal District Court in Manhattan that he had led the violent S.M.M. gang, which had sold crack cocaine and heroin in the Bronx as well as in Pittsburgh and North Carolina.
''We possessed firearms and committed murder,'' he told Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum, describing killings he had carried out or approved from jail.
In one 1993 case, he said, he fatally shot a man who had drawn his gun on a fellow gang member. ''We protected one another,'' Mr. Rollock explained.
In another case, in 1994, he was entering a sneaker store when he saw an associate of another of his recent victims. He fatally shot him, too. ''I knew that he was a danger to me,'' Mr. Rollock said.
While Mr. Rollock (whose name has also been spelled Rollack) was jailed at Rikers Island around late 1995, a federal indictment charges, he joined the Bloods gang and made S.M.M. a kind of local affiliate.
In 1997, after he was transferred to a jail in Charlotte, N.C., to face narcotics charges there, the authorities have said, he sent a coded letter to his girlfriend that led to the murders of two men during an annual Thanksgiving football game between residents of the Soundview and Castle Hill Houses in the Bronx. One victim was thought to be cooperating with the government.
Mr. Rollock was later returned to New York to face the charges that carried the death penalty; at some point, the authorities restricted his ability to communicate from jail, even with his father, Leonard Rollock, who was serving a long sentence in a federal prison elsewhere. ''We have concerns that he may enlist his father to have his father's associates do harm to the witnesses and/or their families,'' a prosecutor wrote then.
Around the time of Peter Rollock's sentencing, the authorities distributed posters in the Bronx that included his photograph and the words ''Life without parole.''
''Former turf: Soundview/Castle Hill,'' the poster reads. ''Current turf: The federal penitentiary. Don't be next!''
The Supermax houses more than 400 of what the Bureau of Prisons calls its most violent and escape-prone inmates. These include Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, who led the first World Trade Center attack; Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber; and Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the so-called underwear bomber. Timothy J. McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, was held there before being executed in 2001 in Terre Haute, Ind.
The typical cell is 7 1/2 feet by 10 feet. In cases where the attorney general finds that allowing a prisoner to communicate with others could result in ''death or serious bodily injury,'' the Bureau of Prisons imposes special administrative measures, or S.A.M.'s, limiting access to mail, calls and visitors, but at least leaving open the possibility of an inmate's ''stepping down,'' that is someday earning an easing of restrictions. But in Mr. Rollock's case, restrictions were imposed as part of the sentence itself, and he claims he was told he would never be allowed into the ''step-down'' program.
Prosecutors agreed last year to modify his deal, and have Mr. Rollock placed under S.A.M.'s instead, but his lawyers argue that his ability to earn his way out of solitary confinement could still take years to accomplish, if it ever occurred.
Mr. Rollock, after arriving at the Supermax in December 2000, threw himself into education, beginning his path toward redemption, his lawyers say. By the end of 2002, he had taken closed-circuit television courses in philosophy, political theory and economics, and he had earned his G.E.D., records show.
Reviews of his status were conducted, but prison officials found him not suitable to be moved in order ''to prevent his contact with cooperating witnesses or former gang members,'' as one memo said.
In 2006, Mr. Rollock appealed to prison officials: ''I have clearly surpassed all program participation requirements and have maintained clear conduct for six years,'' he wrote. He said he wanted to ''begin the process of working my way out'' of the Supermax and into a regular prison. The appeal was unsuccessful.
Meanwhile, he was also writing. In 2006, with the help of family members, his 150-page novel, ''Trigga,'' was published by a print-on-demand company in Alabama. In addition to several early bulk orders, the company said recently, the book had sold 116 copies through Amazon and other outlets. The cover says the book is written by ''Team Rollock,'' but his lawyers say Mr. Rollock was the author.
''Peter wrote the book 'Trigga' in longhand,'' said Kevin M. McNally, another of Mr. Rollock's lawyers. ''It is indeed a cautionary tale for young gang members. Peter meant it to be.''
Supermax officials read the manuscript and allowed it to be sent to family members on his approved list, Mr. McNally said. After the book was published, he added, the prison refused to allow Mr. Rollock to receive a copy.
Prosecutors have made it clear that they believe the book glorifies Mr. Rollock's criminal exploits.
But Mr. Moskowitz, Mr. Rollock's lawyer, countered that the book was a work of fiction, and had left the Supermax with full approval. ''They knew about it, they read it, they let it out,'' he said in court.
The Bureau of Prisons and prosecutors refused to comment on Mr. Rollock's case or the book.
The cover features a photograph of a gun. The novel, written raw, features a character named Tyvon and a drug gang called Money & Murder. The novel ends with Tyvon's being shot; as he dies, he realizes that he has dedicated his life to the street, trying to increase his ''money stacks.''
''But what did I accomplish?'' he asks. ''If all fast money does is hurt, can someone please explain what is its worth? The average street kid wont' makes it out of his 20s before he is place in the dirt.''
By the end of 2006, Mr. Rollock had accumulated more than 1,400 hours of closed-circuit television courses, including Classical Mythology, the Joy of Science and History of Ancient Rome; he had also viewed a program in anger management.
''Other prisoners at ADX have gone insane under such conditions,'' Mr. McNally said. ''Peter has not. He continues to educate himself every day. He takes advantage of exercise when available.''
Nonetheless, prosecutors remained strongly opposed to easing the conditions of Mr. Rollock's confinement; they have noted that his reputation from the street endures. In recent years, they say, ''Pistol Pete'' graffiti has been found in the Bronx, and during arrests and searches of Bloods members who had nothing to do with S.M.M., authorities have uncovered ''Bloods literature and materials which talk all about Peter Rollock,'' Mr. Rody, the prosecutor, told Judge Cedarbaum in 2010.
If Mr. Rollock were allowed to mix with other prisoners, he could pass messages through inmates who were not subject to communications restrictions, Mr. Rody said, adding, ''He knows who cooperated against him and the rest of his organization.''
A current prosecutor, Margaret M. Garnett, said last year in court that Mr. Rollock and his family had been discussing a business called Team Rollock, which would ''monetize and capitalize'' on his reputation on the street. She even cited talk of Team Rollock T-shirts, with a rifle sight as the ''primary design element.''
''Mr. Rollock's efforts to continue to capitalize on that, encourage it, foment it,'' she said, ''continue to give us security concerns.''
Mr. Moskowitz says that since Mr. Rollock's ''communications are strictly monitored, if the government had any objections to what he said or wrote, it would have prevented the communications.''
As for Mr. Rollock, his book seems to address the possibility his status may never change. ''Freedom, prison or death,'' Tyvon ruminates. ''The two negatives were stacked up against the positive. But that was the life he chose. Of course he didn't want to die or go to prison,'' he added. ''But he was prepared for it if it came to that.''

HEADLINE: Mali's Tomb Raiders

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN F. SOARES. 
Benjamin F. Soares, a senior researcher at the African Studies Centre in Leiden, the Netherlands, is a co-editor of ''Islam and Muslim Politics in Africa.''

 BODY:
Amsterdam
IN the past week, Islamists have destroyed and desecrated the tombs of Muslim saints in the fabled town of Timbuktu in northern Mali, recalling the Taliban's 2001 destruction of two giant Buddhas in Bamiyan, Afghanistan.
In defiance of the West and many local Muslims, Islamists in northern Mali are prohibiting people from worshiping at tombs and erecting structures on graves. Although both practices are widespread throughout the Muslim world, religious extremists consider them un-Islamic and are seeking to stamp them out.
Long a darling of Western donors and hailed as one of the few democracies in the Muslim world, the poor, landlocked country of Mali has descended into chaos since low-ranking military officers seized power from President Amadou Toumani Toure in March, just weeks before scheduled elections. Arms flowing in from postwar Libya have made the situation worse and American and European policy makers have so far been much too timid in responding to the crisis. 
Western donors have indulged Mali, as its governing elites enriched themselves and levels of corruption skyrocketed. In recent years, the north became a safe haven for extremist Salafi Muslims pushed out of neighboring Algeria after its civil war ended in 2002. After rebranding themselves as Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Salafis were able to operate fairly freely in northern Mali and attract recruits eager to engage in jihad.
In Mali, such jihad has frequently been mixed with kidnapping Europeans and seeking ransoms, drug trafficking and other criminal activities. Indeed, Mali has become an important node in the drug trade as Latin American cocaine passes through the Sahara en route to Europe and the Middle East. This lucrative trade has tempted many Malians, including government officials, who have profited handsomely from it.
However, it was the NATO-supported collapse of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's government in Libya that had the most serious consequences for Mali. Many Malian members of the Tuareg ethnic group, who had long lived in Libya, returned home, heavily armed with weaponry from Qaddafi's arsenals. Some joined the ranks of the secular National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad, known by the French initials M.N.L.A.
In the wake of the March coup, various armed groups filled the power vacuum in the north: the M.N.L.A.; Islamists known as Ansar Dine, who are intent on applying Shariah across Mali; and fighters affiliated with Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. These militants easily took over the northern half of the country, including Timbuktu, after facing little resistance from a Malian army that had almost completely evaporated.
The M.N.L.A.'s sympathizers have long thought the secularist group could be used to fight against Al Qaeda and Islamists; France, Algeria and Mauritania have therefore supported them. But the M.N.L.A. seriously miscalculated in April, when it declared the independence of Azawad, the territory it claims in northern Mali, and then received no international backing. Ansar Dine and its Al Qaeda allies soon outmaneuvered the M.N.L.A. and its backers, and Islamists now seem to be in control of most of the north and quite likely have a grip on the criminal networks that run through the region. There is also a looming humanitarian disaster: Mali's economy has ground to a halt, many displaced persons have fled the north, and there are indications that famine could affect the country in the coming months.
Meanwhile, the Malian government and the coup plotters have been completely ineffectual. Thus far, they have done nothing to improve the security situation in the north, nor have they provided any humanitarian assistance.
Many Malians are now openly calling for war to retake control of the north. Citizens are forming militias to liberate their towns from the rebels and the Islamists. The destruction of tombs in Timbuktu will anger only more people, encouraging them to join or support these militias. And any concessions by the government to northern rebels or Islamists could lead to another coup or even civil war.
Mali's citizens are looking to the Economic Community of West African States, the United Nations, the United States and even the much-mistrusted former colonial power, France, to take the lead. And they must. A United Nations mandate allowing regional organizations like Ecowas and the African Union to send an armed stabilization force and peacekeepers could stop the situation from deteriorating further.
Despite considerable investment in counterterrorism in the region, Mali remains relatively marginal to American foreign policy. But it would be a huge mistake for the United States and Europe to let the problems in Mali fester any longer or idly sit by while Islamists become entrenched in the north, attract even more recruits, and possibly threaten the stability of the entire region.

HEADLINE: As Brooklyn Gentrifies, Some Neighborhoods Are Being Left Behind

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
For much of the past century, Brooklyn was the Rodney Dangerfield of boroughs, known for its blue-collar style, for its funny accent and, of course, for getting no respect.
Then came the brownstone homesteaders and the bohemian pioneers. They turned lunch-bucket warrens in Park Slope, Dumbo and Williamsburg into glamorous destinations, drawing a flood of well-schooled young men and women who were attracted by quaint yet affordable homes, outdoor cafes, bicycle lanes and the neighborhoods' sometimes self-parodying artisanal, sustainable and locavore ethos.
Brooklyn somehow, against all odds, became an internationally recognized icon of cool.
The sudden physical and cultural transformation has been endlessly debated. Yet to many longtime residents in some of the borough's unaffected corners -- in the rough-edged and timeless Brooklyn that has endured in places like Gerritsen Beach, Marine Park, Sheepshead Bay, Brownsville and East New York -- the renaissance is still being watched with amusement, nervousness and even dismay. 
In these neighborhoods, rarely mentioned in the city's tourist literature, some shrug off the re-branding of their home borough as so much tinsel or distant thunder having little to do with their lives, while others worry about being forgotten altogether. Still others express outright resentment that they have not enjoyed the fruits of Brooklyn's more modish reputation. Shuttered factories in places like Dumbo remind them of lost jobs rather than the expensive lofts that beckon from glossy advertisements.
''I'm glad Brooklyn is making a name for itself and it's coming up, but if it's coming up, it should be spread out,'' said Joycelyn Maynard, who runs the Stone Avenue Library, a nearly 100-year-old branch in Brownsville, an area struggling with unemployment, foreclosed homes, troubled schools and gang shootings. ''I think they pay more attention to parts of Brooklyn that are gentrified.''
''Even in certain parts of Bedford-Stuyvesant you find a cafe table to sit out in the sun,'' Ms. Maynard added. ''Here, how can you have a cafe where people eat in the sun if they're concerned about gangs shooting each other?''
In middle-class enclaves like Gerritsen Beach -- home to generations of police officers, firefighters and post office workers, where weekends are often for worship and backyard barbecues -- fashionable Brooklyn spots like Park Slope or Boerum Hill might as well be a foreign country.
''I enjoy happening places and I would enjoy the restaurants, and I'm glad it's getting to be on the map,'' said Jennifer Avena, whose family roots in Gerritsen Beach stretch decades. ''But keep it there.''
The city's most populous borough remains stunningly diverse. Neighborhoods like Red Hook and Bedford-Stuyvesant mix lives side by side, though not always comfortably. But a look at some of the typical signs of gentrification, income and education shows that sections of the borough are increasingly on divergent tracks.
In the community district that embraces Park Slope and Carroll Gardens, the proportion of households earning over $100,000 rose to 43 percent in 2010 from 28 percent in 1990. In Brownsville and Ocean Hill, the number stayed flat, around 9 percent, while those earning under $25,000 rose to 46 percent from 43 percent, according to a study of household income by Susan Weber-Stoger, a Queens College sociology research associate.
In Williamsburg and Greenpoint, the proportion of residents holding graduate degrees quadrupled to 12 percent; in East New York and Starrett City, it remained 4 percent.
Assemblyman Hakeem S. Jeffries, who recently won the Democratic primary for a Congressional seat that serves gentrifying Fort Greene and Prospect Heights as well as Brownsville and East New York, said: ''The poorer neighborhoods were devastated by the collapse of the economy and have not meaningfully recovered.''
''The sidewalk cafes are great,'' he said, ''but we need a blueprint for employment and housing opportunities that are desperately needed in parts of Brownsville and East New York. We should continue to promote Brooklyn as a trendy destination but cannot forget the bread-and-butter economic issues that many distressed Brooklynites continue to deal with each day.''
Some of the same sentiment can be heard as well in the more affluent traditional enclaves, where there is a feeling that city officials may not respond as swiftly to routine complaints about municipal services. Greg Borruso, president of the Marine Park Civic Association, said the residents of his south shore neighborhood ''are constantly reminding elected officials we're here, we're a voting area, we take care of our homes and of each other, and we want to make sure you don't forget us.''
''What happens when you're not in the paper a lot and on TV, you're kind of forgotten,'' he said, ''so when we ask for something we don't always get the same response.''
In Sunset Park, a neighborhood bustling with Chinese and Mexican immigrants, there has been bitterness that the city has not until this year heeded complaints that four-day-a-week street cleaning forces car owners to endlessly circle blocks looking for parking spaces. By contrast, the more politically muscular residents of southern Park Slope next door have had two-day-a-week street cleaning for many years.
Complaints about being overlooked are echoed in neighborhoods like Brownsville. Al Mathieu, 38, who has operated the Black Success Unisex barbershop for 15 years, says his neighborhood is being ignored by the city and developers. ''They're putting money in those neighborhoods, but not in this one,'' he said. ''There's very little private development.''
Even when residents who feel slighted welcome the resurrection of shopworn neighborhoods like Williamsburg into magnets for writers, celebrities and top chefs, the culture and value system there sometimes seem as foreign as the high-concept farm-to-table offerings at the Brooklyn Sandwich Society. They cited the idea of boycotting products as a political protest, a proposal that was heatedly debated by Park Slope's food cooperative in regard to Israeli foods.
''You'd never see anything like that here,'' said George R. Broadhead, head of the property owners association of Gerritsen Beach, on Brooklyn's south shore.
Ms. Avena, 35, said the greater availability of organic vegetables or sustainable, grass-fed beef in a place like Park Slope holds no appeal. ''If they think it's healthy, it's fine with me,'' she said. ''But it's not for me.''
In Marine Park, Mr. Borruso, a hardware merchant, spurns the gourmet restaurants on Smith Street for a dinner out at Michael's Restaurant, a 40-year-old spot in his seaside neighborhood, which has reliable food and, just as important, a place to park.
''Did you ever try to find a parking spot in Brooklyn Heights or Park Slope?'' he said.
Theresa Scavo, chairwoman of Community Board 15, which includes Homecrest, Sheepshead Bay, Manhattan Beach and Gerritsen Beach, is proud of a polyglot domain that is peopled with Irish- and Italian-Americans, Syrian Jews, thriving Soviet immigrants and a growing number of Asian newcomers. Residents have adopted quite traditional lifestyles, preferring houses and apartment buildings with manicured lawns to reimagined 19th-century row houses.
''Here, everything remains the same,'' Ms. Scavo said. ''They don't want Trader Joe's. They don't want sidewalks crowded with cafes. They want a residential, suburban lifestyle. We're not looking for innovative ways to do things. I have a hard time setting up a DVR.''
Most residents, Ms. Scavo said, shrug off Brooklyn's glossy new neighborhoods and are not interested in emulating them.
''When people hear about the new Brooklyn, they say let them have it,'' she said.

Re ''Home-Care Workers Aren't Just 'Companions','' by Eileen Boris and Jennifer Klein (Op-Ed, July 2): 
At-home caregivers provide a valuable service to the elderly and people with disabilities by giving them the option of leading a more independent life. A proposed rule under consideration by the Obama administration would take that opportunity away.
The change will hurt the care Americans receive from these trained professionals by driving up costs and possibly forcing families to put loved ones in institutionalized care, which is more expensive and often paid through Medicaid, already straining state budgets.
That's why the National Disability Leadership Alliance, a coalition of 14 disability organizations, expressed concern with the change. Those receiving care will not be the only ones adversely affected. Caregivers could see reduced hours to avoid overtime costs.
Furthermore, state laws already govern wage issues for at-home caregivers. These concerns prompted me and more than a dozen of my colleagues to introduce legislation preserving the 1975 law threatened by the proposed change.
This legislation is not about keeping skilled professionals ''in the shadows of the low-wage economy,'' as the Op-Ed writers stated. It's about preserving the time-tested, high-level care millions of Americans depend on every day.

HEADLINE: A Light Approach to a Grim Issue: Suicide Prevention

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
ADVERTISING about delicate health issues is usually straightforward and often sober. But it occasionally takes a humorous approach, as it did in a campaign last year for the Prostate Cancer Foundation by Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal & Partners, New York, part of MDC Partners. A commercial introduces ''The Prostate Czech,'' a stocky Eastern European man wearing a tracksuit and a latex glove who offers exams to random men -- and gets no takers.
Now humor is being used on an even more unlikely topic: suicide prevention. 
A campaign based in Colorado aimed at men ages 25 to 64 introduces a fictional therapist, Dr. Rich Mahogany, an affable, mustachioed, middle-aged man whose personality might be described as Dr. Phil meets Ron Burgundy, Will Ferrell's fictional anchorman.
In a public service announcement and in videos featured on a new Web site, ManTherapy.org, Dr. Mahogany, played by John Arp, is featured in his office, which is filled with items like a mounted moose head, ax and baseball trophies.
''Men have a way of doing things,'' he begins in the spot. ''A man has his way of eating'' -- he's shown eating a sandwich made from an entire loaf of Italian bread. ''Of exercising'' -- he does bicep curls with a bowling ball. ''Of keeping his hands warm'' -- he thrusts his hands down the front of his khakis. ''And of straightening out'' -- he uses a leaf blower to clear his desk of stacks of paper.
''So when a man faces a serious life problem, like divorce, depression or suicidal thoughts, shouldn't a man have a way to deal with that, too?'' he continues. ''Well, now he does. I'm Dr. Rich Mahogany. Visit me at ManTherapy.org.''
The spot, by Cactus in Denver, will be shown statewide on July 17. Partners in the effort are the Colorado Office of Suicide Prevention and the Carson J. Spencer Foundation, a suicide-prevention organization, with financing from the Anschutz Family Foundation.
In addition to billboards, the campaign also is using restroom posters and drink coasters promoting ManTherapy.org to try to reach men drowning their sorrows in bars.
''The stigma around mental health for men is even greater than it is for the general population,'' said Joseph Conrad, the chief executive of Cactus. ''We thought humor would really crack that stigma and draw men in.''
Jarrod T. Hindman, director of the Colorado Office of Suicide Prevention, said funny ads for products like erectile dysfunction drugs demonstrated that humor suited difficult topics.
''Sexual dysfunction is an affront to men's manhood, and I think mental illness and having depression also are seen as a sign of weakness that conflicts with being manly in the social ecology,'' said Mr. Hindman.
Jeffrey Boal, the founder of the Plowshare Group, which develops distribution strategies for public service announcements, reviewed the campaign and said its humor would serve it well when it comes to getting airtime donated.
''There's no question it will get played by P.S.A. directors,'' he said. ''Humor is a great tool in the P.S.A. space primarily because it's used so sparingly, since we tend to cover serious topics.''
As for whether the approach will actually be effective for men who are struggling, Mr. Boal said the tone might be problematic.
''It's not like dental hygiene or foot fungus -- it's something highly personal and very sensitive,'' Mr. Boal said of suicide risks. ''This is a very risky campaign, and that's part of its beauty, but I'd really want to make sure I knew how it impacted the target population.''
The initial concept for the campaign drew some skepticism from both suicide survivors and mental health professionals who have played an advisory role in the effort, Mr. Hindman said, but they all are ''fully on board'' now.
''Some thought we would be making fun of therapy, but there are therapists out there that use humor, and Rich Mahogany is a guy you could have a beer with and who could also steer you in the right direction,'' he said.
Colorado is tied with New Mexico in having the sixth-highest suicide rate in the country, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. High suicide rates tend to correlate with states that are both sparsely populated and have high rates of gun ownership, according to data from the Harvard School of Public Health. Montana tops the list, followed by Alaska and Wisconsin.
Even though three times as many women than men attempt suicide, the rate for suicide attempts resulting in a fatality is almost four times higher for men, or 79 percent to 21 percent. That disparity may stem from men's higher rate of gun ownership, with suicides attempted with firearms having the highest fatality rate (85 percent), followed by hanging and other types of suffocation (69 percent) and jumping (31 percent), according to the Harvard data.
Responding to the rising number of suicides among active duty soldiers -- a number that as of June 1 outpaced the number of troops killed in Afghanistan this year -- the Pentagon recently established a Defense Suicide Prevention Office.
On ManTherapy.org, Dr. Mahogany is a constant presence, greeting visitors seated in a leather chair when they first open the site and delivering various messages when prompted. Clicking a prominent red rotary phone reveals the number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.
A questionnaire on the site gauges respondents' mental state, with Dr. Mahogany in one of three videos declaring the results good, about average, or troublesome.
''Your results have me worried,'' he says gravely in the video for the most troubling results, the only time he steps out of character. ''And needless to say, if a pretend doctor like me is concerned about you, you probably should get some help.''

HEADLINE: Cuomo for President? Who Said That? Well, Dad

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Mario M. Cuomo never ran for president, but he seems to be warming to the idea that his son might.
One recent Saturday, Mr. Cuomo, the former governor, showed up at his former residence, the Executive Mansion, and broached the unbroachable: before a crowd of about 100 relatives, friends and advisers gathered to mark his 80th birthday, he called his son, Andrew M. Cuomo, ''the best governor in modern times,'' and, according to several of those present, mused at length that the younger Mr. Cuomo might someday ''have an opportunity to serve at a higher level, to serve the people of the United States.''
The moment was striking because -- despite widespread discussion in political circles that Andrew Cuomo could be a strong contender for his party's nomination in 2016 -- the younger Mr. Cuomo has repeatedly sought to tamp down such talk. He has done so not because of any absence of ambition, but because he has carefully studied the presidential flirtation of the politician he knows best: his own father. 
The younger Mr. Cuomo, although clearly paying attention to national politics, has taken a number of steps to show how serious he is about avoiding the national stage. He is planning a low-key role at this year's Democratic National Convention -- he will attend with the state's delegation, but does not have a scheduled speech, despite being among the nation's most popular governors. He has repeatedly turned down requests for interviews in the national news media, speaking almost exclusively to reporters from New York. He has made a point of rarely traveling outside the state, scheduling his vacations in the Adirondacks or the Hamptons.
By contrast, Mario Cuomo, less than two years into his governorship, vaulted into the national spotlight with a speech to the 1984 Democratic National Convention. He vacillated about the presidency for so long that he was at times derided as ''Hamlet on the Hudson,'' and he once famously left two planes sitting on a tarmac in Albany while he debated whether to fly to New Hampshire to enter the 1992 race.
Andrew Cuomo has made it clear that his own thinking about a possible presidential bid -- or his decision not to think about it yet -- is shaped by his assessment of his father's experience; he believes the incessant speculation about his father's potential presidential run hurt his ability to administer state government. For Mario Cuomo, budget negotiations with Senate Republicans became particularly fraught as presidential speculation grew louder. His son has been determined not to undermine his own tenure in Albany by fueling presidential chatter.
''I've seen this movie before, actually in this room,'' he told reporters this year, while sitting in the Capitol's Red Room, where governors have long held news conferences. ''There's like a whole little deja vu going on for me. So I've seen this play, I know how it turns out.''
''Once you start saying let's talk political -- my own politics, my own aspirations -- it can become not just distracting, in that it takes time, but it can become confusing and frustrating,'' he added. ''All I'm working on is being the best governor I can be.''
For many people, the prospect of an Andrew Cuomo candidacy seems obvious. The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, who served as speaker and negotiating foil to both men, said of Andrew: ''I think if the opportunity presented itself, he'd be honored to run, and he'll run on his record as governor of New York.''
There have also been hints of a rising profile: two journalists are working on competing biographies of the governor, and Mr. Cuomo is planning to write his own book; all would be released before the next presidential election in 2016. Mr. Cuomo, an aggressive and prodigious fund-raiser, did travel to Los Angeles last year to raise money from gay and lesbian supporters, and this year, in Manhattan, he was chairman of a panel for the Democratic Governors Association, an important networking group for politicians with national aspirations.
Like his father, Andrew Cuomo is carrying forward a liberal social ideology, at times challenging the Roman Catholic Church, in which both men were raised. Mario Cuomo, the state's 52nd governor, supported abortion rights, while Andrew Cuomo, the state's 56th governor, persuaded the Legislature to legalize same-sex marriage; both positions are at odds with church teachings. Mario Cuomo was also renowned for his opposition to the death penalty; Andrew this year tried but failed to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana.
But their differences are also distinct. Andrew Cuomo's fiscal and economic policy takes more of a centrist cue from former President Bill Clinton, in whose cabinet he served as housing secretary; Mr. Cuomo remains close to Mr. Clinton, and the possibility that Mr. Clinton's wife, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, could run for president in 2016 is a significant complication for Mr. Cuomo.
At the Executive Mansion party, Mario Cuomo wore a sport coat and an open-collared shirt, and if his voice was not quite as powerful and he did not stand quite as tall as he once did, he was in a good mood, joking with aides, working the crowd. Andrew Cuomo's own speech was poignant and laudatory of his father -- he called him ''my hero.''
Mario Cuomo followed up his comment about higher office by saying, ''Not that anyone should want such a thing.'' The crowd laughed, but he said, ''No, I mean it,'' and then he lamented that a president could wake up in the morning, press the wrong button and be at war.
He said there had been too many bad wars of late, and then he explained, in his aggressively Socratic way, why he and his son do what they do. He talked about his time as an altar boy and said he had even worked on Sabbaths at a synagogue. He said he believed that people are on earth for a purpose, to make a difference, to make the world a better place, and that that was the underpinning of their belief in government.
Slightly varying versions of the remarks were related by four people present who spoke on the condition of anonymity, because the remarks were meant to be kept private. The Cuomo administration had no comment, and Mario Cuomo did not return calls for comment.
Harold Holzer, a historian and former aide to Mario Cuomo who attended the party at the mansion, declined to discuss the presidential comments, but did say that the elder Mr. Cuomo ''said the difference between Andrew and me is that I made plenty of mistakes.'' He added, ''Andrew learned from all of my mistakes and he doesn't make any.''
It was a sentimental afternoon from two men who are not exactly known for being warm and fuzzy -- or easy to work for. Joseph Percoco, an aide and sometime enforcer to the current Governor Cuomo who also served the first Governor Cuomo, was said to provide comic relief, recounting how the current governor frequently gives him grief about his tie, or his weight. ''Andrew's the older brother that I never had,'' he said, ''and never wanted.''
But it was Mario Cuomo's comments that had the Cuomo loyalists buzzing, trained as they are to avoid public discussion of what might come next. There is a price for speaking out of turn in Cuomoland -- as an aide to Andrew Cuomo once said, ''We operate on two speeds here: Get along, and kill.'' Then again, how do you tell your 80-year-old, three-term governor dad to hush?
''It was definitely one of the take-aways,'' one attendee said, adding that people remarked afterward, ''Jesus, Mario was talking about him running for president!''

HEADLINE: Barclays Inquiry Shifts to a Regulator

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
LONDON - The scandal over the manipulation of global interest rates until now has mostly put bankers in the spotlight. But the focus on Monday will turn to the regulators, both on what they did and what they did not do.
Paul Tucker, a deputy governor at the Bank of England, will give evidence on whether senior government officials put pressure on Barclays to lower its submissions to the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. Barclays agreed in late June to pay some $450 million to settle accusations from United States and British authorities that its traders and senior executives had manipulated the rate, which underpins trillions of dollars of corporate loans, home mortgages and derivatives around the world. 
Mr. Tucker's testimony could put him at loggerheads with Robert E. Diamond Jr., the former chief executive of Barclays, who told the same committee last week that the Bank of England, as well as the Financial Services Authority of Britain and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, had repeatedly been informed about the issue, but had not moved to stop it.
After resigning last Tuesday, Mr. Diamond released an e-mail last week that indicated that Mr. Tucker had questioned why the bank was submitting rates consistently higher than rivals, a sign of relatively poor health.
How Mr. Tucker responds promises to be a pivotal in the central banker's career. The 54-year-old Cambridge graduate is a leading candidate to replace Mervyn King next year in the top job as the governor of the Bank of England, one of the world's most important central banks.
''The focus will be on whether his recollection tallies with what Bob Diamond told us,'' said Pat McFadden, a Labour member of Parliament who sits on the committee overseeing Mr. Tucker's testimony. ''We want to know if anyone at the Bank of England or in other government departments asked Barclays to lower its Libor submissions.''
Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Tucker declined to comment.
The intense scrutiny confronting Mr. Tucker follows a career spanning more than three decades at the Bank of England. After brief stints in the 1980s at the British bank Baring Brothers and with the Hong Kong government, he rose through the ranks to become the British central bank's deputy governor in charge of financial stability in 2009.
Mr. Tucker also is a leading figure in global efforts to overhaul financial regulation. Along with his Bank of England duties, he currently holds senior positions at both the Financial Stability Board and the Global Economy Meeting, whose memberships comprise officials from the world's leading central banks.
Unlike some other regulators, Mr. Tucker is known for his practical understanding of both the financial markets and the current effort to provide extra financing support to prop up British banks, according to several of his current and former colleagues, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the importance of his testimony on Monday.
''He would be a good man for the top job'' at the Bank of England, said one of the people. ''He understands banks and is a naturally bright guy who gets how the financial system works.''
Mr. Tucker's reputation, however, has been tarnished by the Libor scandal. The British government will start its search for a new central bank chief toward the end of the year.
Analysts say other potential candidates, like Gus O'Donnell, a recently retired high-ranking British civil servant, may benefit from Mr. Tucker's involvement in the Barclays' rate manipulation affair. ''Intellectually, he's not up to the job,'' said David Blanchflower, a British economist who sat on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee with Mr. Tucker from 2006 to 2009. ''Every single call since 2007, he has got wrong.''
Mr. Blanchflower points to a Bank of England meeting in November 2007 led by Mr. Tucker when a number of officials raised concerns that Libor submissions were lower than market rates. ''He was told about the problem, but didn't do anything about it,'' Mr. Blanchflower added.
A lot now depends on Mr. Tucker's testimony. In a highly unusual step for a British government official, the central bank's deputy governor released a statement last week, requesting to give evidence to the British parliamentary committee ''as soon as possible.''
His testimony is expected to center primarily on a phone call with Mr. Diamond in late October 2008. Last week, the former Barclays chief told the parliamentary committee that Mr. Tucker had expressed concerns from senior British politicians that Barclays' Libor submissions were higher than those of rivals.
Mr. Diamond then e-mailed Jerry del Missier, a top deputy, about the conversation, saying that Mr. Tucker had stated that it ''did not always need to be the case that we appeared as high as we have recently,'' according to documents released by Barclays.
Mr. del Missier, who also resigned last week because of the rate manipulation scandal, then directed employees to keep the submitted rates lower, or at least in line with rivals. His actions, some regulators say, were a result of a ''miscommunication,'' rather than instructions from Mr. Tucker.
Mr. Diamond has said that he did not tell senior executives to lower the bank's Libor rate submissions. The former Barclays chief also said that he had been told only last month about the activity, which occurred amid the financial crisis.
''I was unaware that Jerry had the impression that Tucker's phone call was taken as an instruction'' to alter the rate, he told the committee.
The involvement of senior British officials has appeared to deflect some of the attention of the scandal away from Barclays. Some of the firm's traders also had been altering Libor to benefit their own trading positions as far back as 2005.
Yet British politicians have expressed skepticism that the Bank of England actually put pressure on Barclays to change its Libor rates. Some contend that the conversations were part of officials' ongoing checks on one of the country's largest financial institutions at the height of a financial crisis.
''I doubt the Bank of England was leaning on Barclays to lower its Libor submissions,'' Mr. McFadden, the British politician, said. ''In the end, Barclays already had been doing that for years.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Fissures Are Growing For Papers

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR. 
E-mail: carr@nytimes.com; Twitter: @carr2n

 BODY:
While the rest of us were burning hot dogs on the grill last week, the newspaper industry seemed to be lighting itself on fire.
There have been cracks in publishing operations that are both hilarious and terrifying. The Times-Tribune in Scranton, Pa., published a box score for a baseball game that was never played, after one of the coaches made up a result to spare the other team the embarrassment of a forfeit.
The U-T, the daily newspaper of San Diego, published a two-week-old blog post -- on its front page. And most notoriously, ''This American Life'' revealed that Journatic, a content farm owned in part by the Tribune Company that produces local articles on the cheap, was using fake bylines. Some of those hyperlocal pieces, which ran in newspapers like The Chicago Tribune, The Chicago Sun-Times, The Houston Chronicle and The San Francisco Chronicle, were written in the Philippines.
Equally confounding, when The Times-Picayune of New Orleans got around to offering jobs to some of its employees in its lower-cost digital news operation -- the print newspaper will come out three times a week -- many of the more prominent staff members took a look at the business plan and said, ''No thanks.'' 
Or maybe not so confounding. Maybe they were making a choice to pull back from an industry that by all appearances was starting to come apart. Between operational fiascos and flailing attempts to slash costs on the fly, it's clear that the print newspaper business, which has been fretting over a looming crisis for the last 15 years, is struggling to stay afloat. There are smart people trying to innovate, and tons of great journalism is published daily, but the financial distress is more visible by the week.
''Most newspapers are in a place right now that they are going to have to make big cuts somewhere, and big seams are bound to show up at some point,'' said Rick Edmonds, a media business analyst at the Poynter Institute.
Some of the bigger cracks can't be papered over by financial engineering. Hedge funds, which thought they had bought in at the bottom, are scrambling for exits that don't exist. Many newspaper companies are hugely overburdened with debt from ill-timed purchases. And though it is far less discussed, newspapers are being clobbered by paltry returns on underfunded pension plans.
Two highly placed newspaper executives told me last week that while the industry had already experienced a number of strategic bankruptcies, more will most likely take place to deal with pension obligations.
As Mike Simonton of Fitch Ratings pointed out to me, very few bond investors are even willing to lend to papers. He said the pension obligations ''represent a call on capital at a time when newspapers desperately need to deploy capital toward evolving their business models and adapting to the digital world.''
The global pension plan at Gannett, which owns 82 daily papers, is underfunded by $942 million, and McClatchy, which owns 30 dailies, is short $383 million, according to Mr. Simonton, even though both companies have been pouring tens of millions in precious cash into the plans to shore them up. Many United States companies have onerous pension obligations, but the decline in revenue gives newspapers a tougher hill to climb.
The employees who earn those pensions are quick to point out that management in many of the companies still found money for ill-advised stock buybacks, along with lucrative dividends and executive compensation, neither of which was supported by results.
Journalists who are constantly being asked to do more with less wonder why the owners didn't invest to meet the coming threat and to add the funds to honor commitments to employees back when they were making great gobs of money.
People take heart that Warren Buffett has been buying newspapers, but it is worth noting that when he bought Media General newspapers, he left the pension liabilities with Media General's parent company.
(The New York Times has taken a very hard line at the bargaining table over the issue of pensions, which it cites as a risk to investors in its forward-looking statements. The paper's pension plan is short $522 million even after the company made a $151 million contribution last year.)
Those of us who work inside the racket like to think of our business as unique, but with underfunded pension plans, unserviceable debt and legacy manufacturing processes and union agreements, the newspaper industry looks a lot like, well, steel, autos and textiles.
The bread and butter for most of the industry is local information. But it has become seemingly impossible to make money creating daily compendiums and throwing it on people's doorsteps. Journatic, the content provider, proceeds from the bold premise that generating community news can function on a call-center model, where a staff unrelated by geography or affiliation will serve customer needs. The company allowed employees to gin up fake bylines to give the appearance of a connection.
And it's not just newspapers. AOL's ambitious local news effort, called Patch, is losing $150 million a year, by some estimates, and is no closer to cracking the code.
Given that context, it's not hard to see why Advance Publications is making huge moves in some of the 25 cities where it publishes newspapers, most notably in New Orleans, where it is spending the summer reducing the staff.
Advance's regional Web sites have generated traffic and have active forums, but they are a miserable place to consume news. Balky and ugly, with a digital revenue base below much of the rest of the industry, they seem like a shaky platform on which to build a business. Some recent traffic trends are not encouraging. According to Nielsen, The Times-Picayune's site, Nola.com, had 639,000 unique visitors in May, compared with over a million in that month a year ago.
Once upon a time, the Newhouse family kept unions at bay by promising lifetime employment, but now the company wants to shed people, and legacy costs, as quickly as it can. The plan is built on accounting, not strategy, which is why some of the newspaper's heavy hitters have declined offers from the newly reconfigured enterprise.
David Hammer, who played a large role in The Times-Picayune's coverage of the rebuilding efforts after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, took a job with the New Orleans CBS affiliate, WWL-TV, doing investigative work; he will be joined by Brendan McCarthy, one of the newspaper's young stars.
Stephanie Grace, a former statewide columnist, declined a job as a reporter, and Bill Barrow, a longtime reporter who covered health care, is going to work for The Associated Press. Bob Marshall, a Pulitzer Prize winner and the newspaper's outdoors editor, took a pass as well.
They are the kind of people that separate The Times-Picayune from, well, Journatic. ''When you look at it, they were asking us to take a job where the revenues are still very dependent on the print product,'' Mr. Barrow said. ''But that newspaper is no longer a priority and no one knows what it is going to look like or what it will have in the way of news when it comes out. There are too many unknowns.''
The diminution of The Times-Picayune is a profound loss and a bet on some very wobbly assets. Still, who is to say that the Newhouse family is any more misguided than the rest of an industry that is scrambling for safe ground? After all, the math is daunting, and there is a shortage of magic bullets.
But as they proceed, the Newhouses should remember that cutting corners ignores a fundamental fact: great journalism, on any platform, is the one sure hedge against irrelevancy.

HEADLINE: Fixing Student Loans

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Congress Approves a $127 Billion Transportation and Student Loan Package'' (news article, June 30): 
Some lawmakers may have opposed the bill for a reason not noted in the article: the one-year extension of a slightly lower interest rate for a select group of students does not fix the student loan crisis. In fact, according to the New America Foundation, the plan will save borrowers only $9 a month on subsidized loans (which account for less than half of the total loans issued under the Direct Loan program) taken out within the one-year window.
If Congress truly cared about helping students pay for college, it would fix the bulging student loan bubble created by the federal government's Direct Loan program and create a sustainable higher education financing program.

HEADLINE: In the Footsteps of Marvel

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES; George Gene Gustines contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Can Valiant Entertainment pull off a Marvel-style comeback?
Home to superheroes like Spider-Man and the Hulk, Marvel achieved one of the most spectacular rallies in media history. With its shares trading for as little as 93 cents, Marvel went from bankruptcy in 1997 to Hollywood heavyweight in 2009, selling itself to Disney for $4.3 billion, or about $53 a share.
Now two professed comic book geeks -- with backing from the turnaround specialist Peter Cuneo, who spent 10 years at Marvel in various roles, including chief executive -- are trying to make lightning strike twice with Valiant, a comics company that was a force in the 1990s but fell victim to legal quarrels and bankruptcy. Valiant, which is based in New York, restarted its comics line in May, achieving strong sales, and has five movies in development.
''Think of us as Marvel 2.0,'' said Mr. Cuneo, whose resume includes turnaround work at Black & Decker and Clairol. 
That is an audacious proclamation: Valiant does not have a single household-name character in its library. Financing is also a question. While the company is well financed as a start-up, it still must figure out how to raise the money to pay for its movie ambitions. But the potential payoff is too big not to try. Superheroes remain Hollywood's most bankable genre -- by far -- despite fears of oversaturation and a generally troubled North American box office.
''Marvel's The Avengers,'' released in May, has taken in $1.5 billion globally. ''The Amazing Spider-Man,'' unveiled by Sony last Tuesday, had taken in about $341.2 million as of Sunday afternoon. ''The Dark Knight Rises'' will arrive on July 20 and is expected to generate ticket sales rivaling those for ''The Avengers.''
With the publishing side of comics having a fragile recovery after the recession, many comics companies besides Valiant hope to hit Hollywood pay dirt. They include Radical Studios, whose dystopian Oblivion graphic novel is being made into a $140 million film starring Tom Cruise; Dark Horse, which has had hits like ''Hellboy'' spring from its books; and Image Comics, which in February sold Universal Pictures a movie based on its Cowboy Ninja Viking title.
''If Valiant's ambitions are to be the next Marvel, they have a huge amount of competition,'' said Jonah Weiland, executive producer of Comic Book Resources, an influential comic news and commentary Web site. ''Valiant is off to a truly impressive start, but keeping up momentum is extremely difficult.''
The two worlds -- movies and comics -- will come together this week at Comic-Con International, an annual gathering in San Diego for fans of science fiction, fantasy, animation and related entertainment. More than 125,000 people are expected to turn out to see scenes from new movies from studios like Disney, Sony and Warner Brothers and browse a trade show overflowing with oddball comics merchandise.
Valiant, conscious of moving too fast, decided not to exhibit at Comic-Con this year. But its executives will use the convention to work on video game deals, refine merchandising plans and scout for illustrators, said Dinesh Shamdasani, Valiant's chief creative officer. ''There's a staleness in comics at the moment, and we're really digging to find fresh stories to tell,'' Mr. Shamdasani said.
The plan is for Valiant to produce the films in partnership with major studios, then follow with licensed merchandise.
Valiant was founded in 1988 by a group that included Jim Shooter, the former Marvel editor in chief, and soon became a major competitor to DC Comics and Marvel, who continue to dominate this corner of publishing.
Valiant's series included Harbinger, about teenage outcasts with superpowers; X-O Manowar, a cross between Conan the Barbarian and Iron Man; and Bloodshot, a broken soldier retrofitted with nanocomputers. Like Marvel, Valiant interwove its characters into a common universe.
The Valiant library includes about 1,500 characters, Mr. Shamdasani said.
Acclaim Entertainment, a video game publisher, acquired Valiant in 1994 for $65 million (about $100.8 million in today's dollars) and later closed the comics division, focusing instead on Valiant games. Acclaim filed for bankruptcy protection in 2005, and, two years later, a group of investors -- led by two comics enthusiasts who were still in college, Jason Kothari and Mr. Shamdasani -- snapped up the Valiant library for a few hundred thousand dollars.
Mr. Kothari and Mr. Shamdasani spent the next few years ensnared in legal battles tied to Valiant trademarks, but emerged unencumbered. They connected last summer with Mr. Cuneo, who invested in the company and became its chairman. Gavin Cuneo, his son, became chief financial officer.
Other early investors include Jay Pollack and Scott Mednick, both of whom were early backers of Legendary Entertainment, a force behind the ''Dark Knight'' series and next summer's ''Man of Steel'' Superman remake.
Investors have contributed modest amounts (millions but not tens of millions), which is enough to ''comfortably'' serve Valiant's current needs, Peter Cuneo said. The hunt for movie financing -- $300 million to $400 million -- will soon start, an endeavor that he predicted would be eased by Marvel's track record. ''Investors like to be able to compare concepts to other concepts,'' he said. ''With Valiant, we very much have a blueprint to follow, which is Marvel.''
Valiant's new slate began in May with print and digital formats of issue No. 1 of X-O Manowar. In June, the company brought back Harbinger and on Wednesday it will release Bloodshot. Archer & Armstrong, about the world's greatest martial artist and an immortal mystic, will begin publication next month. X-O Manowar No. 1 sold some 45,000 copies -- blockbuster status in today's comic book market.
The reviews for X-O and Harbinger have been exceedingly positive. A review at IGN.com described the concept of the series, written by Robert Venditti and illustrated by Cary Nord, as ''aliens and barbarians'' and noted that it felt fresh, not a retread or throwback to the 1990s.
Comic Book Resources called Harbinger, by Joshua Dysart and Khari Evans, ''exciting and feels new in a way that few comics about characters with superpowers manage these days.''
Mr. Kothari said he expects Bloodshot to be the first Valliant character to make the leap into theaters. Sony is working on the property with the producer Neal H. Moritz, perhaps best known for the ''Fast & Furious'' film franchise. The director Brett Ratner, whose films include ''X-Men: The Last Stand,'' has committed to Harbinger.
The remaining three movie projects are tied to Archer & Armstrong and characters called Shadowman and Ninjak. ''Movies are obviously important to us, but great comics are absolutely essential,'' said Mr. Kothari, who holds an undergraduate business degree from Wharton and is Valiant's chief executive. ''Readers are very discerning, and they are not looking for a movie pitch in comic book form.''
When it comes to movies, Peter Cuneo said he is not worried that Valiant's characters are not well known outside comic circles.
''The general public didn't know Iron Man and look at him now,'' he said of the Marvel character that has starred in two hit movies and anchored ''The Avengers.'' ''What matters is the quality of the movie you make.''
Correction: July 11, 2012, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about Valiant Entertainment, a comic book publisher with movie aspirations, using information from the company, erroneously included two prominent Hollywood business figures among the members of Valiant's board. Tom Sherak, the departing president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and Sidney Ganis, a past academy president and Columbia Pictures executive, have only given Valiant informal advice on occasion.

HEADLINE: Obama Poised For New Fight Over Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Jonathan Weisman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With a torpid job market and a fragile economy threatening his re-election chances, President Obama is changing the subject to tax fairness, calling for a one-year extension of the Bush-era tax cuts for people making less than $250,000.
Mr. Obama plans to make his announcement in the Rose Garden on Monday, senior administration officials said. The ceremony comes as Congress returns from its Independence Day recess, and as both parties and their presidential candidates head into the rest of the summer trying to seize the upper hand in a campaign that has been closely matched and stubbornly static.
House Republicans plan to vote this month to extend permanently all of the Bush tax cuts, for middle- and upper-income people.
The president's proposal could also put him at odds with Democratic leaders like Representative Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, who have advocated extending the cuts for everyone who earns up to $1 million. And it will most likely do little to break the deadlock in Washington over how to deal with fiscal deficits, an impasse that has only hardened as Republicans sense a chance to make gains in Congress this fall. 
But by calling for an extension for just a year, Mr. Obama hopes to make Republicans look obstructionist and unreasonable. Trying to bounce back from another weak jobs report on Friday, he also hopes to deepen the contrast with his challenger, Mitt Romney. On Friday, the president said Mr. Romney would ''give $5 trillion of new tax cuts on top of the Bush tax cuts, most of them going to the wealthiest Americans.''
From their stronghold in the House, Republicans plan to vote this week to repeal Mr. Obama's health care law, hoping to energize their base even though they know that the campaign to abolish the law, which the Supreme Court upheld, stands no chance in the Democratic-led Senate. Republicans also renewed their call for an overhaul of the tax code.
''You know, what we ought to be doing is extend the current tax rates for another year with a hard requirement to get through comprehensive tax reform one more time,'' the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said on Sunday on the CNN program ''State of the Union.''
The struggle to frame the tax debate comes as the campaign moves into a period, only four months before the election, when the perceptions of voters begin to harden. Polls show a persistently tight race, with Mr. Romney closing in on Mr. Obama in certain swing states but with neither candidate able to break out decisively. Control of Congress is also up for grabs, with Mr. McConnell saying on Sunday that he believed the Republicans had a 50-50 chance to regain control of the Senate.
To find a compromise with Republicans on which Bush tax cuts to extend, Ms. Pelosi, the House minority leader, and Mr. Schumer, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, favor making $1 million the cutoff. Above that level, Mr. Schumer has said, people are not likely to spend the savings from lower taxes and help the economy.
Administration officials said they did not believe that the difference between the White House and these Democratic leaders was a big obstacle. They said that whether to use $250,000 or $1 million as a cutoff was more a matter of strategy than a ''religious debate,'' in the words of one official, who added that many other Democrats favored $250,000.
The White House hopes to squeeze maximum political mileage out of the Rose Garden event, surrounding Mr. Obama with families and workers who would benefit from the extension. On Tuesday, he will take his message to Iowa, the battleground state that turned him into a serious presidential contender in 2008.
In Cedar Rapids, Mr. Obama plans to visit the home of Jason and Ali McLaughlin, a high school principal and an account manager at a document-scanning company, a campaign official said. The McLaughlin family, with a combined income of $82,000, would face an extra $2,000 burden next year if the tax cuts on the middle class expired as scheduled, the campaign said.
White House officials insisted that Monday's move was more than politics. They said it would ease anxiety over the ''fiscal cliff'' -- the combination of tax increases and automatic spending cuts that are scheduled to kick in at the end of this year. That one-two punch, economists say, could deal a heavy blow to an already tender economy unless the White House and Congress work out some kind of compromise.
Proposing a one-year extension, a senior official said, recognizes that Mr. Obama and the Republicans are not likely to resolve the larger debate over whether to permanently extend the Bush tax cuts for everyone or, as Mr. Obama has long advocated, just for the middle class. That debate is likely to be decided at the ballot box, where a victory by Mr. Romney would almost certainly enshrine all the tax cuts.
''To the degree that there is concern about the economy, we're saying, 'Let's extend the middle class tax cuts for a year,' '' said Gene B. Sperling, director of the White House's National Economic Council. ''Economically, extending tax cuts to those workers will have the most effect on them and the strongest impact on the economy.''
A one-year extension for people making under $250,000 would cost the government $150 billion in revenue, the administration estimates, an amount that would be added to the deficit. In a point of comparison, economists estimate that letting the cuts expire for people above that threshold would generate $850 billion over 10 years.
While Mr. Obama returns to the tax issue this week, House Republican leaders will press forward Wednesday with a vote to fully repeal his health care law, testing their faith that they can make the law part of their attack on Democratic economic policies against evidence that swing voters want to move past the fight.
Just as Mr. Obama needs to worry about divisions on the tax bill, some Republicans are in disagreement over the wisdom of relitigating the health care law. Some Republicans, facing re-election in swing districts, are openly suggesting that some measures should remain. Representative David B. McKinley, a Republican freshman from West Virginia, said prohibitions on lifetime coverage caps and on discrimination against people with pre-existing medical conditions should ''absolutely'' stay in force, even if health care costs would have to rise.
''If it means increasing my premiums, so be it,'' he said. ''That's what insurance is about.''
Mr. Romney's supporters on the Sunday talk shows hammered away at the idea that Mr. Obama is at fault for the poor economy. Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, said Mr. Romney supported preserving all of the Bush-era cuts for another year because he believes ''that will stimulate the economy and provide certainty out there in the job market.''
For Mr. Obama, the biggest advantage of the tax proposal may be simply to move the political discussion off the job market. On his bus tour through Ohio and Pennsylvania last week, the president took pains to present himself as a guardian of the middle class, whose most cherished childhood memories included raiding the ice machine at a Howard Johnson while on a Greyhound tour of the United States.
On Friday, however, when the latest poor jobs number was reported, Mr. Obama was back to talking about the long road to recovery.

HEADLINE: Romney Mines the Hamptons for Campaign Cash

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and SARAH WHEATON; Michael Barbaro reported from East Hampton, and Sarah Wheaton from Southampton, N.Y. Jim Rutenberg contributed reporting from Montauk, N.Y.

 BODY:
EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. -- A woman in a blue chiffon dress poked her head out of a black Range Rover here on Sunday afternoon and yelled to an aide to Mitt Romney. ''Is there a V.I.P. entrance? We are V.I.P.''
No such entrance existed. The line of cars waiting to enter a Romney fund-raiser on a waterfront estate here had reached 30 deep, a gridlocked testament to the Republican candidate's financial might on a weekend when he is expected to haul in close to $4 million in the Hamptons. 
The aides to the governor apologized for the wait: each donor had to be checked off a guest list, setting off a major backup. ''We are doing our best,'' a staff member with a clipboard said.
Mr. Romney arrived around noon for the first of three major fund-raisers on Sunday afternoon, his motorcade of Chevrolet Suburbans bypassing a line of gleaming Bentleys, Porsches and Mercedes-Benzes waiting to deposit guests paying up to $25,000 a head to hear him speak.
But what was billed as a day of elegant campaign events at the homes of the ultrarich turned out to be an afternoon of curious and clashing tableaus: protesters with their bandannas and Occupy Wall Street-inspired chants (''We got sold out, banks got bailed out!'') standing amid multimillion-dollar mansions, where live bands played ''Margaritaville'' and donors dined on prosciutto-wrapped melon balls.
A luncheon fund-raiser was held at the sprawling home of Ronald O. Perelman, the billionaire financier and Revlon chairman. Widely described as the largest estate in East Hampton, when last advertised in the early 1990s, the house was said to have 40 rooms, 9 fireplaces and a mile of frontage on Georgica Pond.
After that, Mr. Romney attended events at the Southampton homes of Clifford Sobel, the former United States ambassador to Brazil, and David Koch, the billionaire industrialist and longtime benefactor of conservative political causes.
Mr. Romney, who amassed a fortune as a private equity executive, seemed sensitive to the imagery of the presumptive Republican nominee spending a day raising money in some of the most exclusive corners of the Hamptons. In remarks to about 250 donors inside a giant white tent on Mr. Sobel's property, Mr. Romney pointedly acknowledged the financial comfort of those around him.
''If you are here, by and large, you are doing just fine,'' he said, his voice audible to a reporter standing on a public street not far away. ''I don't spend a lot of time worrying about those here. I spend a lot of time worrying about those that are poor and those in the middle class that are finding it hard to make a bright future for themselves.''
The event at Mr. Koch's home drew about 200 protesters, who in brochures promoting their demonstration said that they opposed ''the ever-growing and pervasive influence of Koch Industries' money,'' a reference to the company controlled by Mr. Koch and his brother, Charles.
They went so far as to hire a local pilot to fly a giant red and black banner over Mr. Koch's house, which read: ''Romney has a Koch problem,'' a play on the drug. (Mr. Koch's name is pronounced the same as the word coke.) A truck, festooned with the logos of big banks like Citigroup and Wells Fargo, circled the neighborhood with a plastic dog on the roof, a jab at Mr. Romney's much-mocked family vacation in which he traveled with his Irish setter inside a pet carrier on the roof of a car.
Protesters said they were offended by the reach of corporate money in Republican politics, scoffing at the $50,000 admission price to Mr. Koch's event. ''It took my father a lifetime to save $50,000,'' one of the demonstrators shouted. Donors drove by without speaking to the protesters, who were separated from them by a line of police officers.
Inside, according to an attendee, Mr. Koch told donors he was committed to ousting President Obama, citing the evening's fund-raiser and his own efforts to raise campaign money this year, which he has done through the ''super PAC'' Americans for Prosperity.
Outside Mr. Perelman's house, where just a handful of demonstrators had gathered, guests stuck in the long line rolled down their tinted windows to chat, or simply shouted from their convertibles, describing their enthusiasm for Mr. Romney and disdain for Mr. Obama.
Laura R. Schwartz, the woman inside the Range Rover and a fund-raiser, complained that Mr. Obama had not visited Israel as president, a slight to the country, in her eyes. ''I don't think he is good for Israel,'' she said. Mr. Romney, she said, ''is a fresh face.''
Her companion, Rody Mehdizadeh, who said he manufactures laundry detergent, praised Mr. Romney's business acumen, calling him ''somebody who can lead the country in a more enterprise-driven way.''
A few cars back, Ted Conklin, the owner of the American Hotel in Sag Harbor, long a favorite of the Hamptons' well-off and well-known, could barely contain his displeasure with Mr. Obama. ''He is a socialist. His idea is find a problem that doesn't exist and get government to intervene,'' Mr. Conklin said from inside a gold Mercedes, as his wife, Carol Simmons, nodded in agreement.
Ms. Simmons paused to highlight what she said was her husband's generous spirit. ''Tell them who's on your yacht this weekend! Tell him!''
Over Mr. Conklin's objections, Ms. Simmons disclosed that a major executive from Miramax was on Mr. Conklin's 75-foot yacht, because, she said, there were no rooms left at the hotel.
Up the driveway, Mr. Romney -- described as re-energized from a vacation in New Hampshire -- discussed his education and economic plans. ''I gotta tell you, it was Romney at his best,'' said one of the event's hosts, Andrew Sabin.
The packed day of fund-raisers seemed to create some confusion among donors. As he pulled up outside Mr. Perelman's estate, Ms. Schwartz's companion initially wondered if he was at the home of the Koch brothers, a fund-raiser scheduled for several hours later.
Oh, he said, not yet.
''We are going to all of them,'' Ms. Schwartz explained.

 BODY:
Berea, Ky.
ANYONE traveling on Interstate 77 just north of Charleston, W.Va., can't miss the billboard perched high above the traffic, proclaiming ''Obama's No Jobs Zone,'' a reference to increased regulations on the coal industry and mountaintop removal mining. Like countless other bits of pro-coal propaganda that have sprouted over the last few years across Appalachia, the sign is designed to inflame tensions -- and by all counts, it's working.
Appalachia is engaged in a civil war of sorts over coal, with miners and their families pitted against environmental activists. The central issue is mountaintop removal, a radical form of strip mining that has left over 2,000 miles of streams buried and over 500 mountains destroyed. According to several recent studies, people living near surface mining sites have a 50 percent greater risk of fatal cancer and a 42 percent greater risk of birth defects than the general population. 
Despite the evidence, the coal industry and its allies in Washington have persuaded the majority of their constituents to ignore such environmental consequences, recasting mountaintop removal as an economic boon for the region, a powerful job creator in a time of national employment distress.
Of course, since mountaintop removal is heavily mechanized, the coal industry is the real job killer -- and, until recently, miners would have been suspicious of any claim to the contrary. For decades the companies had fought the miners' efforts to unionize, resulting in violent strikes.
After finally recognizing the union, King Coal opposed its demands for things like a living wage, health insurance, safety precautions and measures to curb the alarming rates of black lung disease. The strategy was simple: the companies would buy off individual communities and leaders, exchanging meager payouts for silence or even support against the more adamant activists.
The presence of the United Mine Workers of America helped stymie such tactics. But now, with a mere 25 percent of miners belonging to the union, the allegiance of miners has largely shifted to the coal companies. The old divide-and-conquer strategy is back. This time, it's a matter of pitting workers against their erstwhile allies in Washington: increased environmental regulations -- a hallmark of the Obama Environmental Protection Agency following eight years of lax guidelines and enforcement under President George W. Bush -- are branded as a war on coal miners.
At the same time, dissent against King Coal is increasingly greeted with open hostility and harassment.
Larry Gibson, who has been fighting for years to save his ancestral land and family cemetery from being mined, has faced vandalism and arson; two of his dogs were killed, and he says someone tried to run him off the road. Bullet holes are visible on the side of his trailer, the handiwork, he says, of angry miners misled into believing that he was the enemy.
Judy Bonds, an activist who died last year, was physically attacked by a miner's wife during a 2009 rally against a leaking three-billion-gallon sludge pond perched just 400 feet above an elementary school. An outspoken grandmother, Ms. Bonds faced repeated death threats and intimidation, inspiring her daughter to give her a stun gun for Christmas.
In 2010, mountaintop removal supporters in Kentucky erected a giant poster disparaging the actress Ashley Judd, an Appalachia native and activist, following a speech critical of the practice. The sign featured a photo of a semi-nude Ms. Judd and read: ''Ashley makes a living removing her top. Why can't coal miners?''
Perhaps the most disturbing story of anti-activist harassment is that of Maria Gunnoe. A native of Boone County, W.Va., Ms. Gunnoe once found her photograph on unofficial ''wanted'' posters plastered around her hometown. In another incident, last month, while testifying before Congress, Republican staffers accused her of possessing child pornography after she tried to present a photograph of a 5-year-old girl being bathed in contaminated, tea-colored water.
There is no easy resolution to the fraught relationship between the coal industry and the people of Appalachia, many of whom rely on it for jobs even as it poisons their region. But it is imperative that the industry's leaders and their elected allies lay down their propaganda and engage in an honest, civil dialogue about the issue. The stakes are too high to do otherwise.

HEADLINE: $16 Billion in Civilian Aid Pledged to Afghanistan, With Conditions

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting from Kabul, Afghanistan.

 BODY:
TOKYO -- An international donor's conference on Sunday pledged $16 billion for the economic development of Afghanistan in the next four years, but for the first time made it a condition that the Afghan government reduce corruption before receiving all of the money.
The agreement, called the Tokyo Framework of Mutual Accountability, says that foreign governments will assure Afghanistan a steady stream of financing in exchange for stronger anticorruption measures and the establishment of the rule of law. Up to 20 percent of the money would depend on the government meeting governance standards, according to the document, which was released here on Sunday. 
The money pledge, along with the plans for the Afghan security forces laid out at a NATO summit meeting in May in Chicago, represent a diplomatic success for American officials, who have lobbied for long-term international support for Afghanistan. There had been concerns that the economic crunch in the West and donor fatigue would leave President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and his American backers scrambling to come up with the money needed to run and secure Afghanistan, where the government's expenses far outstrip its revenues.
Addressing the conference here in Tokyo, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said the lives of all Afghan civilians needed to improve after a decade of war. To accomplish that goal, a number of steps were needed, she said.
''That must include fighting corruption, improving governance, strengthening the rule of law, increasing access to economic opportunity for all Afghans, especially for women,'' she said.
Mr. Karzai, who is under increasing pressure from international donors to fight corruption, including within his extended family, acknowledged in his own speech to the conference that corruption had undermined the legitimacy of his government.
But Afghans were not the only ones responsible for corruption, he said: ''We will fight corruption with strong resolve where it occurs and ask the same of our international partners.''
Representatives of more than 70 countries attended the conference. Mrs. Clinton did not specify how much the United States would contribute to the $16 billion, saying that Washington would maintain its level of financing. The Obama administration request to Congress for Afghan civilian assistance for 2013 was $2.5 billion, slightly more than the $2.2 billion that lawmakers approved for 2012.
Congress, given budget constraints and public weariness with the war in Afghanistan, would almost certainly appropriate less than the $2.5 billion requested, American analysts said.
The United States is the biggest donor to Afghanistan's economic development programs. Japan, the host of the conference, announced a pledge of $5 billion over five years. Germany, another large contributor, would give an estimated $550 million for the next four years, said Dirk Niebel, the minister for economic cooperation and development.
Diplomats at the conference said they were pleased with the pledge of $16 billion. The Japanese government said international donors had spent $35 billion on economic development in Afghanistan in the past decade, about twice that committed on Sunday for the next four years.
With recession in Europe and war fatigue in the United States, the possibility of cutbacks in aid for infrastructure projects, schools and health clinics seemed real, several diplomats said.
Before the Tokyo conference, the Afghan government trimmed estimates of what it said it needed in order to fit the outcome on Sunday.
The governor of the Afghan Central Bank said several weeks ago that up to $7 billion annually would be needed to accelerate economic development. Last week, Mr. Karzai said $4 billion would be sufficient, and the World Bank estimated that Afghanistan needed $3.9 billion a year through 2024 to boost development.
Money for the Afghan Army and police forces is separate from that raised in Tokyo. Financing for the Afghan security forces after 2014 is expected to total about $4.1 billion a year.
Beyond the $16 billion, other financing that has been pumped into the Afghan economy through the decade of war would be reduced as countries withdraw military and diplomatic personnel in the next few years, said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow for national security at the Center for American Progress in Washington.
''With many countries heading for the exits and drawing down both military and diplomatic personnel in the next few years, the Afghan government is going to see a reduction in the amount of money it gets from the international community in any case,'' Mr. Katulis said.
If the Afghan authorities fail to do a better job curbing corruption, ''then the whole framework for international support could collapse,'' he said.
After addressing the conference Mrs. Clinton met with the Pakistani foreign minister, Hina Rabbani Khar, for a one-on-one discussion, their first meeting since Pakistan, seven months ago, closed down the route that the United States military uses to transport supplies to Afghanistan. Last week, the route was reopened after Mrs. Clinton issued a statement saying that the United States was ''sorry'' for the deaths of two dozen Pakistani soldiers in American airstrikes last November.
The route's closing forced Washington to redirect supplies at a cost of more than $1 billion, and threatened to hurt the United States' counterterrorism efforts.
In the meeting with Ms. Khar, and at a later session with Ms. Khar and the Afghan foreign minister, Zalmai Rassoul, Mrs. Clinton emphasized again the need for Pakistan to shut down the Haqqani terrorist network that has mounted attacks in Afghanistan against American and NATO targets, a senior State Department official said.

HEADLINE: Information Technology Spending to Hit $3.6 Trillion in 2012, Report Says

BYLINE: QUENTIN HARDY


HIGHLIGHT: Europe may be a mess, the United States is having a slow recovery, and China is losing steam, but information technology is doing well. Researchers at Gartner project an increase greater than they forecast last quarter, led by cloud computing and new kinds of devices. 

 BODY:
Fueled by an accelerating move to cloud computing, and by a boom in associated telecommunications services, worldwide information technology spending is increasing somewhat faster than expected, according to industry analysts at Gartner. 
Over all, people will spend $3.6 trillion on information technology in 2012, the research firm said. This represents a 3 percent increase from 2011, when $3.5 trillion was spent, Gartner said, and is up from the 2.5 percent increase projected three months ago.
The increase, while modest, is notable because it is happening in the face of a financial crisis in Europe, slow growth in the United States, and a slowdown in China's economic growth. 
Spending on public cloud services is expected to increase 20 percent, to $109 billion, from $91 billion in 2011. By 2016, Gartner said, this expenditure could nearly double, to $207 billion.
That would still be a relatively small portion of the total spending, though it tends to represent considerable computing power and potentially more efficient I.T. systems. 
The greatest spending in the field, by far, remains telecommunications services. Gartner forecast that companies would spend $1.69 trillion on telecommunications this year, up only 1.4 percent from 2011. Fees for these services tend to be dropping, but Gartner cited increased demand from developing economies, as well as the rising demand generated by the boom in connected devices, like tablets and game consoles.
Gartner said over 200 business and technology analysts worldwide contributed to the report. These analysts also saw a 2.3 percent increase, to $864 billion, in fees for technology service. The consultants said consulting was in high demand, as companies try to manage things like their own complex systems, cloud computing, and the rise of analytics.

HEADLINE: Social Security and the Stork

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Why fertility rates are falling is a complex matter, but there's no question that the government could do more for parents and for children, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
The proverbial stork, bringer of babies and emblem of fertility, has been driven off course by the socialist welfare state. Now that people can rely on the state for income security in old age, they no longer need children. Social Security is undermining parenthood.
This conservative argument, flapping recently through the news media, leads to the distinctly unconservative argument that we should provide more public support for parents - a policy that many liberals and feminists (including me) also advocate. A closer look at this political paradox helps explain some basic points of disagreement about the impact of the welfare state. 
The economist Ed Yardeni makes a simplistic case for "crowding out" on his blog, with a graph showing that countries with the largest public pension programs also have the lowest fertility. 
This is hardly persuasive, given considerable evidence offered by the economist Peter Lindert and others that public pensions, like other forms of social spending, are strongly associated with economic development, which, in turn, promotes fertility decline. Changes in the economic and political position of women have a huge impact on family-size decisions. 
The historical panorama is long and complicated. In the United States, the total fertility rate among whites declined from about 7 children per woman in 1800 to about 2.5 children per woman in 1930, long before the Social Security Act of 1935 was passed. A small baby boom became apparent in the 1950s, and the total fertility rate reached about 3.5 in 1960, before declining to about 2.1 in 2000, about where it remains today. 
Trends among other racial and ethnic groups, though less well documented, have followed a similar pattern. 
Public pensions may have emerged partly as a response to fertility decline, rather than a cause of it. Still, once in place, these programs may have had a slightly negative effect on fertility in recent years in the United States and elsewhere. Ross Douthat of The New York Times and Ramesh Ponnuru of National Review developed this more nuanced argument of "partial crowding out," building on more detailed policy analysis by the economist Robert Stein. 
They express serious concern that Social Security transfers resources from parents - who invest considerable time and energy in raising the children who will help finance it - to nonparents, who get the same benefits per lifetime dollar earned (all else equal) but spend far less on the next generation. 
The contribution that nonparents make is largely limited to payment of taxes that help subsidize child-rearing and education.
Concern about what might be termed "family fairness" sets these conservatives apart from others critical of Social Security, especially those who favor converting it to a mandatory private savings program, as proposed by the Bush administration in 2005. That change would, as Robert Stein puts it, also "crowd out the traditional motive to have kids." 
Ideally, Mr. Ponnuru explains, the best solution would be to eliminate all entitlements. But because he considers this option politically unlikely, he favors a major expansion of the child tax credit, quintupling it to $5,000 per child. Such a significant increase in public spending (in the form of tax subsidy) would significantly improve the position of parents with children under 17. 
Other proposals to increase the child tax credit - which I believe is a good idea - are now in play, and I plan to discuss the specifics in a future post. 
Meanwhile, consider the assertion that, in the best of all worlds, elimination of all entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare would solve the problem. The reasoning behind this claim is not fully developed but the clear implication is that parents would be able to directly benefit from the earnings of their adult children (while nonparents would not). This "payback" would presumably create greater incentives to have children. 
Such a private family arrangement may have been viable in a high-fertility society in which children were less costly and most adults worked until they died at a relatively young age. Today, the costs of caring for dependents are much higher, and reliance on children for old-age security hardly seems viable. 
As an insurance program, it would be extraordinarily risky. Your children might predecease you or just get peeved with you and move away (a process the economic historian Richard Sutch refers to as "child default"). Or they might decide to become artists, writers or stay-at-home parents without enough discretionary income to take care of you. 
Most individuals would enjoy far more old-age security if they invested the money they would have spent on children in a diversified portfolio or annuity. The economic incentives to raise children would decline even further if entitlements for children or spending on education were reduced. 
Mr. Stein emphasizes that public policies benefiting parents don't come close to covering the costs of raising children. True enough, but they provide far more support than would be forthcoming in a fully privatized economy. 
Socializing a hefty proportion of the costs of caring for dependents makes good economic sense. That's exactly why we need reforms that could bring public support for parents and children into balance with support for the elderly. 
In this context, I'm far less worried about the proverbial stork than the proverbial ostrich, who responds to difficulty by sticking its head into the sand.

The Week's Bests
Josh Bell shares three "hacks" to be a better you, including: "Focus on activities that make you feel fulfilled. If you have kids, spend time with them, and make some memories. If you don't have kids, why not plant a garden? Perhaps learning a new skill might interest you. You could learn to paint, cook, golf, ski, kayak, surf, or one of so many other options. The point is, find something to spend more of your free time doing that will create a much deeper sense of accomplishment and fulfillment within you, rather than being concerned about which celebrity just entered rehab, or which A-list couple just separated."
Ryan Spoon says there are a few keys to bootstrapping your start-up: "Revenue is king. Profitability is better. This is a key difference with venture-backed companies, who often aren't advised to focus on revenue early on - rather, they focus on growth and usage. Bootstrapped companies usually do not have that luxury and have to focus on self-sustainability. Of course, that means that revenue (and profitability) are king. And when you get there - that buys you the ultimate luxury: optionality. You are in the luxurious position of choice: continue to operate, fund and accelerate the business, or exit the business. Profitability affords these choices."

HIGHLIGHT: Economic theory versus the self-regarding rich. 

 BODY:
The Romney fundraiser in the Hamptons continues to inspire much justified hilarity. Matt Yglesias has fun with whining rich people complaining that they are the engine of the economy, pointing out that quite a few of the whiners make their money in ways that arguably does very little for growth -- say, by running funds that collect so much in fees that they leave investors worse off.
There is, however, an even broader critique of the whole keep taxes low on jobcreatorsenginesoftheeconomy thing -- it doesn't make sense even when the rich really earn their money. I've tried to make this point before, with regard to optimal top tax rates, but without as much success as I'd like; so let's try it again.
So, imagine a Romney supporter named John Q. Wheelerdealer, who works 3000 hours a year and makes $30 million. And let's suppose that he really does contribute that much to the economy, that his marginal product per hour -- the amount he adds to national income by working an extra hour -- really is $10,000. This is, by the way, standard textbook microeconomics: in a perfectly competitive economy, factors of production are supposedly paid precisely their marginal product.
Now suppose that President Obama has reduced Mr. Wheelerdealer to despair; not only does the president waste money by doing things like feeding children, he says mean things about some rich people, which is just like the Nazis invading Poland, or something. So Wheelerdealer decides to go Galt. Well, actually just one-third Galt, reducing his working time to just 2000 hours a year so he can spend more time with his wife and mistress.
According to marginal productivity theory, this does in fact shrink the economy: Wheelerdealer adds $10,000 worth of production for every hour he works, so his semi-withdrawal reduces GDP by $10 million. Bad!
But what is the impact on the incomes of Americans other than Wheelerdealer? GDP is down by $10 million -- but payments to Wheelerdealer are also down by $10 million. So the impact on the incomes of non-Wheelerdealer America is ... zero. Enjoy your leisure, John!
OK, there's a catch: Wheelerdealer pays taxes, and when he chooses to work less, he pays less taxes. So there is in fact a welfare loss to the rest of America, but it comes only through the fact that revenue falls.
This is the basis of the result from optimal taxation theory that says that from the point of view of everyone except the very rich the optimal top tax rate is the rate that maximizes revenue -- full stop. And since the rich already make so much money, their marginal utility from an extra dollar is very small, so the revenue-maximizing tax also maximizes welfare for society as a whole.
Oh, and we have pretty good evidence on the (small) actual incentive effects of changes in top tax rates, enough to suggest that the optimal rate is in the 70-80 percent range -- which is where it was in the 1960s, a decade of very good economic performance.
Now, obviously the Romney fans have a very different view. They seem to believe that John Q. Wheelerdealer somehow adds much more to the economy than even the lavish amount he gets paid; he's an engine of growth! Oddly, though, they also claim to believe in the perfection of markets -- and the only way to justify their belief in their own special role is to claim that there is some kind of massive market failure.
So there's a huge contradiction in the whole position of the self-regarding rich -- a contradiction that I'm quite sure bothers them not at all. More champagne?

HEADLINE: The Libor Scandal's Consumer Upside

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: The bank manipulation of a key interest rate may have had a favorable effect on the finances of many borrowers. 

 BODY:
If you have a credit card, a car loan or an adjustable-rate mortgage, you might want to drop the bankers tied up in the Libor scandal a quick thank-you note. Their manipulation of the crucial global financial rate just might have saved you a bit of money. 
How, you ask? 
Let's start with the basics: What is Libor anyway? It's the London interbank offered rate - or, more accurately, rates. A number of big banks submit an estimate of how much it would cost them to borrow unsecured money from another big bank for a given period of time, in a given currency. The top and bottom estimates are tossed out. The others are averaged. The resultant rates act as benchmarks for hundreds of trillions of dollars - yes, trillions with a t - of financial products, everything from complicated derivatives to simple consumer loans.
Let's say that you have an adjustable-rate mortgage. Your interest rate changes as a given index rate changes. That index rate very well could be Libor. When the rate goes up, your interest payments go up. When the rate goes down, your interest payments go down. 
In a $450 million settlement with authorities in Britain and the United States, Barclays has admitted that it manipulated Libor. During the financial crisis, it lowballed its estimated borrowing costs to make the bank look healthier. At other times, it submitted a false rate to help traders - both in-house and in other firms - make some money on a financial bet. 
There's a lot of speculation that traders in other big banks will come forward and admit that they were doing the same thing, and that some regulators might even have been in on it. 
So what does it mean for you? Well, when Barclays artificially suppressed the Libor rate, it would have resulted in cheaper loans for consumers. When the rate was artificially inflated, it would have resulted in more expensive loans for people on the street. 
It seems that they were doing the former more than the latter - so the consumer very well might have a big thank-you to write those European traders, for the lost basis points, if not for the erosion of trust in the banking system and illegal collusion to undermine a foundation of global finance.
Conversely, the people investing in those consumer loans - and other Libor-linked financial instruments -- might want to have a word with Barclays about whether Libor resulted in their receiving lower interest payments. The City of Baltimore and a Connecticut police and firefighters' benefit fund have already filed a class-action lawsuit arguing that Libor manipulation did just that.

HEADLINE: Trafficked Into Tragedy: Abuse of Immigrant Workers in Afghanistan and Iraq

BYLINE: SHREEYA SINHA


HIGHLIGHT: A report highlights the trafficking and abuse of foreign workers on military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan. 

 BODY:
On every military base in Iraq and Afghanistan exists an economy sustained by immigrant workers. For transportation, construction, food services, security and more, the United States government relies on 174,000 laborers, 70,000 of them recruited from developing countries like Nepal, India, the Philippines and Uganda.
But not all of these workers voluntarily leave home to serve alongside the United States military. According to a report released in June by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Lowenstein Clinic at Yale Law School, many of these workers are tricked into working for American contractors and subcontractors who abuse them with "impunity" and subject them to grueling hours, meager wages, confinement and deadly working conditions.
In 2004, Buddhi Prasad Gurung and 12 other men from a village in Nepal were promised jobs in a luxury hotel in Jordan. Instead, they were sent to Iraq to work for a United States government subcontractor and, en route, were kidnapped by insurgents. Twelve men were executed "in the single largest set of executions of foreign captives by Iraqi insurgents."
Mr. Gurung survived the attack but said he had not been permitted to go home for 15 more months, according to a lawsuit against the subcontractor, Daoud & Partners, and the primary contractor, KBR.
In 2011, The New Yorker's Sarah Stillman documented Fijian beauticians who suffered from the same deceptive practices. "For the first time in American history, private-contractor losses are now on a par with those of U.S. troops in both war zones, amounting to 53 percent of reported fatalities in the first six months of 2010," she wrote.
The United States has a zero-tolerance policy toward human trafficking, but the report says existing measures -- prevention, investigation and prosecution -- are failing to curb the entrapment and abuse of foreign workers.
"Accountability exists in theory but not in practice: to date, the U.S. government has yet to fine or prosecute a single contractor for trafficking- or labor-related offenses," the report states.

HEADLINE: China's Economy: Apocalypse Soon?

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: Talk of an economic slowdown in China has become so loud and persistent that it now has its own slang: ghost cities, ghost fleets, rocket eggs, naked officials. The downturn has even led to the invention of a new financial algorithm, something called the China Stress Index - and the index remains high. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - Talk of an economic slowdown in China has become so loud and persistent that it now has its own slang: ghost cities, ghost fleets, rocket eggs, naked officials. The downturn has even led to the invention of a new financial algorithm, something called the China Stress Index - and the index remains high.
Some of the stresses were mentioned over the weekend by Prime Minister Wen Jiabao as he spoke of "huge downward pressure" on the world's No. 2 economy, due principally, he averred, to slackening consumer demand in Europe and real estate speculation at home. 
As my colleague Keith Bradsher reports, housing construction has nearly stopped. Work sites that had recently been going round the clock seven days a week are now down to one shift - and just on weekdays. 
Analysts and government planners are now resigned to the fact that the growth rate in 2012 will slip under the once-magic (and numerologically auspicious) figure of 8 percent. Instead, keeping growth above 7 percent has become the immediate task at hand, especially with the important 18th Party Congress coming this autumn.
Nomura, the Japanese financial services firm, has launched the and the Nomura analyst Rob Subbaraman affirmed Monday that the company sees "a one-in-three probability" that China will experience "a hard economic landing commencing before the end of 2014." 
Foreign Policy magazine has a new overview of the economy called "Five Signs of the Chinese Economic Apocalypse." (Business Insider sees that bet, and triples it, with a headlined "Fifteen Reasons Why Everyone Is Suddenly Freaking Out About China.")
In making its case for apocalypse now, or soon, the Foreign Policy piece says, "Businesses are taking fewer loans. Manufacturing output has tanked. Interest rates have unexpectedly been cut. Imports are flat. GDP growth projections are down, with some arguing that China might already be in recession."
Government figures released Monday showed that consumer prices dropped 0.6 percent in June compared with May, raising the concern of deflation, as Keith reports. 
Meanwhile, though, some food prices have risen so sharply (and food contamination scares have been so profound) that people are increasingly growing their own vegetables and more folks are keeping pigs. Mainland chickens are now laying "rocket eggs," a reference to their price trajectory. 
Local governments, after years of massive and prideful investments, are now seeing loans coming due. (How many of these loans are already underperforming is a matter of some debate among economists and analysts.) 
The central government in Beijing is even insisting on some austerity now, from sell-offs of the fleets of luxury cars assigned to local bosses to cutbacks on high-end liquor and nosh at official banquets. 
Some of the (few) more bullish analysts speak admiringly of the robustness of the state banking system and Beijing's ability to manipulate the levers of its highly controlled economy. But when they start listing areas of deep concern, they can barely come up for air. 
Sales of luxury goods in China, for example, are slowing. Wealthy mainlanders, including government and party officials, are feverishly offshoring their cash by buying properties abroad, from Hong Kong and Macau to Australia, Europe and the United States. Hedging against possible political or economic upheavals, they are keeping so few (seizable) assets in China that they're being called luo guan - "naked officials." 
Coal, iron ore and copper also are piling up in China, which has led Chinese shippers, once happy to ply the coastal routes, to head for blue water in search of new business. In a new blog post - "Is China Running Out of Steam?" - Evan Osnos of The New Yorker called this "the freight equivalent of deer wandering out of the woods in search of food. Because it materialized out of the shadows, shipping people have named it the 'ghost' fleet."
There are plenty of China experts in the gloom camp, and some in the doom camp. In a recent Barron's piece called "Falling Star," Jonathan Laing took the temperature of Jim Chanos, "the most outspoken Sino-Skeptic" on Wall Street. 
Never one to mince words, Chanos contends that China is headed for a hard landing of epic proportions because of its shaky financial system and an imminent collapse in its property market, which undergirds the entire economy. "I'm being conservative when I say that the coming bust in China's real-estate market will be a thousand times that of Dubai," he told Barron's.
After a recent trip to China, Rosemary Righter wrote in The Times Literary Supplement of "tens of millions of houses and apartments as well as Ozymandian public buildings and factory estates - and what hits the eye is how much of it all stands empty. Across the country, uninhabited concrete blocks scab the land, not only in the megacities of the eastern seaboard but also in the sleepier southwest; from filthy mining towns in Henan, all the way to entire ghost towns in Inner Mongolia." 
Mr. Laing also got a diagnosis from Edward Chancellor, a global strategist for GMO, the investment management firm based in Boston. 
"I can't tell you precisely when the downturn will hit," he says. "No one can. All I know is that China has all the earmarks of a classic mania that will end badly - a compelling growth story that seduces investors into ill-starred speculation, blind faith in the competence of Chinese authorities to manage through any cycle, and over-investment in fixed assets with inadequate returns facilitated by an explosion in credit."
Calling China a "Field of Dreams" economy - if we build it, they will come - he mentioned "a highway system with sparse traffic, local airports running at half-capacity and the rapidly expanding national high-speed railroad system, a technical marvel that can't charge ticket prices sufficient to pay for itself."

HEADLINE: Campbell Soup to Buy Bolthouse Farms for $1.55 Billion

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The acquisition of Bolthouse Farms will allow Campbell to expand in the multibillion-dollar market for packaged fresh foods and complement its V8 brand. 

 BODY:
9:44 a.m. | Updated 
The Campbell Soup Company said on Monday that it would buy the food company Bolthouse Farms from the private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners for $1.55 billion in cash. 
The deal, the biggest in Campbell's history, will allow the food company to add to its beverage offerings. As soup sales have slowed, the company has focused on augmenting its healthy offerings, which are anchored by the V8 line of drinks.
Bolthouse's products include fresh carrots and premium beverages, as well as refrigerated salad dressing. It also packages carrots for various private label brands.
 "Bolthouse is a great strategic fit with Campbell," Denise M. Morrison, Campbell's chief executive, said in a statement. "Its business platforms, capabilities and culture are well aligned with the core growth strategies we announced last year."
Campbell is only the latest company that is turning to mergers to bolster growth. Many of the deals that have been struck since the financial crisis have been so-called "add-on" transactions that augment existing businesses but generally do not lead to wholesale transformations of an industry. 
Over the last year, Campbell has struggled to prop up its soup sales, which have been hurt by commodity costs and changing consumer tastes. In May, it reported that profit fell 5 percent after the prices of ingredients continued to rise, as did marketing costs.
The company said the Bolthouse acquisition would add about 5 to 7 cents a share in adjusted net earnings for its 2013 fiscal year.
Campbell added that, excluding the deal's costs, it expected sales growth for this fiscal year to come in near the low end of its previously disclosed forecast range of up to 2 percent. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to decline near the upper end of its previous guidance of 5 to 7 percent.
Bolthouse, based in Bakersfield, Calif., will continue to operate as a separate unit within Campbell and will still be run by its current management team, led by its chief executive, Jeff Dunn. It was purchased by Madison Dearborn in October 2005. 
Campbell said it planned to finance the deal by taking on additional debt. The transaction is expected to close later this summer.
Shares in Campbell declined .6 percent, to $32.79. They have fallen 4 percent in the last year.
Campbell was advised by Morgan Stanley and Davis Polk & Wardwell, while Bolthouse Farms was aided by Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and Kirkland & Ellis.

Banking Official Faces Panel in Barclays Scandal | The scandal over the manipulation of global interest rates until now has mostly put bankers in the spotlight. But the focus on Monday will turn to the regulators, both on what they did and what they did not do.
Paul Tucker, a deputy governor at the Bank of England, will give evidence on whether senior government officials put pressure on Barclays to lower its submissions to the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. Barclays agreed in late June to pay about $450 million to settle accusations from United States and British authorities that its traders and senior executives had manipulated the rate, which underpins trillions of dollars of corporate loans, home mortgages and derivatives around the world.
Mr. Tucker's testimony could put him at loggerheads with Robert E. Diamond Jr., the former chief executive of Barclays, who told the same committee last week that the Bank of England, as well as the Financial Services Authority of Britain and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, had repeatedly been informed about the issue, but had not moved to stop it.
The testimony is scheduled to begin at 11:30 a.m. Eastern time. DealBook »
WellPoint to Acquire Amerigroup for $4.9 Billion | WellPoint, one of the country's largest health insurers, has agreed to buy Amerigroup in a bid to bolster its Medicaid business as the industry undergoes an overhaul.
The company said the transaction, which is expected to close early next year, is valued at about $4.9 billion. Under the deal, WellPoint will pay $92 a share in cash for all outstanding shares of Amerigroup.
The deal will give the combined company's Medicaid business a presence in 19 states, according to a news release announcing the deal. The move comes as the insurance industry, and Medicaid, face significant changes under the Obama administration's health care reform plan. DealBook »

HEADLINE: Elizabeth Warren Raises $8.67 Million for Massachusetts Senate Race

BYLINE: JESS BIDGOOD


HIGHLIGHT: The total is the biggest quarterly haul yet for Ms. Warren, who has so far raised more money than any Congressional candidate in the nation. 

 BODY:
BOSTON - Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic candidate in the closely watched Senate race in Massachusetts, raised $8.67 million in the second quarter of this year, according to her campaign.
The impressive total is the biggest quarterly haul yet for Ms. Warren, who has so far raised more money than any Congressional candidate in the nation, according to OpenSecrets.org, which collects campaign finance data. Ms. Warren raised nearly $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, and $6.9 million in the first quarter of this year.
The new numbers suggest that Ms. Warren's fund-raising ability was not marred at the end of April, when the campaign struggled to defend itself against months of questions, sometimes stoked by the campaign of her opponent, Senator Scott P. Brown, a Republican, over whether she had claimed Native-American ancestry to advance her career.
Ms. Warren's campaign said that $3.1 million was raised in June alone, and that 81 percent of the quarter's donations came in increments of $50 or less. There were also big-name fund-raisers, like a May event hosted in Hollywood by the film stars Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, which raised over $250,000.
The campaign now has $13.5 million on hand, it said.
"Elizabeth Warren has fought hard to create a level playing field for middle-class families," Ms. Warren's campaign manager, Mindy Myers, said in a statement, adding, "We still have a long way to go until Nov. 6, and Wall Street and other powerful interests are going to continue to send their millions to Scott Brown."
Ms. Warren is locked in a close race with Mr. Brown, who has not yet released his second-quarter fund-raising totals. She has outraised him in each quarter of the campaign so far, although his total war chest of about $15 million exceeded hers at the end of this year's first quarter by about $4 million, helped by money raised for his special election in 2010.

HEADLINE: Utah: Very Republican, but Not Quite as Conservative as It Appears

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Utah has voted Republican by at least 19 percentage points in every presidential election since 1964, and the FiveThirtyEight forecast gives Mr. Romney a 100 percent chance of winning the state. 

 BODY:
If only Grover Cleveland could have known.
On Jan. 4, 1896, President Cleveland, a Democrat, made Utah the 45th state. One hundred and sixteen years later, Utah is perhaps the most Republican state in the union, having voted Republican by at least 19 percentage points in every presidential election after 1964.
Its majority Mormon population makes the state very conservative on social issues, and in 2012, Utah is probably a safer bet to vote for Mitt Romney, himself a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, than the District of Columbia is to vote for President Obama.
But the constancy of Utah's conservative instincts in presidential elections is only recent, and it obscures a more moderate inclination on some issues. The reason Utah is so Republican in presidential elections - the influence of Mormonism on Utah's culture and politics - is also one of the reasons the state has taken less hard-line positions in other arenas, like immigration.
Just over 62 percent of Utah is Mormon, and 75 percent of Utah voters in 2008 identified themselves as Mormon, according to exit polls. The Mormon faith colors Utah culture to a remarkable extent. Among the faithful, consumption of alcohol, tobacco and caffeine is prohibited. Families are big; Utah has more children per capita than any other state and the lowest rate of out-of-wedlock births. Utah also has the highest rate of volunteerism in the nation. 
In today's politics, Utah's majority Mormon population translates into an overwhelming Republican advantage in presidential elections. But that wasn't always the case. "Until the beginning of the 1970s, Utah's partisan politics was very divided and balanced," Mr. Chambless said. Then, on a range of issues, from Roe v. Wade to the Vietnam War protests, "it was the state's Republican Party that seized the popular political positions."
Today, a majority of Mormon voters in Utah have two nonnegotiable litmus tests, Mr. Chambless said: abortion and same-sex marriage. This alone makes the state virtually impossible for a Democratic presidential candidate to carry. 
But on other issues, Utah has taken more moderate stances than might be implied by the state's voting record. For instance, Utah has tended to vote more Republican than Arizona, but Utah has taken a much more moderate approach to illegal immigration than Arizona -- in large part due to appeals from L.D.S. leaders, Mr. Chambless said. Thirteen percent of Utah's population is Hispanic, and more than 100,000 illegal immigrants are estimated to live within its borders.
Rather than follow Arizona's lead, Utah, in March 2011, became the first state to establish its own guest worker program, in which illegal immigrants without a criminal record who pay a fine can get a work permit. Utah is one of only three states where illegal immigrants can legally drive a car.
In 2008, Utah's governor, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., won re-election after campaigning on investing in renewable energy and instituting stricter regulations to protect the environment.
Indeed, without the strong social conservatism of the Mormon faith, Utah might be a bit more amenable to Democratic candidates. Although geographically the state is rural, demographically Utah is urban. Vast expanses of the state in the south are devoted to national parks, but about 75 percent of the state's population lives in small cities and suburbs in the Wasatch Front, from Provo north through Salt Lake City to Ogden.
Salt Lake City has become more diverse, and Salt Lake County is now a swing county in some elections. Mr. Obama carried it by 296 votes in 2008, and the Republican governor, Gary R. Herbert, won it in 2010 with 51 percent of the vote. Liberal pockets can be found, of all places, right around the L.D.S. headquarters in Salt Lake City, where many professional, non-Mormon migrants have settled. To the east, Park City, home to the Sundance Film Festival, is also fairly liberal.
The Bellwether: Tooele County
To the west of Salt Lake City, affordable suburban housing has made Tooele one of the fastest-growing counties in the state. In the 2000 election, Tooele was 4 to 6 percentage points off of each candidate's statewide vote share. But Tooele County's rapid population growth has made it a better barometer for the statewide margin in the last two elections, missing by 1 percentage point or less.
The Bottom Line
Mr. Romney has a 100 percent chance of winning Utah's six electoral votes, according to the current FiveThirtyEight forecast. And that seems low.
Utah has been safe Republican territory in recent presidential elections. Add to that the fact that Mr. Romney and a majority of Utahans share a faith and that Mr. Romney spearheaded the Salt Lake City Olympics, and the question Utah politicos are asking themselves isn't who will win the presidential race in the state, but whether turnout for Mr. Romney will also wash away down-ballot Democrats.
Utah's Mormon majority has shrunk slightly. But as long as it is still a majority, and as long as Democrats nominate pro-choice, pro-same-sex marriage presidential candidates, Utah will probably remain Republican.
"Although Utah is becoming far more diverse -- culturally and ethnically -- religion is still the No. 1 political litmus test for candidates seeking statewide office," Mr. Chambless said.

HEADLINE: Obama's Campaign Zeroes In on Romney's Wealth

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The Obama campaign's new, all-out effort to portray Mr. Romney, as personally wealthy and out of touch with average Americans. 

 BODY:
Is Mitt Romney too rich to be president?
President Obama's push on Monday to extend tax cuts for the middle class - but not for the rich - is being joined by a new, all-out effort from his allies to portray Mr. Romney as out of touch with average Americans.
On Sunday, Democrats seized on new reports about Mr. Romney's offshore bank accounts to hammer the presumptive Republican nominee, accusing him of not being forthcoming about the sources of his multimillion dollar fortune.
By Monday, more of Mr. Obama's surrogates were hitting the airwaves to mock Mr. Romney's day of high-dollar fund-raisers at estates in the Hamptons. The Democratic National Committee created a video highlighting reports of bank accounts in offshore institutions.
Brad Woodhouse, the communications director for the Democratic National Committee e-mailed the video to reporters with the subject line: "Sunday Blood Sunday."
Appearing on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" program on Monday, Robert Gibbs, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama's campaign, bluntly accused the Republican candidate of not giving voters the information they need to make a decision about his wealth.
"Release the tax returns," Mr. Gibbs said. "Put all this to rest. If Mitt Romney is not hiding something in Bermuda and Switzerland and the Caymans, it will be in the tax returns."
Mr. Romney's allies hit back furiously against the suggestion that he was hiding anything. Dan Señor, an adviser to Mr. Romney, said on "Morning Joe" that Mr. Gibbs was being "stunningly dishonest" in his attacks.
"The reason we know about these accounts, as Robert knows, is because they are in the tax returns that Mitt Romney released," Mr. Señor said. "We know this because he submitted this information."
A statement from the Republican campaign called questions about Mr. Romney's wealth an "unfounded character assault" and said it was "unseemly and disgusting."
Mr. Romney's personal wealth became a serious issue during the Republican primary campaign when his rivals demanded to see his tax returns. Mr. Romney eventually released two years of his returns.
But since then, Mr. Obama's campaign has focused more directly on Mr. Romney's role as a business executive, suggesting that his career was a boon to the wealthy and that he did not have the interests of workers at heart.
The campaign first attacked Mr. Romney's former company, Bain Capital, for shutting down factories and laying people off. Then it turned to the issue of outsourcing, describing Mr. Romney's company as a "pioneer" in moving jobs overseas.
Now, it looks as if Mr. Obama's strategists are ready to focus once again more directly on Mr. Romney's wealth.
Will it work?
Democrats are hoping to find the right mix of policy and politics by offering voters a striking contrast between Mr. Obama's refusal to extend tax cuts for the wealthy and Mr. Romney's desire to cut taxes for people like himself.
Last week, Democratic allies of the president's repeatedly pointed to Mr. Romney's vacation at his lakeside estate in New Hampshire of evidence of his being out-of-touch.
In the East Room on Monday, Mr. Obama drew the line just that sharply, saying that under the economic ideas of Republicans, "the wealthy got wealthier, but most Americans struggled."
He did not mention Mr. Romney by name, but predicted that the fight over tax cuts for the wealthy would be resolved by the choice that voters make in the presidential election this November.
"My opponent will fight to keep them in place," he said. "I will fight to end them."
Mr. Romney's advisers believe the effort to focus voters on Mr. Romney's wealth will misfire. They argue that voters want the candidates to talk about how they will turn around an economy that has battered middle class people.
Polling suggests they may be right. A Washington Post / ABC News survey in April found that 71 percent of those surveyed did not believe that Mr. Romney's wealth would be a major reason to support or oppose him.
The polling did suggest that for those who said it was a major factor in the decision, it was more likely to be a negative. But Mr. Romney's advisers argue that the facts about his offshore accounts will make that less likely.
Kevin Madden, a spokesman for Mr. Romney's campaign, said on Fox News Sunday that the Republican candidate "hasn't paid a penny less in taxes by virtue of where these funds are domiciled." he said, "His liability is exactly the same as if he held the fund investments directly in the U.S."
But for the most part, Mr. Romney's advisers intend to try and ignore the attacks on his personal wealth. On Monday, they focused their responses on Mr. Obama's renewed call to let the tax cuts for the wealthy expire.
"Americans are struggling in a 'zombie economy' and President Obama's only answer is to pass one of the largest tax hikes in history," said Amanda Henneberg, a spokeswoman. "President Obama's tax increases on families and job creators will create more economic uncertainty and fewer opportunities for struggling middle-class families."

HEADLINE: Behind the Cover Story: Robert Draper on How Democrats Finally Embraced Super PACs

BYLINE: RACHEL NOLAN


HIGHLIGHT: The author of this week's cover article answers questions about the motivations of the people who run Priorities USA Action, a Democratic Super PAC. 

 BODY:
How did this article on Democratic super PACs come about?
The editors of the magazine and I had been chewing on the question of how to do a human-driven super-PAC story. I tend to gravitate toward the experiential aspect of a topic: how a president's B.F.F. (Valerie Jarrett) exerts her influence in the White House; how the operation of a political rogue (Sarah Palin) functions; what it's like to be the guy whose job it is to bring the House's Tea Party freshmen in line (Kevin McCarthy). In this case, I decided it would be interesting to show how Democrats slowly shed their (professed) disdain of big-money politics and embraced the world of super PACs - and to do this by showing how two novices to that world, Bill Burton and Sean Sweeney, built theirs from the ground up and then endeavored to sell it to a not-so-waiting world.
You write about a couple, the Mostyns, who welcome Priorities USA Action. But what's the most common reason people say no to a super PAC?
There are four. In no particular order:
1) The belief that Obama can't possibly lose to Romney (this reason began to dissipate after the antics of the G.O.P. primaries were concluded).
2) The belief that the Obama campaign organization would be raising all the money it would need anyway.
3) Disillusionment with the president vis-à-vis progressive ideals and naïveté about the G.O.P. as willing legislative partners.
4) A basic distaste for super PACs and the attack ads they fund.
Obama openly shares that distaste. Do you think that Bill Burton, who helped found the Priorities super PAC after working in the White House, also felt this way?
Burton was pretty candid on the subject. Sure, he said, it's a lousy system and ought to be reformed. But to paraphrase Donald Rumsfeld - and Burton did exactly that - you go with the rules you have, not the rules you wish you had. I don't think he and Sweeney spend a minute of their day fretting about the amorality of the world in which they operate.
Were you surprised by how super-PAC people rationalize their work?
In the world of presidential campaigning, you really can't luxuriate in self-doubt or navel-gazing. Things move too quickly, and day-to-day battles are waged. I guess what continues to surprise me is how quotidian it has become to attack-attack-attack, and how nearly everything is fair game for ridicule. That, and the fact that we're in a recession, with millions of people out of work, and yet upward of a billion dollars will be spent in this election simply to fill the airwaves with invective. These are not original thoughts, I realize.
What impressed the Mostyns most, it seemed, was that Priorities found workers who could blame Bain for losing their jobs. How did they find those folks?
Basically, their researcher Brennan Bilberry behaved like a good reporter. He read every news item from the '90s pertaining to employees who were laid off by Bain. He located those people, talked to them by phone, got their stories and ascertained whether they'd be willing to share said stories in an attack ad. Then another person was sent to interview the Bain victims in person.
Does Priorities USA Action have another strategy in mind, or is Attack Bain plan A, B and C, with no plan D?
They're constantly poll-testing themes and angles, and it's possible that some new leitmotif worthy of exploitation will emerge - for example, when Governor Romney announces his running mate. The reality, however, is that Priorities doesn't have enough money to heave against the wall to see what sticks. They've pretty much got to hone what they have and take dead aim with it.

HEADLINE: Patriot Coal Files for Bankruptcy Protection

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Patriot Coal filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday, prompted by struggles with low coal prices. The company said that it had $3.6 billion in assets and $3.1 billion in debts. 

 BODY:
Patriot Coal filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday, an action prompted by the company's struggles with low coal prices.
In a document filed in federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan, the company said that it had $3.6 billion in assets and $3.1 billion in debts.
Coal companies have been hit hard by a decline in demand, arising in part from competition from cheap natural gas and a weaker economy. They have also blamed tougher environmental rules for rising costs. 
All of these factors eroded Patriot's financial health, the company argued. It has lost money every year since 2010, reporting a $198.5 million loss in the year that ended March 31. 
"The coal industry is undergoing a major transformation and Patriot's existing capital structure prevents it from making the necessary adjustments to achieve long-term success," Irl F. Engelhardt, Patriot's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. "Our objective is to use the reorganization process to address important issues in an orderly way and make the company stronger and more competitive."
To stay afloat during the Chapter 11 process, Patriot has secured $802 million in bankruptcy financing from a group led by Citigroup, Barclays and Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch. 
In May, Patriot disclosed that it had hired the Blackstone Group and the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell to provide advice on refinancing its credit facilities. It also announced having secured $625 million in new loans from Citi, Barclays and Natixis.
The company said last month that its chief executive at the time, Richard M. Whiting, had resigned, and that his duties would be assumed by Mr. Engelhardt, then only its chairman. 
In a court filing, Patriot listed the Wilmington Trust Company and U.S. Bank, both serving as trustees for bondholders, as its biggest unsecured creditors.
Besides Blackstone and Davis Polk, Patriot is being advised by the consulting firm AlixPartners. The coal company has appointed Ted Stenger, an AlixPartners executive, as its chief restructuring officer, reporting to Mr. Engelhardt.

BYLINE: VIVIAN YEE


HIGHLIGHT: New York City is sponsoring a competition to design an apartment building filled with apartments with just 275 to 300 square feet of living space. 

 BODY:
For New Yorkers who gripe about their cramped living quarters, and there are many, the real estate news announced by the city on Monday should be worthy of note. 
Confronted with what the city has in mind, such malcontents may feel thankful for what they have. 
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced a city-sponsored competition to design an apartment building full of "micro-units" with 275 to 300 square feet of living space. Each would include a kitchen and a bathroom, but no closet.
City officials said they hoped the building would become a prototype for a new model of tiny, but affordable, housing.
"Young people from around the country or around the world - those are our future, and they don't have a lot of money," Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference, standing in front of a life-size mock-up of a shoebox-shape studio complete with pullout bed, toilet, bowl of fruit and umbrella stand, all made of paper. "You have to change the rules along with the requirements."
There are about 1.8 million one-person or two-person households in the city, but only one million studios and one-bedroom apartments, the mayor's office said. The mismatch reflects how the city's housing has failed to keep up with the shift in its demographics in recent decades.
Mr. Bloomberg himself spent his first 10 years in New York in a studio that, according to his estimate, had 600 square feet; his rent was $120 to $140 a month. (He now resides in a 7,500-square-foot Beaux-Arts town house on East 79th Street.)
The city will waive zoning regulations for the project and allow units smaller than the current minimum size of 450 square feet. Among other criteria, the submissions will be judged on designs for common spaces in the building and on their success in drawing air and light into the units. Submissions are due by Sept. 14.
Some New Yorkers, already squeezed into tiny spaces, might find it hard to believe that homes can actually shrink further. 
But interest in making small homes livable, even beautiful, has grown as more people find that tiny is often the only affordable option, said Mimi Zeiger, who has written two books about small living spaces and who recently left a 400-square-foot studio in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn.
The influx of young workers into cities like New York over recent decades parallels a similar flood in the 1920s and 1930s, when bachelor's apartments and single-room occupancy buildings became popular, Ms. Zeiger said. But some choose small homes out of a desire to live more simply and efficiently, rather than just out of necessity, she said. 
Scott McCulley, who has lived in a 338-square-foot studio on East 69th Street since 2003, insists that everything, from decorating to entertaining, is best done in a small space.
His dining table doubles as a desk; his platform bed provides storage. He has forced himself to pare down his possessions. He rarely buys food in bulk, and sometimes uses his stove for extra storage.
"It's not the amount of space you have, it's how functional it is," Mr. McCulley said.
Architects at Jordan Parnass Digital Architecture in Brooklyn, who have worked on several studio renovations, said they emphasize multifunctional spaces and furniture that can adapt to different needs. For an East Village studio that was featured in a number apartment-design blogs, the firm built a loft with a bed and a walk-in closet, with extra storage space inside wooden stair risers.
The firm often receives calls from people hoping to redo their tiny studios, said Darrick Borowski, the firm's creative director. 
"I know they're out there; I know they're struggling with this," Mr. Borowski said. "But there's a higher awareness now that you don't have to suffer through it. You don't have to move to the suburbs."
For the record, Mr. Borowski occupies a 750-square-foot apartment - with his two children.

HEADLINE: Will Ending Tax Cuts for the Rich Hurt the Economy?

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Letting tax cuts for the wealthy lapse would probably cut economic growth, but not as much as other fiscal tightening that is scheduled to take effect at year's end. 

 BODY:
President Obama on Monday proposed extending most of the Bush tax cuts, but not those for the highest-income Americans. Republicans responded that all of the tax cuts should be extended, since tax hikes of any kind will hurt economic growth.
Are they right? Will allowing the tax cuts for the highest earners to lapse put a damper on gross domestic product?
Most likely. I should note, though, that the magnitude of the drag is likely small, at least relative to other fiscal tightening that looms when this year ends.
Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, estimates that allowing tax cuts for Americans who earn above $250,000 to expire at the end of 2012 would reduce gross domestic product growth in 2013 by $40 billion, or about 0.24 percentage points.
Allowing the "middle class" tax cuts to expire would shave an additional 1.06 percentage points off economic growth. That means letting all of the Bush tax cuts phase out would cut about 1.3 percentage points from growth. 
Here's a table showing Mr. Zandi's estimates for how each of the spending cuts and tax increases scheduled at the end of 2012 will hurt economic growth:
As you can see, allowing the Bush tax cuts for households earning under $250,000 to expire would be the biggest drag on growth, followed by the automatic spending cuts set off by last year's failed supercommittee talks, and then the end of the payroll tax holiday.
If Congress were to drive off the "fiscal cliff" entirely -- that is, let every fiscal policy that's supposed to expire this year do so -- the total effect would decrease economic growth by about 3.6 percentage points.
The growth cut that would come from allowing all of the Bush-era tax policies to expire -- 1.3 percentage points -- may not sound like much, but economic growth is pretty anemic as is. In the first quarter of this year, the economy grew at an annualized rate of just 1.9 percent. If Congress undoes its scheduled fiscal tightening, Moody's Analytics expects growth next year to come to 3.8 percent.
So far Mr. Zandi's numbers are the only ones I have been able to find that estimate the economic impact of isolated fiscal policies sunsetting this year. Others have tried to estimate the economic effect of allowing of these fiscal policies to lapse, however.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that going headlong over the "fiscal cliff" would cut economic growth next year by 3.9 percentage points. That means the United States economy would grow just 0.5 percent, rather than the 4.4 percent we would be able to expect if Congress eliminated its fiscal restraint entirely. The office has not, however, released numbers estimating the effect of extending or phasing out individual policies that make up the fiscal cliff.
Mr. Zandi acknowledges that there's a lot of uncertainty around his estimates.
"These estimates do not consider the broader context," he wrote me in an e-mail. "Depending on what else policy makers do or not do to address the other aspects of the fiscal cliff, the Treasury debt ceiling, and laying out a credible path to fiscal sustainability will determine whether the economic consequences are more or less severe than these estimates suggest."

HEADLINE: Bank Scandal Turns Spotlight to Regulators

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Politicians in both London and Washington are looking into whether regulators allowed banks to report false rates in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis and afterward. 

 BODY:
10:04 a.m. | Updated 
As big banks face the fallout from a global investigation into interest rate manipulation, American and British lawmakers are scrutinizing regulators who failed to take action that might have prevented years of illegal activity.
Politicians in both London and Washington are questioning whether regulators allowed banks to report false rates in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis and afterward. On Monday, Congress stepped into the fray, requesting information about the role of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, according to people close to the matter. The Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday also announced it was looking into the issue.
The focus on regulators and other financial institutions has intensified in the last two weeks after the British bank Barclays agreed to pay $450 million to resolve an enforcement case. British and American authorities accused the bank of improperly influencing key interest rates to deflect concerns about its health and bolster profits.
The Barclays settlement is the first action stemming from a broad investigation into how banks set key benchmarks, including the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. The pricing of $350 trillion of financial products, including credit cards, mortgages and student loans, is pegged to Libor and other such rates.
Authorities around the world are now considering action against more than 10 big banks, including UBS, JPMorgan and Citigroup. The banks also face a raft of civil litigation from municipalities, investors and other financial firms that claim they lost money from the misreporting of rates. These lawsuits could end up costing the banking industry tens of billions of dollars, according to analysts.
On Monday, the oversight panel of the House Financial Services Committee sent a letter to the New York Fed seeking transcripts from at least a dozen phone calls in 2007 and 2008 between central bank officials and executives at Barclays.
"Some news reports indicate that although Barclays raised concerns multiple times with American and British authorities about discrepancies over how Libor was set, the bank was not told to stop the practice," Representative Randy Neugebauer, a Texas Republican and the head of the House oversight panel, said in the letter, which was reviewed by The New York Times.
The political firestorm also escalated in London on Monday, where a British parliamentary committee grilled a top Bank of England official over his knowledge of wrongdoing at Barclays. British politicians chided Paul Tucker, deputy governor at the Bank of England, the country's central bank, for not taking a more active role in Libor.
In November 2007, Mr. Tucker led a meeting in which some officials raised concerns that banks were underreporting Libor submissions to temper concerns about their health, a process known as lowballing. It was in the earliest stages of the market turmoil that would culminate in the 2008 financial crisis, and banks were loath to report high rates that pointed to weak financial footing.
"This doesn't look good, Mr. Tucker," Andrew Tyrie, the head of the parliamentary committee, said on Monday, referring to minutes of the meeting. "We have what appear to any reasonable person as the lowballing of rates."
The Barclays settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Justice Department and Financial Services Authority of Britain has been a black mark for the bank. The scandal has already prompted the resignation of the bank's chairman, Marcus Agius; its chief executive, Robert Diamond; and a top deputy, Jerry del Missier.
As it tries to control the damage, Barclays is framing a defense around the notion that regulators approved the actions. Last week, the bank released information about dozens of conversations with the Bank of England, the New York Fed and other government agencies.
In one call with the Financial Services Authority, a Barclays manager acknowledged that the bank was understating its Libor submissions. "So, to the extent that, um, the Libors have been understated, are we guilty of being part of the pack? You could say we are," the Barclays manager said, according to regulatory documents.
The bank also discussed its Libor rates twice with the Bank of England in fall 2008, according to documents Barclays released last week. Additional evidence has emerged that the British central bank first held discussions about Libor with Mr. del Missier a year earlier, in late 2007, said a person briefed on the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Authorities are also focused on Barclays' conversations with the New York Fed, including discussions between senior bank employees and officials from the Fed's trading desk, according to another person briefed on the matter, who also requested anonymity.
In the letter to the New York Fed, Mr. Neugebauer requested transcripts of the calls by Friday.
"The role of the government is to ensure that our capital markets are run with the highest standards of honesty, integrity and transparency," Mr. Neugebauer said on Monday. "The interest rate manipulation scandal clearly demonstrates that these principles were violated by Barclays and, from what we understand, other banks as well. My request to the New York Fed is a preliminary step to understanding what role, if any, the regulators played in this scandal."
Among the officials that the Senate Banking Committee plans to question during hearings this month include Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, who ran the New York Fed during the crisis. 
"I am concerned by the growing allegations of potential widespread manipulation of Libor and similar interbank rates by some financial firms.," Senator Tim Johnson, the South Dakota Democrat who leads the committee, said in a statement on Tuesday. "At my direction, the Committee staff has begun to schedule bipartisan briefings with relevant parties to learn more about these allegations and related enforcement actions."
In a statement, a New York Fed spokeswoman said that during the financial crisis "we received occasional anecdotal reports from Barclays of problems with Libor." Ultimately, the New York Fed made "further inquiry of Barclays as to how Libor submissions were being conducted" and offered "suggestions for reform of Libor" to British authorities.
Under sharp questioning by British political leaders on Monday, Mr. Tucker, considered a front-runner to succeed Mervyn A. King as the next head of the Bank of England, defended the central bank and his professional future. Committee members focused their questioning on a conversation that Mr. Tucker had with Mr. Diamond in October 2008.
According to an e-mail trail, Mr. Tucker contacted Mr. Diamond, saying he was "struck" that Barclays was paying a high interest rate on its loans.
Mr. Tucker testified that his conversations with Mr. Diamond were meant to convey that the financial markets were questioning whether the British bank had access to capital.
Barclays last week also released documents saying that at least some bank executives believed Mr. Tucker had instructed them to lower the Libor submissions. That belief, some regulators say, stemmed from a "miscommunication," rather than instructions from Mr. Tucker. The bank also never explicitly told regulators that it was reporting false interest rates that amounted to manipulation, according to regulatory documents.
Mr. Tucker on Monday flatly denied that he authorized, or even knew about, any improper actions. "We were not aware of it, other than what is starting to come out in these investigations," he said.
Underscoring the point, he noted that the Bank of England used the rate to set its Special Liquidity Scheme, in which the government lent local banks more than $310 billion from 2008 to 2011.
Still, British politicians criticized Mr. Tucker for not taking a more active role in policing the banks. When asked whether he was confident that the Libor manipulation had stopped, Mr. Tucker wavered.
"I can't be confident about anything after learning about this cesspit," he replied.

HEADLINE: Gas Nags

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: John Boehner, Bill O'Reilly and Donald Trump said that we would experience some of the highest fuel prices ever this summer. It didn't work out that way. 

 BODY:
Colorado Springs
Up and down the high plains side of the Rocky Mountains, a road warrior becomes a comparative shopper. Last week, regular gas was $3.24 a gallon at the Safeway in Laramie, Wyo., $3.43 a gallon at Costco in Colorado Springs. A new American car, with an average fuel economy of 24 miles to the gallon, could cruise the entire midsection of Colorado on a single tank and still have enough change from $50 to buy caffeinated swill the color of the Houston Ship Channel.
Wait a minute: wasn't gas supposed to be $5 a gallon now, costing $75 for that same trip? Let's return to the experts:
"Certainly, this summer, we'll see the highest gas prices in years." So said House Speaker John Boehner, in February.
"Right now we're headed toward $5 a gallon and by the end of summer - maybe 6." That was Bill O'Reilly, of Fox News, in the same month.
"They're gonna go to $5, $6, $7." And that was Donald Trump in April, showing why he's no better at predicting fuel prices than he is at reading public documents from the state of Hawaii.
As of Monday, the average price for a gallon of self-service regular was $3.38, according to the AAA daily survey, down from a peak of $3.93 in April. Prices fell just as Republicans and their partners at Fox launched a campaign to blame high gas costs on President Obama. The price is a graphic update, reminding voters of something with a real effect on their daily lives.
What does this unlikely gas price shrinkage prove, at the peak of the summer driving season no less, other than the hardy consumer advisory that people who demagogue for a living should stick to things that can't be fact-checked?
For one, it shows that in the United States we're still awash in cheap oil. Ask any European, used to paying $7 and $8 a gallon to fuel their golf-cart-size vehicles, what it's like to fill up at the Loaf 'N Jug in Fort Collins - reverse sticker shock.
But more broadly, this little economic parable is a good lesson in the phony politics that passes for a national debate on energy. Back in March, Mitt Romney, who certainly knows better, said there was "no question" that Obama was to blame for rising gasoline prices. At the same time, one of his surrogates, Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, said Obama "should be held fully responsible for what the American public is paying for gasoline."
O.K., so now that gas is much closer to $3 than $4, does Obama get the credit for the windfall, as Republicans indicated when they fell into this silly rhetorical trap? No, of course not. Fox hardly brings it up anymore. Gas prices - no story there.
But nor should Obama get to do a victory lap. Harvey, the invisible rabbit now strolling the boards on Broadway, has about as much power over the price of a global commodity like oil as the president of the United States does. And most voters, ahead of the politicians, understand that.
Obama is no environmental obstructionist, sad to say. There's been more drilling on public land - much to the chagrin of lovers of wild open spaces in the West - under Obama's watch than in the eight years of George W. Bush. It hasn't done diddly to the global price. Oil companies are sitting on 7,000 leases to drill for oil which they've yet to tap.
And with the boom in North Dakota and elsewhere in the plains, Americans are less dependent on foreign sources: imports were 45 percent of total consumption last year, down from 60 percent in 2005.
But increasingly not all American oil stays in the states. Last year, for the first time since 1949, the United States exported more petroleum products than it imported, the Energy Department reported.
Drill, baby, drill is a fun thing for Republicans to chant back at Sarah Palin, but as a policy, it's mindless, and enriches no one but an oil industry that made nearly $140 billion in profits last year.
The slogan, somewhat refined, sounds even worse when President Obama says it. "You have my word that we will keep drilling everywhere we can," Obama told a crowd of oil workers in New Mexico earlier this year, when he was trying to get out ahead of the gas blame game.
Republicans say the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would ship dirty tar sands oil from Canada to the United States (and which Obama has refused to O.K.), could bring relief at the pump. Not a chance. The pipeline, under the best case scenario, would not open until 2020, and even then its output will be pegged to the global price, unless a President Palin decides to nationalize it.
Refinery production can lead to some short-term price manipulation, as we saw on the West Coast, which has the nation's highest gas prices. Critics suspected willful withholding of full supplies to gas stations, as a way to run up the price, though the refineries said it was a simple capacity problem caused by repairs and other backups.
Most economists say the price at the pump has declined because the world has plenty of oil at a time of global economic slowdown. Production hit an all-time high earlier this year, while demand flattened - especially in Europe, which is using less oil than at any time since 1994.
It won't fuel a talk radio rant on a long drive - better to listen to Springsteen sing about a "pink Cadillac" - but gas prices are pegged to a basic tenet of this summer's economic conditions. Supply is up, demand is down, and prices have fallen. Even Donald Trump understands that, at some level.

To the Editor:
Re ''Filling the Skills Gap,'' by Joe Nocera (column, July 3): 
As chairwoman of the Higher Education Committee for the New York State Assembly, I have a firsthand perspective on the benefits of community colleges.
Community colleges have an essential role to play in our economy's revitalization, but more important, provide a lifeline for those seeking the economic mobility that is key to the American dream. It is increasingly important for government to invest in these institutions.
This year, New York State was able to increase financing for SUNY and CUNY community colleges by $150 per full-time student, an overall increase of $39 million. But because of budget cuts in the last decade, this financing rate remains less than community colleges received in 2005. Given the important part community colleges can play, empowering them to remain open and accessible to all must be a priority.

The New Old Age
Paula Span posted to nytimes.com/newoldage:
Every day, Bureau of Labor Statistics interviewers ask Americans to detail how they spent the previous 24 hours, how many minutes and hours they devoted to everything from shopping to child care to phone calls. The results, culled from 12,500 respondents, make up the American Time Use Survey.
It began in 2003, but only last year did the bureau start asking about a key activity for millions of people -- elder care. The recently released 2011 results reveal how many millions of us are involved: In the past three months, 39.8 million people over age 15 have provided unpaid care to someone over 65 ''because of a condition related to aging.'' 
Between 22 and 23 percent of those ages 45 to 64 identify themselves as elder care providers, along with 16 percent of those over age 65. Almost a third of them are taking care of two older people or more.
A majority of those providing care are women -- 56 percent -- but that's a smaller majority than past research has found.
The survey, we should note, uses a very broad definition of ''caregiver.'' You qualify if you provided unpaid care of any kind (including simple companionship or ''being available to assist when help is needed'') more than once in the past three months, regardless of how long you spent at it.
So a 17-year-old who paid two 20-minute visits to her grandmother since mid-April is, to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, an elder care provider. The caregiver who emerges from this survey may also be a somewhat different species from the ones described in others.
Elder care has been a subterranean activity for a long time, unpaid and largely unmeasured and, as a consequence, often unappreciated. Increasingly, ''there's a wide interest in elder care, in how competing demands on our time impact our lives,'' said Stephanie Denton, an economist with the bureau. ''How do elder care responsibilities influence our work? Or our child care?''
Researchers can now use this annual trove of data to help answer such questions.
Scientist at Work
David Gruber, a research associate at the American Museum of Natural History who is exploring bioluminescent and biofluorescent marine animals in the Solomon Islands, posted to nytimes.com/scientistatwork:
We are moving farther into the Western Province of the Solomon Islands. After a two-hour boat ride, we are in the Vonavona Lagoon, on a 110-acre island populated by 10 people and hundreds of large coconut crabs. Our guide takes us to an unmarked reef called Shark Point. Immediately after entering the water, I am overwhelmed with the lively hustle and bustle of marine life.
The reef is completely covered with an astounding and colorful variety of living corals. White-tip and black-tip reef sharks, silver-tip sharks and scalloped hammerhead sharks are seen mingling within the bustling community. The Solomon Islands are a hotbed of biodiversity; the coral species alone are about 10 times as numerous as in the Caribbean.
Since arriving here, we have found biofluorescence in lineages in which it never has been reported before, including breams and flatheads. We have also noted that within specific groups, some fishes exhibit an interspecific variation in the patterns of biofluorescence, which may provide clues to its biological function.
Our group has found multiple organisms in these reefs that exhibit deep red fluorescence. ''I've never seen such red fluorescence before,'' said Vincent Pieribone, who designs optical brain sensors from fluorescent proteins found in marine organisms.
These pristine reefs demonstrate the vast libraries of species and compounds waiting to be discovered, cataloged and examined. Modern coral reefs trace their roots back about 240 million years. This ecosystem is the genetic equivalent of the Library of Congress, but holds information that has taken eons to be inscribed.
In recent decades, human activity and climate change have left about 75 percent of the world's coral reefs threatened or severely damaged. Shark Point falls within the quarter not yet facing imminent danger.

HEADLINE: A Crowd That Knows The Menu

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- The categories of song at the Essence Music Festival, here at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome from Thursday to Sunday, were pretty fixed: love, sex, religion, controlled fun and breakdowns of many kinds -- having them, living with them, fixing them if possible, putting them behind you.
It's a party, but also a strategy-making festival for its intended audience: black, female, middle-class or better, middle-aged or at least self-possessed. An opening montage for the R&B singer Fantasia on Sunday night flashed the phrases ''Be empowered,'' ''Be inspired,'' ''Be motivated,'' ''Be you.''
Fantasia herself wasn't so crisp and businesslike -- she stomped the stage, shouting, lower lip trembling or hardening in indignation -- but that was the message, over and over, at least for most of the headlining female acts, including Mary J. Blige, Mary Mary, Keyshia Cole, Ledisi and Aretha Franklin. 
The male performers -- among them Charlie Wilson, D'Angelo, Trey Songz, Anthony Hamilton and the comedian Kevin Hart, whose routine about girlfriends and private neuroses was so intense that it involved flashpots and lasers -- did more of the pure party-bringing.
Now in its 18th year and always scheduled around the Fourth of July weekend, Essence Fest, as it is known, has been an important event in non-hip-hop black pop for an entire generation. This year it added an extra day -- a Thursday slate of teenage acts -- and drew an overall 413,000 to the events at the Superdome and the Morial Convention Center, said Dana Baxter, a spokeswoman for Essence Communications. (The Superdome has a capacity of about 70,000; each night it seemed more than half filled.)
The festival is sponsored by Essence Magazine, and since last year has been produced in-house by Essence Festivals LLC, a division of Essence Communications; it's not as if the magazine invented modern R&B and gospel, but its editorial slant and ideal readership certainly draw lines around the booking and the spirit of the event.
With speeches and panel discussions by figures from the news media, politics and entertainment during the day (''Helping Our Children Succeed in School,'' ''2012 Election: Does the Black Church Still Matter?,'' ''What Men Want'') and music at night, it's a festival devoted to guarding against crisis -- of marriages, of faith, of employment, of confidence, of leadership, of the black middle class. And it has an implied dress code: All weekend, around the French Quarter and on Poydras Street around the arena, there were women in magnificent displays of body and hair, and men in seersucker and powder blue straw hats.
This is an audience that knows what it likes. D'Angelo ran into some trouble with this. After 12 years of near silence since his album ''Voodoo,'' he's returned, starting with a string of shows in Europe early this year, then a few surprise or secret performances in front of sympathetic American audiences, an appearance on the televised BET Awards and now this.
He didn't alter his performance much for the occasion: It had a solo-voice-and-keyboards part near the end, but he played a nearly unbroken segment of squirrely funk discourse, heavily indebted to James Brown, Jimi Hendrix, and Sly and the Family Stone, with neither a big opening nor a big finish. He was a strange and fascinating presence, tying together songs with stretches of rehearsed vamps. Singing, playing guitar or keyboards, and chattering improvised phrases, he repeatedly flashed and buried his charisma.
You can't keep something for yourself in front of this audience. This was by no means a rude crowd -- almost the opposite, in fact -- but it practices a highly evolved disdain for nonsense.
The reaction to D'Angelo was an example of that: heavy grumbling after the set that he didn't perform ''Brown Sugar,'' a song that's become a modern R&B standard, even among brass and marching bands, and general dismissal of his mysterious airs.
Another example: on Saturday a young, bohemian white male -- the common stock of most major music festivals but a minuscule minority in the Superdome -- was walking toward a show by the pianist Robert Glasper in one of the four upstairs lounge spaces. He was wearing cheap pajama bottoms. Ladies in their finest watched him as he passed down the hall, processing the sight, making exquisite grimaces.
But Mary J. Blige got the tone exactly right. She lets her graveness slide into true vulnerability and then knocks it back into graveness; she was at her best on Saturday. It's hard to describe something so close to perfection. On this night, in this situation, she seemed completely in tune with her work and her audience: the curves of her songs; controlling her rough voice and her movements; growing sorrowful and almost angry during ''No More Drama''; essentially acting out trust issues -- with one person, with 40,000, whatever. It was one long, dramatic flow, a high point of energy, emotion, pacing and even sound: Nearly all the rest of the main-stage performances suffered from sound problems, but not this one.
Mr. Glasper's show was full of tangential, improvised funk with jazz harmony; that, a few New Orleans brass band sets and one guitar solo in D'Angelo's performance were the closest this festival came to jazz. Otherwise it was booked mostly with that non-hip-hop black-pop mainstream of the last 20 years: new and old R&B, and a reassuring bottom line of gospel.
Aretha Franklin closed the festival on Sunday, playing with a band full of New Orleanians, including Jason Marsalis on percussion and vibraphone. (Well, she didn't quite close it: There was a final hourlong set past 1 a.m. involving Chaka Khan and some tributes to recently fallen divas.)
Ms. Franklin's set was a deflation: long and wayward, full of awkward silences and slide shows from her scrapbook and the history of black heroes. Its best part, a set piece in her recent shows, was a shouted meditation on her recent surgery over a one-chord, whole-band tremolo.
That night, sets by Fantasia and Anthony Hamilton included old-style, two-beat gospel breakdowns -- intimations of the hard-core church experience -- but Ms. Franklin's performance, even in its sluggishness, became a stately reminder of gospel's dimensions before it was reframed through hip-hop and R&B.
Male performers at Essence could be scoundrels with sufficient conscience, or consciences with sufficient scoundrelness. At the end of his set on Saturday the singer Tank, part of the early-oughts Southern R&B scene and now 36, was beseeching in ''Stay,'' with a particularly well-engineered message of love: ''I deserve whatever you put me through/because I've done the same damn things to you.''
Then he sang, both to the woman in the song and the women in the audience, ''What can I do to make you stay with me?'' He took off his T-shirt and focused his pitch. ''Do you love me? ''Do you need me?''
The R&B singer and songwriter Eric Roberson is about the same age, but he's gone a different moral-ethical route. His most recent album is called ''Mister Nice Guy,'' and upstairs at the dome, in the McDonald's Superlounge, he performed in a jacket and tie, announcing that he'd just become a father.
''I want to celebrate the union between man and woman,'' he said, and in his light voice sang ''Softest Lips,'' a long and excellent slow jam with the repeated line, ''I just kissed the softest lips that God has ever made.''
Later he improvised an entire song over a chord sequence using crowd-sourced words and phrases: They included ''sex,'' ''motorcycle,'' ''fantasy,'' ''twins,'' ''abstinence'' and ''McDonald's chicken wrap.'' The refrain, sung without breaking stride, became ''Girl, we can talk about this and that/got my arms around you like a chicken wrap.'' For a moment he reached a kind of ideal: skill, generosity, morality, aesthetic beauty and lunch.

HEADLINE: The Opportunity Gap

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Over the past few months, writers from Charles Murray to Timothy Noah have produced alarming work on the growing bifurcation of American society. Now the eminent Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam and his team are coming out with research that's more horrifying.
While most studies look at inequality of outcomes among adults and help us understand how America is coming apart, Putnam's group looked at inequality of opportunities among children. They help us understand what the country will look like in the decades ahead. The quick answer? More divided than ever. 
Putnam's data verifies what many of us have seen anecdotally, that the children of the more affluent and less affluent are raised in starkly different ways and have different opportunities. Decades ago, college-graduate parents and high-school-graduate parents invested similarly in their children. Recently, more affluent parents have invested much more in their children's futures while less affluent parents have not.
They've invested more time. Over the past decades, college-educated parents have quadrupled the amount of time they spend reading ''Goodnight Moon,'' talking to their kids about their day and cheering them on from the sidelines. High-school-educated parents have increased child-care time, but only slightly.
A generation ago, working-class parents spent slightly more time with their kids than college-educated parents. Now college-educated parents spend an hour more every day. This attention gap is largest in the first three years of life when it is most important.
Affluent parents also invest more money in their children. Over the last 40 years upper-income parents have increased the amount they spend on their kids' enrichment activities, like tutoring and extra curriculars, by $5,300 a year. The financially stressed lower classes have only been able to increase their investment by $480, adjusted for inflation.
As a result, behavior gaps are opening up. In 1972, kids from the bottom quartile of earners participated in roughly the same number of activities as kids from the top quartile. Today, it's a chasm.
Richer kids are roughly twice as likely to play after-school sports. They are more than twice as likely to be the captains of their sports teams. They are much more likely to do nonsporting activities, like theater, yearbook and scouting. They are much more likely to attend religious services.
It's not only that richer kids have become more active. Poorer kids have become more pessimistic and detached. Social trust has fallen among all income groups, but, between 1975 and 1995, it plummeted among the poorest third of young Americans and has remained low ever since. As Putnam writes in notes prepared for the Aspen Ideas Festival: ''It's perfectly understandable that kids from working-class backgrounds have become cynical and even paranoid, for virtually all our major social institutions have failed them -- family, friends, church, school and community.'' As a result, poorer kids are less likely to participate in voluntary service work that might give them a sense of purpose and responsibility. Their test scores are lagging. Their opportunities are more limited.
A long series of cultural, economic and social trends have merged to create this sad state of affairs. Traditional social norms were abandoned, meaning more children are born out of wedlock. Their single parents simply have less time and resources to prepare them for a more competitive world. Working-class jobs were decimated, meaning that many parents are too stressed to have the energy, time or money to devote to their children.
Affluent, intelligent people are now more likely to marry other energetic, intelligent people. They raise energetic, intelligent kids in self-segregated, cultural ghettoes where they know little about and have less influence upon people who do not share their blessings.
The political system directs more money to health care for the elderly while spending on child welfare slides.
Equal opportunity, once core to the nation's identity, is now a tertiary concern. If America really wants to change that, if the country wants to take advantage of all its human capital rather than just the most privileged two-thirds of it, then people are going to have to make some pretty uncomfortable decisions.
Liberals are going to have to be willing to champion norms that say marriage should come before childrearing and be morally tough about it. Conservatives are going to have to be willing to accept tax increases or benefit cuts so that more can be spent on the earned-income tax credit and other programs that benefit the working class.
Political candidates will have to spend less time trying to exploit class divisions and more time trying to remedy them -- less time calling their opponents out of touch elitists, and more time coming up with agendas that comprehensively address the problem. It's politically tough to do that, but the alternative is national suicide.

HEADLINE: Alcoa's Revenue Falls 9% On Weak Aluminum Prices

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Alcoa, the big aluminum manufacturer, opened the second-quarter earnings season on Monday by posting a $2 million loss, although its results were slightly ahead of analysts' expectations. The company's revenue dropped 9 percent mainly because of weak prices in the slowing global economy. 
Alcoa posted break-even earnings per share. That compared with 28 cents a share and net income of $322 million a year ago.
The results included one-time items of $63 million. Excluding those, Alcoa earned $61 million, or 6 cents a share.
Revenue totaled $5.96 billion, compared with $6.59 billion a year earlier.
Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected Alcoa to earn 5 cents a share, excluding one-time items, on revenue of $5.83 billion. They had lowered their expectations for Alcoa in recent weeks because of weaker prices for aluminum, rising inventories and the sluggish economies of the United States, Europe and China.
Alcoa said that it was hit by an 18 percent decline in aluminum prices from the second quarter of 2011, but that it saw pockets of stronger demand in some industries, and overall shipments were up from a year ago.
''Although aluminum prices are down, the fundamentals of the aluminum market remain sound with strong demand and tight supply, and Alcoa is successfully capitalizing on accelerating demand in high-growth end markets such as aerospace and automotive,'' Klaus Kleinfeld, the company's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
The company stuck with its forecast for a 7 percent increase in global demand this year and predicted that there would be a global aluminum supply deficit this year.
Alcoa's performance reflects broader economic trends because aluminum is used in products as varied as automobiles and beverage cans. It is the first company in the Dow Jones industrial average to report results, so investors often watch it for signs of how earnings may unfold for other companies.

HEADLINE: One Made It by Water, And Another by Land

BYLINE: By KAREN CROUSE

 BODY:
DAVIS, Calif. -- Paths are a point of pride in this college town. There are its bike trails, miles and miles of asphalt ribbon that cover Davis's 11 square miles like tape on bicycle handlebars. There is its off-the-beaten-path location, a passing blur for San Franciscans and other Bay Area motorists headed to Sacramento or the Lake Tahoe ski resorts.
Then there is the interconnectedness of the town's 65,000-plus residents. Every other person in Davis, it seems, has a story of losing a wallet while riding a bike and having it promptly returned with all its contents.
And now Davis will be represented at the London Olympics by two athletes on parallel paths. 
On June 29 in Omaha, Scott Weltz, a former U.C. Davis athlete-turned-volunteer coach, upset the two favorites in the men's 200-meter breaststroke to win the event at the United States Olympic swimming trials. The night before in Eugene, Ore., Kim Conley, a distance runner who competed and coached at U.C. Davis, erased a 20-meter deficit in the homestretch to claim a spot on the American track team with a third-place finish in the 5,000 meters.
Weltz, 25, and Conley, 26, have never been formally introduced despite frequently sharing the on-campus weight room. They were on solitary journeys before becoming inextricably linked because of their shared narrative.
''Like Scott, I've steadily made improvement by working hard and not giving up,'' Conley said last Thursday. ''I hope there are lots of people who can draw inspiration from the fact that we weren't athletes that people in high school looked at and said, 'There's a future Olympian.' ''
Conley's personal best in the 5,000 meters was 16 minutes 17 seconds when she graduated from U.C. Davis in 2009 with a degree in exercise science. At the national championships a year ago, she placed 10th in 15:38.13. By April, she had lowered her time to 15:24.89. Conley credited her improvement to her work the past four years with Drew Wartenburg, the Aggies' director of cross country and track and field.
''We have that one shared vision, and Drew's really inspired me,'' she said.
The women's Olympic A standard in the 5,000 meters is 15:20. On the final turn, Conley was boxed in and several meters behind the third-place runner.
''I heard Drew's voice, and I snapped out of feeling sorry for myself,'' she said.
Conley began picking off the runners ahead of her and with a desperate lunge at the finish, she secured the final Olympic berth in 15:19.79. She was four-hundredths of a second ahead of the fourth-place finisher.
''Every time I watch a replay of the finish, the way the camera angle is, it doesn't look like I did it,'' Conley said.
Upon returning from Eugene, Conley turned onto her West Sacramento street, a 10-minute drive from the Davis campus, and did a double take. A neighbor with U.C. Davis ties had done some exterior decorating. The walkway leading to Conley's house was lined with miniature American flags. Red, white and blue tinsel hung like Spanish moss. On the front door there was a homemade sign with the Olympic rings that read, ''Welcome Home, Olympian.''
At that moment, it really hit Conley what she had done.
''How do you justify calling yourself a professional athlete if you can't earn a living off it yet?'' Conley said, adding, ''Now I feel like I can justify what I'm doing.''
So, finally, can Weltz. After graduating in 2010 with a degree in economics, he said he did not know how to respond to people who asked what he did.
''I'm not a guy who's going to say, 'I'm training to go to the Olympics,' '' he said.
Weltz placed 38th at the 2008 trials in the 200-meter breaststroke. He had never posted a top-eight finish at a senior national meet. In 2010, shortly after Weltz's college eligibility expired, U.C. Davis dropped the men's swim program, which left him with no male training partners.
But Weltz beat Brendan Hansen, the former world-record holder in the 200 breaststroke, and Eric Shanteau, the American-record holder, at the trials. Frank Busch, the national team director for U.S.A. Swimming, described Weltz's victory as proof that the rags-to-riches narrative fueling the American dream had not run out of steam.
Over a post-workout breakfast last Thursday at a diner popular with students, Weltz said the attention lavished on his achievement had caught him off guard.
''It seems kind of weird,'' he said, ''because if I had not made the Olympic team no one would have made a big deal about it, but I would have been devastated.''
So confident of Weltz's Olympic prospects were the people close to him that he was left off the July work schedule for the AquaMonsters recreational swim team that he helps coach.
''I hear people talk about how this guy came out of nowhere,'' Weltz said, referring to himself, ''but that's not how we looked at it.''
The man who planted the Olympic seed in Weltz's mind and nurtured it until it bore fruit was his coach, Peter Motekaitis, a former U.C. Davis record holder who has worked with the women's program since the men's team was disbanded.
It was Motekaitis's idea to place a training device, a thick chip about the size of a quarter, inside Weltz's swimming cap during breaststroke sets. Motekaitis programmed the device so it would make a beeping sound every 16.125 seconds, which is the pace Weltz needed to maintain for each 25-meter segment of his 200 breaststroke to achieve his goal time. So even though he was training alone, Weltz essentially had a daily partner that was pushing him to a 2:09 pace, which he and Motekaitis figured would put him in the mix for an Olympic spot.
''That was the goal time,'' Weltz said, adding, ''It gave me a lot of confidence knowing I can keep up with the beep and the beep's better than my competition.''
In the 200 breaststroke final at the trials, Weltz clocked a 2:09.01, almost a second faster than the runner-up Clark Burckle. Motekaitis promptly reprogrammed the training device.
''I've got it set on a 2:08 pace now,'' he said. ''So we'll see.''
Weltz wore a U.C. Davis T-shirt during the 200 breaststroke medal ceremony and the news conference that followed, a gesture that did not go unnoticed back home.
At a July 4 cookout hosted by friends of his girlfriend, Amber Bonds, a preschool teacher, Weltz said he was approached by guests who told him how much they appreciated that he dressed in his Davis gear. Other people, including former teammates disenchanted with the university's decision to drop men's swimming, have wondered why he showed support for a university that had forsaken his sport.
''The U.C. Davis shirt was for all the people who helped me,'' Weltz said, adding: ''I was thinking the other day that by making the Olympic team maybe this is turning wheels somewhere that we can get the team back. If that happened, it would be huge. It would mean a lot to me.''
On July 5, the university announced the hiring of a new athletic director, Terry Tumey, whose first day on the job will be Aug. 1. In London on the same day, the men's 200-meter breaststroke final will take place, another shining example, Weltz hopes, of the intersecting paths that make Davis special.

HEADLINE: H.I.V. Continues Its Grim Toll on Blacks in the U.S.

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
''Frontline'' tackles one of the country's thornier and more invisible problems on Tuesday with ''Endgame: AIDS in Black America,'' which tries to pin down why rates of AIDS and H.I.V. infection are disproportionately high among black Americans. The program focuses largely on institutional causes that have been suggested by various studies, a play-it-safe approach that omits a core question: With so much known about the disease and so many years of safe-sex messages out there, how can anyone still be cavalier or uninformed about this subject?
''Today in America, 152 people will become infected with H.I.V.,'' a speaker is telling a World AIDS Day gathering as the program opens. ''Half of them will be black. Today in America, two-thirds of the new H.I.V. cases among women will be black. Today in America, 70 percent of the new H.I.V. cases among youth will be black.'' 
From there the program, directed by Renata Simone, embarks on a history lesson, tracing how AIDS was almost immediately typecast as a disease of gay white men, even though some of the earliest cases were in black men. That led to an indifference among blacks at the start of the epidemic, and soon along came the drug nightmare of the 1990s, with sex being traded for a fix, rampant needle sharing and resistance to needle-exchange programs that sought to do something about the problem. Endemic poverty in black America of course exacerbated everything about the AIDS crisis.
Black leaders acknowledge that they failed to take the kind of vocal role in the early years that they had been known for in civil rights battles and other struggles. ''I didn't do what I could have done and should have done,'' Julian Bond, the civil rights activist and a former chairman of the N.A.A.C.P., says bluntly.
Churches receive particular criticism for not stepping up, and abstinence-only versions of sex education are also faulted. (''Ignorance makes you more susceptible to the virus,'' one young woman says.)
But here is where the program starts to feel as if something were missing. White churches, too, have been hostile to gay people and pretended AIDS didn't exist. The abstinence-only view of sex education is hardly a black phenomenon. And even if churches and schools didn't do their jobs, who, especially in black America, could have missed the omnipresent news of Magic Johnson, the basketball legend who contracted H.I.V. (and who tells his story again in this program)?
Ms. Simone punctuates the big-picture issues with individual stories, several of which involve intelligent-sounding women who contracted the virus from men they thought were upstanding and trustworthy. Their stories are moving, but the men are seen only in photographs, their faces blurred out. These men's stories are what is missing from this program, because flawed institutions and economic inequality are only part of what spreads AIDS; human behavior and, at least in these particular cases, personal irresponsibility are also vital to the story.

HEADLINE: Consumers Take On More Debt

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans stepped up their borrowing in May, helped by the largest one-month gain in credit card debt in well over four years. But overall credit card use is still well below where it was just before the recession began. 
The Federal Reserve said on Monday that consumer borrowing rose by $17.1 billion in May from April.
The increase took total borrowing to a seasonally adjusted $2.57 trillion. That is just below the record high of $2.58 trillion reached in July 2008, seven months after the recession began.
Borrowing has increased steadily in the last two years. But most of the gain has been driven by auto and student loans. The category that measures activity in auto and student loans increased by $9.1 billion in May to a record $1.7 trillion
A measure of credit card debt jumped by $8 billion in May, the biggest one-month jump since November 2007. But the overall level rose to just $870 billion, well below the $1 trillion-plus before and shortly after the recession began.
Consumers cut back sharply on credit card borrowing during the recession and have only modestly been increasing their borrowing in the last year.
In May, Americans reached for their credit cards as the job market slumped and consumer confidence slid. That could mean that more people are struggling with payments and are taking on more high-interest debt.
The Fed's report covers auto loans, student loans and credit cards. It excludes mortgages, home equity loans and other debt tied to real estate.

HEADLINE: A Soccer Prodigy, At Home in Brazil

BYLINE: By SAM BORDEN

 BODY:
There is a Brazilian saying that the soccer prodigy Neymar and his family often laugh about. The phrase -- calca de veludo ou bunda de fora -- comes up frequently: when Neymar reminisces about his beginnings in street games in Sao Vicente, for example, or when someone asks, again, ''Are you really better than Messi?'' Always, the family returns to calca de veludo ou bunda de fora. And then they all giggle.
The phrase is difficult to translate directly into English. Generally, it has to do with gambling and a man's soul. It has to do with being brash and bold and brave. It has to do with fortitude and, perhaps more than anything else, an abiding belief in a singular path.
Sitting in a hotel lounge 25 stories above Columbus Circle in Manhattan last month, the star's father, Neymar Sr., looked out over Central Park and tried his best to explain it. Across the Hudson River, his son was with the Brazilian national team, preparing for a sold-out exhibition match against Argentina and, beyond that, for the Olympics, where he will be the most dynamic player in the competition. At the London Games, with the world's spotlight squarely on him, Neymar Jr. will seek to earn his country a gold medal, the one major soccer trophy it has never won. 
''He is living it right now,'' Neymar Sr. said. ''That saying we talk about -- he is doing it.''
But that was not enough. So Neymar Sr. tried again, through a translator, to summarize the essence of the phrase. His son's success, he continued, has always been based on risk. On finding the right mix of fast and slow, of possibility and caution.
At 20 years old, Neymar is already the highest-paid soccer player in Brazil. He is the face (and future) of soccer's South American mecca. He is, in the words of no less than perhaps the greatest player in history, a technical marvel, a wizard with magical feet. But through it all, his father said, this one Brazilian saying has guided him, especially now as the latest question -- when will Neymar go to Europe for good? -- is asked over and over.
Finally, Neymar Sr. laughed as he settled on the best way to present the idiom. He sat up straight and explained that in life there are, really, only two choices: ''A man can either go through life wearing velvet pants,'' he said grinning, ''or he can go through life with his bare rear end hanging out in the open air.''
A Magician With the Ball
For the better part of 100 years, Brazilian custom has allowed many, if not most, people to go by a single nickname. This convention knows no boundaries (a former president was known simply as Lula), and in some cities even the phone books list residents by a lone name.
In soccer, the nicknames are prevalent. Edson Arantes do Nascimento is Pele. Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite is Kaka. Robinho, who was Neymar Jr.'s favorite player growing up, is Robson de Souza. And so, before Neymar -- Neymar da Silva Santos Jr., actually -- there was Neymar Sr.
But Neymar Sr.'s risks did not come on the soccer field. Yes, he was a professional player, he said, but by his own admission ''not a player of high quality.'' In 1992 he was playing in Mogi das Cruzes, a factory city about 25 miles east of Sao Paulo, when his son was born. Initially, Neymar Sr. remained in Mogi, but after several years, as it became clear his playing career was ending, he moved his family -- his wife, Nadine, as well as an infant daughter and Neymar Jr. -- back to his hometown, Sao Vicente.
There, in the coastal city where he grew up, Neymar Sr. moved in with his parents. ''We weren't starting at zero -- we were starting at minus-five,'' Neymar Sr. said, acknowledging it would have been easy simply to stay put. Live in that modest house, raise his children with his parents around, aspire to little more than he had. ''We could have done that,'' he said.
Instead, he started his chase for the velvet pants. Neymar Sr. began working three jobs simultaneously. He was a car mechanic. He was a bricklayer. He was an employee for the city. His wife worked too, as a cook at a child-care center.
The early mornings and late nights lasted about four years, Neymar Sr. said, and in the middle of that span -- when Neymar Jr. was 7 -- a recruiter for a local indoor soccer team came to see them.
The family did not know it, but that was the beginning. Neymar Sr. did not get to see his son play much because he was always working, but he had heard the talk. Even at 5 and 6, Neymar was pushing to play with older boys in street games. It did not matter that the goals were sandals and the ball was sometimes little more than a rock. ''I just wanted to play,'' Neymar said during a recent interview at a New Jersey restaurant.
Grabbing a tiny salt shaker from the table, he held it up against a water glass at least three times as large. ''They were this size, I was that size,'' he said, laughing at the memory. ''They were very dismissive, the other boys. 'Who is this little kid?' But I managed to convince them to let me play that first time, and I scored a goal. That changed their attitude. That changed everything.''
Between street games and salon football, or futsal, as it is sometimes known, Neymar quickly developed a preternatural touch with the ball. Style is prized among South American players, and controlling the ball artistically is such a desired skill that there is a television show -- known as ''Street Style'' -- dedicated to identifying the best juggler.
Neymar was a celebrity judge on that show last year (he even gave a standing ovation to one contestant, who popped the ball up and hid it under his shirt as Neymar looked for it in confusion) and, as a boy, he honed his feel for the ball by rarely being without one, as if willing it to become an extension of his feet.
He can flick it, roll it, slide it and cradle it. He can make it disappear. In an exhibition against the United States this year, Neymar took the ball to the near side and danced with it toward the endline. As the crowd at FedEx Field in Landover, Md., exhaled a collective ''oooh,'' he slipped toward the goal and slid a perfect pass at the feet of a teammate, Pato.
That Pato's shot rebounded off the post almost did not matter. For that moment, Neymar was a boy again, juggling in the streets with his friends shouting at him to keep the ball in the air longer and kick it over his head once more.
''I just like playing with the ball,'' he said. ''I always have. I play on the street even now. When we're on vacation -- it doesn't matter where -- I will go and look for a game.''
There were never enough games to satisfy Neymar, and by the time he was 11, teams throughout Brazil coveted him. His father took over full-time care of Neymar's career at that point, handling the crush of scouts and club representatives who came to try and sign him. One of them was the Brazilian legend Zito, who scored 57 goals with Santos F.C. and won two World Cups with the national team. That Neymar rooted for Santos made the connection even sweeter.
Neymar ultimately joined Santos's youth team, but at 14 he was offered the chance to play for Real Madrid, a Spanish power and one of Europe's most famous clubs. Brazilian stars like Ronaldo and Robinho played for Madrid, and Neymar traveled there with his family.
The allure of Europe was powerful. ''I have always dreamed of playing there,'' Neymar said, and he could have stayed, could have made his life there. No one in Brazil would have begrudged him using that opening as the start to a long career playing in a more visible league like those in Spain or England or Italy. But Neymar Sr. said the family ignored the popular sentiment.
''We're from a humble family, and in a humble family there is always the question of cultural values,'' he said. ''We thought he had to grow up in Brazil. That was the first serious choice we had to make.''
So Neymar did not rise up through the ranks at Madrid. And he did not receive the exposure guaranteed to South American prodigies who opt to play in Europe like, say, the Argentine Lionel Messi, to whom Neymar is so often compared. Instead, he returned home. He rejoined Santos and re-entered a life that quickly developed into something he never could have imagined.
A Life Closely Examined
One afternoon, before a Santos game in 2010, Neymar and his friend Andres decided to give themselves new hairstyles. Neymar had previously kept a simple, basic look, but after toying with a razor for a while the pair settled on something akin to a Mohawk.
''It was just messing around,'' Neymar said recently, in the way mischievous children do.
At the game later, Neymar Sr. had just settled into his seat when he saw his son -- and his son's hair -- on the field. While he managed to restrain himself from running out there and wringing Neymar's neck (a thought, he acknowledged, that crossed his mind), there was a conversation -- the father's word -- afterward about Neymar's impulsiveness.
Still, little could be done. After all, Neymar had scored two goals with his new haircut, so it was not going anywhere, and the haircut quickly became a national phenomenon. Children got the Mohawk. Adults got the Mohawk. ''In Brazil, only the president doesn't have a Mohawk,'' Neymar Sr. said, sighing. Even now -- with Neymar back to a more standard appearance -- fans still pay homage. A teenage fan with a spiky Mohawk approached Neymar at the New Jersey restaurant recently, and Neymar rubbed the bristles as they took a picture together.
Neymar's fame, particularly at home, is difficult to quantify. He returned to Santos at 14 and made a first-team impact at 17, scoring 14 goals that season. At 18, he scored 42 goals in 60 games and led Santos to the championship of the Campeonato Paulista, the top league in the country.
It was not long before he could barely go out of the house. Neymar likes food -- Italian, Japanese and, of course, rice and beans, he said -- but going to restaurants became troublesome. ''And I only know how to make scrambled eggs myself,'' he said a bit sheepishly.
There are safety issues as well. While hooliganism is not as prevalent in Brazil as in some European countries, the public scrutiny of Neymar and his teammates seemingly knows no bounds. Once, after Santos lost a match, 6-2, the fans were so angry that they threw eggs at the players.
The public examination of Neymar may never have been higher than in 2011, when he became a father at 19. His father had cautioned him against the dangers of what he called the ''chemical and the physical,'' but while Neymar had avoided issues with alcohol or drugs, the uproar over his baby out of wedlock was brutal.
Journalists pried. Fans speculated. Television shows and news reports inspected all aspects of the situation. Eduardo Musa, one of the 14 members of Neymar's team of advisers, said: ''It was overwhelming, and what we did not want people to forget was that it was not a money issue or anything else. It was a baby. That was the important thing.''
The baby, a boy named Davi, was born last August, and Neymar said the ugliness surrounding the news of the pregnancy had been far overshadowed by the joys of fatherhood. Davi lives with his mother, but Neymar said he saw him often; in New York, he and his sister both shopped constantly for presents for Davi, Neymar Sr. said.
''Everything in my life has happened very early, personally and professionally,'' Neymar said. ''I'm always learning. I have to.''
Lately, the focus on Neymar has become almost exclusively about where he plays. On his 20th birthday, Feb. 5, 2012, he scored his 100th professional goal, and Santos has turned down advances from several English clubs, including Chelsea, attempting to take Neymar to Europe.
This is not new. Neymar Sr. recalled a stranger confronting him at a grocery store when Neymar was 16 and haranguing him about how he owed it to everyone -- his son, his family and Brazilians as a people -- to send Neymar to Europe to play.
But Neymar Sr. said the family was sticking to its plan. ''It was hard to stay in Brazil,'' he said. ''But we are achieving, we are doing this, at least until he matures. Then we will go out and show the world.''
A Sense of Purpose and Place
At times, Neymar Sr. sounds a bit like Tiger Woods's father, Earl, when he talks about his son. Earl Woods was known for his (often bombastic) pronouncements of Tiger's importance and impact, perhaps most notably when he suggested Tiger would have more influence on the world than Jesus Christ. Neymar Sr. is more measured -- he at least says his son is still developing -- but preaches, all the same, about how Neymar will help change the style of soccer around the world.
Initially, it seems overwrought, a reaction to the increase in rugged play (both in Brazil and elsewhere) and the deterioration of the so-called beautiful game, which features artistic dribbling and, at its best, stunning sequences of ball movement around the field.
And yet, then, one must consider this: There is a video on YouTube titled, in part, ''Neymar Super Drible,'' which contains footage from a match last year between Brazil and Argentina. In it, Neymar takes a pass on the left sideline, coolly drags the ball downfield and proceeds to do a series of feints, fakes and what looks like a sort of rudimentary samba before slyly pushing the ball past the defender.
There is no amazing goal scored on the video. There is not even a shot on goal. There is just dribbling and running and the most graceful kind of movement, and to date the video has been viewed more than nine million times.
Neymar Sr. believes that sort of reach is proof that the risks the family has taken for Neymar have been worthwhile. ''If my son were not a soccer player today, he would be unemployed,'' the father said, but it is more than that. He would have no purpose, Neymar Sr. went on. No place.
Now, Neymar is compared to Messi. Some, like Messi's former teammate Thierry Henry, see no comparison. ''I think Neymar is amazing; I think Messi is more than amazing,'' Henry said. But there are people like Pele, perhaps the greatest ever to play, who said he believed Neymar was more technically advanced than Messi.
Neymar is diplomatic, saying, ''I have a long way to go to be compared to him for real.'' If he and his father are to be believed, Neymar will leave London after the Olympics and return to Brazil, as he intends to honor his contract with Santos, which runs through 2014.
It is a risk, of course. Neymar could get hurt, could lose his form. He could be surpassed by another wunderkind who can do even more with the ball. And, as the man in the grocery store said years ago, how will the family feel if Neymar never plays on his sport's biggest stages?
Father and son say they do not care. These are the chances they have taken, and these are the choices they have made. This is their path.
''Everyone thinks money is everything, but it isn't,'' Neymar Sr. said, sipping his coffee. ''We've lived on very little.''
He gestured out the window. ''Maybe the boldness, the daring of having said 'no,' signifies something to people everywhere. Maybe it says something important. Doesn't it?''
Neymar Sr. laughed then, because he knew. Of course it did. The chase for velvet pants never ends.

HEADLINE: Study Says Meeting Contraception Needs Could Cut Maternal Death Rate by a Third

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
A new study by researchers at Johns Hopkins University shows that fulfilling unmet contraception demand by women in developing countries could reduce global maternal mortality by nearly a third, a potentially great improvement for one of the world's most vulnerable populations.
The study, published on Tuesday in The Lancet, a British science journal, comes ahead of a major family planning conference in London organized by the British government and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that is an attempt to refocus attention on the issue. It has faded from the international agenda in recent years, overshadowed by efforts to combat AIDS and other infectious diseases, as well as by ideological battles. 
The proportion of international population assistance funds that went to family planning fell to just 6 percent in 2008, down from 55 percent in 1995, while spending on H.I.V./AIDS represented 74 percent of the total in 2008, up from just 9 percent in 1995, according to Rachel Nugent, a professor of global health at the University of Washington, who cited figures from the United Nations Population Fund.
But population growth has continued to surge, with the United Nations estimating last year that the world's population, long expected to stabilize, will instead keep growing. Population experts warn that developing countries, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, where fertility continues to be high and shortages of food and water are worsening, will face deteriorating conditions if family sizes do not shrink.
''Family planning kind of faded from the radar screen, and now it is coming back,'' said John May, a visiting fellow at the Center for Global Development and author of a book, ''World Population Policies: Their Origin, Evolution, and Impact.''
''There is a realization from many different places that population issues are not going away,'' he said.
The issue of family planning is fraught in the United States, where government assistance often gets caught up in political battles. Contraception has again become controversial this political season, though the United States remains a major donor.
The Gates Foundation and the British government are pressing the issue. About $4 billion is expected to be pledged at the London conference to provide family planning services to 120 million women from the world's poorest countries over the next eight years.
''We hear time and again from women out in the field that they want the ability to plan their families,'' said Gary Darmstadt, director of family health at the Gates Foundation, who spoke by telephone from London. ''We felt we needed to shine a light back onto the importance of this issue and get the conversation going.''
Maternal deaths have declined dramatically since 1990, down by a third, according to the World Health Organization.
But about 16 percent of the world's population lives in countries where fertility is still more than four children per woman, Mr. May said. The numbers of people are expected to more than triple in these places during this century, an issue that is urgent not only for their economies and environment, but also for the women themselves, who women's rights advocates argue would benefit from more power to decide about bearing children.
The Lancet study, which the Gates Foundation financed, draws on maternal mortality and survey data from the United Nations and World Health Organization to estimate the annual number of maternal deaths in 172 countries and the share that could be preventable by the use of contraception.
Birth control reduces health risks, the researchers said, by delaying first pregnancies, which carry higher risks in very young women; cutting down on unsafe abortions, which account for 13 percent of all maternal deaths in developing countries; and controlling dangers associated with pregnancies that are too closely spaced.
The authors of the Lancet study, researchers at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins, found that the number of maternal deaths in those countries in 2008 would have nearly doubled without contraception. They acknowleged, however, that maternal mortality record-keeping is weak in developing countries, a limitation of the study. They also found that an additional 29 percent of the deaths could have been prevented if women who wanted birth control would have received it, a concept called unmet need that is estimated using surveys of mothers in developing countries.
Even so, simply providing contraceptives to people who are not using them and who say they want to avoid pregnancy might not be enough to actually do so, and Professor Nugent said the study's conclusions might be optimistic.
The lack of birth control in poor countries has become an important issue for Melinda Gates, who argued in highly personal remarks in April that birth control should not be controversial, because it improves women's lives.
''Somewhere along the way we got confused by our own conversation and we stopped trying to save these lives,'' she said. She added: ''We're not talking about abortion. We're not talking about population control. What I'm talking about is giving women the power to save their lives.''

HEADLINE: In City That Sought N.H.L. Team, a Battle Over Keeping It

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS; Jeff Z. Klein contributed reporting.

 BODY:
GLENDALE, Ariz. -- Outside a public library branch here, two men waged a silent battle one recent morning, trying to lure voters to support -- or derail -- a deal sealed last month to keep the Phoenix Coyotes in town.
On one side was Joe Cobb, 68, a retired college economics professor who was working to gather signatures to put the deal on the November ballot, which might kill it, given the widespread concern among residents over the city's debt problems. On the other side was Ben Shroyer, 30, an IT manager at a local pet-supply store who was working to persuade voters not to sign Cobb's petition. 
''Democracy is trusting the people you elect to make the right decisions for you,'' Shroyer said.
The City Council voted on June 8 to pay $324 million over 20 years in arena management fees to a company owned by Greg Jamison, who is leading a group trying to buy the Coyotes, which the N.H.L. bought out of bankruptcy three years ago.
It was, as the council member Joyce Clark put it, ''the least painful of choices'' for a city still struggling to overcome the crippling effects of the recession and the heavy weight that its investment in the Coyotes places on its finances. Glendale's slice of shared revenue from the state has fallen by 31 percent in recent years and its sales tax revenue has dropped by 14 percent, Clark said, carving a hole in its budget for the fiscal year that started on July 1.
Another potential ballot measure is seeking to invalidate a temporary sales tax increase, which the city instituted to help shore up its finances and honor the $25 million it agreed to pay the N.H.L. to cover the team's losses until the Coyotes are sold.
The Coyotes once seemed like a great investment to Glendale, but now they are perhaps the most tortured example of the perils of public funding for privately held teams.
''If there's anyone to blame for this mess, it's us because we voted to pay all this money to bring the Coyotes here,'' said Manny Martinez, a council member. ''We thought it would be a good deal.''
The Coyotes, who had the league's lowest attendance in the regular season, reached the Western Conference finals in May but have already lost one of their stars, Ray Whitney, who said the uncertainties influenced his decision to sign with the Dallas Stars when the free-agency period opened July 1. Shane Doan, the Coyotes' captain, who arrived with the team when it moved from Winnipeg in 1996, is also a free agent and has yet to decide if he will come back.
The N.H.L. deputy commissioner, Bill Daly, said the attempts to derail the deal had not yet had an impact on negotiations to sell the team to Jamison, who helped establish the San Jose Sharks as a respectable franchise during his 13 years as their chief executive.
''We will continue moving forward this month and see where we are at the end of the month,'' Daly said in an e-mail, noting that the agreements between Glendale and the league, which expire July 31, have been extended twice.
But the clock is ticking. The season is scheduled to start in October. If Jamison does not buy the team, the N.H.L. will have to decide whether to operate the Coyotes for one more year in Glendale, somehow arrange a move to Quebec City or elsewhere, or even suspend the franchise for the 2012-13 season before reactivating it somewhere else.
The city should learn soon if the $324 million lease agreement and the sales tax increase will be put on the November ballot. Signatures for the tax increase referendum were turned in Thursday and were being reviewed by the city clerk. The city said the signatures for a referendum on the lease agreement were due Monday, but organizers of the petition have argued they should have another week because of a paperwork delay.
If the ballot measures gain enough signatures, it will be up to the N.H.L. to decide whether it wants to press ahead with the sale knowing Glendale could end up with no money to pay what it owes.
In 2001, the Council voted unanimously to spend $180 million to entice the Coyotes to move to Glendale from Phoenix. Although the team had been losing $20 million a year, Glendale gambled on its potential to spur development on the west part of the city, a promising boom-time strategy that wobbled under the weight of the economic hard times ahead.
The city issued bonds to access the money, which it used in 2003 to buy the arena. The goal was to repay the debt over 30 years, using mostly sales tax generated by the businesses in the three-million-square-foot complex built around the arena.
The recession made it hard to fill all the office and retail space, and some of the restaurants that opened have since closed their doors. The complex, which also includes the Arizona Cardinals' stadium, has injected new life into the area, though, bringing in hotels, universities, an outlet mall that is scheduled to open in the fall and a hospital, which should open in 2014.
Glendale officials are again banking on possibilities. They are hoping Jamison will turn around the Coyotes, just as he was able to turn around the Sharks. And they are hoping the sales tax increase, which would generate about $20 million a year, will go through. Area hockey fans formed a group, Coyotes Political Action Committee, to counter the petition efforts by Cobb, who is also running as a libertarian against the Democratic incumbent, Ed Pastor, to represent parts of Phoenix and Glendale in Congress.
Shroyer, one of the group's volunteers, passed on bright-green fliers to library visitors that urged, ''Don't sign, get the facts,'' and noted that the hundreds of thousands of customers who attended the Coyotes games last season also patronized the restaurants, hotels and shops near the area. Cobb had a pair of clipboards holding official petition papers and a black and white printout taped to his table, saying, ''Let the voters decide.''
Catherine Ford, 75, approached him and said, enthusiastically, ''I'm definitely going to sign.''
''I don't like all my taxes being raised to subsidize private business,'' Ford said. ''Frankly, the percentage of people who go to these Coyotes games don't justify all the money we have already spent.''

HEADLINE: Housing's Last Chance?

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
There are few counties in America in as rough shape as San Bernardino County in California. During the housing bubble, the good times were very good. But then came the bust.
Today, San Bernardino County has one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation: 11.9 percent. Home prices have collapsed. Astonishingly, every second home is underwater, meaning the homeowner owes more on the mortgage than the house is worth. It is well documented that underwater mortgages have a high likelihood of defaulting -- and, eventually, being foreclosed on. It has also been clear for some time that the best way to keep troubled homeowners in their homes is by reducing the principal on their mortgages, thus lowering their debt burden and more closely aligning their mortgage with the actual value of the home.
Which is why Greg Devereaux, the county's chief executive officer, found himself listening intently when the folks from Mortgage Resolution Partners came knocking on his door. They had spent the previous year kicking around an intriguing idea: have localities buy underwater mortgages using their power of eminent domain -- and then write the homeowner a new, reduced mortgage. It's principal reduction using a stick instead of a carrot. 
I know. When you first hear this idea, it sounds a little crazy. Eminent domain to take a mortgage? But the more closely you look at it, the more sense it starts to make. It would be a way to break the logjam that keeps mortgages in mortgage-backed bonds -- securitizations -- from being modified. It could prevent foreclosures. And it could finally stabilize housing prices.
The core issue that Mortgage Resolution Partners is trying to solve is what might be called the securitization problem. Bundling mortgages into securities and selling them to investors was, initially, a wonderful idea because it greatly expanded the amount of capital available for homeownership. But the people who wound up owning the mortgages -- investors -- were diffuse, often with conflicting interests, while the mortgages were managed by servicers or trustees who didn't actually own them. And the securitization contracts never anticipated that people might need to modify. So it has been nearly impossible to modify mortgages stuck in securitizations.
It turns out, however, that there is nothing to prevent a government entity from using eminent domain to acquire a mortgage. ''Eminent domain has existed for centuries,'' said Robert Hockett, a law professor at Cornell who has served as an adviser to Mortgage Resolution Partners. ''And it is applicable to any kind of property, including a mortgage.'' What matters, Hockett continued, is two things: is the entity paying fair value for the property, and is it for a legitimate public purpose?
Can there be any doubt that keeping people in their homes constitutes a legitimate public purpose? ''This is a yoke around the American economy,'' said Steven Gluckstern, an entrepreneur with a varied career in insurance and finance who is the chairman of Mortgage Resolution Partners. ''When people are underwater, their behavior changes. They stop spending. There are 12 million homes that are underwater,'' he added. ''Is the answer to really just let them get foreclosed on? Or wait for housing prices to rise?'' According to Gluckstern, the fact that the foreclosure crisis is continuing is precisely why housing prices aren't rising -- despite some of the lowest interest rates in history.
As for fair value, since the home has dropped dramatically in value, the mortgage is worth a lot less than its face value. On Wall Street, in fact, traders are buying securitized mortgage bonds at a steep discount -- reflecting the true value of the mortgages they're buying. Yet the homeowner remains saddled with a mortgage that is unrealistically high. The plan calls for the county to buy mortgages at a steep, but fair, discount to its face value, and then to offer the homeowner a new mortgage that reflects much, though not all, of that discount. (Fees and costs would be paid for by the spread.) The money to buy the mortgages would come from investors; indeed, Mortgage Resolution Partners is in the process of raising money.
The securitization industry is up in arms about this proposal. In late June, after the plan was leaked to Reuters, some 18 organizations, including the Association of Mortgage Investors, wrote a threatening letter to the San Bernardino board of supervisors claiming that the plan would inflict ''significant harm'' to homeowners in the county. For his part, Devereaux insists that no final decision has been made. But, he says, ''this is the first idea that anyone has approached us with that has the potential to have a real impact on our economy.'' Other cities are watching closely to see what happens in San Bernardino.
We're four years into a housing crisis. Nothing has yet worked to stem the terrible tide of foreclosures. It's time to give eminent domain a try.

HEADLINE: Love Among the Spuds

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
PLOVER, Wis.
Tammy Baldwin, who has a very real chance of becoming the first openly gay or lesbian person elected to the United States Senate, stood with a 73-year-old potato farmer in his fields here the other day and asked him: ''How hot am I?''
For the previous half-hour, the farmer had been boastfully showing Baldwin, 50, his equipment: the sorting machine, the stacking machine. And now, in response to her question, he nudged his thermometer close to her. I do mean thermometer, an infrared one, with which he'd just determined that the temperature of the dirt on this scorching July afternoon was 136 degrees. 
He took a reading of Baldwin's skin, which was a crackling 101.
''Wow,'' she said, repeating a syllable that was getting a thorough workout as she deftly played a social role as traditional as any: the attractive younger woman stroking the older man's pride. Her sexual orientation was irrelevant.
Because he didn't care about it? Or didn't even know? I had just a few minutes to chat with him before she and a few aides, doing a campaign swing through rural Wisconsin, arrived, and I got the sense that he was familiar only with her politics, the populist tone of which he said he liked.
''And the lesbian part?'' wasn't a phrase I instantly blurted out. The lesbian part shouldn't be the deciding factor. And to judge from what I observed while shadowing her one day last week, it won't be.
Baldwin, a Democrat currently serving her seventh term in the House, won't know until mid-August which of four Republican aspirants she'll face and precisely what kind of fight she's in for.
But I don't think its outcome will be governed by whom and how she loves. Not in 2012. Not with all the change afoot.
Look at the last few weeks, even the last few days. The high-profile wedding in the news over the weekend was of the retiring Congressman Barney Frank and his male partner. The high-profile wedding the weekend before that was of the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes and his male partner.
A male hip-hop star just came out; a prominent pray-away-the-gay advocate just conceded that sexual orientation is Psalms-resistant; Google just announced that it would promote gay rights worldwide, even in countries where homosexual acts are now criminal.
That's not to mention Anderson Cooper's recent acknowledgment that he's gay, which elicited more yawns than gasps. The reaction befit a world in which Ellen DeGeneres is a pitchwoman not only for CoverGirl but also for J.C. Penney, whose catalogs this year included same-sex couples.
The specific issue of same-sex marriage still provokes fierce disagreement. But even factoring that in, the gay rights movement inexorably closes in on its real goal, which is not -- as some opponents believe -- for everyone to be talking incessantly about homosexuality. Among ourselves we don't talk incessantly about it, trust me. We talk about dinner, diets and, during a summer like this, air-conditioning. We're hot all right, but in the same weary, sweaty sense as everyone else.
The goal is for talking about homosexuality to be largely unnecessary. The goal is for the presence, legitimacy and equal rights of gays to be givens.
In 1998, Baldwin became the first openly gay or lesbian non-incumbent candidate elected to Congress. Four years earlier, Wisconsinites in a different district re-elected Steve Gunderson, a longtime Republican congressman, after learning of his homosexuality. He retired after that term.
For most of Baldwin's congressional career she was coupled, but the two women broke up in 2010. During an interview late last year, she confirmed for me that she was still single.
When I asked last week if that status had changed, she laughed: ''During a U.S Senate campaign?'' She didn't mean that dating was politically risky. She meant it was time-consuming.
Before entering the Senate race, she had research done on her vulnerabilities. It suggested that her sexual orientation wouldn't be a useful weapon in attacks against her, she said.
Only once as I shadowed her did it come up, when a supporter sought advice on how to discuss it with others. She told him to focus their attention on what the election was really about: economic opportunity, security and fairness.
Those were the main topics covered when she mingled with voters outside a Curves gym in the town of Friendship and, later, inside a pub in Nekoosa.
In Plover, during her meet-and-greet with the farmer, the conversation turned to spuds. He told her his services were always available -- a phone call away -- should she need tuber tutelage.
''Remember Dan Quayle,'' he said, recalling how the former vice president never lived down his ''potatoe'' misspelling. ''If you've got the wrong information, it can hit you real hard.''
How delicious. He surveyed the possible tripwires on her path into history, and all he saw were gratuitous vowels.

HEADLINE: Seeking to Lure the Crowds Again. But Hold the Borscht.

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME; Sari Botton contributed reporting.

 BODY:
KIAMESHA LAKE, N.Y. -- Long before they became associated with borscht, the Catskills conjured images of fog-shrouded cliffs and rugged retreats, Rip Van Winkle and the Hudson River School of art.
Now, unfortunately, they evoke the past and present of Concord Road in Sullivan County. The Concord, once the largest hotel in the Catskills, with a dining room that seated 3,000, and, during the 1940s, a 35-piece orchestra performing Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky, closed in 1998. A proposed $600 million entertainment, housing and gambling complex that is the latest plan to revive it exists only on paper. And for now, there is just a dismal, fenced-in expanse of rubble, brush and ghosts.
In an era when enhancing the brand name is deemed mandatory for every aspiring company, celebrity and locale, it seems clear that the Catskills could use a rebooted one. Hence an exercise in crowd-sourcing and creative marketing in which the newly formed Catskill Park Resource Foundation is hoping to raise $5 million to rebrand the Catskills. 
''I think there has been a general awareness on the part of people in tourism and business for many years that the brand 'Catskills' is just not helpful,'' said Dean Gitter, who founded the high-end Emerson Resort and Spa in Mount Tremper, N.Y., in 2001. He has worked for more than a decade to get approval for a resort on Belleayre Moutain and is a charter board member of the foundation. ''It's either 'the borscht belt,' which isn't accurate and is long gone, or it's just nebulous 'upstate,' wherever that is. Or else, like after Hurricane Irene, we're just off people's radar altogether.''
In truth, the Catskill region has been trying to change its image and its economic climate for almost half a century. Despite the growing second-home market, creeping hipsterism and exurban meccas like Woodstock, however, much of the region remains depressed. The past year has been disastrous: the lagging economy, flooding from Tropical Storm Irene in August, and an almost snowless winter that produced a dismal ski season.
It is tricky in terms of geography, definition and marketing. The Catskill area that became perhaps the country's first tourism destination and the site of legendary attractions like Kaaterskill Falls, Kaaterskill Clove and the Catskill Mountain House was in the spectacular mountains of Greene County. But the image of the Catskills is still defined by its southern edges and the borscht belt hotels of Sullivan County in the rolling hills closest to New York City.
Various groups, including the Central Catskills Chamber of Commerce, the Great Northern Catskills Chamber of Commerce and four counties, try to market the area, so it is hard to speak with a single voice or to say, for example, just where the Hudson Valley ends and the Catskills begin.
The region's heart is the 700,000 acres of the Catskill Park, in Delaware, Greene, Sullivan and Ulster Counties, which has 98 peaks over 3,000 feet high, but this marketing effort focuses on all four counties, including areas that may be part of the Catskills culturally but not geographically.
For example, Ellenville, at the foot of the Shawangunk Ridge east of the Catskills, was the home of the now-closed Nevele Hotel, so it has been considered part of the Catskills even if it is geographically part of the Shawangunks, known as the Gunks. Brendan Burke, artistic director of the Shadowland Theater there, says the theater considers itself part of the Catskills or the Hudson Valley-Catskills Region while wishing the term Catskills had more appeal.
''It's got a stigma, an old-school stigma, so I think rebranding it would be a great idea,'' Mr. Burke said. ''You hear it and think bungalow colonies and resorts with bad carpet. For me, Gunks is a type of branding that's very powerful. You hear it and think rock climbing, youth, beautiful areas, bed-and-breakfasts, majestic views and fireflies. That's what the Catskills are, too, but you don't think about that.''
The idea is to make people think of the Catskills in terms of trout fishing, artisanal cheese and Zen retreats, rather than Simon Says, rimshot comedians and ''Dirty Dancing.'' Still, the proposed rebranding of the neo-Catskills has a bit of the feel of proto-Catskills publicity ploy, online.
Mr. Gitter, whose proposed Belleayre resort has been reduced in size to 739 privately owned acres, from 1,960 acres, after it generated bitter opposition from environmental groups, said people with ideas for a new Catskills catchphrase can send them to the group's Web site, cprandco.org, by Sunday.
He said more than 1,000 have been submitted since the middle of June; five finalists will be selected. After July 27, people may vote on the Web site to pick a winner, who will be awarded $1,500. The winning slogan will be announced Aug. 25 at a comedy event supporting the foundation; it is to feature Susie Essman, who stars in HBO's ''Curb Your Enthusiasm,'' lives nearby and played the borscht belt when it was still the borscht belt.
Marketing experts have different thoughts on rebranding the Catskills.
Catherine Kaputa, a strategist and author who founded SelfBrand, said there was not much juice left in old images, and it would probably be better to start from scratch.
''Sometimes you can do various things with an existing brand, but I think with 'borscht belt' you have to throw it out the window,'' she said.
William Arruda, another brand strategist, said it usually made more sense to ''create a bridge'' from an existing image rather than try to start afresh.
And Allen Adamson, a managing director of Landor Associates, a branding and consulting firm, said rebranding anything these days was tough.
''We're branding countries, states, cities, business districts -- everyone is yelling 'Hey, look at me!' '' he said. ''It's a brutal environment for getting anyone to pay attention.''
Which is perhaps why Ron Rozman, a semiretired editor and entrepreneur who grew up in Ellenville, reasons that if the mountains, rivers and valleys are the ultimate brand, why not just leave them be?
''It seems silly to rebrand the Catskills,'' he said. ''It's like rebranding a black walnut tree.''

Places like Woodstock, top left, are popular, but most of the region is economically depressed. A site in Kiamesha Lake, N.Y., above, was home to the Concord Resort Hotel, demolished in 2000. The area's largest resort, it had a dining room seating 3,000.

HEADLINE: Bank Scandal Turns Spotlight To Regulators

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
As big banks face the fallout from a global investigation into interest rate manipulation, American and British lawmakers are scrutinizing regulators who failed to take action that might have prevented years of illegal activity.
Politicians in both London and Washington are questioning whether regulators allowed banks to report false rates in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis and afterward. On Monday, Congress stepped into the fray, requesting information about the role of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, according to people close to the matter.
The focus on regulators and other financial institutions has intensified in the last two weeks after the British bank Barclays agreed to pay $450 million to resolve its case. British and American authorities accused the bank of improperly influencing key interest rates to deflect concerns about its health and bolster profits.
The Barclays settlement is the first action stemming from a broad investigation into how banks set key benchmarks, including the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. The pricing of $350 trillion of financial products, including credit cards, mortgages and student loans, is pegged to Libor and other such rates. 
Authorities around the world are now considering action against more than 10 big banks, including UBS, JPMorgan and Citigroup. The banks also face a raft of civil litigation from municipalities, investors and other financial firms that claim they lost money from the misreporting of rates. These lawsuits could end up costing the industry tens of billions of dollars, according to analysts.
On Monday, the oversight panel of the House Financial Services Committee sent a letter to the New York Fed seeking transcripts from at least a dozen phone calls in 2007 and 2008 between central bank officials and executives at Barclays.
''Some news reports indicate that although Barclays raised concerns multiple times with American and British authorities about discrepancies over how Libor was set, the bank was not told to stop the practice,'' Representative Randy Neugebauer, a Texas Republican and the head of the House oversight panel, said in the letter, which was reviewed by The New York Times.
The political firestorm also escalated in London on Monday, where a British parliamentary committee grilled a top Bank of England official over his knowledge of wrongdoing at Barclays. British politicians chided Paul Tucker, deputy governor at the Bank of England, the country's central bank, for not taking a more active role in Libor.
In November 2007, Mr. Tucker led a meeting in which some officials raised concerns that banks were underreporting Libor submissions to temper concerns about their health, a process known as lowballing. It was in the earliest stages of the market turmoil that would culminate in the 2008 financial crisis, and banks were loath to report high rates that pointed to weak financial footing.
''This doesn't look good, Mr. Tucker,'' Andrew Tyrie, the head of the parliamentary committee, said on Monday, referring to minutes of the meeting. ''We have what appear to any reasonable person as the lowballing of rates.''
The Barclays settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Justice Department and Financial Services Authority of Britain has been a black mark for the bank. The scandal has already prompted the resignation of the bank's chairman, Marcus Agius; its chief executive, Robert Diamond; and a top deputy, Jerry del Missier.
As it tries to control the damage, Barclays is framing a defense around the notion that regulators approved the actions. Last week, the bank released information about dozens of conversations with the Bank of England, the New York Fed and other government agencies.
In one call with the Financial Services Authority, a Barclays manager acknowledged that the bank was understating its Libor submissions. ''So, to the extent that, um, the Libors have been understated, are we guilty of being part of the pack? You could say we are,'' the Barclays manager said, according to regulatory documents.
The bank also discussed its Libor rates twice with the Bank of England in fall 2008, according to documents Barclays released last week. Additional evidence has emerged that the British central bank first held discussions about Libor with Mr. del Missier a year earlier, in late 2007, said a person briefed on the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Authorities are also focused on Barclays' conversations with the New York Fed, including discussions between senior bank employees and officials from the Fed's trading desk, according to another person briefed on the matter, who also requested anonymity.
In the letter to the New York Fed, Mr. Neugebauer requested transcripts of the calls by Friday.
''The role of the government is to ensure that our capital markets are run with the highest standards of honesty, integrity and transparency'' Mr. Neugebauer said on Monday. ''The interest rate manipulation scandal clearly demonstrates that these principles were violated by Barclays and, from what we understand, other banks as well. My request to the New York Fed is a preliminary step to understanding what role, if any, the regulators played in this scandal.''
In a statement, a New York Fed spokeswoman said that during the financial crisis ''we received occasional anecdotal reports from Barclays of problems with Libor.'' Ultimately, the New York Fed made ''further inquiry of Barclays as to how Libor submissions were being conducted'' and offered ''suggestions for reform of Libor'' to British authorities.
Under sharp questioning by British political leaders on Monday, Mr. Tucker, considered a front-runner to succeed Mervyn A. King as the next head of the Bank of England, defended the central bank and his professional future. Committee members focused their questioning on a conversation that Mr. Tucker had with Mr. Diamond in October 2008.
According to an e-mail trail, Mr. Tucker contacted Mr. Diamond, saying he was ''struck'' that Barclays was paying a high interest rate on its loans.
Mr. Tucker testified that his conversations with Mr. Diamond were meant to convey that the financial markets were questioning whether the British bank had access to capital.
Barclays last week also released documents saying that at least some bank executives believed Mr. Tucker had instructed them to lower the Libor submissions. That belief, some regulators say, stemmed from a ''miscommunication,'' rather than instructions from Mr. Tucker. The bank also never explicitly told regulators that it was reporting false interest rates that amounted to manipulation, according to regulatory documents.
Mr. Tucker on Monday flatly denied that he authorized, or even knew about, any improper actions. ''We were not aware of it, other than what is starting to come out in these investigations,'' he said.
Underscoring the point, he noted that the Bank of England used the rate to set its Special Liquidity Scheme, in which the government lent local banks more than $310 billion from 2008 to 2011.
Still, British politicians criticized Mr. Tucker for not taking a more active role in policing the banks. When asked whether he was confident that the Libor manipulation had stopped, Mr. Tucker wavered.
''I can't be confident about anything after learning about this cesspit,'' he replied.

HEADLINE: Market Droops as Investors Await Earnings Reports

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Anxious investors sent stocks modestly lower on Monday ahead of corporate earnings reports and amid more signs of instability in Europe.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 36.18 points, to 12,736.29. It was the Dow's third consecutive day of declines. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 2.22 points, to 1,352.46, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 5.56 points, to 2,931.77. 
Alcoa, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow, became the first big American company to report second-quarter results after the market closed Monday. The aluminum manufacturer beat the earnings estimates of Wall Street analysts by a penny a share, excluding onetime items, although revenue dropped because of weaker prices and pockets of declining demand in the slowing global economy.
Alcoa's results are often seen as a harbinger for other major companies. So far, investor expectations are low. Wall Street forecasts a 1 percent decline in second-quarter earnings of S.& P. 500 companies compared with last year, according to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ. That would be the first decline since the third quarter of 2009.
Kim Caughey-Forrest, a senior equity analyst at the Fort Pitt Capital Group, said many portfolio managers were fearful that this earnings season could bring disappointments about stocks they bought this year.
Advanced Micro Devices dropped 10 percent in after-hours trading after the semiconductor company unexpectedly released preliminary results after the market close. Revenue fell 11 percent from the previous quarter because of weak sales in China and Europe. The company previously forecast revenue growth of 3 percent.
Investors were unnerved Monday by developments in Europe, where Spain's borrowing costs rose as finance ministers from the euro countries gathered in Brussels to complete a rescue package for Spain's banks.
The interest rate on Spain's 10-year government bond rose above 7 percent.
In the American bond market, the price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 10/32, to 102 5/32, while its yield dropped to 1.51 percent, from 1.55 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: A Gold Rush in the Abyss

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
Tom Dettweiler makes his living miles down. He helped find the Titanic. After that, his teams located a lost submarine heavy with gold. In all, he has cast light on dozens of vanished ships.
Mr. Dettweiler has now turned from recovering lost treasures to prospecting for natural ones that litter the seabed: craggy deposits rich in gold and silver, copper and cobalt, lead and zinc. A new understanding of marine geology has led to the discovery of hundreds of these unexpected ore bodies, known as massive sulfides because of their sulfurous nature.
These finds are fueling a gold rush as nations, companies and entrepreneurs race to stake claims to the sulfide-rich areas, which dot the volcanic springs of the frigid seabed. The prospectors -- motivated by dwindling resources on land as well as record prices for gold and other metals -- are busy hauling up samples and assessing deposits valued at trillions of dollars.
''We've had extreme success,'' Mr. Dettweiler said in a recent interview about the deepwater efforts of his company, Odyssey Marine Exploration of Tampa, Fla. 
Skeptics once likened mining the deep to looking for riches on the moon. No more. Progress in marine geology, predictions of metal shortages in the decades ahead and improving access to the abyss are combining to make it real.
Environmentalists have expressed growing alarm, saying too little research has been done on the risks of seabed mining. The industry has responded with studies, reassurance and upbeat conferences.
The technological advances center on new robots, sensors and other equipment, some of it derived from the offshore oil and gas industry. Ships lower exploratory gear on long tethers and send down sharp drills that gnaw into the rocky seabed. All of this underwater machinery is making it more and more feasible to find, map and recover seabed riches.
Industrial powers -- including government-supported groups in China, Japan and South Korea -- are hunting for sulfides in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. And private companies like Odyssey have made hundreds of deep assessments and claims in the volcanic zones around Pacific island nations: Fiji, Tonga, Vanuatu, New Zealand, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea.
The International Seabed Authority, a sleepy United Nations body located in Jamaica that presides over mineral rights on the high seas, an area its officials like to characterize as 51 percent of the earth's surface, has found itself besieged with sulfide queries.
''We are entering a new stage,'' Nii Allotey Odunton of Ghana, secretary general of the authority, told a meeting in November.
Since the Pacific islands control mineral rights in their territorial waters, they can negotiate mining deals more easily than the seabed authority, which tends to plod along by international consensus.
Odyssey Marine Exploration, which recently expanded from shipwreck recovery into deep prospecting, began scouring the Pacific waters in 2010, discovering far more gold, silver and copper than expected.
''There's a lot at stake,'' Mr. Dettweiler said. If metal prices go up, he added, ''a billion-dollar deposit can turn into a hundred billion.''
Scientists once thought the main source of wealth in the deep sea lay in beds of potato-size rocks that could be mined for such common metals as iron and nickel. In the 1960s and '70s, entrepreneurs tried to scoop them up, but the rewards never offset the high cost of exploration, retrieval and transportation.
Things began to change in 1979 with the discovery of ''black smokers'', sulfurous mounds and towers that gush blistering-hot water. The smokers turned out to dot the 46,000 miles of volcanic fissures that gird the global seabed like seams on a baseball.
Scientists found that the smokers formed as hot water rose through the volcanic rocks, hit icy seawater and shed a variety of minerals that slowly coalesced into eerie mounds and chimneys. One, found off Washington State and nicknamed Godzilla, stood more than 15 stories high.
The first wave of discovery showed that the volcanic springs harbored riots of bizarre creatures, including thickets of tube worms. The second wave showed that the mounds and chimneys -- hot and cold, new and old, active and inactive -- were composed of complex minerals that contained surprising amounts of copper, silver and gold.
Today, increasingly, mines on land lack rich supplies of copper, a staple of modern life found in everything from pipes to computers. Many commercial ores have concentrations of only a half a percent. But seabed explorers have found purities of 10 percent and higher -- turning the obscure deposits into potential bonanzas. The same turned out to be true of silver and gold.
Fifteen years ago, would-be underwater miners staked the world's first claim: Nautilus Minerals won title to about 2,000 square miles of the Papua New Guinea seabed rich in volcanic features. The company, based in Toronto, inched toward mining but quickly expanded its prospecting to hundreds of Pacific sites and has since identified dozens of areas as potential candidates for seabed mining.
Last year, Nautilus won a 20-year lease to mine a rich deposit in the Bismarck Sea, in the southwestern Pacific. The mounds are a mile down. The company says the site holds about 10 tons of gold and 125,000 tons of copper.
Nautilus plans to start mining next year but also cites possible delays. It is building robots up to 25 feet tall that are to collect sulfides and pump them to the surface. Barges are then to carry the seabed minerals to Rabaul, a Papua New Guinea port some 30 miles away.
''We're making good progress,'' Stephen Rogers, the company's chief executive, recently told analysts.
Critics say the plan is potentially dangerous for fisheries, islanders and ecosystems. In a 32-page report, ''Out of Our Depth,'' an international group of environmentalists that calls itself the Deep Sea Mining Campaign noted that the volcanic sites shelter hundreds of species previously unknown to science.
The group said information gaps should be filled and mitigation plans developed ''before mining begins.''
In an interview, Mr. Rogers called the group's analysis unfair. ''We're developing detailed environmental plans and have an obligation to do that,'' he said. ''We're very proud of what we've done.''
He added that his company was working closely with some of the world's leading oceanographers and that its operations were shedding light on the sulfide mysteries. ''We're advancing the science,'' he said.
Experts around the globe are watching Nautilus closely to see how it navigates the perils of environmental politics, novel technologies and unpredictable markets.
''Any success will work as a trigger for other mining companies,'' said Georgy Cherkashov, a Russian marine geologist and president of the International Marine Minerals Society.
China, the world's largest consumer of gold, copper and many other industrial metals, has shown little interest in waiting for declarations of success. When the seabed authority adopted rules for sulfide prospecting in May 2010, Beijing's representative filed the country's application on the same day.
China does its mineral hunting from ships. It is also developing a submersible known as Jiaolong, after a mythical sea dragon, that can carry three people down deep enough to investigate the sulfide areas.
Last year, it signed a contract with the authority for exclusive sulfide rights to 3,860 square miles, about the size of Puerto Rico, on a volcanic rift nearly two miles below the Indian Ocean. Jin Jiancai, secretary general of China's ocean mineral resources agency, told reporters that such deposits ''will help China meet the increasing demand'' for refined metals.
Meanwhile, Tong Ling, China's largest importer of copper concentrates and one of the world's largest copper smelters, recently signed a deal with Nautilus for more than a million tons of Pacific sulfide ores per year -- an amount equal to about 5 percent of the world's copper production.
Russia joined the high-seas rush in 2011, and France and South Korea in May. Recently, Seoul also cut a deal for sulfide prospecting in the waters of Fiji, letting it tap the mineral bounty of Pacific volcanism.
John R. Delaney, an oceanographer at the University of Washington who has studied the volcanic springs for decades, said the threat of environmental harm from seabed mining probably centered less on the high-seas projects of developed states than those in the territorial waters of the Pacific islanders.
''They're more worried about their economies than the environment,'' he said in an interview.
Dr. Cherkashov of the minerals society played down the environmental concerns, saying one reason for the global rush is that seabed mining has a relatively low impact compared with land operations.
''It's first come, first get,'' he said of the multiplying claims. The wide maneuvering for the most promising sites, he added, represents ''the last redivision of the world.''

HEADLINE: At 11th Hour, Norway's Government Steps In to Avert a Lockout of Oil Workers

BYLINE: By STANLEY REED; Clifford Krauss contributed reporting from Houston.

 BODY:
LONDON -- Minutes before Norway's oil industry planned to lock out thousands of striking workers, the Norwegian government stepped in, ordering the offshore workers back to work and sending the dispute to binding arbitration.
The government's intervention ended a threat that had rattled global oil markets. Norway's oil industry had warned that it would begin the lockout of 6,500 offshore oil workers at 12:01 a.m. Norway time on Tuesday. Norway is the largest producer of oil and gas in Western Europe, and a large-scale shutdown could have caused an upturn in world petroleum prices, which lately have been softening because of slack economic demand.
Offshore oil workers had been on strike since June 24 over retirement and pension issues, causing the shutdown earlier of some Norwegian fields. The Norwegian Oil Industry Association, which represents the petroleum companies, had warned the workers to return to work by Tuesday or be locked out of their jobs. 
But Norway's minister of labor, Hanne Bjurstrom, summoned the two sides to a meeting in her office just 30 minutes before the lockout was supposed to begin. ''She declared the conflict as over and that there will be compulsory arbitration to define the new pay agreement,'' the oil industry association said in a statement on its Web site.
Already, the strike has cut Norwegian oil production by 15 percent, and gas production 7 percent. The Norwegian offshore industry produces about two million barrels per day of oil, or about 2 percent of world supplies.
Losing that much petroleum output would have added ''three or four dollars'' to the price of a barrel of oil, said Stuart Joyner, an analyst at Investec Securities in London.
One labor leader said before the government's order that it was ''crazy'' for the oil companies to allow a shutdown that would cost them ''a lot of money.''
''The North Sea will be shut down completely,'' said Leif Sande, president of Industri Energi, one of the three unions involved in the dispute.
As a lockout looked increasingly likely, oil prices rose in Monday trading. The United States benchmark oil rose $1.54 to $85.99 a barrel. Brent crude, the European benchmark oil, rose more than $2 a barrel, although it is down about 15 percent since the beginning of the year.
The loss of Norwegian crude was not the only worry of international oil experts, who expected global supplies to tighten as Iranian exports are squeezed by sanctions. There were reports over the weekend of sabotage on a key pipeline in Nigeria's Niger Delta. And local militia in Libya, protesting Saturday's elections, blocked three export terminals responsible for half of the country's shipments for two days last week.
Whatever the supply and price of oil, though, the far bigger impact of a Norwegian disruption would have been on the natural gas market. Norway produces about 10.8 billion cubic feet of gas per day, according to data from the industry association. That is about 3 percent of the global supply of natural gas. Within Europe, Norway provides about 26 percent of the region's natural gas, about the same as the other big supplier, Russia. Britain, Germany and France are among the big consumers of Norwegian gas.
Natural gas on the global spot market gained 10.7 cents in Monday trading in New York to end at $2.883 per 1,000 cubic feet.
With European gas inventories already 8 percent lower than at this time last year, a result of bad winter weather and diversion of some supplies to Asia, ''a shut-in of Norwegian gas output has considerable potential to compound an already tightening European gas market,'' said Rob West, analyst at Bernstein Research in London.
One buffering factor could be that, with much of Europe in the economic doldrums, demand for gas is weaker than it might otherwise be. In the labor dispute, the unions are seeking to lower the retirement age for offshore oil workers to 62 from 65.
Norway's oil and gas workers are already among the world's best paid, making an average of $157,000 a year, according to the industry association. And while offshore laborers work only about 16 weeks a year, they cite tough conditions in their call for an earlier retirement age.
Mr. Sande, the labor official, said that the unions had proposed paying the early retirement costs out of $40 million they had already set aside for that purpose.
''What we are asking the employers is to allow us to use our own money to pay pensions,'' Mr. Sande said.
With the lockout threat, the oil industry seemed to be trying to force the Norwegian government to intervene in the dispute.
''Of course, it will harm Norway's reputation as a secure energy supplier to Europe,'' said Eli Ane Nedreskar, a spokeswoman for the industry association. ''This is important for both the companies and the government.''
Norwegian oil production has been in decline for years, falling from 3.4 million barrels a day in 2001 to about 2 million barrels a day in 2011, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy. Gas output has doubled in that period.
Still, Norway remains by far the largest oil producer in Western Europe, with roughly double Britain's output.
A spokesman for Statoil, which is controlled by the Norwegian government, had said earlier on Monday that barring a resolution of the strike, the company intended to begin a controlled shutdown of its platforms early Tuesday. Statoil would have been the biggest loser in a sustained lockout. The company had said it would lose 1.2 million barrels a day of oil and oil equivalent production, leading to a revenue loss of about 520 million Norwegian kroner, or about $85 million, a day.
Other companies with substantial exposure to Norwegian production relative to their size include France's Total, Italy's ENI and Shell.
Some analysts had predicted that the government would force a quick solution.
''It will end in forced arbitration -- it always does,'' said Bjorn Dingsor, director of Norwegian Energy, a market research firm, on Monday. ''Norway will not put its reputation as a reliable energy producer at risk.''
Online Correction: July 9, 2012, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article gave an incorrect accounting of the workers involved in the Norwegian oil industry dispute. The lockout that had been threatened would have affected 6,500 offshore workers; that is not the number of workers, a smaller group, who had already been on strike.

HEADLINE: Obama's Camp Makes Aggressive Push for Romney to Disclose Offshore Finances

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Dalia Sussman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama's push on Monday to extend tax cuts for the middle class -- but not for the rich -- is being joined by an all-out effort from his allies to portray Mitt Romney as a wealthy candidate who is out of touch with most Americans.
The president's campaign and his surrogates are accusing the presumptive Republican nominee of hiding the sources of his multimillion-dollar fortune and of refusing to release multiple years of his tax returns. On Monday, they also mocked Mr. Romney's weekend fund-raisers at glamorous estates in the Hamptons. 
In an interview with a New Hampshire television station on Monday, Mr. Obama added his voice to the criticism of his rival, saying that Americans should ''know who you are and what you've done and that you're an open book. And that's been true of every presidential candidate dating all the way back to Mitt Romney's father.''
Senior aides to Mr. Obama's campaign say the intent is not to attack the rich, or even the fact of Mr. Romney's wealth. Instead, the focus on Mr. Romney's personal fortune is part of a broader plan, they say, to disqualify Mr. Romney's economic credentials in the eyes of voters.
''It's about the fact that Governor Romney, who could be the first president in history to keep his finances offshore, has defied precedent and kept his tax returns secret even though they could prove whether or not he avoided paying taxes,'' said Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for Mr. Obama.
Amanda Henneberg, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney, called questions about the Republican's wealth an ''unfounded character assault'' and said it was ''unseemly and disgusting.''
The aggressive push by Democrats comes just days after another mediocre jobs report provided new ammunition for Mr. Romney's criticism of the president's economic policies. Just 80,000 jobs were added in June, capping the worst quarter since the summer of 2010 for job creation.
Mr. Obama sought a quick change of subject on Monday with his call for an extension of middle-class tax cuts, saying that the fate of similar cuts for the wealthy would be resolved by voters in November's election.
''My opponent will fight to keep them in place,'' he said. ''I will fight to end them.''
Meanwhile, the president's advisers and allies are intensifying their focus on Mr. Romney's financial holdings, seizing on reports by the news media that some of the Republican's personal money is kept in overseas bank and investment accounts. The reports added new details about the status of Mr. Romney's finances.
The existence of a Swiss bank account was first disclosed in January, when Mr. Romney released his 2010 tax returns. Advisers have said the account was closed that year.
But an article in Vanity Fair magazine published last week added new details about other holdings in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, which served as complex investment holdings for partnership income that Mr. Romney continued to receive for years after leaving Bain Capital, the private equity firm he founded two decades ago.
The article said Mr. Romney has financial interests of at least $30 million in 12 funds in the Cayman Islands.
Kevin Madden, a spokesman for Mr. Romney's campaign, said on Fox News Sunday that the Republican candidate ''hasn't paid a penny less in taxes by virtue of where these funds are domiciled.'' He added, ''His liability is exactly the same as if he held the fund investments directly in the U.S.''
But that answer has not stopped Democrats and Mr. Obama's campaign from attacking. The Democratic National Committee created a video on Sunday highlighting reports of bank accounts in offshore institutions.
Appearing on MSNBC's ''Morning Joe'' program on Monday, Robert Gibbs, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama's campaign, bluntly accused the Republican candidate of not giving voters the information they need to make a decision about his wealth.
''Release the tax returns,'' Mr. Gibbs said. ''Put all this to rest. If Mitt Romney is not hiding something in Bermuda and Switzerland and the Caymans, it will be in the tax returns.''
Dan Senor, an adviser to Mr. Romney, on the same ''Morning Joe'' episode, said that Mr. Gibbs was being ''stunningly dishonest'' in his attacks. ''The reason we know about these accounts, as Robert knows, is because they are in the tax returns that Mitt Romney released,'' Mr. Senor said.
The Obama campaign is walking a fine line -- trying to make Mr. Romney seem out of touch while not appearing to question the value of being a wealthy businessman. That kind of message could backfire, especially with moderate voters in battleground states.
''It's not about wealth,'' Mr. LaBolt wrote in an e-mail. ''There have been other wealthy candidates, nobody is out to demonize wealth.''
So far, Mr. Obama's campaign has focused more directly on Mr. Romney's role as a business executive, suggesting that his career was a boon to the wealthy and that he did not have the interests of workers at heart.
Now, Democrats are hoping to contrast Mr. Obama's refusal to extend tax cuts for the wealthy and Mr. Romney's desire to cut taxes for people like him.
Mr. Romney's advisers believe that the effort will misfire. They argue that voters want the candidates to talk about how they will turn around the economy.
Polling suggests they may be right. A Washington Post/ABC News poll in April found that 71 percent of those surveyed did not consider Mr. Romney's wealth to be a major reason to support or oppose him. Among those who said it was a major factor in the decision, his wealth was more likely to be a negative.
For the most part, Mr. Romney's advisers intend to ignore the attacks on his personal wealth. On Monday, they focused on Mr. Obama's renewed call to let the tax cuts for the wealthy expire.
''Americans are struggling in a 'zombie economy,' and President Obama's only answer is to pass one of the largest tax hikes in history,'' Ms. Henneberg said.

HEADLINE: For the White House's New Generation, It's a Different World

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
THE OBAMIANS
The Struggle Inside the White House to Redefine American Power
By James Mann
Illustrated. 392 pages. Viking. $26.95.
A multitude of new realities has presented President Obama with a daunting series of challenges and called into question America's postwar dominance of the world stage: the economic fallout from the 2008 financial tsunami, the aftermath of a disastrous war in Iraq and a continuing engagement in Afghanistan, a rapidly ascendant China, and a swiftly changing global and technological landscape.
In ''The Obamians,'' his useful, if at times patchy new book, James Mann -- a former reporter for The Los Angeles Times and an author in residence at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University -- argues that the president's view of America's role on the world stage is ''more modest and downbeat'' than those held by his predecessors George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. In addition he argues that Mr. Obama has not only ''focused on redirecting America's resources and energy toward domestic renewal,'' but is also looking ''ahead to a time when the United States, with all its economic problems, might no longer be able to maintain predominance.'' 
Mr. Mann even quotes Ben Rhodes, a national security adviser, serving up this humble goal of preserving America's leadership: ''We're not trying to preside over America's decline. What we're trying to do is to get America another 50 years as leader.''
In much the way that he tried to explicate the worldview of President Bush's war cabinet in his previous book, (''Rise of the Vulcans,'' 2004), Mr. Mann attempts, in these pages, to examine the ideas and formative experiences of President Obama's foreign policy advisers and Mr. Obama's own evolving vision of America's place in the world. ''The Obamians'' does not contain breaking news of the sort found in two revealing new books: ''Confront and Conceal'' by David E. Sanger, a correspondent for The New York Times, and ''Kill or Capture'' by the Newsweek reporter Daniel Klaidman. And it also gets off to a tedious start by rehashing familiar arguments about older Democrats' efforts to shrug off the party's peacenik image, dating back to the Vietnam War era.
When Mr. Mann moves on to analyzing Mr. Obama's policies and positions, however, the gears of his book begin to engage. Drawing upon some 125 interviews, including those with many officials in the Obama administration, Mr. Mann writes with shrewdness and insight about the evolution of the president's thinking, tensions among his staff (over issues like humanitarian intervention and the use of military force), and contrasts and continuities between his conduct of foreign policy and that of the previous two presidents.
As Mr. Mann sees it Mr. Obama began his presidency as a foreign policy realist in the tradition of George H. W. Bush and his national security adviser Brent Scowcroft. While Mr. Obama's ''speeches were elegantly phrased and full of idealism,'' Mr. Mann says, he ''did not want to sound like a moralist by talking too much about democracy. In Iran, he was not going to let the Green Movement in the streets stand in the way of his efforts at a rapprochement with the country's leaders. He hoped above all to persuade the Iranian regime to change its policies abroad, if not at home.''
As it became increasingly clear that Tehran was not going to moderate its policies, and as the Middle East was rocked by the democratic uprisings of the Arab spring, Mr. Mann suggests, a new idealism crept into Mr. Obama's realpolitik. His call for Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak, to step down could be defended in Mr. Mann's words ''as both idealism (pressing for democratic change) and realism (preventing upheaval and winning popular support in a country of extraordinary strategic importance to the United States).''
Intervention in Libya, Mr. Mann goes on, represented an even starker break from ''the foreign policy realism that had characterized his first 18 months in the White House'' and provided a window into the evolving Obamian approach to the world: ''It showed, once again, that Obama was no pacifist; he was willing to use military power. It demonstrated for the first time that he was willing to put the American military to work on behalf of humanitarian goals, in a way that the realists he admired would not. Above all, it showed the Obama administration's intense commitment to multilateralism.''
By Mr. Mann's account some top advisers like James L. Jones, the president's first national security adviser, and, at the beginning, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton ''discovered they held less influence within the administration than their job titles or their public roles would have indicated.'' He writes that Mr. Obama often talked with an inner circle of aides -- including Mr. Rhodes, Mark Lippert and Denis R. McDonough, who went back to his days in the Senate -- before and after meetings with advisers like Mrs. Clinton and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. ''He tended to make his final decisions with these aides,'' Mr. Mann contends, ''and the aides were sometimes dispatched to inform State or Defense officials what Obama wanted or decided.''
These Obamians, as Mr. Mann somewhat awkwardly calls them, tended to think of themselves self-consciously, ''as a new generation in American foreign policy.'' They were for the most part post-baby boomers who regarded Vietnam as settled history, Mr. Mann writes: ''It did not induce in them a sense of nervous hesitation about overseas involvements and the use of force as it had for the liberal Democrats of the 1970s -- nor, conversely, did it engender a perceived need to overcome the antiwar legacy of Vietnam, as it had for the Democrats of the 1990s.''
Whereas Democrats of the Clinton era remembered a series of cold war era elections in which members of their party were attacked for being ''insufficiently hawkish,'' Mr. Mann says, the younger Obamians tended to worry about ''2002 syndrome'' -- that is, the run-up to the Iraq war when leading Democrats like Senators Joe Biden, John Kerry, Mrs. Clinton and John Edwards voted in favor of President George W. Bush's request for authorization for the use of force in Iraq.
According to Mr. Mann, the Obamians promoted an image of themselves as a new generation dealing with a different world from that of their predecessors. But while they had a few broad-stroke ideas (like stepping up the war in Afghanistan and attempting a new dialogue with Iran), he says, they did not have a lot of detailed, concrete policy initiatives. ''Because the Obamians had so little experience in governing,'' he writes, ''they would have to rely on others for help and advice. They would need the veterans of the Clinton administration, as well as some old hands from government bureaucracies such as the C.I.A. and the Defense Department. Their inexperience and their reliance on others hampered the Obamians' ability to bring about change.''
For that matter, Mr. Mann contends that the 2008 campaign brought forth more changes in style, rhetoric and perception than actual changes in foreign policy. ''Indeed, virtually everyone in the Obama administration interviewed for this book,'' he asserts, ''acknowledged that, in many policy areas, there had been considerable change from Bush's first term in office to his second'' -- when the more pragmatic views of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Gates prevailed over the hard-line ones of Vice President Dick Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld -- ''and that in fact the changes from the late Bush years to Obama's tenure were not so dramatic.''
Mr. Mann writes, for instance, that the Obama administration ''decided to preserve -- or, in some instances, expand -- many parts of the counterterrorism program it had inherited from the Bush administration'': not only upping the use of drone strikes and targeted killings (including last year's takedown of Osama bin Laden by the Navy SEALs) but also, he says, keeping the C.I.A.'s program of rendition and accepting and perpetuating ''the practice of indefinite detention, without trial or sentencing, for those prisoners believed to be especially dangerous terrorists.''
Mr. Mann does not do a very detailed or persuasive job of explaining why and how these practices were continued, and at times in this volume he also resorts to some dubious generalizations (for example, ''Republicans have tended to prefer big short wars or none at all''). All in all, though, ''The Obamians'' provides the reader with a succinct and serious-minded overview of Mr. Obama's foreign policy so far -- foreign policy that Mr. Mann argues provides a far better picture of the president and his ideas than his domestic policies because Congress does not have the sort of oversight of foreign policy that it does on, say, taxes, budgets or health care.
''The one exception, in which Obama was clearly unable to achieve something because of congressional opposition, was his failure to close Guantanamo'' prison, Mr. Mann concludes. ''But elsewhere -- on Iraq and Afghanistan, policies toward Iran or China, drone attacks, killing Osama bin Laden, telling Hosni Mubarak to give up power in Egypt, intervening in Libya -- the successes and failures were Obama's alone.''

HEADLINE: Perry Declares Texas' Rejection of Health Care Law 'Intrusions'

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Gov. Rick Perry of Texas told federal officials on Monday that the state had no intention of expanding Medicaid or establishing a health insurance exchange, two major provisions of President Obama's health care overhaul.
After the United States Supreme Court upheld the federal health care law on June 28, Republican officials in Texas suggested that they would fight the expansion of Medicaid and the exchanges, online marketplaces in which people shop for health insurance. On Monday, Mr. Perry made the state's position official in a letter to Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, calling both provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ''brazen intrusions into the sovereignty of our state.''
''Neither a 'state' exchange nor the expansion of Medicaid under the Orwellian-named P.P.A.C.A. would result in better 'patient protection' or in more 'affordable care,' '' the letter said. ''What they would do is make Texas a mere appendage of the federal government when it comes to health care.'' 
Mr. Perry's opposition to the provisions, while not surprising, angered Democrats and community health advocates in Texas. According to the Texas Medical Association, 25 percent of the state's population lacks health insurance -- 6.2 million people, including 1.2 million children -- the highest rate of any state. In Houston, the state's biggest city, 30 percent of the population is uninsured, while the rate is 34 percent to 37 percent in Brownsville and other cities near the Mexican border, according to the medical association.
''Rick Perry could've brought billions in federal dollars to Texas, reduced the rate of the uninsured and improved the quality of life for Texans,'' Rebecca Acuna, a spokeswoman for the state Democratic Party, said in a statement. ''Rick Perry's Texas solution is to let Texans stay ill and uninsured.''
A handful of other Republican governors -- including Rick Scott of Florida, Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana -- have said they would not set up health exchanges, arguing that states would have little flexibility in operating them and that their residents and businesses would have higher insurance costs. Texas, Florida, South Carolina and Louisiana were 4 of the 26 states that challenged the constitutionality of the health care law in court after it was passed in 2010.
In his letter, Mr. Perry said expanding Medicaid, the government health-insurance program for low-income and sick people, would exacerbate the failure of the current system and ''threaten even Texas with financial ruin.'' He also said the health care law failed to allow states to create and run exchanges completely on their own by giving the federal government the final say on what insurance plans can be offered and what benefits those plans can provide.
The health care law requires states to establish health insurance exchanges by January 2014. Federal health officials will step in to administer the exchanges in states that fail to make progress in establishing them or refuse to set them up. Mr. Perry is the only governor who has sent a letter formally declining to build an exchange, federal officials said. States have until Nov. 16 to tell the secretary of health and human services what type of exchange they will have.
According to Ms. Sebelius's agency, when the law is fully in place in 2014, the exchanges will provide individuals and small businesses with ''one-stop shops'' for high-quality health insurance and for tax credits to make that coverage more affordable.
Representatives of Texas Well and Healthy, a coalition of supporters of the federal health care law, said Texas would receive more than $70 billion in six years in Medicaid financing if the program was expanded. They said the federal government would cover 100 percent of the costs of the expansion for the first three years, and 93 percent to 95 percent in the years that followed.
''Our economy would benefit from this infusion, and our stretched health care system needs the boost,'' said Eileen Garcia, chief executive of Texans Care for Children, a nonprofit children's advocacy group that is a member of the coalition.

HEADLINE: Obama Pushes Tax Cut Extension That Excludes Wealthiest

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama, drawing a contrast with what he called Republican trickle-down economics, called on Monday for temporarily extending the Bush-era tax cuts for people making less than $250,000 while letting the taxes of the wealthiest go up.
Leading Republicans promptly rejected that approach, saying that it would be a mistake to raise anyone's taxes when the economy was so weak.
Flanked by supporters handpicked to represent the taxpayers -- 98 percent of households and 97 percent of small businesses, Mr. Obama asserted -- who would benefit from his approach, Mr. Obama said only a strong middle class, not an ever wealthier top rung, would foster economic growth.
''These tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans are also the tax cuts that are least likely to promote growth,'' Mr. Obama said. 
''We don't need more top down economics,'' he said. ''We have tried that theory. We have seen what happened. We can't afford to go back to it.''
Andrea Saul, the spokeswoman for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, in a statement issued shortly before Mr. Obama spoke, said: ''Unlike President Obama, Governor Romney understands that the last thing we need to do in this economy is to raise taxes on anyone.''
House Republicans plan to vote this month to extend for a year all of the Bush tax cuts, for middle- and upper-income people alike. Mr. Obama countered with an immediate, one-year extension except for the wealthiest taxpayers in the highest brackets. Their taxes would go back up to the levels of the Clinton administration.
Conceding that the ultimate resolution of what has already been a long debate over extension of the Bush-era tax cuts ''will be decided by the outcome of the next election,'' Mr. Obama said there was no reason to delay a temporary, partial extension.
Mr. Obama's proposal, an approach that he has been pushing through two years of fiscal debate, is not likely to break the deadlock in Washington over how to deal with budget deficits, an impasse that has only hardened as Republicans sense a chance to make gains in Congress this fall.
But by calling for an extension for just a year, Mr. Obama hopes to make Republicans look obstructionist and unreasonable. Trying to bounce back from another weak jobs report on Friday, he also hopes to deepen the contrast with his challenger, Mitt Romney. On Friday, the president said Mr. Romney would ''give $5 trillion of new tax cuts on top of the Bush tax cuts, most of them going to the wealthiest Americans.''
From their stronghold in the House, Republicans plan to vote this week to repeal Mr. Obama's health care law, hoping to energize their base even though they know that the campaign to abolish the law, which the Supreme Court upheld, stands no chance in the Democratic-led Senate. Republicans also renewed their call for an overhaul of the tax code.
''You know, what we ought to be doing is extend the current tax rates for another year with a hard requirement to get through comprehensive tax reform one more time,'' the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said on Sunday on the CNN program ''State of the Union.''
The struggle to frame the tax debate comes as the campaign moves into a period, only four months before the election, when the perceptions of voters begin to harden. Polls show a persistently tight race, with Mr. Romney closing in on Mr. Obama in certain swing states but with neither candidate able to break out decisively. Control of Congress is also up for grabs, with Mr. McConnell saying on Sunday that he believed the Republicans had a 50-50 chance to regain control of the Senate.
To find a compromise with Republicans on which Bush tax cuts to extend, Ms. Pelosi, the House minority leader, and Mr. Schumer, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, favor making $1 million the cutoff. Above that level, Mr. Schumer has said, people are not likely to spend the savings from lower taxes and help the economy.
Administration officials said they did not believe that the difference between the White House and these Democratic leaders was a big obstacle. They said that whether to use $250,000 or $1 million as a cutoff was more a matter of strategy than a ''religious debate,'' in the words of one official, who added that many other Democrats favored $250,000.
The White House hopes to squeeze maximum political mileage out of the White House event, surrounding Mr. Obama with families and workers who would benefit from the extension. On Tuesday, he will take his message to Iowa, the battleground state that turned him into a serious presidential contender in 2008.
In Cedar Rapids, Mr. Obama plans to visit the home of Jason and Ali McLaughlin, a high school principal and an account manager at a document-scanning company, a campaign official said. The McLaughlin family, with a combined income of $82,000, would face an extra $2,000 burden next year if the tax cuts on the middle class expired as scheduled, the campaign said.
White House officials insisted that Monday's move was more than politics. They said it would ease anxiety over the ''fiscal cliff'' -- the combination of tax increases and automatic spending cuts that are scheduled to kick in at the end of this year. That one-two punch, economists say, could deal a heavy blow to an already tender economy unless the White House and Congress work out some kind of compromise.
Proposing a one-year extension, a senior official said, recognizes that Mr. Obama and the Republicans are not likely to resolve the larger debate over whether to extend the Bush tax cuts for everyone or, as Mr. Obama has long advocated, just for the middle class. That debate is likely to be decided at the ballot box, where a victory by Mr. Romney would almost certainly enshrine all the tax cuts.
''To the degree that there is concern about the economy, we're saying, 'Let's extend the middle class tax cuts for a year,' '' said Gene B. Sperling, director of the White House's National Economic Council. ''Economically, extending tax cuts to those workers will have the most effect on them and the strongest impact on the economy.''
A one-year extension for people making under $250,000 would cost the government $150 billion in revenue, the administration estimates, an amount that would be added to the deficit. In a point of comparison, economists estimate that letting the cuts expire for people above that threshold would generate $850 billion over 10 years.
While Mr. Obama returns to the tax issue this week, House Republican leaders will press forward Wednesday with a vote to fully repeal his health care law, testing their faith that they can make the law part of their attack on Democratic economic policies against evidence that swing voters want to move past the fight.
Just as Mr. Obama needs to worry about divisions on the tax bill, some Republicans are in disagreement over the wisdom of relitigating the health care law. Some Republicans, facing re-election in swing districts, are openly suggesting that some measures should remain. Representative David B. McKinley, a Republican freshman from West Virginia, said prohibitions on lifetime coverage caps and on discrimination against people with pre-existing medical conditions should ''absolutely'' stay in force, even if health care costs would have to rise.
''If it means increasing my premiums, so be it,'' he said. ''That's what insurance is about.''
Mr. Romney's supporters on the Sunday talk shows hammered away at the idea that Mr. Obama is at fault for the poor economy. Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, said Mr. Romney supported preserving all of the Bush-era cuts for another year because he believes ''that will stimulate the economy and provide certainty out there in the job market.''
For Mr. Obama, the biggest advantage of the tax proposal may be simply to move the political discussion off the job market. On his bus tour through Ohio and Pennsylvania last week, the president took pains to present himself as a guardian of the middle class, whose most cherished childhood memories included raiding the ice machine at a Howard Johnson while on a Greyhound tour of the United States.
On Friday, however, when the latest poor jobs number was reported, Mr. Obama was back to talking about the long road to recovery.

HEADLINE: Cracks Appear in Republican Unity on Health Law Repeal

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A House vote to fully repeal President Obama's health care law was supposed to be the coup de grace for ''Obamacare,'' a final sweeping away of a law that Republicans thought the Supreme Court would gut and leave for dead.
Instead, the House on Wednesday will take up the repeal measure after the Affordable Care Act's constitutionality was upheld, and amid growing misgivings that relitigating the issue now will make Republicans seem out of touch -- especially when party leaders are still without an alternative. 
''Anytime Republicans are debating taxes and the economy, we're winning,'' said a veteran Republican campaign consultant who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid publicly crossing his party's leadership. ''Anytime we're debating health care, they're winning.''
The tally on Wednesday may be largely unchanged from the first full-repeal vote in February 2011, but the run-up to the vote is shaping up as far different. Republicans will keep fanfare to a minimum, while Democrats try to mount the attacks.
No doctors in white lab coats will be paraded before the television cameras pleading for repeal. The rhetoric is likely to be less about socialized medicine and government takeovers of health care and more about the health care law's impact on the real issue driving the election -- jobs and the economy.
Moreover, divisions are emerging over the wisdom of pulling the law out, root and branch. Some Republicans, facing re-election in swing districts, are openly suggesting that some measures should remain.
Others worry that the Republican leadership has yet to detail what the party would replace the health care law with. Representative Nan Hayworth, an ophthalmologist and a freshman Republican from New York, said she and others have a clear framework: bolstered health savings accounts, the option to purchase insurance across state lines, medical malpractice limits and a government-subsidized insurance pool for sick people who cannot buy insurance on their own. But those alternatives have not been broadly aired.
''We need to start expressing our principles promptly,'' she said.
Such concerns are a sharp contrast to the first repeal vote, when a new, vigorous Republican majority was confident that they owed their triumph to voter anger over the health care law. Democrats were on the defensive, with all eyes on which survivors of the 2010 midterm tsunami would switch their votes for the law and embrace repeal. The House voted 245-to-189 to undo President Obama's signature domestic achievement, with three Democrats joining in.
Representative Pete Sessions of Texas, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said the health care law was passed ''with deception at its core'' -- a penalty for those who fail to purchase insurance has been unmasked by the Supreme Court as a tax on the middle class. He said he was still convinced that the issue would be ''probably the biggest driver'' ensuring Republican victory in November, outside of the tax increases that could come next year with the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts.
His deputy at the Republican Congressional Committee, Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, was more circumspect.
''We're going to be talking about jobs and economy, but there are lots of elements to that discussion, one of them being health care,'' Mr. Walden said.
Democrats, on the other hand, say they will be playing offense. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee started an advertising campaign Monday morning portraying Republicans as controlled by insurance companies and intent on taking away the popular consumer protections in the law. A series of news conferences are planned that will include real-life families whom Democrats say would be harmed by repeal.
But they will also frame the repeal vote as a political stunt, taking Congress's time away from job-creating legislation. A video to be released Monday will use Speaker John A. Boehner's oft-repeated phrase, ''Mr. President, where are the jobs?'' to mock the repeal exercise.
''There's a strong sense that we don't want to carry on this fight, over and over,'' said former Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia, a Democrat who is running for the Senate. ''Let's move on.''
For Republicans in solidly conservative districts -- a majority of Republicans in the House -- the repeal vote is a no-cost way to energize the base and prove to angry constituents that the fight has not ended.
Representative Patrick McHenry, a Republican from western North Carolina, spoke of ''fire and passion for repeal'' still seething in his district.
''Activist and average folks regularly bring up full repeal,'' he said. ''They're still keenly aware of it, demand it and understand this law is holding back economic growth.''
But Republican campaign consultants are more cautious. Those voters are already energized by the prospect of voting against Mr. Obama in November. How a rehashing of the health care debate will affect independent voters is less clear.
Democrats are driving the narrative that voters are ready to move on. Dan Maffei, a former House Democrat from upstate New York who is campaigning to get his seat back, is using the Supreme Court's decision to push the debate toward improving the health care law he helped pass, not whether it should stay or go. To him, another vote -- the 30th this Congress has held to repeal or partially repeal the law -- is more evidence of the rut Washington is in.
''They're stuck in this eternal recurrence, rerunning the debate on the bill over and over again instead of moving forward,'' Mr. Maffei said.

When Moktada al-Sadr, the populist Shiite leader, returned to Iraq early last year after three years of self-imposed exile in Iran, he did so as a triumphant kingmaker whose actions proved decisive in ending months of electoral stalemate. Now he is trying to navigate his way to national power through nontraditional alliances that risk alienating supporters. PAGE A4

HEADLINE: The Need to Agree to Agree

 BODY:
Taxes are supposed to be complicated and contentious. Yet, speaking from the White House on Monday, it took President Obama less than 15 minutes to make a strong and sensible case for letting the high-end Bush-era tax cuts expire at the end of 2012. Citing well-documented facts, he pointed out that tax cuts at the top have failed to promote economic growth and have blown a hole in the federal budget.
Under his plan, Americans who make more than $250,000 a year -- the top 2 percent of taxpayers -- would see their tax rates go back up next year to the levels from the Clinton years, while those making less than $250,000 -- the remaining 98 percent -- would have their tax cuts extended through 2013. 
In calling for cooperation from Congress, Mr. Obama said that the point is to ''agree to do what we agree on'': extend the middle-class tax cuts. As a matter of fairness and responsible policy making, he said, the majority of Americans, and the broader economy, should not be held hostage again to another debate over the merits of tax cuts for the wealthy.
Unfortunately, it is not a message Congressional Republicans want to hear, committed as they are to preserving tax cuts for the rich at all costs. It is not even what some Democratic leaders want to hear, including Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader and Senator Charles Schumer of New York, both of whom voiced support on Monday for Mr. Obama's approach but have advocated in the past for extending the tax cuts for households that earn up to $1 million a year, a level that would please wealthy campaign donors.
But it's a message that needs to be sent, loud and clear, over and over. There will never be consensus for solving the nation's budget problems without first ending the lavish tax breaks at the top. In the near term, letting the high-end tax cuts expire would raise much-needed revenue without harming the recovery because tax increases on high-income Americans do not cut into consumer spending nearly as much as middle-class taxes. The revenue that could be raised -- about $850 billion over 10 years -- would be a significant step toward reducing the deficit and financing programs to spur the economy.
Mr. Obama laid out the broad issues. Now he needs to drive these points home.
THE TAX INCREASES WOULD BE MANAGEABLE Reverting to Clinton-era tax rates for those making more than $250,000 annually would mean increases in the top rates to 36 percent and 39.6 percent from 33 percent and 35 percent currently. It would also mean raising the tax rate on investment income, which is highly concentrated among the wealthy, to 20 percent from 15 percent. No one is being bankrupted or punished. They are being asked to pay more after an extended period of super-low rates. The 15 percent rate on capital gains investment income, for example, is the lowest such rate since the Great Depression.
MILLION-DOLLAR EARNERS DON'T NEED A BREAK Extending the tax cuts to those earning $1 million a year would cost the government $366 billion in lost revenue over 10 years, compared with extending the tax cuts only to those making less than $250,000 a year. That amount would have to be made up by cutting federal spending in critical areas like Medicare, Medicaid, education and food safety.
SMALL BUSINESSES ARE SPARED Republicans argue that letting the high-end tax cuts expire will hit small businesses and impede hiring. That is nonsense, and based on an overly broad definition of ''small business,'' which counts any taxpayer who reports business income as a business owner, including lawyers and accountants working in partnerships, corporate executives who sit on other firms' boards and shareholders in ''S-corporations,'' business organizations that can employ thousands of workers. Using a more reasonable definition of small business -- for instance, having income and deductions of less than $10 million -- a recent Treasury analysis found that only 2.5 percent of small-business owners would face higher taxes from the expiration of the Bush tax cuts. Of those who would be affected, most are unlikely to reduce hiring or investment because of ample deductions for business expenses.
The strength of Mr. Obama's argument is unlikely to sway Republicans. But he's right on fairness and the facts, and will, we hope, prevail in this debate.

HEADLINE: Romney, Again, Outdoes Obama In Fund-Raising

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
In the battle for political cash, President Obama is finding himself in an unaccustomed place during the final months of the 2012 campaign: he is losing.
Mitt Romney and the Republican National Committee easily outraised the formidable Obama money machine for the second month in a row. A nonstop schedule of high-dollar events around the country brought in $106 million during June to Mr. Obama's $71 million, giving him and his party four times the cash on hand that it had just three months ago.
Mr. Obama's fund-raising deficit in part reflects how steeply the terrain has shifted since 2008, when many Republican donors embraced the candidate and his campaign raised millions of dollars from Wall Street and other traditionally right-leaning industries. Now those donors are swinging hard back to the Republican Party -- and to Mr. Romney, whose promise to curtail regulation and cut taxes has helped draw a torrent of five-figure checks. 
In a worrisome development for the Obama campaign, Mr. Romney, who until now has been heavily dependent on donors giving the maximum federal contribution, also showed success in June drawing small donors, a traditional strength of the Obama campaign. Reflecting the intensifying general election matchup with Mr. Obama and conservative anger over the recent Supreme Court decision upholding the president's signature health care law, Mr. Romney raised about a third of his total in checks of under $250, officials said on Monday. Mr. Romney and the R.N.C. now have about $160 million in cash.
''This month's fund-raising is a statement from voters that they want a change of direction in Washington,'' Spencer Zwick, Mr. Romney's finance chief, said in a statement.
Mr. Romney's surge puts him on track to raise the $800 million his campaign and the Republican National Committee hope to bring in by Election Day, leaving the real possibility that Mr. Obama could be outspent despite the advantages of incumbency. And with political reality reasserting itself on Mr. Obama, he is being forced to rely more heavily on traditional Democratic constituencies, like Hollywood, labor unions and gay donors, as well as his own millions of small donors.
''It's the perfect storm for Republicans,'' said R. Donahue Peebles, a New York businessman who has raised more than $100,000 for Mr. Obama. ''Republicans and independents who supported the president financially thought they would see a change in how Washington worked. What they see now, and it's not necessarily the president's fault, is a lot of partisanship in Washington and a struggling economy.''
Mr. Obama, who reported about $109 million in cash in the bank at the end of May, has been significantly outspending Mr. Romney on advertising in swing states. But Mr. Romney's fund-raising successes are being matched by Republican-leaning outside groups, who are barraging the airwaves with anti-Obama advertisements that the president's campaign has been forced to spend its own money to match. On Monday, the biggest of the ''super PACs,'' American Crossroads, announced a $40 million, nine-state fall ad campaign against Mr. Obama, coming on top of a $25 million spree by an affiliate that will run through Labor Day.
Mr. Obama easily outraised Mr. Romney through much of the last year, as Mr. Romney fought for the Republican nomination and Mr. Obama exploited his incumbency to raise large checks in conjunction with the Democratic National Committee. And newly minted nominees typically take in huge influxes of cash as major donors come off the sidelines at the end of a nominating fight, as John Kerry did during the early months of the 2004 general election campaign against George W. Bush. Come November, the final tally between the two candidates could be close to a draw.
Yet money flooding into Mr. Romney's campaign suggests that even Mr. Obama -- the most prodigious fund-raiser to date in political history -- can be beaten. And Democratic-aligned outside groups, including those investing heavily in races for the House and the Senate, are far behind their Republican counterparts in raising and spending money.
All told, Republican candidates, party committees and outside groups have spent $269 million on broadcast advertising, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group, compared with $133 million for the Democratic side. Those totals do not included tens of millions of dollars that Mr. Obama invested early in the cycle on data mining, technology and campaign infrastructure, efforts Mr. Romney is now seeking to match on the fly.
Mr. Obama is being outraised despite a more intense fund-raising schedule than any of his predecessors: He was scheduled to hold two events on Monday in Washington, bringing the total to 174 fund-raisers since formally beginning his re-election campaign last year, according to CBS News.
Mr. Obama sought to rally supporters on Monday with a blunt e-mail from Ann Marie Habershaw, the campaign's chief operating officer.
''We could lose if this continues,'' Ms. Habershaw warned.
Several top Obama donors said privately that Mr. Obama's attacks on Mr. Romney's private equity career, the president's handling of White House relations with business leaders and his criticisms of tax rates for the wealthy had made it harder for some of his allies to raise money on Mr. Obama's behalf from the financial sector and other industries.
''He will not have the same level of support from the business community as last time -- either in endorsements, money or support,'' said one Obama backer who declined to be identified because of his relationship with the campaign. ''That's clear.''
Mr. Peebles, the Obama fund-raiser, echoed objections among some other Democrats, many with ties to the financial industry, over what he said were unreasonable attacks on the wealthy by the Obama campaign.
''I just got back from Rhode Island on my boat,'' Mr. Peebles said, referring to criticism of Mr. Romney's much-photographed vacation boating last week on New Hampshire's Lake Winnipesaukee. ''I can hold 12 people on my boat. I don't feel that I'm out of touch with Americans or that I am a bad person. I find it offensive, and I'm a supporter.''

HEADLINE: Dissent in the Ranks as Parties' Tactics Erode Unity Both Left and Right

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama and Congressional Republicans pressed ahead on Monday with politically charged proposals on tax cuts and health care, in competing efforts to frame the election-year debate. But each risked opening fissures in their own ranks, as lawmakers played up alternatives to the aggressive approaches of their leaders.
At the White House, Mr. Obama announced his proposal of a one-year extension in the Bush-era tax cuts for people earning under $250,000, which threatened to put him at odds with some Democrats who have supported extending the cuts for everyone earning up to $1 million. While most party leaders fell into line with Mr. Obama's message, several rank-and-file members said they remained opposed to any tax increases.
The No. 2 House Democrat, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, indicated that he would be open to a $1 million income threshold, while Senator Ben Nelson, a Nebraska Democrat who is retiring at the end of this session of Congress, called that a bare minimum. ''My druthers are to extend all of the tax cuts to continue the economic recovery,'' he said. ''But if this leads to a compromise, Congress should at least extend the cuts for everyone under $1 million.'' 
At the same time, House Republicans forged ahead with their plans to vote on a repeal of Mr. Obama's health care law, even as some members expressed unease about voting to abolish politically popular elements of the law. Others expressed fears that the Republicans would be hurt politically for appearing to refight the health care battles of two years ago, after the Supreme Court had upheld the law and many voters had moved on.
The divisions underscored the stakes for the president and the Republicans as they battle for control of the political debate -- each choosing as their weapon a complex public policy issue with broad ripple effects. With four months left until Mr. Obama and Congress face the voters, these choices have become even more fraught, as lawmakers worry about alienating people who like expanded health coverage or tax cuts.
Mr. Obama, flanked by supporters chosen to represent the taxpayers who would benefit from his proposal, made the case that putting money in middle-class pockets would foster economic growth more than wealthy ones.
''These tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans are also the tax cuts that are least likely to promote growth,'' Mr. Obama said in a ceremony in the East Room. ''We don't need more top-down economics,'' he said. ''We have tried that theory. We have seen what happened. We can't afford to go back to it.''
He said that 98 percent of households and 97 percent of small businesses would receive a tax cut under his plan. But Republicans said the president's proposal would amount to a broad tax on small businesses because many business owners report their profits as personal income.
While the fault lines between Republicans and Mr. Obama were clear, the president's move provoked anxiety among some Democrats who either favor across-the-board tax relief or argue that putting the threshold for expiration at $1 million is more politically potent than $250,000. Mr. Obama may have added to that perception by campaigning for the Buffett Rule -- named for the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett -- which would impose a minimum tax rate of 30 percent on anyone who earns $1 million or more.
Senator Jim Webb, Democrat of Virginia, reiterated his position that no income taxes should be raised, while Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, one of Mr. Obama's toughest critics within his party, declared in a statement that ''the people of West Virginia are tired of temporary solutions to our long-term problems.''
Mr. Hoyer, speaking at the Center for American Progress, a research and advocacy group, reacted with ambivalence. He said he supported Mr. Obama's $250,000 cutoff, but he added, ''A million dollars will be, I think, a metaphor for Republicans who will not support increasing revenues on any persons in America, no matter how much they make.''
White House officials, led by the chief of staff, Jacob J. Lew, began meeting with Democratic leaders last month to prepare them for Mr. Obama's move, according to a senior Senate Democratic leadership aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
At those meetings, a leading advocate of the $1 million cutoff, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, warned that Republicans had stoked concerns among middle-income voters that their taxes could increase next year. The $1 million threshold created a ''bright line'' that would decouple middle-class families from the truly rich, Mr. Schumer said.
Mr. Obama had accepted a millionaire's surtax and had set $1 million in income as the trigger for the Buffett Rule. But the Buffett Rule is different from income taxes, administration officials argue, because the superrich earn most of their income from investments and face relatively little pain from income tax increases.
The president, his aides said, was determined to stick to his pledge to let the tax cuts expire for people earning above $250,000. Ultimately, Mr. Schumer promised Mr. Lew he would not introduce legislation that would contradict that. On Monday, Mr. Schumer issued a statement pledging his ''solidarity'' with the White House.
Officials at the White House said that they were confident of the support of the Democratic leadership.
''Republicans and Democrats alike agree on the need to extend the tax cuts for the 98 percent of Americans who make below $250k,'' Mr. Schumer said, ''so let's heed the president's call and focus on that right away.''
Republican lawmakers, particularly those up for re-election in more moderate districts, are facing a similarly difficult calculus as the House nears its vote to repeal the health care law, the 30th vote to repeal or partly repeal the law since last year but the first since the Supreme Court affirmed its constitutionality.
Representative Judy Biggert, an Illinois Republican in a tough fight in a district outside Chicago, said she would vote to repeal. But she said she wanted to maintain the law's mandated coverage of people with pre-existing medical conditions, its prohibition on rescinding insurance coverage when a customer gets sick and its coverage for young adults under 26.
''I disagree with the leaders there,'' she said, adding, ''We should schedule a vote on alternative reforms with the same urgency we pursue repeal.''
Representative Nan Hayworth, an ophthalmologist and freshman Republican from New York, echoed that concern. ''We need to start expressing our principles promptly,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Romney, at Harvard, Merged Two Worlds

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN and RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
President Obama has a Harvard law degree. Former President George W. Bush has a Harvard M.B.A. Will the next president have both?
One of the most exclusive clubs in academe is a Harvard University dual-degree program allowing graduate students to attend its law and business schools simultaneously, cramming five years of education into four. On average, about 12 people per year have completed the program -- the overachievers of the overachievers -- including a striking number of big names in finance, industry, law and government.
The program is so small that it has drawn little attention outside rarefied circles, but that may change as its most famous graduate, Mitt Romney, campaigns for the White House, subjecting every phase of his life to scrutiny.
When Harvard started its so-called J.D.-M.B.A. program in 1969, there were just a handful like it. Others have cropped up since, but Harvard's has what may be the most successful alumni roster, particularly in finance. 
In addition to Mr. Romney, founder of Bain Capital, the roughly 500 graduates include Bruce Wasserstein, who led the investment bank Lazard until he died in 2009; leaders of multibillion-dollar hedge fund and private equity firms like Canyon Capital Advisors, Silver Lake Partners and Crestview Partners; high-ranking executives at banks like Citigroup and Credit Suisse; C. James Koch, founder of the Boston Beer Company; and Theodore V. Wells Jr., one of the nation's top trial lawyers.
The young Mr. Romney wanted to go to business school, while his father, George W. Romney, a cabinet secretary and former Michigan governor, urged him to go to law school. So the younger Mr. Romney did both, studying at Harvard from 1971 to 1975.
''What was special about these people was that they had bandwidth,'' said Malcolm S. Salter, an emeritus business professor who helped create the program. ''They had to be driven, hard-working and organized to a degree that was unusual even for Harvard business or law grad students.''
Guhan Subramanian, who graduated from the program in 1998 and now is its faculty chairman, said the students could be viewed as ''resume builders who haven't figured out what to do with their lives and are just checking off all the boxes.'' But he said they are genuinely interested in mastering both fields.
Students must be admitted separately to the business and law schools before applying for the program. That is a feat in itself, because the two student bodies are quite different.
The law school takes younger students, often straight out of college, putting more emphasis on academic credentials, while the business school usually wants work and leadership experience. Business students are often described as being more gregarious and at ease with numbers, law students as more intellectual and facile with words.
And then there are politics.
''I was among the most conservative people at the law school and one of the most liberal people at the business school,'' said Peter Halasz, a partner at the law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel, who completed the program in the early 1980s. ''Studying at both exposes you to many different kinds of people and various sides of an argument.''
The political gap was wider in Mr. Romney's era, scarred by Vietnam and Watergate, when law students wore T-shirts and business students wore ties to class. ''The law school was very swept up in the politics of the time, but the business school pretty much ignored them,'' said Detlev Vagts, a law professor who ran the program for more than 30 years.
Charles E. Haldeman Jr., former head of Putnam Investments and Freddie Mac, was a year ahead of Mr. Romney in the program. ''Back then, people were trying to save the world,'' Mr. Haldeman said. ''Because I was interested in business, and doing well economically mattered to me, and I didn't think the country was controlled by evil people, the law school students did think of me as a little different.''
Both schools were overwhelmingly male in those days. And far more graduates have gone into business than law; many, like Mr. Wasserstein, switch to business.
Lawrence Golub, chief executive of the Golub Capital investment firm, said that the vast majority of graduates end up in business rather than law because of the earnings potential and the quality of life. ''One learns that the life of associate at a big corporate law firm is demanding, unpleasant and not as lucrative as what you can do on the business side,'' said Mr. Golub, who graduated from the program in 1984 and founded its alumni society.
For many graduates, Mr. Golub said, the toughest lesson after a lifetime of uninterrupted success is ''that failing won't kill you.''
In the 1970s, many graduates went into management consulting, as Mr. Romney did, but for most of the program's history, finance has dominated, which some people connected to the program find mildly disappointing. Professor Salter said he had hoped the program would produce more public servants.
But former students and professors say it makes sense that a group of overachievers would be drawn to financial markets, a hypercompetitive field with the promise of immense riches.
Adebayo O. Ogunlesi, a program graduate, said, ''I wanted to be a business or commercial lawyer and thought I could meet prospective clients at H.B.S.''
But Mr. Ogunlesi, whose law classmates included Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., practiced law only briefly. He became head of investment banking at Credit Suisse, then chairman of Global Infrastructure Partners.
''When you're negotiating as a banker, it helps to throw in a few choice legal terms to suggest that you could help them think through how the deal can get done from a legal point of view,'' he said.
Students start by taking the first year of one program, and then the first year of the other. In their third and fourth years, they take courses from both.
Those who start with the first year of law school -- often regarded as the hardest -- as Mr. Romney did are more likely to complete both degrees.
But in another sense, Mr. Romney is atypical. He is one of only two alumni to have a high-profile career in politics, along with Christopher Cox, a former congressman and Securities and Exchange Commission chairman. (In a historical quirk, Jack Ryan, Mr. Obama's Republican opponent in the 2004 Senate race in Illinois, has a Harvard J.D.-M.B.A. He dropped out of the race amid allegations that he had pressured his former wife to go to sex clubs.)
As long as politics remains a relatively low-paying, fickle career, graduates do not expect to see many students taking the political path. All the more reason that other dual-degree graduates, whether or not they support Mr. Romney, admit to being intrigued by the prospect that one of theirs might become president.
''Who knows,'' Mr. Golub said, ''maybe we'll be holding our next reunion at the White House.''

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on July 10 about Harvard University's dual graduate degree program in law and business misstated the status of women when the program began in 1969. The first group of students to enter the program included a woman, Patricia Gimbel Lewis, who completed both degrees in 1971; it was not ''several years'' before the program had its first female student.

HEADLINE: From Mongolia, Clinton Takes Jab at China

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

 BODY:
ULAN BATOR, Mongolia -- Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, in an unmistakable message to China delivered in a speech from this neighboring country, said Monday that economic success without meaningful political openness was an unsustainable equation that would ultimately lead to instability.
Mrs. Clinton arrived in this mineral-rich nation on the border of China on the second day of an Asia tour dedicated to broadening the Obama administration's renewed focus on the region beyond an early emphasis on building up American military strength. The effort was seen as aimed at easing away from a confrontation with China. 
But Mrs. Clinton's comments, made at an international forum on democracy, came at a sensitive time for China, where a leadership transition at the top of the Communist Party is proving messy, and as criticism of the government spreads from environmental concerns to social issues, including forced abortion.
Mrs. Clinton did not mention China by name, but it was clearly the target of her remarks.
''You can't have economic liberalization without political liberalization eventually,'' she said. ''It's true that clamping down on political expression or maintaining a tight grip on what people read, say or see can create an illusion of security. But illusions fade -- because people's yearning for liberty don't.''
In a dig at China as it wrestles with an economic downturn after a decade of double-digit growth, Mrs. Clinton added, ''Countries that want to be open for business but closed to free expression will find that this approach comes at cost: it kills innovation and discourages entrepreneurship, which are vital for sustainable growth.''
The notion that democratic values were for Western societies only, an idea spawned in the 1990s by Lee Kuan Yew, the founder of modern Singapore, was antiquated, she said. ''In the last five years, Asia has been the only region in the world to achieve steady gains in political rights and civil rights, according to the N.G.O. Freedom House,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
But in contrast to governments that had made democratic gains, she said, there were those ''that work around the clock to restrict their people's access to ideas and information, imprison them for expressing their views, usurp the rights of citizens to choose their leaders and govern without accountability, closed off from public view.''
Mrs. Clinton is well known to the Chinese as a critic of their model of government, a fact that she recalled on Monday by referring to her visit to Beijing 17 years ago as first lady.
On that occasion, in 1995, she addressed a United Nations conference on women and created a firestorm when she declared that ''human rights are women's rights -- and women's rights are human rights.'' Immediately after that conference, she visited Mongolia for the first time and was struck, she said, by the emergence of a democracy, a contrast that appears to have left an indelible impression.
In the eyes of the Chinese government, Mrs. Clinton was further identified as a promoter of human rights when, during a visit to Beijing in May, she negotiated the departure of the dissident Chen Guangchen to the United States.
Formerly aligned with the Soviet Union, Mongolia has been held up by the administration as a model of how democracy can be born from authoritarianism. Its democratic credentials were tarnished in April when the government arrested former President Nambaryn Enkhbayar on corruption allegations; he was held for a month until formally charged and released on bail in May, according to the State Department.
On Monday, Mrs. Clinton did not refer to the arrest, choosing to praise parliamentary elections last month in which nine women were elected to the 76-member Parliament, three times the number in the previous legislature.
She met President Tsakhia Elbegdorj in a ceremonial yurt, the traditional abode of nomadic herders, that featured a carved wooden ceiling, elaborate chairs and a glistening chandelier.
With Mr. Elbegdorj seated on the stage at Government House, a Soviet-style building from the 1950s, Mrs. Clinton extolled Mongolia as an excellent example of how freedom and democracy were not exclusively Western concepts. To those who doubted, she said, ''Let them come to Mongolia.''
The Obama administration has taken a special interest in Mongolia, largely because of its position next to China. Mr. Elbegdorj visited the White House last year, and Vice President Joe Biden went to Mongolia last year, as well.
Washington is backing an American company, Peabody Energy, based in St. Louis, to win a contract to mine a massive coal deposit at Tavan Tolgoi. The other main contender, Shenhua Energy, is a state-owned Chinese enterprise.
Online Correction: July 9, 2012, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this story misspelled the surname of Mongolia's president. He is Tsakiha Elbegdorj, not Elbegdor.

HEADLINE: For an Exiled Cuban Photographer, Freedom Was in Color

BYLINE: DAVID GONZALEZ


HIGHLIGHT: Omar Rodr&#237;guez Saludes called himself "a blind photographer," since he never saw prints of his work. His photos, which showed another side of Cuba, led to a prison sentence and his exile. 

 BODY:
Freedom was in color. That was the indelible memory that Omar Rodríguez Saludes remembered the day he boarded an Iberia flight to Spain from Havana in 2010. Until then, his world was sketched in drab shades of gray, green and white. Those were the colors of his imprisonment: gray for his rags, white for the walls and green for the guards.
"To see any other color was rare," Mr. Rodríguez Saludes said. "But in that plane, I saw colors. Everyone was dressed regularly. I saw colors I had not seen in a long time."
Seven years, to be exact. Journalism was the reason for his imprisonment. Specifically, everyday shots of Havana life, far from the gleaming tourist hotels and beaches. His world showed a crumbling city with haggard faces, presided over, Oz-like, by billboards with revolutionary slogans.
He had been among some 20 independent journalists who were rounded up by the Cuban government during a sweep of 75 dissidents in March 2003, and given lengthy sentences after quick trials. They were said to be traitors and mercenaries in the service of the United States government, even though international human rights and journalists groups defended them as prisoners of conscience.
Mr. Rodríguez Saludes was a self-taught photographer who was considered among the best of the island's up-and-coming independent journalists. It was not an easy life, whether dealing with daily harassment and short-term jail stays, or regularly having his camera and recorder confiscated. In a profile I wrote on him in 2002, he called himself "a blind photographer," since he saw only his negatives, never the prints that were published in a Miami-based Cuban news service, Nueva Prensa Cubana.
Soon after the article ran, a friend of his in Miami called to thank me. The article, he said, would give his friend a higher profile and, perhaps, a measure of protection.
That's relative. Mr. Rodríguez Saludes was sentenced to 27 years, the longest of any independent journalist. He got off easy: prosecutors had asked for a life term. Mr. Rodríguez Saludes served seven years before being sent into exile to Spain with his family, where he now lives (though has been unable to find work).
"You have to have courage to do this work," said Carlos Lauria of the Committee to Protect Journalists. "Omar's case was one of the longest sentences they gave to anyone. It is a faithful reflection of an arbitrary system that has a totally obsolete legal framework. It is totally repressive and looking to stifle any kind of expression."
Mr. Rodríguez Saludes did not start out to be a journalist or dissident. He had been working at a shipyard, where he saw the differences between how the company - the Cuban government - treated those who worked inside the office and those who worked fixing boats. He called it slavery. The government thought otherwise. In 1992, he lost his job.
He had become used to walking around Havana taking pictures, a hobby he had picked up from his mother, who took family photos with an old box camera. In his early 20s, he had been using a Soviet-made camera to chronicle his walks about town. His archive grew; his work prospects did not.
In 1995, Raúl Rivero, the dean of Cuba's independent journalists, invited him to become part of the island's growing movement. He quickly took to it.
"I was already in the streets with my camera in hand," he said. "It was my custom, almost a vice. Even on family walks I had my camera. It was daily work that gave me a social and photographic vision. I saw things others did not. I focused on the details."
The more he shot, the more he looked to contrast the reality on the sidewalk with the billboards and official pronouncements. Getting around on a bike, he scooted about Havana looking for those contrasts.
"I had to be fast," he said. "This was before digital. Back then, the frame had to be right. I had one or two shots to get it. I tried to show the reality as it is. I wanted to speak loudly about the reality facing Cubans, and to show it was not he paradise the government presents. They try to say it is clean and stable. But reality is far from that."
Though he had often been detained - losing his cameras to an agent of state security who hung one in his office like a trophy - things took a serious turn for the worse in March 2003, the time that came to be known as Cuba's Black Spring. He said that agents showed up at his home and searched it, taking books, cameras and even medicine sent by his mother from Miami.
One particular prize was the 2002 New York Times article.
"When they found it in a drawer, one of the agents said, 'Look at this!' when I turned around, I saw it was the New York Times article," he said. "They used it as evidence against me in their prosecution, as if it had been a nuclear weapon."
While in custody, he was repeatedly questioned.
"They started to talk to me about the news, who spoke to me, how did I get the news, what did I do with it," he said. "From the beginning, the only words I said was 'No, I will not respond.' They knew the answers already. That was public. The problem was I did not want to cooperate. You can't cooperate with them."
His trial lasted hours. His sentence, years. He spent his first nine months in an isolation cell, he said, and was later sent to different prisons, often making it hard for his wife and children to visit. During those years, he managed to keep a diary.
He was freed in July 2010, thanks to the intercession of the Cardinal Archbishop of Havana and the Spanish government. The offer was hardly ideal: he would have to go into exile in Spain, whose government was willing to offer resettlement assistance (which has recently run out for those exiles still there).
The conditions placed on many of the freed journalists - namely, exile - have been denounced by press freedom and human rights groups. Mr. Lauria said it was important to note that many of the former independent journalists had not been writing direct criticisms of the government or its leaders.
"It's important to note that may of those who were jailed had once embraced Socialist ideas," Mr. Lauria said. "But the moment they expressed themselves, they were seen not just as the opposition, but acting against the interests of the state. For something that in any normal country is not considered an aberration, but part of the game of democracy."
Many of the former journalists have left Spain after finding it hard to find work. Mr. Rodríguez Saludes himself is unemployed despite having taken courses in three different trades. He recently decided to move to the United States, where he hopes to finish writing his prison diary.
He says he regrets nothing.
No longer a blind photographer, the only pictures he takes are with his cellphone - though they are in color, just like inside the plane that took him from Havana.
"When I walked up the steps with my family, I did not look back," he said. "I knew they were looking at me. I knew there was hate.
"But when I got to the top of the stairs, something happened. The flight crew was there and the captain extended his hand to me. 'Welcome to Spain, liberty and democracy.' Then, he hugged me and my family."

HEADLINE: In Lost Opportunity of 1932, Are There Lessons for Today?

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: The view that fiscal austerity, not monetary policy, was the answer to the Great Depression only delayed meaningful action, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
By the summer of 1932, the Great Depression was three years old with no end in sight. The Hoover administration, like Republicans today, was adamant that economic stimulus was wrongheaded, that the big problem was business confidence, which would be restored by keeping the budget under control, and that under no circumstances should the Federal Reserve adopt policies that would ignite inflation.
However, it was painfully clear to farmers and business people that deflation - falling prices - was the root of the economy's problem. Between 1929 and 1932, the consumer price index fell 20 percent and prices for many commodities had fallen much more.
As a consequence, producers could not make a profit, which led them to lay off workers. As workers lost income, they reduced their purchases, which intensified the downward pressure on prices.
By early 1932, a growing number of prominent economists were openly advocating "reflation" - just enough inflation to get the price level back to where it was in 1929.

In January, the Columbia economist Frederick C. Mills said, "Recovery hinges to a considerable degree on an upward movement in some of the most seriously depressed commodity prices." The recovery from every previous economic recession had been accompanied by rising prices, he argued.
Mills urged the federal government to issue bonds to finance a large public works program, which would be supported by Federal Reserve open-market operations.
Also in January 1932, a group of 35 prominent economists, including a number of conservative "hard money" men, such as Edwin Kemmerer of Princeton and Walter Spahr of New York University, said that deflation had "gone far enough." They advocated a "liberal" Fed policy "designed to check credit decreases and encourage some expansion."
On Feb. 8, Winston Churchill, who had lately been Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, spoke at the Hotel Astor in Manhattan. He attacked deflation and forcefully advocated restoration of the price level to its 1927-8 level, saying that joint action between the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England could probably accomplish this even without the assistance of other countries.
In a May 1932 article in The Atlantic Monthly, John Maynard Keynes agreed that deflation was the core economic problem and that cheap money was the necessary cure. But he warned that the economy's downward momentum may have gone too far for conventional monetary policies to work:
I am not confident that on this occasion the cheap-money phase will be sufficient by itself to bring about an adequate recovery of new investment. It may still be the case that the lender, with his confidence shattered by his experiences, will continue to ask for new enterprise rates of interest which the borrower cannot expect to earn. Indeed, this was already the case in the moderately-cheap-money phase which preceded the financial crisis of last autumn.
Keynes warned that there might be "no means of escape from prolonged and perhaps interminable depression except by direct state intervention to promote and subsidize new investment."
And in July, the Yale economist Irving Fisher said the deflation since 1929 had increased the real value of the dollar by 50 percent. The result was to also increase the real burden of indebtedness to the same degree. "Every debtor has to pay over $1.50 for every dollar he contracted to pay," he explained. "The farm mortgages are today bigger, measured in terms of wheat and cotton, than ever before."
The failure of the Federal Reserve and Hoover administration to address the problem of deflation led some maverick members of Congress to take matters into their own hands. In April, Representative Thomas Goldsborough, Democrat of Maryland, persuaded a House banking subcommittee to report a bill that would require the Fed to raise the price level to its 1926 level through monetary policy.
A few days later, the Goldsborough bill received the support of the full committee. The New York Times frowned on his effort. In an April 22 editorial, The Times said that the proposal was doomed to fail because it was impossible to "restore prosperity by fiat." Nevertheless, on May 2, the House of Representatives approved the legislation, 289 to 60.
Again, The Times was critical. In a May 4 editorial, it argued that the Fed had already purchased an enormous quantity of Treasury securities and lowered the discount rate to a historically low level. The editorial questioned whether simply doing more of what was already not working would be of value.
On May 5, President Hoover attacked the Goldsborough bill directly. He argued that the nation's true problem was not monetary, but fiscal. Balancing the budget by drastically cutting spending and raising revenue was what the economy needed. "Nothing will put more heart into the country," Hoover said.
In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on May 13, Fisher strenuously disagreed. He noted that the economy was showing some signs of life because of an expansion of the money supply that the Fed had adopted in the spring. But businesses had no assurance that it would continue, which was their prime source of uncertainty. The Goldsborough bill would guarantee a continuation of easy money until recovery had been achieved, Fisher argued.
He was prescient. In July, the Fed halted its policy of quantitative easing and the recovery was quickly aborted. In a March 2006 article in the Journal of Economic History, the economists Chang-Tai Hsieh and Christina Romer suggest that pressure from the regional Federal Reserve bank presidents was instrumental in ending the easing. With ample reserves in the banking system and very low interest rates there was nothing to be gained by further easing, they asserted.
On July 11, the Senate effectively killed the Goldsborough bill by substituting a Fed-approved measure that did not require it to do anything to stanch deflation. Meaningful action to end the Great Depression would have to wait until after the election and the inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933.

HEADLINE: Bankers Wanted: Must Be Less American

BYLINE: MARK ASHURST


HIGHLIGHT: Parliament sifts through the Libor-fixing scandal, as The City starts to think that perhaps it needs a new business model and Brussels appoints a permanent fixer. 

 BODY:
When Eurozone finance ministers met in Brussels into the wee hours Tuesday morning to wrangle over their bailout of Spanish banks, the easy part was appointing a new boss for the European Financial Mechanism - the permanent bailout fund due to come into effect this month.
The job had to go to a German, the better to convince German voters that their economy should bankroll the Eurozone. And since this is no time for surprises, the job went to Klaus Regling, a German civil servant and a former IMF official who for the past two years has been in charge of the European Financial Stability Facility, the interim bailout fund.
In unknown territory, experience may seem a weak qualification. Central bankers in the United States, China and across the globe are urging boldness in the Eurozone. But boldness is convincing only when backed by authority, a commodity in much shorter supply than new money. Mr. Regling's task is to bring authority to a new financial institution which - two and a half years into Europe's banking crisis - is long overdue. And still does not exist.
Officials at the European Council had planned to launch the new European Financial Mechanism this week. Instead, legal preparations and a constitutional challenge in Germany have slowed ratification by the member states. 
The small print matters because the new bailout fund will, eventually, command firepower of about (EURO)500 billion, or more than $600 billion. That's double the reserves of its predecessor, the European Financial Stability Facility, and about three times more than the value of Spanish banks' distressed property assets.
Even so, if and when the new European Financial Mechanism needs to intervene in Italy or Portugal, half a trillion Euros would be a slender reserve. EFM bonds are underwritten by the collective creditworthiness of Europe's governments. But, as Chancellor Angela Merkel has insisted, even Germany's balance sheet is unequal to the potential combination of southern Europe's sovereign debt and bank crises.
As many financial wits have observed, the structure of the EFM looks uncannily familiar. Its mechanism for bundling pan-European debt into collateralized bonds - a "wrapper", in financial jargon - resembles the collateralized debt obligations (C.D.O.s) conjured by American lenders to secure triple-A ratings for junk mortgages or home bonds. That mechanism relied on a hierarchy of multi-tiered debt, an obscure and elaborate trick.
The resemblance is unflattering, and Mr. Regling has objected to comparisons with the EFSF: "The essential difference between the EFSF and a CDO is that EFSF debt has no tranche structure," he wrote to the Financial Times in March 2011, "There is no seniority and all investors have exactly the same rights." In reply, the FT's Joseph Cotterill veiled skepticism in faint praise: although not "technically" a CDO, he conceded, EFSF was "so much more: it is a model of sovereign debt financial engineering." 
To be sure, these are inventive measures for desperate times, with more to come. A new European Bank Supervisor is to be created with powers to grant direct aid to troubled banks, in effect bypassing governments to move bailout funds "off-balance sheet." Loans may be converted to grants, without the need for sovereign guarantees. It will be risky, difficult and painful work - certain to provoke taxpayers and infuriate politicians.
All of which may provide some solace to another high-flying bank official in London, who yesterday watched as his dream of promotion slipped away. Paul Tucker, deputy-governor of the Bank of England, told British MPs that in 2008 he failed to suspect illegal manipulation of Libor, a benchmark interest rate, despite almost daily contact with Barclays. Barclays was fined £290m for fixing Libor, prompting the resignations of chairman Marcus Agius and chief executive Bob Diamond. A criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office is underway.
Mr. Tucker told the Treasury Committee in Westminster that the mechanism by which banks share information to calculate the benchmark London inter-bank lending rate had appeared "dysfunctional not dishonest." The deputy-governor denied a suggestion to the same committee from Mr. Diamond, who gave evidence last week, that at the height of the financial crisis the Bank of England was encouraged by "senior" figures in the Labour government to apply pressure to Barclays to lower its rates.
The controversy likely scuttles Mr. Tucker's ambition to become the governor of the Bank of England when that post becomes free next year. 
So, a new search begins to fill two top jobs in global finance. The central bank wants closer scrutiny of the complex, market-making deals inside commercial lenders. And Barclays is said to be seeking a "less American" style leader than Mr. Diamond, a career investment banker. 
Neither person will want to hear much from Mr. Regling, who may be preoccupied further south. But something of his unflinching Teutonic style will be essential in London.

HIGHLIGHT: Hippies and budget deficits. 

 BODY:
Robert Samuelson has a very peculiar column in which he alleges that we can't have Keynesian policies because irresponsible Keynesians ended budget responsibility back in the 1960s. Really.
Look, I know that conservatives are still fuming over sex, drugs, rock and roll, and all that; hatred of hippies remains a powerful force in America around 35 years after the last hippie sighting. But look; here's the history of the ratio of US federal debt to GDP:
OK, something did happen to fiscal responsibility; but it happened circa 1981, not circa 1961. Who was the president then? I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
I'd add that the recent rise in debt/GDP is very different from what happened in the 80s; this time around we really had a crisis that required fiscal support for the economy. What happened in the 80s had no such justification.

HEADLINE: Assessing the Chances for Criminal Charges in the Libor Scandal

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: Prosecutors will probably have to dig deeper than what banks provided in their internal inquiries in order to determine whether top executives had any involvement in manipulating Libor. 

 BODY:
The Barclays settlement over the manipulation of benchmark interest rates may prove to be, in the words of Winston Churchill, "the end of the beginning," as more banks are caught up in government investigations.
An important issue will be whether any criminal charges will result against senior officers involved in the scandal. That may hinge on whether prosecutors are able - and willing - to look beyond the reports from internal investigations conducted by the banks.
American prosecutors and regulators rely heavily on companies to conduct an internal investigation to determine whether there is sufficient evidence of wrongdoing to pursue charges. These are usually undertaken by outside lawyers who dig through corporate records and interview employees to put together a report about what happened.
 In supplementary information provided to the British Parliament last week, Barclays said it had spent nearly £100 million ($150 million) on its internal investigation into manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor.
That cost looks to be about par for an internal investigation these days. News Corporation says it has spent more than $100 million related to telephone hacking at its British newspapers, and Avon's internal investigation into possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has surpassed $200 million, according to its filings.
Companies, however, do have a powerful incentive to disclose the results of investigations, which are usually confidential: the government gives significant weight to the degree of cooperation shown by a company in deciding whether to file charges or reach some other resolution.
For Barclays, the Justice Department noted that it was "the first institution to provide extensive and meaningful cooperation to the government." The case was resolved through a nonprosecution agreement, meaning that no criminal charges were filed against the bank here in the United States. 
In its internal investigation report, Barclays made sure to pin the blame on the traders who manipulated Libor to benefit trading positions at the bank. In testimony before a parliamentary committee last week, Robert E. Diamond Jr., the former Barclays chief executive, said their actions made him "physically sick."
Regarding the actions of corporate executives in their Libor dealings during the height of the financial crisis, however, the tone was quite different. Some of the blame was directed at the Bank of England, and any manipulation during that period was the result of a "miscommunication" along with other banks that may have improperly reported interest rates.
In any internal investigation, there is pressure to identify culprits within the company's ranks. The government expects swift action to be taken against them, which often means job terminations.
But when the misconduct reaches into the executive suite, the question is whether the company will try to soft-pedal any misconduct. Blowing the whistle on wrongdoing by top executives is never an easy thing for lower-ranking officials to do, especially if those executives will decide the next assignment or annual bonus.
There is a good chance that top executives at other banks could be involved in the manipulation of Libor. Mr. Diamond testified that other banks have also been implicated in fixing reports for Libor.
Setting interest rates is not something that would normally come to the attention of executives because it is a mundane exercise handled by lower-level bank employees. But during the worst days of the financial crisis, Libor become a "canary in a coal mine," signaling which banks were facing liquidity issues. It got the attention of executives, like Mr. Diamond, who viewed it as a means to allay concerns about the viability of major banks; reporting low Libor rates signaled confidence in a bank's ability to repay loans.
Indeed, that is one reason Barclays lowered the interest rates it was reporting in October 2008 because of perceptions that the bank was out of line. That fed suspicions that other banks were not being honest in reporting their own rates for inclusion in Libor calculations. In the parlance of one Barclays official, "We're clean, but we're dirty-clean, rather than clean-clean."
The Justice Department will face the question of whether internal investigations have identified all the wrongdoing inside the banks, and it must assess which individuals participated in misconduct. That may require prosecutors to go beyond what the banks disclose and conduct separate inquiries into whether top executives had any involvement in manipulating Libor.
It would not be sufficient for senior officials to argue that they reported misinformation about interest rates out of a desire to save a bank during the depths of the financial crisis. Good motives that do not involve overt self-enrichment should not excuse executives if there is evidence of fraudulent conduct.
The pressure on the Justice Department to pursue charges against senior executives at large financial institutions is enormous. President Obama introduced the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force in November 2009 to investigate cases from the financial crisis, but there have been no signature prosecutions against individuals working at Wall Street banks.
The Libor investigation is an opportunity to look at the conduct of bank executives who may have tinkered with a crucial facet of the financial system.

HEADLINE: In New Rules to Shine Light on Derivatives, Regulators Also Allow Exemptions

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The new rules, stemming from the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, will give regulators more control over the $700 trillion derivatives industry, an opaque business at the center of the financial crisis. 

 BODY:
8:34 p.m. | Updated 
Regulators on Tuesday took a major step toward reining in risky Wall Street trading, approving new rules aimed at preventing a repeat of the financial crisis.
The rules, stemming from the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law, will give regulators more control over the $700 trillion derivatives industry, an opaque business that was blamed for many of the ills of the 2008 crisis. While regulators have spent more than two years retooling the sector, the latest reforms laid crucial building blocks for the remaining aspects of the Wall Street overhaul.
"Light will begin to shine on the markets for the first time," Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which approved the rules, said at a public meeting. "This is a very significant day for the American public." But another member of the agency questioned whether last-minute changes undermined the new rules, allowing risk to seep back into the system. Bart Chilton, a Democratic commissioner who cast the lone vote against the plan, raised concerns that the fine print created loopholes wide enough for Wall Street to exploit.
 "There are lots of lawyers out there itching to find ways for their clients to get around Dodd-Frank," said Mr. Chilton, an outspoken advocate of regulation who had never before voted against a final Dodd-Frank rule.
The agency also approved, after months of frenetic corporate lobbying, a set of policies spelling out a crucial exemption from regulation. Under the plan, many nonfinancial companies and small banks are excused from certain provisions of Dodd-Frank. The carve-out, regulators say, excludes from some oversight about 30,000 manufacturers, gas companies and airlines, including companies like Ford.
Congress enacted Dodd-Frank nearly two years ago, for the first time mandating an overhaul of trading in swaps - the derivative contracts tied to the value of commodities, interest rates and mortgage securities. One form of derivatives, credit-default swaps, nearly toppled the giant insurer American International Group and deepened the financial crisis.
Under Dodd-Frank, big banks and other financial institutions must submit certain derivatives contracts to regulated clearinghouses, which serve as a backstop in case one party in the trade defaults.
But Wall Street was in a holding pattern until regulators took action on Tuesday. The new plan, which defined important derivatives terms - including "swap" - will now set in motion a cascade of other Dodd-Frank measures. The definitions underpin the law, ushering in rules that subject big banks like JPMorgan Chase to reporting requirements and capital standards. Some requirements will take effect about two months from now.
"There's no question this is an incredibly foundational rule for the industry," said Gabriel D. Rosenberg, a lawyer at Davis Polk, which represents some of the biggest names on Wall Street. "The clock has started ticking and it's a clock with a very short fuse."
The agency said its definitions would cover most known swaps contracts while excluding insurance products, so-called forward deals and consumer transactions, like contracts to buy home heating oil. The Securities and Exchange Commission unanimously approved a similar version of the plan last week.
"By finalizing these rules, we are completing the foundation of a new regulatory regime intended to reduce systemic risk and bring greater transparency to this multitrillion-dollar market," Mary L. Schapiro, the S.E.C.'s chairwoman, said in a statement.
But Mr. Chilton questioned whether the exclusions were overly broad, going beyond what the S.E.C. agreed to last week. Indeed, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission delayed its Tuesday meeting nearly an hour to negotiate a last-minute compromise over some minor details.
"One man's loophole is another man's livelihood," Mr. Chilton said.
Americans for Financial Reform, a group that supports Dodd-Frank, praised the agency's actions on Tuesday while noting that "the rules do contain significant exemptions that are a threat to effective reform."
Separately on Tuesday, the futures trading commission unanimously approved a broad exemption from the requirement that derivatives trades go through regulated clearinghouses.
It applies to "commercial end users" - like oil companies, airlines and other firms that use swaps to counteract risk associated with a potential swing in value of goods that they buy or manufacture. An airline, for instance, uses swaps to hedge against the fluctuating cost of jet fuel. Commercial companies also buy swaps to protect against jumps in interest rates.
Under the agency's final rule, swaps do not need to go through clearinghouses if at least one party in the trade is a "nonfinancial" entity and is using the swap to hedge against its "commercial risk." The exempt firms must still alert regulators when they enter into swap transactions.
Regulators also extended the exemption to small banks and other financial firms outside the glare of Wall Street. The final rule allowed the firms with total assets of $10 billion or less to qualify for the end-user exception.
The approvals whittled down the futures trading agency's lengthy list of Dodd-Frank responsibilities. The C.F.T.C, Mr. Gensler said, has approved some 35 final rules and has about 15 remaining.
"Just by the math you can see we're quite a way into this," Mr. Gensler said. "But I think it is critical we finish the job, protect the market and promote more transparent and healthier markets," he added.

HEADLINE: Richer Rich, and Poorer Poor

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A new report shows that compared to a generation ago, wealth has been getting more concentrated in the hands of the richest Americans. 

 BODY:
A while back I wrote about how there was greater inequality in wealth than there was in income. Now a new report from the Pew Economic Mobility Project shows that across the distribution, every income class is earning more than it used to, even if the raises are uneven. But when it comes to the distribution, the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.
The report is based on data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, or P.S.I.D., a longitudinal data set that has followed families from 1968 to the present. First Pew looked at the earnings of today's adults compared to those of their parents' generation, and found that the typical American in each income quintile earned more than his counterpart from a generation earlier.
The median person in the panel today earns a family income of $51,177, whereas the comparable figure from a generation ago was $27,036 after adjusting for inflation. You can see similar bumps upward for the typical family in other quintiles, and that the very highest earners got the biggest raises.
The median family in the top quintile earned $49,075 a generation ago, and $111,115 today, an increase of 126 percent in inflation-adjusted terms. That's a much bigger raise, no doubt, but at least every income strata saw its earnings rise.
The trend for the distribution of wealth looks somewhat different.
Unlike with income, there were not across-the-board gains for wealth. The median person in the poorest quintile has a family net worth that is 63 percent than that of his counterpart a generation ago: $2,748, versus $7,439.
There were similar drops in wealth for the next two socioeconomic strata.
On the other hand, the top fourth and fifth quintiles by wealth have gotten richer.
The median family in the top socioeconomic class today (i.e., the family at the 90th percentile) is worth $629,853, compared to $495,510 in the last generation. That's a 27 percent increase in the size of the median fortune in the top income stratum.
In other words, compared to the last generation, wealth has been become more concentrated in the hands (and bank accounts and houses) of the richest Americans. Exactly why is debatable. The global markets for labor and capital have changed, of course. And the lower tax rate on capital gains -- which disproportionately helps richer people, who have more capital to invest -- has helped the richest amass ever higher net worths.
In case you're interested, here are some more details on how these numbers were calculated, from the report's appendix:
The sample size for the analysis of wealth includes 2,277 children of the original PSID families who were between the ages of zero and 18 in 1968 and were tracked into adulthood.
Because wealth was first collected in 1984, parents' wealth is measured in that year only. For the children, wealth is measured as the mean value taken in 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2009.
The limited availability of wealth data for parents produced differences in the mean ages for the parents and children. The average age of parents when wealth is measured was 55, and the average age of children was 46. To address the effects that an age gap in wealth measurement might have on intergenerational comparisons of wealth, age adjustments were performed on the data to make the parent and child generation wealth data more evenly matched...
Note that most of data on wealth of the children's generation are from before the housing bubble burst. If anything, then, these data may overstate the wealth of the children's generation.

HEADLINE: Rate Scandal Stirs Scramble for Damages

BYLINE: NATHANIEL POPPER


HIGHLIGHT: Baltimore has been leading a legal battle against the global banks that determine the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which serves as a benchmark for global borrowing and is at the center of a scandal. 

 BODY:
As unemployment climbed and tax revenue fell, the city of Baltimore laid off employees and cut services in the midst of the financial crisis. Its leaders now say the city's troubles were aggravated by bankers' manipulation of a key interest rate linked to hundreds of millions of dollars the city had borrowed.
Baltimore has been leading a battle in Manhattan federal court against the banks that determine the interest rate, the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which serves as a benchmark for global borrowing and stands at the center of the latest banking scandal. Now cities, states and municipal agencies nationwide, including Massachusetts, Nassau County on Long Island, and California's public pension system, are looking at whether they suffered similar losses and are weighing legal action.
Dozens of lawsuits filed by municipalities, pension funds and hedge funds have been consolidated into a few related cases against more than a dozen banks that are involved in setting Libor each day, including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank and Barclays. Last month, Barclays admitted to regulators that it tried to manipulate Libor before and during the financial crisis in 2008, and paid $450 million to settle the charges. It said other banks were doing the same, but none of them have been accused of wrongdoing.
 Libor, a measure of how much banks must pay to borrow money from one another in the short term, is set through a daily poll of the banks.
The rate influences what consumers, businesses and investors pay on a wide range of financial contracts, as varied as mortgages and interest rate swaps. Barclays has said it and other banks understated the rate during the financial crisis to make themselves look healthier to the public, rather than to make more money from clients.
As regulators and lawmakers in Washington and Europe assess the depth of the Libor abuse and the failure to address it, economists and analysts are already predicting it could be one of the most expensive scandals to hit Wall Street since the financial crisis.
Governments and other investors may face many hurdles in proving damages. But Darrell Duffie, a professor of finance at Stanford, said he expected that their lawsuits alone could lead to the banks' paying out tens of billions of dollars, echoing numbers from a recent report by analysts at Nomura Equity Research.
American municipalities have been among the first to claim losses from the supposed rate-rigging, because many of them borrow money through investment vehicles that directly derive their value from Libor. Peter Shapiro, who advises Baltimore and other cities on their use of these investments, said that "about 75 percent of major cities have contracts linked to this."
If the banks submitted artificially low Libor rates during the financial crisis in 2008, as Barclays has admitted, it would have led cities and states to receive smaller payments from financial contracts they had entered with their banks, Mr. Shapiro said.
"Unambiguously, state and local government agencies lost money because of the manipulation of Libor," said Mr. Shapiro, who is managing director of the Swap Financial Group and is not involved in any of the lawsuits. "The number is likely to be very, very big."
The banks have declined to comment on the lawsuits, but their lawyers have asked for the cases to be dismissed in court filings, pointing to the many unusual factors that influenced Libor during the crisis.
The efforts to calculate potential losses are complicated by the fact that Libor is used to determine the cost of thousands of financial products around the globe each day. If Libor was artificially pushed down on a particular day, it would help people involved in some types of contracts and hurt people involved in others.
Securities lawyers say the lawsuits will not be easy to win because the investors will first have to prove that the banks successfully pushed down Libor for an extended period during the crisis, and then will have to demonstrate that it was down on the day when the bank calculated particular payments. In addition, investors may have to prove that the specific bank from which they were receiving their payment was involved in the manipulation. Before it even reaches the point of proving such subtleties, however, the banks could be compelled to settle the cases.
One of the major complaints was filed by several traders and hedge funds that entered into futures contracts that are traded through the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and that pay out based on Libor. These contracts were a popular way to protect against spikes in interest rates, but they would not have paid off as expected if Libor had been artificially lowered.
A 2010 study cited in the suit - conducted by professors at the University of California, Los Angeles and the University of Minnesota - indicated that Libor was significantly lower than it should have been throughout 2008 and was particularly skewed around the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.
A separate complaint filed in 2010 by the investment firm Charles Schwab asserts that some of its mutual funds, including popular ones like the Schwab Total Bond Market Fund, lost money on similar investments.
The complaints being voiced by municipalities are mostly related to their use of a popular financial contract known as an interest rate swap. States and cities generally enter into these swaps with specific banks so that they can borrow money in the bond market. They pay bondholders based on a floating interest rate - like an adjustable-rate mortgage - but end up paying their bankers a fixed rate through a swap. If Libor is artificially lowered, the municipality is stuck paying the same fixed rate, but it receives a smaller variable payment from its bank.
Even before the current controversy, some municipal activists have said that banks took advantage of the financial inexperience of municipal officials to sell them billions of dollars of interest rate swaps. Experts in municipal finance say that because of the particular way that cities and states borrow money, they are especially liable to lose out on their swaps if Libor drops.
Mr. Shapiro, who helps cities, states and companies negotiate these contracts, said that if a city had interest rate swaps on bonds worth $1 billion and Libor was artificially pushed down by 0.30 percent, which is what the lawsuits contend, that city would have lost $3 million a year. The lawsuit claims the manipulation occurred over three years. Barclays' settlement with regulators did not specify how much the banks' actions may have moved Libor.
In Nassau County, the comptroller, George Maragos, said in a statement that according to his own calculations, Libor manipulation may have cost the county $13 million on swaps related to $600 million of outstanding bonds.
A Massachusetts state official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of potential future legal actions, said the state was calculating its potential losses.
"We are deeply concerned and we are carefully analyzing all of our options," the official said.
Anne Simpson, a portfolio manager at the California Public Employees' Retirement System - the nation's largest pension fund - said that the fund's officials "are sifting through the impact, but there certainly is an impact."
In Baltimore, the city had Libor-based interest rate swaps on about $550 million of bonds, according to the city's financial report from 2008, the central year discussed in the lawsuit. The city's lawyers have declined to specify what they think Baltimore's losses were.
The city solicitor, George Nilson, said that the rate manipulation claims meant that the city lost out on money when it needed it the most.
"The injury we suffered during the time we suffered it hurt more because we were challenged budgetarily," Mr. Nilson said. "Every dollar we lost due to illegal conduct was a dollar we couldn't pay to keep open recreation centers or to pay police officers."

HEADLINE: Q. and A.: Understanding Libor

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: A primer on the London interbank offered rate, more commonly known as Libor, which is one of the most important numbers in the financial world. 

 BODY:
The London interbank offered rate, more commonly known as Libor, is one of the most important numbers in the financial world. But until the Barclays scandal, it received scant public attention. Here is a primer.
Q.
 What is Libor?
A.
 Libor is the average interest rate at which banks can borrow from each other. London is mentioned in its name because the benchmark is set in that city.
Essentially, Libor is one of the main rates used to determine the borrowing costs for trillions of dollars in loans. Interest rates on some mortgages, student loans and credit card accounts go up or down when Libor moves. Often the rates are adjusted annually or quarterly, rather than every day.
Q.
 Why was Libor created, and by whom?
A.
 In the early 1980s, banks started looking for a standard benchmark to calculate the prices on an array of financial products, and the British Bankers' Association, an industry trade group, began publishing Libor on Jan. 1, 1986.
The idea was that instead of constantly haggling over the interest rates that would be charged for different types of loans, banks would have a uniform benchmark. There are actually 150 different Libor rates published every day. They cover 10 currencies and 15 maturities.
Q.
 How is Libor calculated?
A.
 For United States-dollar-denominated Libor, more than a dozen banks - including Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Barclays, UBS of Switzerland and others - estimate how much interest they would pay to borrow money on a short-term basis from other institutions. While the process is still overseen by the British Bankers' Association, the calculations are now performed by Thomson Reuters.
Thomson Reuters discards the four highest and four lowest submissions as outliers, and averages the remaining ones.
The data provider then publishes its calculations, generally around 11:30 a.m. London time, along with each bank's submissions. On Tuesday, the three-month United States dollar Libor rate, one of the most common Libor metrics, stood at 0.4576 percent. During the financial crisis of 2008, that rate rose to nearly 5 percent. At the time, banks considered lending to each other much riskier, and thus wouldn't lend unless they got a high interest rate in return. 
Q.
 What are examples of how Libor is used?
A.
 Banks often ask borrowers to pay Libor plus an added amount of interest, reflecting the credit risk of the borrower.
Many mortgage lenders in the United States rely on Libor to determine the interest rates they charge for adjustable-rate mortgages. Typically, an adjustable-rate mortgage might be 2 to 3 percentage points over the six-month Libor rate.
Big corporations with strong credit typically would pay roughly 1 percentage point or less over Libor because they are considered safer bets than individual mortgage borrowers.
Q.
 How has Libor's use evolved over time?
A.
 Libor was primarily created as a benchmark for banks to determine borrowing costs - and it is largely used in the same manner today, albeit for a broader group of financial products. For instance, many banks now used Libor to set the prices on derivatives, the complicated financial instruments tied to commodities, interest rates, currencies and other assets.
Q.
 Why is Libor important?
A.
 After more than two decades, Libor still remains one of the most highly cited benchmarks in the financial world.
The British Bankers' Association has promoted the rate-setting process as highly transparent and impartial, making Libor a good benchmark for various financial products. The group has argued that no one institution can single-handedly alter the calculations behind the rate.
But amid the rate-manipulation scandal, the integrity of Libor has been called into question. In late June, Barclays agreed to pay $450 million to settle accusations by regulators that it had submitted false Libor rates to bolster its bottom line and deflect scrutiny about its health.
Q.
 Is Libor changing as a result of the rate manipulation scandal?
A.
A. It's unclear at the moment. After regulators unveiled their settlement with Barclays, the B.B.A. said that it was "shocked" by the revelations and was reviewing all aspects of the Libor-setting process.

HEADLINE: Oh, (No) Canada!

BYLINE: FRANK JACOBS


HIGHLIGHT: The surprisingly complicated history of Newfoundland's borders. 

 BODY:
PUB-DATE: July 22, 1948
Now nearing the 64th anniversary of its Independence Day, that Republic of Newfoundland - blessed with a small population [2] and ample natural resources [3] - might have become a beacon of state-sponsored prosperity à la Scandinavia. Or independence might have aggravated a dormant border dispute with Quebec, opening the door to instability, conflict and outside meddling. 
What if, in those scary first years of the cold war, Stalin had managed to use Newfie [4] sovereignty, and more specifically the dispute over its newly internationalized border, as a chance to interfere directly in North American affairs? Newfoundland could have been an earlier, colder Cuba - but with a foothold on the American mainland. 
That didn't happen, of course, but it's not idle speculation, either. Ottawa, London and Washington were all keen to avoid precisely that scenario, and gently but urgently prodded the locals towards confederation. Among other things, the Americans put aside semi-official plans for a Newfoundland-United States trade alliance [5]. 
So on midnight of March 31, 1949, Newfoundland became Canada's 10th (and last) province [6]. In 2001, the province was re-baptized, better to reflect its true geographical scope: Newfoundland . That re-naming prompted the government of Québec to reiterate its position vis à vis its land border with Labrador: "No Québec government has ever formally recognized the course of the border between Québec and Newfoundland in the Labrador Peninsula, as defined by the judgment made by the judiciary committee of the Privy Council of London in 1927. For Québec, this border has never been definitively defined." [7]
That, fortunately, was as worked up as Quebec chose to get over the Labrador border [8]; no gendarmes were sent to re-take territory, no Newfie militias were raised to stop the invasion. No doubt the fact that both entities are provinces within the same federation takes the edge off the dispute, and prevents its pursuance. Which is good, as the well of grievances is deep, and plentiful.
Labrador [9] and Newfoundland [10] were rediscovered [11] and named by Portuguese and Italian sailors respectively, but first settled by the English - who claimed Newfoundland as England's very first colony, in 1583 - and the French, who abandoned their settlements on the island to the English by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The French did maintain fishing rights on the so-called French Shore [12] until ceding those in 1904. 
Labrador remained part of New France until its conquest by the British in 1760. In 1763, a royal proclamation transferred the coast of Labrador to Newfoundland "to the end that the open and free fishery may be extended and carried on upon the coast of Labrador and the adjacent islands." 
The 1774 Quebec Act re-transferred Labrador to what was formerly New France, which under its new name was greatly enlarged to encompass lands up to the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers [13]. But in 1809, the British re-re-transferred Labrador, "from the River St. John to Hudson's Streights" to Newfoundland. 
As an accommodation toward Lower Canada (i.e., Quebec), the British, by the 1825 Labrador Act, withdrew Labrador's southern border from the shore of the Gulf of St Lawrence to the 52nd Parallel North, to where it meets a line due north from the "Bay or Harbour of Ance Sablon" (nowadays Blanc-Sablon). These two straight lines are the oldest (if contested) parts of Labrador's current land border. 
Yet the border conflict didn't erupt until 1902,, when Newfoundland issued a logging license for an area far inland, on the Churchill River [14]. From Quebec's point of view, Labrador existed only as a manifestation of fishing rights, but not much else - not unlike the French Shore - and should therefore not intrude inland more than, say, a mile. 
 At Quebec's behest, Ottawa submitted the dispute to the Judiciary Committee of the Privy Council in London, as both Canada and Newfoundland were separate and equal members of the British Empire. As a ruling was not forthcoming, both parties to the dispute instructed the Privy Council to pronounce solely on the "location and definition" of the border, basing itself only on the existing statues and proclamations. In doing so, they spared the five-judge panel from having to create new borders or propose land swaps ex nihilo. 
Obviously, Canada hoped that this meant that its interpretation of "coast" would prevail. It didn't. In 1927, the Privy Council fixed Labrador's inland border on the watershed (or the highest point of land) between the Atlantic Ocean and the Hudson Bay. It coupled this to the 1825 straight-line border, refining the definition to grant the town of Blanc-Sablon to Quebec. 
To Quebec, this felt like a consolation prize. The watershed line deprived Quebec of a large chunk of territory that it felt was rightfully hers. It was whispered, in Quebec's corridors of provincial powerlessness, that some of the judges had logging interests in Labrador. 
Nevertheless, this is the official border as it has appeared on most maps ever since. When Newfoundland acceded to Canada in 1949, it made sure to cement its Labrador border in the Terms of Union [15]. Quebec took exception to the Privy Council's ruling, but in 1971, an official commission of the Quebec government decided that the dispute was not worth pursuing. And yet, as the reanimated animosity of the 2001 press release shows, the dispute lives on. 
 The dispute now centers on Labrador's southern, straight-line border. Some maps published by the Quebec government show the straight line as "non-definitive" [16] and place the actual border further north. Giving Labrador a taste of its own medicine, this line marks the southern border of the Atlantic basin, the very watershed that forms Labrador's western boundary. This not only deprives Labrador of its only sizeable straight-line border, but also of just under 5,000 square miles of its territory. 
Neither Quebec nor Newfoundland seems to want to press the issue - for the moment. But who knows what will happen in the future? Quebec, as the heir to New France, has occasionally leaned toward declaring independence [17]; should that ever come to pass, the Quebec-Labrador border would yet become an international one - perhaps reviving Quebec's claims to the southern watershed border, or even the 1-mile coastal border [18]. 
 Meanwhile, we should not forget that Newfoundland has an international border. Some 12 miles off the island's southern coast are the French islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon - the only splinter of New France still under French control [19]. This peculiarity comes with not one but border disputes. 
In 1972, Canada and France delimited the maritime boundary between Newfoundland and St. Pierre and Miquelon, leaving open a dispute about the extent of the two countries' economic exclusion zones. It was only solved in 1992, by arbitration. The zone granted to France was peculiar, to say the least: it consisted of a 24-mile extrusion west of Miquelon, and a corridor southward from the islands, only 10 nautical miles wide, but 188 nautical miles long. The intention of the zone's baguette-like shape ostensibly was to allow access to St. Pierre and Miquelon from the high seas; otherwise, they would have been surrounded by the Canadian exclusion zone. Sadly, it wasn't well drawn: according to a conventional reading of the pertinent treaty, Canada's zone extends well beyond France's, cutting off the intended access route. 
And it would appear that the 1972 decision also contained a blunder. The maritime border, halfway between St. Pierre and Newfoundland, may pass through Canada's Green Island and the Little Green Islands just to its south. Or it may not. Some maps place all of these islets on either side of the border, some place the border straight through them - providing France with a third dry-land border in the Americas [20]. 
Clearly, the province of Newfoundland and Labrador is a minefield of dormant border disputes - and we haven't even mentioned its own third land border, on its northern extremity: for apparently no good reason, Killiniq Island, just above the extreme northern point of Labrador's mainland, is divided in two - between Newfoundland and Labrador and Canada's newest territory, Nunavut. 
 Newfoundland was a colony until 1907, then had dominion status until 1949. Unlike other dominions, and quite unique in history, Newfoundland in 1934 voted to abandon self-government in favor of direct rule from London, becoming the rare entity to reject independence in favor of being governed by someone else.
 The population at the time of the referendum was just over 350,000. It now stands at around 515,000. Newfoundland accounts for 95 percent of the total population, with just over 50 percent concentrated on the Avalon Peninsula on the island's southeast (also the location of the capital, St. John's). 
 Fish and oil, with a decline of the former now compensated by a boom of the latter; but also mining (and prospecting) for minerals such as iron, nickel, copper, zinc, silver and gold. 
 A common, originally derogatory nickname for Newfoundlanders, now often self-applied with pride. 
 The Economic Union Party advocated for such an outcome; as this option was purposely left off the ballot, the party supported "responsible government" (i.e., independence), which gained a plurality of the votes (44.5 percent, vs. 41.1 percent for confederation with Canada) on June 3, 1948, in the first round of the referendum. 
 Canada consists of 10 provinces and 3 territories; Newfoundland's admission was the last but one major territorial change for Canada. In 1999, the new territory of Nunavut was split off from the Northwest Territories. 
 A statement by Québec's minister of natural resources and minister responsible for Canadian intergovernmental affairs, expressing the Québec government's position on the constitutional changes in the nomenclature of Newfoundland. 
 Not only the only disputed interprovincial boundary in Canada, at over 2,100 miles it is also the longest one. This is due to the borderline's erratic course as it follows the watershed between the Atlantic and the Hudson Bay. 
 Named by and after João Fernandes Lavrador, who sighted the peninsula in 1498. The name initially also applied to the coast of southwest Greenland. 
 Named Terra Nova in 1497 by John Cabot (Giovanni Caboto), an Italian sailing for the English king. The Irish later called it Talamh an Eisc ("Fishland") and the Basque Ternua. The toponyms in common use today are in English (Newfoundland) and French (Terre-Neuve). The island's name in some languages like German (Neufundland), Polish (Nowa Fundlandia) and Hungarian (Uj-Fundland) suggests the island, analogous to many other places in the New World, is named for a place in the Old World - "Fundland." The Mi'kmaq Indians first named the island Ktaqamkuk (translatable as the "Big Shore", the "Mainland" or the "Little Continent"). 
 In 1960, the discovery of the remains of a Viking village at L'Anse-aux-Meadows, on the northernmost tip of Newfoundland, provided the first undisputable archaeological evidence of the Norse discovery of America as described in Icelandic sagas. Many scholars have since identified Newfoundland with (part of) Vinland, and Labrador with Markland. 
 The Treaty of Utrecht defined the French Shore as between Cape Bonavista (in the island's east) and Point Riche (in the northwest), but as the French continued to fish to the south of this area, the Treaty of Versailles moved the French Shore to between Cape St John and Cape Ray. In this area, what Breton fishermen had called Le Petit Nord since the 16th century, French fishermen were allowed to come ashore in order to prepare their catch, but not to establish permanent settlements. 
 Quebec's southernmost point thus became the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, at present-day Cairo, now merely the southernmost town in Illinois. 
 Named the Hamilton River until Feb. 1, 1966, when Newfoundland premier Joey Smallwood renamed it after the former British prime minister, who had died one week previously. The river now flows from Smallwood Reservoir. 
 Term #2: "The Province of Newfoundland and Labrador shall comprise the same territory as at the date of Union, that is to say, the island of Newfoundland and the islands adjacent thereto, the Coast of Labrador as delimited in the report delivered by the Judicial Committee of His Majesty's Privy Council on the first day of March, 1927, and approved by His Majesty in His Privy Council on the twenty-second day of March, 1927, and the islands adjacent to the said Coast of Labrador." 
 on this map, published as part of Quebec's to develop the province's hydroelectric potential. 
 In two referendums, in 1980 and 1995, the No camp won, but only by 50.6 percent in that second one. 
 Even though, according to Henri Dorion, who presided over the Commission to Study the Territorial Integrity of Quebec (1966-1972) in a 1995 speech outlining the "Ten Great Myths about the Labrador Boundary," "if it is ridiculous to have the boundary on the watershed, it is even more ridiculous to have it 5,000 feet inland." 
 In fact, it was returned to France at the Treaty of Paris in 1763, just when the rest of New France was transferred to Britain. 
 For a discussion of another French land border in the Americas, see this previous Borderlines post.
France's third land border in the Americas is with the Netherlands, with which it shares the Caribbean island of St. Martin/Sint-Maarten.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Short on Ethics, Report Finds

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: About 30 percent of respondents said their compensation structure created pressure to compromise their standards or violate the law, according to a study released by the law firm Labaton Sucharow that involved 500 financial workers in the United States and Britain. 

 BODY:
How ethical is Wall Street?
It is a question that has been asked countless times since the financial crisis, especially when scandals like the rate-rigging case at Barclays and prominent insider trading trials expose questionable behavior in the financial industry. A new study offers an answer: Wall Street is not very ethical at all.
According to the law firm Labaton Sucharow, which represents investors and whistle-blowers, 24 percent of Wall Street workers who participated in a study said they believed unethical or illegal behavior could help people in their industry be successful. In addition, 26 percent of respondents said they had observed or had firsthand knowledge of wrongdoing in the workplace.
The study, which involved 500 financial workers in the United States and Britain, also found that 30 percent of respondents said their compensation structure created pressure to compromise their standards or violate the law. And 16 percent of respondents said they would commit insider trading if they believed they could get away with it.
"When misconduct is common and accepted by financial services professionals, the integrity of our entire financial system is at risk," Jordan Thomas, partner and chair of the law firm's whistle-blower representation practice, said in a statement.
The findings resonate with a popular perception of the industry. The scandal at Barclays, which led to the resignation of top bank officials last week, including the chief executive, Robert E. Diamond Jr., has fueled protests and other denunciations. On Friday, The Economist magazine's British edition ran the headline "Banksters" on its cover.
One former Wall Street executive found that the report showed a troublesome trend. Sallie Krawcheck, who once led Bank of America's wealth management division, posted a response on Twitter: "Oh dear ..."

HEADLINE: Republican Web Site Points to Obama as 'Real Outsourcer-in-Chief'

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: In a Web site announced early Tuesday morning, the Republican National Committee says the president wasted billions of dollars that should have been spent in America. 

 BODY:
11:24 a.m. | Updated The Republican National Committee is accusing President Obama of sending taxpayer dollars overseas to finance jobs in other countries at the expense of American workers at home.
On a new Web site announced by Reince Priebus, the group's chairman, early Tuesday morning, the committee says the president wasted billions of dollars that should have been spent in America and says that the spending makes Mr. Obama "the real outsourcer-in-chief."
The move is part of an effort to go on the offensive after attacks from Mr. Obama's campaign on Bain Capital, the private equity firm that Mitt Romney founded. The president's aides said the company was a "pioneer" in outsourcing U.S. jobs to low-wage countries.
But it is unclear how much money Republicans are planning to put behind the attack, which was teased by Mr. Priebus in a post on Twitter on Monday night.
"Your taxpayers $ going to Finland, Korea, China? Watch our trailer video," , adding a link to a that led to a not-yet-available Web site, ObamanomicsOutsourced.com.
Responding quickly to Mr. Priebus even before the Web site was available, Stephanie Cutter, Mr. Obama's deputy campaign manager, posted on Twitter: "Pres. Obama knows America benefits from insourcing. Mitt Romney personally benefitted from companies that outsource."
Ms. Cutter that defended Mr. Obama's record on protecting American jobs.
"President Obama has fought continuously to end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas, fostered incentives for companies to bring jobs back to America and doubled the rate of trade enforcement actions we've taken against China to ensure an even playing field for American workers," the document says.
The Republican National Committee's Hollywood-style video and the Web site cost a tiny amount of money to produce and do not have anywhere near the reach of Mr. Obama's advertising campaign, especially in critical battleground states. Republican officials declined to say whether a television advertisement is in the works.
Still, the attack, which will be officially unveiled by Mr. Priebus in Iowa even as Mr. Obama travels to the state for campaign events on Tuesday, signals that Mr. Romney and his allies are unwilling to let the president seize the moral high ground on outsourcing, a potentially potent issue.
The teaser video says that Mr. Obama "shipped the recovery overseas," and shows a moving red dot that ends up in China. The video then says the president has "a record of failure spanning the globe" and lists nearly two dozen countries, including Switzerland, Mexico, Vietnam, Russia, Germany, El Salvador and Indonesia.
Once at the Web site, visitors are told that most of the money Mr. Obama sent to those countries came from the stimulus funds that the president pushed through Congress at the beginning of his term.
"As he racked up trillions in new debt, billions of dollars did go to create jobs that were outsourced or spent overseas," the Web site says. "Whether it is electric cars made in Finland or solar panels in Mexico, taxpayers would be astonished to learn that their hard-earned money went abroad for jobs that weren't created in the United States."
Among the examples cited:

        
The Republican National Committee says that "nearly half" of a $2.4 billion stimulus program to help support battery production went to foreign firms, including two South Korean companies "that used their awards to hire foreign nationals in Michigan to do work that Americans easily could have done."
        
The Republicans say that $8.5 billion in grants for wind farms went overseas, "creating thousands of jobs overseas with money that was supposed to create jobs within the United States."
        
The Web site says that $880 million in clean-energy manufacturing tax credits went to foreign firms.
        
The Republican National Committee says that the largest recipient of Mr. Obama's loan guarantee program for green energy projects was Abengoa, a Spanish company which received $2.7 billion in guarantees.
The website, which went live at midnight Tuesday morning, initially provided little backing for the charges, offering no citations to public documents or to news media reports about the allegations. Later on Tuesday morning, the R.N.C. published links to news articles and other citations they said supported their claims. And the document provided by Ms. Cutter from the Obama campaign provides detailed links to news articles for each point.
The document from the Obama campaign notes, for example, that a section of the stimulus program prohibits money from going to renewable energy properties that are "used predominantly outside of the United States." The document includes citations to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the U.S. Treasury.
"President Obama signed free-trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama in the largest trade deal since 1994, with the agreements to support an estimated 70,000 jobs," the Obama document says.
Mr. Obama is scheduled to arrive in Iowa on Tuesday for a roundtable discussion at a family's home in Cedar Rapids around 12:20 Eastern Time. A little later, he is expected to give remarks at a community college in the town.
Mr. Obama's aides said his remarks would focus on his announcement on Monday that he would push for an extension of middle-class tax cuts, but not for an extension of tax cuts on wealthy individuals.
The Republican National Committee effort is designed in part to step on that message.

HEADLINE: Diamond to Forgo Up to $31 Million in Bonuses From Barclays

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Robert E. Diamond Jr., the former chief executive of Barclays, will forgo deferred bonuses of up to $31 million, as the British lender looks to quell public anger over an interest rate-rigging scandal. 

 BODY:
Robert E. Diamond Jr., the former chief executive of Barclays, will forgo deferred stock bonuses of up to $31 million, as the British bank looks to quell public anger over an interest rate-rigging scandal.
The bank's chairman, Marcus Agius, told a British parliamentary committee on Tuesday that Mr. Diamond would still receive up to one year in salary and a cash payment worth a combined $3.1 million. Mr. Diamond, who resigned last week as Barclays battled public furor over its illegal actions, will "support the transition to the new chief executive as necessary," the bank said on Monday. Mr. Diamond had already agreed to forfeit his annual cash bonus. 
"It is my hope that my decision to step down and today's agreement on my remuneration will help close this chapter and allow Barclays to move forward and prosper," Mr. Diamond said in the statement. 
Details of the pay package trickled out at the parliamentary committee hearing on Tuesday as British politicians scrutinized Mr. Agius, questioning whether he was a competent chairman. The committee struck a hostile tone, hammering away at Mr. Agius, who has also agreed to resign in wake of the scandal. 
The committee also homed in on Mr. Diamond's leadership of the bank and whether the former chief executive was fully forthcoming when he testified last week. 
Last month, Barclays agreed to pay $450 million to settle accusations that it had attempted to manipulate a key interest rate known as the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which is based on surveys from banks about the rates at which they could borrow money in the financial markets. The rate serves as a benchmark for the pricing of $350 trillion of financial products, including credit cards, mortgages and student loans. 
The Barclays settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Justice Department and Financial Services Authority of Britain exposed how the bank improperly influenced Libor to deflect concerns about its health and bolster profits.
The Barclays case, part of a broader investigation into how many of the world's biggest banks set key interest rates, set off a firestorm in London that is now spreading to the United States. Several American banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, are also under scrutiny for their suspected role in the case. 
In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Agius said: "The Board deeply regrets the circumstances that led to Bob resigning his positions at Barclays. Despite having no personal culpability, he recognizes more than anyone the negative attention that they have generated and has taken characteristically strong action to address that. These circumstances do not detract in any way from the tremendous legacy that Bob has left at Barclays, and his actions are clear indications of his commitment to the institution to which he has contributed so much."

HEADLINE: A Recent History of India Through Western Magazine Covers

BYLINE: HEATHER TIMMONS


HIGHLIGHT: Tracking the fickle attentions of the foreign media. 

 BODY:
Time Magazine's recent cover story in Asia, which dubs Prime Minister Manmohan Singh "The Underachiever," has roiled sleepy summer-time New Delhi, forcing politicians from Home Minister P. Chidambaram to opposition leaders out of the air-conditioned bungalows to either decry or support the magazine.
(For the record: The Bharatiya Janata Party's spokesman said the magazine has "only stated the obvious," which Mr. Chidambaram countered, sort of, with "Can the PM rouse himself? The answer is 'Of course.' ")
The fickle attentions of the Western media have blown hot and cold on India in recent years, sometimes praising its ingenuity and entrepreneurial spirit, other times decrying the slow-moving government and lack of infrastructure, sometimes doing both in the same year.
A quick look back at the past decade in India, through Western magazine covers:
PUB-DATE: December 7, 2003Week
The Rise of India and What it Means for America
Art: A young Indian man stares earnestly into the camera
An excerpt: "The Welch center is at the vanguard of one of the biggest mind-melds in history. Plenty of Americans know of India's inexpensive software writers and have figured out that the nice clerk who booked their air ticket is in Delhi. But these are just superficial signs of India's capabilities. Quietly but with breathtaking speed, India and its millions of world-class engineering, business, and medical graduates are becoming enmeshed in America's New Economy in ways most of us barely imagine. "India has always had brilliant, educated people," says tech-trend forecaster Paul Saffo of the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif. "Now Indians are taking the lead in colonizing cyberspace."
February 2004, Wired Magazine
Kiss Your Cubicle Goodbye: The new face of the Silicon Age.
Art: A beautiful Indian bride, wearing gold jewelry, with software programming code written in henna on her hands, as for a Mehandi ceremony.
An excerpt: "Aparna Jairam isn't trying to steal your job. That's what she tells me, and I believe her. But if Jairam does end up taking it - and, let's face facts, she could do your $70,000-a-year job for the wages of a Taco Bell counter jockey - she won't lose any sleep over your plight. When I ask what her advice is for a beleaguered American programmer afraid of being pulled under by the global tide that she represents, Jairam takes the high road, neither dismissing the concern nor offering soothing happy talk. Instead, she recites a portion of the 2,000-year-old epic poem and Hindu holy book the Bhagavad Gita: "Do what you're supposed to do. And don't worry about the fruits. They'll come on their own."
PUB-DATE: March 6, 2006
The New India
Art: A beautiful Indian woman (Padma Lakshmi) poses in a red sari, hands folded in greeting.
An excerpt: "India is diverging from its past, but also from most other countries in Asia. It is not a quiet, controlled, quasi-authoritarian country that is slowly opening up according to plans. It is a noisy democracy that has finally empowered its people economically. In this respect India, one of the poorest countries in the world, looks strikingly similar to the world's wealthiest country, the United States of America. In both places, society has triumphed over the state."
PUB-DATE: June 26, 2006
India Inc.: Why the world's biggest democracy is the next great superpower, and what it means for America.
Art: A beautiful Indian woman, draped in classical dance attire, wearing a call center headset.
An excerpt: "If you want to catch a glimpse of the new India, with all its dizzying promise and turbocharged ambition, then head to its biggest, messiest, sexiest city -- Bombay. Home to 18.4 million people and counting, the city, formally known as Mumbai, is projected by 2015 to be the planet's second most populous metropolis, after Tokyo. But it's already a world of its own. Walk down its teeming streets, and you'll encounter crime lords and Bollywood stars, sprawling slums and Manhattan-priced condos, and jam-packed bars where DJs play the music of the Punjab, bhangra -- a pulsating sound track familiar to clubgoers in London and New York City."
(Note: The picture is actually of Gunjan Thiagarajah, 29, a "sales and marketing employee at a biotech firm in Los Angeles," a later Time Magazine story said.)
PUB-DATE: March 18, 2007Week
The Trouble With India: Crumbling roads, jammed airports and power blackouts could hobble growth.
Art: An elephant whose trunk, tusk and ears are disintegrating.
Excerpt: "But this economic boom is being built on the shakiest of foundations. Highways, modern bridges, world-class airports, reliable power, and clean water are in desperately short supply. And what's already there is literally crumbling under the weight of progress. In December, a bridge in eastern India collapsed, killing 34 passengers in a train rumbling underneath. Economic losses from congestion and poor roads alone are as high as $6 billion a year, says Gajendra Haldea, an adviser to the federal Planning Commission."
PUB-DATE: October 10, 2010
How India's Growth Will Outpace China's
Art: A blurry tiger, on the run.
An excerpt: "No doubt a strong central government would have given India a less chaotic Commonwealth Games, but there is more to life than badminton and rhythmic gymnastics. India's state may be weak, but its private companies are strong. Indian capitalism is driven by millions of entrepreneurs all furiously doing their own thing. Since the early 1990s, when India dismantled the 'licence raj' and opened up to foreign trade, Indian business has boomed. The country now boasts legions of thriving small businesses and a fair number of world-class ones whose English-speaking bosses network confidently with the global elite. They are less dependent on state patronage than Chinese firms, and often more innovative: they have pioneered the $2,000 car, the ultra-cheap heart operation and some novel ways to make management more responsive to customers. Ideas flow easily around India, since it lacks China's culture of secrecy and censorship. That, plus China's rampant piracy, is why knowledge-based industries such as software love India but shun the Middle Kingdom."

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:

        
In a worrisome development for the Obama campaign, Mitt Romney easily outraised the president's formidable money machine for the second month in a row, with a nonstop schedule of high-dollar events and growing success with small-dollar donors as well, Nicholas Confessore reports. President Obama's fund-raising deficit in part reflects how drastically the terrain has shifted since 2008, as many of the Republican donors who embraced him back then now swing back to their party.

        
President Obama and Congressional Republicans pressed ahead on Monday with politically charged proposals on tax cuts and health care, Mark Landler and Jonathan Weisman report. Lawmakers from both parties offered alternatives to the plans announced by their leaders, underscoring the stakes for the president and the Republicans as they battle for control of the election-year debate.

        
President Obama's push on Monday to extend tax cuts for the middle class - but not for the rich - is being joined by an all-out effort from his allies to portray Mitt Romney as a wealthy candidate who is out of touch with most Americans, Michael D. Shear writes. But top aides from the Obama campaign say they are not attacking their opponent's fortune; instead, they say, the focus is part of a broader plan to disqualify Mr. Romney's economic credentials in the eyes of voters.

        
The House Ethics Committee has formally opened an investigation into the actions of Representative Shelley Berkley, Democrat of Nevada, Eric Lipton reports. Her bid for a Senate seat will probably remain under a cloud through Election Day, with the committee looking into allegations that she used her office to help her husband's medical practice.

        
Graduating from the dual program at Harvard University for a joint law and business degree puts Mitt Romney into one of the most exclusive academic circles in the world, Peter Lattman and Richard Pérez-Peña write.
Around the Web:

        
Some House Democrats are striking a nerve with Republican congressmen and candidates by recording video of their homes and posting the footage online, Politico reports.

        
President Obama's re-election campaign went to court on Monday with the hope of banning Demstore.com from selling merchandise with the campaign's signature "O" logo on it, The Associated Press reports.
Happenings in Washington:

        
President Obama will travel to Iowa to make his case for middle-class tax relief. He will be back in Washington this evening.
        
The Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation will hold a ceremony to honor close to 2,000 military children with more than $6 million in scholarships.

TOP STORIES
Bank Scandal Turns Spotlight to Regulators | As big banks face the fallout from a global investigation into interest rate manipulation, American and British lawmakers are scrutinizing regulators who failed to take action that might have prevented years of illegal activity.
Politicians in London and Washington are questioning whether regulators allowed banks to report false rates in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis and afterward. On Monday, Congress stepped into the fray, requesting information about the role of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, according to people close to the matter.
The focus on regulators and other financial institutions has intensified in the last two weeks after the British bank Barclays agreed to pay $450 million to resolve its case. British and American authorities accused the bank of improperly influencing key interest rates to deflect concerns about its health and bolster profits.
The Barclays settlement is the first action stemming from a broad investigation into how banks set key benchmarks, including the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. The pricing of $350 trillion of financial products, including credit cards, mortgages and student loans, is pegged to Libor and other such rates. DealBook »

American Airlines and US Airways Dance Around a Merger | For the last several months, American Airlines' new chairman and chief executive, Tom Horton, has been desperately trying to delay merger talks with his former cubicle mate, US Airways' chief executive, Doug Parker, writes Andrew Ross Sorkin in the DealBook column. (Mr. Horton and Mr. Parker sat next to each other when they both worked at American in the 1980s.)
Mr. Horton put American's parent, AMR, into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November. Since then, US Airways has sought to merge with American to no avail - despite securing support for a deal from American's own labor unions and many of its creditors.
Mr. Horton has not budged, beyond nodding to the overture by saying it will be considered as part of the company's fiduciary duty to its creditors. Instead, he has repeatedly argued that the airline's best strategic choice is to emerge from bankruptcy independently, declaring that he plans to restore American to its previous industry-leading position despite all the evidence that its market share is fast eroding.
But there potentially is another reason - one that would be a perverse incentive - that Mr. Horton may be shunning a deal with US Airways before emerging from bankruptcy: a giant payday. DealBook »

HEADLINE: Farm Aid Concert Coming to Pennsylvania

BYLINE: FELICIA R. LEE


HIGHLIGHT: Willie Nelson and Neil Young are among the headliners for the concert on Sept. 22. 

 BODY:
 Willie Nelson, Neil Young, John Mellencamp and Dave Matthews will be among the performers this year at the annual Farm Aid benefit concert, which will be held in Hersheypark Stadium in Hershey, Pa., on Sept. 22.
Farm Aid has been held nearly every year since 1985 and has raised more than $40 million to help family farmers remain on their land. The event drew about 16,000 people last year in Kansas City, Kan. Its Farmer Resource Hotline network is now online and helps farmers find alternate sources of credit or specialized training.
 "We've built a strong family farm movement to grow our economy, ensure our health and protect our environment," Mr. Nelson, the Farm Aid president, said in a statement. "Farm Aid brings these Main Street values to transform the Wall Street-controlled farm and food system." 
Tickets for this year's show go on sale Friday. Also scheduled to perform are Jack Johnson, ALO, Pegi Young and The Survivors, and Lukas Nelson and Promise of the Real. The festival will feature Farm Aid's "homegrown concessions" which are family farm-identified, local and organic foods. Concertgoers will also have an opportunity to meet farmers and learn more about their work.

HEADLINE: A Close Presidential Contest, With Less Than Enthusiastic Voters

BYLINE: ALLISON KOPICKI


HIGHLIGHT: A new Washington Post/ABC News poll showed Barack Obama and Mitt Romney tied, each with 47 percent of support among registered voters. 

 BODY:
Results from three recent national surveys show a country that is closely divided between the presidential candidates but not very enthusiastic about voting this fall. Respondents also said that politics were behind the recent action by the Republican-led House to hold the attorney general in contempt, and that the Obama administration should answer all questions about the gun-trafficking case known as Operation Fast and Furious. 
A new Washington Post/ABC News poll showed Barack Obama and Mitt Romney tied, each with 47 percent of support among registered voters. 
Most voters also said they were committed to their choices, with just 8 percent of Romney supporters saying there was a good chance they could change their minds, and just 4 percent of Obama supporters saying so.
Despite the even support for the candidates, nearly 6 in 10 Americans said that Mr. Obama would emerge the victor this fall, compared with about a third who said Mr. Romney would win. 
The poll showed stronger enthusiasm among Mr. Obama's supporters, with more than half saying they were very enthusiastic, compared with fewer than 4 in 10 of Mr. Romney's supporters. Most of Mr. Romney's supporters said their vote was against President Obama, rather than for Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts. 
Americans gave the president less than stellar ratings on the economy, immigration, and health care, with a majority saying they disapproved of his handling of each issue. Voters divided nearly evenly over would will do better on their most important issue, the economy: 48 percent said Mr. Romney would do a better job, while 45 percent favored Mr. Obama. However, Mr. Romney scored lower among voters on qualities like understanding Americans' economic problems, likability and standing up for what he believes.
Gallup examined swing state voters in its recent tracking survey, looking at the responses of 1,200 respondents in 12 states that they deemed as highly contested in this year's election. And while voters in these swing states were more likely to be exposed to television ads from the campaigns, their enthusiasm for voting in the election was not very different from .
Among swing state voters, 25 percent said they were extremely enthusiastic about voting in the 2012 election, compared with 22 percent nationwide. Over all, nearly a third of voters said they were not enthusiastic about voting this year.
A CNN/ORCpoll conducted in the days after the Republican-led House of Representatives voted to hold Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. in contempt found that just over half of Americans approved of the action taken by the House of Representatives. 
However, about 6 in 10 Americans said the Republican investigation of Operation Fast and Furious was mostly to gain political advantage, while about a third said it was due to real ethical concerns. And nearly 7 in 10 Americans said President Obama and his aides should answer all questions related to the investigation - only 27 percent said they should continue to invoke executive privilege. 
The ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by telephone July 5 to 8 among 1,003 adults, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points for the full sample and registered voters. The CNN/ORC poll was conducted by telephone June 28 to July 1 among 1,517 adults, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Gallup's swing states survey was based on telephone interviews conducted June 22 to 29 on the Gallup Daily tracking survey, of 1,200 registered voters living in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

HEADLINE: In Manchester United's I.P.O., a Preference for American Rules

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: The United States, which has long been criticized for its harsh rules surrounding initial public offerings, is now the place where foreign companies go to avoid regulation. 

 BODY:
Manchester United, the English soccer team with an adoring fan base in Europe and Asia, is filing to go public in the United States.
But the initial public offering is not a reflection of Americans' increasing love of soccer. Instead, it is a reflection of American regulators' light touch.
I'm not kidding. The United States, which has long been criticized for its harsh rules surrounding I.P.O.'s, is now the place where foreign companies go to avoid regulation.
Manchester United may be the world's most popular soccer club, with 659 million fans according to the team's own estimates. In 2005, the American businessman Malcolm Glazer and his family bought control of the team, loading it up with hundreds of millions of dollars in debt. Now, the company is selling shares to raise money and reduce its debt, which stands at about $655 million.
But the Glazers do not want to give up voting control since, among other reasons, Manchester United fans appear eager to buy back the team from the still-unpopular family. In 2010, a prominent group of Manchester United fans were said to have tried to form a consortium to repurchase the club. The Glazers have uniformly given the same response: the team is not for sale. Now, the Glazers are venue-shopping for their stock.
They passed over the Hong Kong Stock Exchange because it would not give the team a waiver to allow two classes of shares, with different voting rights. The London Stock Exchange also does not allow such share structures, perhaps the reason this natural home was skipped over by the Glazers.
Manchester United declined to comment for this article.
The Singapore Exchange seemed more amenable to the Glazers' plan to list Manchester United and keep control through a dual-class structure. But after the exchange delayed final signoff on the dual-class shares and the Asian markets cooled, the Singapore plans were derailed, according to an article in Reuters.
The soccer team has recently found a home for its stock in the United States. Manchester United filed the papers this month for its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, and the Glazers are taking advantage of the country's willingness to be more flexible when it comes to shareholder rights. Manchester United is proposing a corporate structure that would give the Glazers shares with 10 votes apiece. Public investors would receive one vote for each share.
While the Securities and Exchange Commission tried to ban this type of dual-class voting stock in the 1980s, a federal appeals court struck down the rules. Since then, the structure has become increasingly common. Facebook, LinkedIn and Google all have dual-class shares. The New York Times also has a dual-class voting structure. In 2011, 28 offerings featured dual-class structures that gave greater voting rights to certain shareholders, according to the research firm Dealogic.
The Manchester United offering is a case study in how the American markets have evolved toward deregulation in the past decade.
The company is a beneficiary of the newly enacted Jumpstart Our Business Start-Ups Act, known as the JOBS Act, designed to help private companies raise capital and go public. Although the team was founded in 1878, the JOBS Act classifies Manchester United as an emerging growth company since it has less than $1 billion in revenue. As such, the company, which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands, does not face the same hurdles as American businesses.
The JOBS Act builds on earlier efforts by the S.E.C. to loosen the rules governing I.P.O.'s of foreign companies. Under pressure from stock exchanges and other market players, the agency has exempted foreign issuers like Manchester United from large parts of American securities laws.
Manchester United will not need to file quarterly reports, report material events, file proxy statements or disclose extensive compensation information, all of which American companies must do. Under a different S.E.C. rule adopted in 2008, Manchester United also does not need to report financials under the generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States, but can instead rely on international financial reporting standards.
Because Manchester United will be a controlled company, it does not need to follow the New York Stock Exchange rules adopted in 2003 that require a public company to have a board composed mainly of independent directors. The board of Manchester United will have four directors, two of Malcolm Glazer's sons and two executives of the company.
The legal environment, which investment bankers and lawyers have long argued deterred I.P.O.'s, also appears to be more conducive. This may be because securities litigation reforms put in place by Congress and the Supreme Court have meant fewer cases in recent years. Even after the financial crisis, only 16 companies on the Standard & Poor's 500 were subject to this type of litigation in 2011, the lowest number since 2000, according to the Stanford Securities Class Action Clearinghouse.
It's all a bit unsettling.
After the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002, critics claimed that the new regulation was driving away foreign companies, although at least one academic study rebutted this claim. But as regulators have slowly loosened the rules, the American markets are attracting foreign issuers seeking watered-down rules.
This does not mean that this deregulation is wrongheaded.
The JOBS Act and other initiatives may not have been designed to attract the likes of Manchester United, but such I.P.O.'s do provide work for investment bankers, lawyers and the exchanges. They also build up American prestige by bringing well-known foreign companies to the United States.
At the same time, the deregulation effort means lower compliance costs for businesses. Presumably, that extra money can be invested, bolstering the economy.
The question is whether deregulation is worth the price.
I have little sympathy for investors who buy Manchester United shares. The risks are mainly disclosed.
The bigger question is whether lowering the bar for foreign issuers will come back to haunt the American markets.
Even before the JOBS Act, Chinese companies took advantage of new S.E.C. rules and started going public en masse in the United States. While some of the I.P.O.'s have worked out, there are now more than 100 newly public Chinese companies facing accusations of fraud by either investors or regulators.
The risk is that American exchanges will become more like London's Alternative Investment Market, a lightly regulated stock exchange that has fostered some spectacular flops. If so, investors may lose faith in American markets, and the United States may end up sacrificing long-term stature for short-term gain.
Either way, the next time someone calls the American markets overregulated, you might want to point them to the Manchester United I.P.O. - and remind them that the English soccer club came to the United States to avoid more burdensome foreign rules.
An earlier version of this column misstated the year that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act became law. It was in 2002, not 2001.

HEADLINE: AerCap Stock Soars on Takeover Rumors

BYLINE: JANET MORRISSEY


HIGHLIGHT: An analyst says the aircraft leasing giant AerCap could fetch as much as a 50 percent premium in any takeover. 

 BODY:
Shares of the aircraft leasing giant AerCap soared Tuesday on rumors that the company has hired an investment bank, Goldman Sachs, to explore strategic alternatives - including the possible sale of the company.
In a note to investors, Gary Liebowitz, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo, said that the company would likely fetch at least $17 a share in a takeover, which represents more than a 50 percent premium to its stock's closing price on Monday of $11.15. The high premium is based on the company's current valuation and premiums paid for other recent transactions in the industry, he said.
The company, based in Amsterdam, is an independent aircraft leasing firm with a fleet of 350 aircraft and offices in the Netherlands, the United States, China, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. It leases planes to major airlines, including American Airlines, Aeroflot and Singapore Airlines. 
Analysts have long speculated that the company is deeply undervalued. Mr. Liebowitz estimates AerCap's current book value at about $16.75, and another $2 to $3 a share in "hidden" book value as a result of what he describes as the understatement of aircraft values compared with current appraisal levels. 
Mr. Liebowitz noted that the Royal Bank of Scotland sold its aircraft leasing company, RBS Aviation, in January to a consortium led by Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group for $7.3 billion, which represented a premium to its book value, in a deal also handled by Goldman. 
If similar math was applied to an AerCap deal, the firm's sale would likely give shareholders at least $17 a share, he says. 
AerCap's shares shot up Tuesday on the rumors, with shares trading about 14 percent higher as of mid-afternoon on heavy volume. 
An AerCap spokesman was not immediately available for comment.
Aircraft leasing companies have taken a hit in the markets over investor concerns about the world economy, particularly in Europe where many of their customers are located.
About 38 percent of AerCap's revenue comes from Europe and 39 percent from the Asia/Pacific and Russian markets, while the rest is derived from other parts of the world. Rising oil prices also has been affecting AerCap's lessees, the airlines, directly.
AerCap is the latest firm hoping to cash in on the heightened RBS Aviation valuations. In February, Oaktree Capital Management retained Deutsche Bank to field offers for a start-up leasing firm, Jackson Square Aviation.

HEADLINE: Romney Criticizes Obama's Tax Plan

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Campaigning in Colorado on Tuesday, Mitt Romney sought to turn the Obama campaign's assertion, that he had helped outsource jobs while at Bain Capital, back on the president. 

 BODY:
GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. - Amid calls to respond more aggressively to attacks from President Obama, Mitt Romney addressed some of the charges head on at a town hall here on Tuesday, and lit into the president for his call on Monday to extend the Bush-era tax cuts by one year for those making up to $250,000.
"But this week, the president added insult to injury with another kick in the gut by announcing that he has a plan, he said, to lower taxes," Mr. Romney said, before accusing Mr. Obama of also announcing a "massive tax increase" for small businesses. "And the idea, I mean, the very idea of raising taxes on small business and job-creators at the very time we need more jobs is the sort of thing only an extreme liberal could come up with."
Some of Mr. Romney's donors and supporters have not only been upset with what they viewed as his overall less-than-aggressive posture, but with his inability to counter the "carrots" - like an extension of the Bush-era tax cuts - that Mr. Obama, behaving increasingly like a candidate locked in a tough re-election fight, has been offering voters.
"This old-style liberalism of bigger and bigger government and bigger and bigger taxes has got to end, and we will end it in November," Mr. Romney said.
Mr. Romney, in his prepared remarks, for the first time sought to turn the Obama campaign's assertion, that he had helped outsource jobs during his time at Bain Capital, back on the president.
"By the way, he likes to talk about outsourcing," Mr. Romney said. "He's run some interesting attack ads on me on that topic. You may have seen that."
Mr. Romney said that an independent fact-checking organization found the president's advertisements "false and misleading," before returning fire and accusing Mr. Obama of outsourcing himself.
"It is interesting that when it comes to outsourcing that this president has been outsourcing a good deal of American jobs himself by putting money into energy companies, solar and wind energy companies, that end up making their products outside the United States," Mr. Romney said. "If there's an outsourcer in chief, it's the president of the United States, not the guy who's running to replace him."
In recent days, Mr. Obama's campaign has begun a concerted effort to portray Mr. Romney as wealthy and out-of-touch, trying to raise questions about funds he had in the Cayman Islands and a corporation in Bermuda, as well as calling on him to release more years of his tax returns. (Mr. Romney has released only his 2010 tax returns and put out an estimate for his 2011 returns).
Mr. Romney, however, has preferred to keep his focus on the economy and largely ignored the Obama campaign's questions. On Tuesday, during the town hall portion of his event, a voter stood up and offered a version of the Romney campaign's argument.
"So why do the Obama team and the liberal media want us to think that we should be more angry with what you do with your money than what Obama has done with mine?" the voter said, to applause.
"I'm not going to apologize for success at home, and I'm not going to apologize for America abroad," Mr. Romney said. "And yeah, I went out and began a business, and the business turned out to be far more successful than I ever would have imagined - and by the way, the profits from the business overwhelmingly went to the people who invested with us."
Question topics at the town hall event ranged from education to who deserves liberty, but one subject at the front of voters' minds seemed to be Mr. Romney's search for a vice president. One man asked if Mr. Romney planned to announce his pick before or after the Republican convention.
"I, uh, yes," Mr. Romney joked, before saying he could not provide "the timeline" or "the individual," but that the person he chose would be "a person who could be president if that were necessary, and that for me is the most important single criteria."
Another man stood to give some unsolicited advice: "We need a fighter out there. I've been listening to Allen West talk," the voter said, referring to the Florida congressman. "He'd make a great vice president. He's a fighter, and that's what we want."
Mr. Romney politely thanked the man, adding that, "All suggestions are welcome."

HEADLINE: July 10: Romney Edges Up After Busy Poll Day

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: With five national polls out on Tuesday, and three in crucial swing states, Mitt Romney has a 33.9 percent chance of winning the Electoral College, up from 32.8 percent on Monday. 

 BODY:
With five national polls out on Tuesday, and three in crucial swing states, we've finally moved out of the poll doldrums. This data tells a somewhat ambiguous story. But our model, in sorting through everything, has Mitt Romney slightly improving his position. He's up to a 33.9 percent chance of winning the Electoral College, from 32.8 percent on Monday.
To be sure, President Obama got his share of good news, in particular a poll showing him eight points ahead in Virginia. But that poll comes from a firm, Public Policy Polling, that has frequently shown good results for Mr. Obama, so it's more of a ground-rule double for him than a home run.
Knowing something about a pollster's partisan lean is important when picking through the numbers on day like Tuesday. Public Policy Polling, for instance, had Mr. Obama up by one point in another survey it conducted in North Carolina. Rasmussen Reports had Mr. Romney up by one in Florida.
When you account for each polling firm's "house effect," however, the difference actually reverses itself. Public Policy Polling surveys have been four to five points more favorable to Mr. Obama so far this cycle than those from Rasmussen Reports, which has Republican-leaning results. That means being behind by one point in the Rasmussen poll was actually a more favorable data point for Mr. Obama than being up by one in the Public Policy Polling survey of North Carolina -- which makes sense since Florida is normally the easier state for the Democratic candidate to win.
Still, the real action was in national polls. On average, the five national polls released on Tuesday (counting the national tracking polls) showed an exact tie between the candidates. It's still too soon to tell how meaningful the pattern is, but that's certainly a better result for Mr. Romney than national polls conducted in late June, which had tended to give Mr. Obama about a three-point edge.
If Mr. Romney needed a tiebreaker, he got one in the form of a fairly steep decline in the stock market, one of the variables our model uses to calibrate its economic index. There wasn't much in the way of U.S. economic data released on Tuesday, but investors are growing more concerned about Spain's debt problems.
Bottom line: Tuesday was not a day that lends itself to elegant narratives about the race. But if Mr. Obama scores one point for the Virginia poll, Mr. Romney gets two: one for his reasonably favorable results in national polls and another for the economic index's moving downward.

HEADLINE: Mitt's Summer Reading Assignment

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: If he hasn't already, Romney should pick up Colin Dueck's history of Republican foreign policy, "The Big Short" by Michael Lewis - and Bill Clinton's autobiography. 

 BODY:
Last week, on the assumption that neither he nor Mitt Romney has anything better to do between now and the conventions, I offered a summer reading assignment to President Obama. Now it's the Republican nominee's turn to get his recommended reading.
Let's start with a book about foreign policy, traditionally an area of Republican strength but not - barring unexpected events - this time around. The Republican Party's reputation for competence is still damaged by the Iraq era, Osama Bin Laden is leagues deep in the Indian Ocean and President Obama's overall foreign policy stewardship, while not without its blunders, hasn't produced any catastrophes significant enough to make Americans nostalgic for the Bush era. Hence the flailing quality to Romney's foreign policy rhetoric: He's relying on what was once a reliable script, accusing a liberal president of weakening America, but this time only his own base is listening.
Since that script isn't working, maybe a little more care and subtlety is in order - and Romney will find it in "Hard Line," a history of Republican foreign policy since World War II by Colin Dueck, an associate professor of public and international affairs at George Mason University. Beneath the Republican Party's various divisions over the years, Dueck argues, there has always been an enduring unity: A commitment to American nationalism, "hawkish and intense," that has sought the strongest possible military and the freest possible hand for American power. At the same time, though, Republicans have given their presidents a great deal of leeway to define what this nationalism requires - realism or neoconservatism, saber-rattling or negotiation, pre-emptive war in Iraq or disengagement from Vietnam and Korea.
As a proud nationalist (and would-be Republican president), Romney will find aspects of this narrative congenial. He should be challenged, though, by Dueck's view of what the Republican Party needs now: The continued defense of American primacy, he writes, requires "a new conservative realism in foreign policy," which "adjusts for some of the political and policy failings of the Bush years" by recognizing the limits to our power and treading carefully in areas where too-rash action might make those limits manifest once again.
Romney's preference, so far, has been to behave as though the Bush-era failings never happened, which in one reason why his messaging is mostly falling on deaf ears. Not that a smarter message is likely to turn foreign policy into a big electoral winner for the Republicans this year. But reading Dueck might at least help Romney flail a little less.
Reading Michael Lewis's "The Big Short," meanwhile, might help Romney understand why his own financial successes are regarded by many voters with suspicion rather than respect. The Bain Capital founder has seemed, at times, almost touchingly confused as to why his rivals (Republican as well Democratic) have been keen to harp on his business career, and to use what Romney has called "the bitter politics of envy" against him.
Lewis's depiction of the financial meltdown could remedy this confusion. To grasp why so many middle class Americans are cool to his persona and achievements, Romney needs to see the 21st century economy the way they see it - as an arena in which, as Lewis puts it, "the line between gambling and investing is artificial and thin." No mere book is likely to persuade a successful investor like Romney to with this perception, since he will obviously continue to regard his fortune as earned rather than merely won. But because Lewis doesn't have a political ax to grind, the story that "The Big Short" tells so well - in which a small group of investors profit wildly by betting against the bad decisions made by a much larger group of rich investors, even as the rest of us go bust - might at least help Romney recognize why so many voters see the world this way.
Understanding anti-business sentiment isn't sufficient to address it: For that Romney needs empathy - and policies. In a previous column, I recommended another book, "A Capitalism For the People," by the University of Chicago economist Luigi Zingales, to assist the Republican nominee on the policy front. For empathy, though, he should consider learning from the master - which means picking up Bill Clinton's "My Life" and rereading every page that relates to the 1992 election.
The '92 campaign bears an obvious resemblance to 2012, and you can tell that the Romney campaign thinks it is imitating Clinton's "it's the economy, stupid" approach to unseating an unpopular incumbent. But Clinton did two big things that Romney hasn't done: He successfully distanced himself from many of the things that Americans didn't like about his party (by being tough on crime, promising to "end welfare as we know it," etc.) and he made the election a referendum, not just on the economy itself, but on his opponent's detachment from the struggles of the middle class.
In 2012, it's Romney who seems detached and calculating, whether he's stumbling into gaffes about his own wealth or assuring an interviewer, as he did last week, that "as long as I continue to speak about the economy, I'm going to win." That sounds like it could be a quote from Tom Dewey in the summer of 1948.
He can't Clinton, obviously: Romney would look like a fool if he tried to make his lip quiver, or drawled about feeling people's pain. But politicians can imitate without impersonating, and by studying the memoirs of our 42nd president, he might find some insights that make his own path to the White House a little smoother.

HEADLINE: Having Lost the Health Care Battle, the N.F.I.B. Readies for a Long War

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Acknowledging that full repeal is a long shot, the group seems to have settled on a less ambitious course of stripping the law of the elements it considers most odious. 

 BODY:
Now that the Supreme Court has largely upheld the Affordable Care Act, what is the next move for the lead plaintiff in the suit to repeal the law? This, of course, is the National Federation of Independent Business, the small-business trade association, and while the N.F.I.B. might have found much to like in the Affordable Care Act - the whole notion of insurance exchanges where small companies could compare and then buy insurance coverage for their employees was taken directly from a bill that the federation helped write - it in fact found much more to dislike. Nothing is likely to happen before the election this November, said the federation's chief executive, Dan Danner, but the group is already preparing its Plan B - and Plan C.
The group's preferred outcome, full repeal of the health care law, does not require a change in election strategy, because the federation was likely to be supporting Republicans hostile to the health law anyway. But Mr. Danner acknowledged that full repeal was a long shot, and he seemed to have settled on a less ambitious course of stripping the law of what the N.F.I.B views as its most odious elements. "I think there's growing sensitivity on both sides of the aisle to some of the things in the legislation that without total repeal could be changed," Mr. Danner said.
To that end, he said, the group planned to spend the next four months pressuring candidates for Congress - Democrats and Republicans alike. For example, referring to the individual mandate, Mr. Danner rehearsed a question the group planned to pose to a Democratic senator in a very tight race for re-election: "Claire McCaskill, you're running for the Senate in Missouri, now that it's clear that we're talking about a tax, are you O.K. with that, this enormous new tax on largely the middle class and young people?" Mr. Danner said his group planned to question "pretty much everybody that's running." (Ms. McCaskill's office did not respond to a request for an answer to the N.F.I.B.'s question.)
Mr. Danner said the mandate would affect the federation's self-employed members - about 16 percent of the group's membership, according to Kevin Kuhlman, a manager for legislative affairs at the federation. Mr. Kuhlman added that the mandate would force other small business owners who could not afford insurance to buy it. "It diverts potential investment in a business to a product," he said. However, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation have estimated that in 2016 only four million people will have to pay the government for refusing to buy insurance, and many of these people would be upper-income.
Apart from seeing the individual mandate removed, the organization would like to repeal an annual fee on health insurers that Senate Democrats drafted to help pay for the overhaul. The provision, which the N.F.I.B. describes as a tax, will raise at least $87.4 billion from 2014 to 2020. "The tax will primarily be on health care plans in the small group market, where our guys are," he said, "so we're pretty confident that that $87 billion gets passed directly down to the small businesses purchasing health care." The Congressional Budget Office has also said that insurers will pass the cost of the fee to customers in premiums. Large companies typically self-insure, and self-insurance is excluded from the fee. (On the other hand, Jason Furman, an economic adviser to the Obama administration, points out that the C.B.O. has also predicted that exchanges paid for in part by the fee should actually make health insurance cheaper for small businesses by reducing administrative costs and increasing competition among insurers.)
And the group plans to push other changes. "We'd still like to see expanded, not diminished, use of health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts, because they're largely taken off the table in the law," Mr. Danner said. And "something that hasn't been addressed in the law, and we'd like to sure see added, because it goes directly to costs, is medical malpractice reform."
At the same time, employees at the Health and Human Services Department who are defining the health care law's essential benefits packages will continue to hear from federation lobbyists. The law requires the Health and Human Services Department to stipulate the minimum benefits for all plans in the individual and small group markets, and Mr. Danner said the federation is worried about additional coverage requirements that could drive up costs for employers. "It makes a great deal of difference if that's all the bells and whistles," said Mr. Danner. "The companies don't get to decide, unfortunately, what they provide. H.H.S. will decide that."
And the federation will be active in every state capital, too, because state governments are charged with setting up the law's insurance exchanges, one for individuals and one for small businesses. "Clearly in a lot of the states, things were somewhat on hold pending this decision, and now things probably move more quickly," Mr. Danner said. "We have a great deal of concern about how the exchanges are going to be set up, and if in fact they're going to offer lots of choices and lower costs for small business."
However, several Republican governors have said that they would at least wait until after the election to make a decision on whether to set up exchanges - where states do not create an exchange, the federal government was slated to do it for them - Mr. Kuhlman said later that the organization was not taking a stand on when, or whether, a state should begin work on its exchanges.
Mr. Danner said his organization hadn't t figured out what precisely it wanted in the exchanges. "We don't have a blueprint of how you should set up every state exchange," he continued. "But I think what we do want is a seat at the table as these are being set up in all the states, and we'll push pretty hard to have that."

PERSON: Donald D. Kummerfeld 

HEADLINE: Donald D. Kummerfeld, Crisis Budgeter, Dies at 78

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Donald D. Kummerfeld, a budget director and first deputy mayor whose insistence on financial discipline and deft political touch helped steer New York City away from the brink of bankruptcy in the 1970s, died on Thursday in Jersey City. He was 78.
He had become ill while gardening in intense heat and died in a hospital emergency room, his wife, Elizabeth, said. 
In 1975, financial markets slammed their doors on New York City after years of excessive borrowing, and New York State stepped in to issue bonds to keep the city running. In return, the state demanded financial stringency. Mr. Kummerfeld's role was to attend to the details of cleaning up the city's sloppy accounting practices, enforcing budget cuts and for the first time extending financial planning years into the future.
Richard Ravitch, an aide to Gov. Hugh L. Carey during the crisis, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that Mr. Kummerfeld's job was to say, ''If you want to have a balanced budget, this is what you have to do.''
Mr. Kummerfeld brought to the task years of experience as a budget official in Washington and as an investment banker on Wall Street. But those who worked with him say his negotiating ability matched his expertise with numbers. The New York Times in 1977 quoted an official who had dealt with him as saying:
''The thing I like about Don is that at least he doesn't try to pretend. Even when he's put in the position of having to act like 2 and 2 is 5, you can say, 'Don, please,' and he'll look at you and shrug and say, 'Yes, but this is our policy here.' ''
In an interview, Felix Rohatyn, who headed the agency in charge of restructuring the city's debt during the crisis, said, ''What he brought to the table was great knowledge of both the facts and the politics of the situation.''
His firmness did not necessarily make him popular. News accounts at the time told of agency heads emerging in tears after meeting with Mr. Kummerfeld. At one public hearing he was accused of ''heartlessness.''
But the strong medicine worked, and by 1977 the city was beginning to turn a corner. ''It's not always obvious, but the city is managing itself now, largely due to Kummerfeld,'' Peter C. Goldmark Jr., the state budget director, told The Times.
Donald David Kummerfeld was born on June 11, 1934, in Gilroy, Calif., and grew up on a 5,000-acre farm, rising before dawn to milk the cows. He rode a bus 24 miles to school and did his homework by flashlight, because the sun was not yet up.
He earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy and a master's in political science from Stanford, and a master's in public administration from Harvard. After a fellowship at the London School of Economics, he worked in Washington as a budget official in the administrations of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. In 1968-69, he was staff director at the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research group.
In 1969 he co-founded the Government Research Company, which started The National Journal as a nonpartisan magazine on politics and policy. From 1971 to 1975 he worked for the First Boston Corporation (now part of Credit Suisse) in public finance, advising states and cities on bond borrowing.
He went to City Hall in January 1976, having been recruited by John E. Zucotti, first deputy mayor in Abraham D. Beame's administration. The two had worked together in Washington.
''It would be hard to exaggerate what a difficult job Don faced when he started out,'' Mr. Zucotti told The Times in 1977. After Mr. Zucotti returned to private legal practice in April 1977, Mr. Kummerfeld succeeded him as first deputy mayor.
When Edward I. Koch, after defeating Mr. Beame and other candidates in the Democratic primary and three challengers in the general election, became mayor on Jan. 1, 1978, he asked Mr. Kummerfeld to stay on as deputy mayor, but without the title of first deputy. Mr. Kummerfeld refused.
Mr. Koch explained in an interview on Tuesday that he had decided not to have a first deputy mayor because he wanted New Yorkers to see that he was personally leading the city. ''He would have been wonderful,'' Mr. Koch said of Mr. Kummerfeld, calling him ''a true hero who helped save New York.''
Mr. Kummerfeld instead accepted an appointment by Governor Carey to be executive director of the New York State Emergency Financial Control Board. That meant that Mr. Kummerfeld would oversee the city financial operations he had just left. ''I certainly know all the details of what to look for,'' he said.
Mr. Kummerfeld went on to head Rupert Murdoch's American holding company and two trade groups, the Magazine Publishers of America and the International Federation of the Periodical Press. He also advised New York mayors and other elected officials on fiscal matters.
A citizens' task force led by Mr. Ravitch and Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, will release a report next week on the budget crisis states now face. It will be dedicated to Mr. Kummerfeld, who did much work on it.
In addition to his wife, the former Elizabeth Miller, Mr. Kummerfeld, who lived in Jersey City, is survived by his daughter, Theodosia Kummerfeld, and a grandson.
Along with public service, gardening was Mr. Kummerfeld's passion, and for many years he grew vegetables and flowers on the terrace of his Fifth Avenue penthouse. His hobby was reading seed catalogs.

A&E STAKE BUYBACK Comcast said on Tuesday that its NBC Universal subsidiary had agreed to sell its 15.8 percent stake in A&E Television Networks for $3 billion. 
A&E will most likely buy back the stake with a cash payment, although it may also opt to pay with cash and a note. The money for the transaction will be provided by its remaining owners, the Walt Disney Company and the Hearst Corporation. MICHAEL J. de la MERCED
LIBOR FALLOUT The Barclays settlement over the manipulation of benchmark interest rates may prove to be, in the words of Winston Churchill, ''the end of the beginning,'' as more banks face official investigations.
An important issue will be whether any criminal charges will result against senior officers involved in the scandal. That may hinge on whether prosecutors are able -- and willing -- to look beyond the reports from internal investigations conducted by the banks. PETER J. HENNING
AIRCRAFT DEAL The American aircraft manufacturer Hawker Beechcraft has entered discussions with Superior Aviation Beijing of China to sell itself for $1.79 billion. Hawker Beechcraft, which is jointly owned by Goldman Sachs and the Onex Corporation, said the deal would combine the company's existing operations in the United States with those of Superior Aviation Beijing in China. MARK SCOTT
AERCAP IN PLAY Shares of the aircraft leasing giant AerCap soared on Tuesday on rumors that the company had hired the investment bank Goldman Sachs to explore strategic alternatives -- including the possible sale of the company.
In a note to investors, Gary Liebowitz, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo, said the company would probably fetch at least $17 a share in a takeover, which represents more than a 50 percent premium to its closing price on Monday of $11.15. The company, based in Amsterdam, is an independent aircraft leaser with a fleet of 350 aircraft.

HEADLINE: A Clean New Life for Grimy Gas Stations

BYLINE: By RONDA KAYSEN

 BODY:
HIGH FALLS, N.Y. -- The gas station in this Hudson Valley hamlet sat empty for years, leaching petroleum into the soil and well water. But a renovation that will transform the abandoned station into a yoga studio, wellness center and a charging station for electric cars has turned the eyesore into a symbol of this struggling community's revival.
The station's decline mirrors that of many others across the country.
Thousands of gas stations have closed in the last two decades, leaving many communities saddled with vacant or abandoned properties. Because gas stations are often built on busy street corners, boarded-up stations have marred the entrances to many bustling business districts in American towns and cities. 
More than 50,000 stations have closed since 1991 when there were nearly 200,000 nationwide, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores.
The high cost of oil has made it hard to turn a profit selling gas, pushing station owners into selling snacks and soda at their convenience stores. With big-box retailers like Walmart and Costco now in the gas business, attracting customers has become even harder. Simply put, mom and pop stations that once thrived just by selling gas and fixing cars in the repair shop can no longer compete.
No numbers are available on how many closed stations remain vacant, but despite problems, the properties can be attractive to developers, especially if they are at desirable intersections.
''If you own the real estate, there's no better time to get out -- everybody wants that convenient location,'' said Jeff Lenard, a spokesman for the convenience store association. ''You could be sitting on a gold mine.''
But converting these sites can be challenging. They often are on small lots and may be contaminated by petroleum leaking from underground storage tanks, as was the case in High Falls.
Petroleum brownfields -- ground contaminated or thought to be contaminated by fuel -- make up half of the 450,000 brownfields in the country, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. As gas stations close, towns must grapple with what to do with this land. If fuel has migrated into groundwater or a neighboring lot, costs can balloon.
State and federal money available to municipalities to clean abandoned sites is limited. Federal regulations require private owners and operators to clean any spills on their property. Still, some developers are reluctant to buy old stations because of the risk that contamination could be found later and they would be stuck with the cleanup bill.
''Gas stations are the gateway to a community,'' said Robert Colangelo executive director of the National Brownfield Association. ''So it's very important to get these things cleaned up.''
In High Falls, a $300,000 renovation is changing a derelict structure to a colonial-style strip of yellow storefronts with white trim that will be completed this summer. Then, charging pumps for electric cars will be installed where two gas pumps once stood. The quick-charge pumps will offer free charging to store customers and anyone else. A wind turbine affixed to a 30-foot ledge behind the station and solar panels atop the ledge will generate the electricity.
The five service bays have been converted to shops, and the garage doors replaced with storefront windows. The second floor has been turned into 2,200 square feet of office space offering views of the nearby falls. ''People who come to a town like this, they're looking for a memory to take home with them,'' said Mark Robinson, who owns the property with Ronald F. Faia. ''I've always loved old gas stations,'' he added. ''It's a view into American history.''
In a village that once was home to Marc Chagall and the setting for some scenes in ''Splendor in the Grass'' a former neighborhood blight has become a new downtown center.
''It's so nice. It's part of the revitalization of High Falls,'' said Michael Warren, town supervisor for Marbletown, which encompasses the hamlet.
But it is not always easy to persuade developers to invest in a property that may need costly environmental cleanup. The High Falls station cost the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation more than $100,000 to clean up in 2001, seven years before Mr. Robinson bought it.
''Whenever you see a for sale sign, it never says 'brownfields for sale,' '' Mr. Colangelo said.
While rural communities struggle to fill empty stations, New York City has a different problem. Property values are so high that stations are being converted to more profitable uses, like high-rise buildings, giving drivers fewer places to fill their tanks. The city had 809 gas stations in 2011, down from 872 in 2006, according to the Department of Consumer Affairs. Of the remaining gas stations, only 44 are in Manhattan.
In 2009, Eyal Shuster, a developer, spent $1 million to convert a defunct Long Island City service station into the Breadbox Cafe, which his wife, Tal, manages. A Getty gas station next door, however, is still operating. Mr. Shuster and his development partner, Moshe Mizrahi, hope to eventually build a high-rise building above the restaurant and demolish the Getty gas station.
On a rainy afternoon in June, the 48-seat restaurant was full of customers. From the street, the boxy single-story building still resembles a service station, despite the quirky addition of 1,600 rolling pins on the facade. New garage doors with large glass panes roll back, opening out onto a wooden patio. Inside, zinc countertops and mahogany paneling give the space a modern look.
''The main challenge is changing people's perception,'' said the restaurant's architect, Eran Chen, a principal at ODA-Architecture. ''How do you create an attractive food space in a place that used to service cars?''
While gas stations might be an eyesore in some communities, in others they are treasured slices of Americana. A St. Louis developer met fierce resistance when he considered demolishing a 1968 Phillips 66 station. The building has an enormous flying saucer-shaped roof. Although it has not been a gas station since the 1980s -- its latest incarnation was as a Del Taco restaurant that closed in 2011 -- residents saw the building as a piece of the city's architectural history.
Rather than build anew, the developer Richard K. Yackey will begin a $1 million renovation this month on the property, which has 3,200 square feet of usable space. The roof, which is 12,000 square feet, will cost $100,000 to replace. When construction is complete next year, the station will house a Chipotle restaurant and a Starbucks and have a 1,300 square feet addition.
''If you do the math, it doesn't make a lot of sense economically,'' Mr. Yackey said, adding that constructing a building on the property would have provided him with more space to lease.
Because many old gas stations sit on small, three-quarter-acre lots, they often have to be expanded to be marketable. Buyers of old stations often angle to get the neighboring lot. But that, too, can be fraught with complications.
''Any time you're putting multiple parcels together it becomes more difficult because you're dealing with another seller,'' said Joseph S. Botta, president of Pineville Properties, which has redeveloped several gas stations in the Philadelphia area.
In Roxborough, a section of northwest Philadelphia, developers drew the ire of local residents when they knocked down two houses next to a former Mobil gas station to make way for a TD Bank that opened last November.
''Neighbors get very concerned when you're knocking down residential houses for commercial uses,'' said Michael J. Cooley, vice president of real estate for the Provco Group, which built the bank.
But developers who cannot expand can be left with a property they cannot use. Mr. Botta said he bought eight gas stations from Lehigh Gas Corporation for $11.5 million in 2008. By June 2011, unable to expand the lots, he sold four back to Lehigh.
Mr. Botta said, ''When you have a small parcel and you can't acquire any ground, you can only build so much.''

HEADLINE: Farm Aid Concert Coming to Pennsylvania

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
Willie Nelson, Neil Young, John Mellencamp and Dave Matthews will be among the performers this year at the annual Farm Aid benefit concert, which will be held in Hersheypark Stadium in Hershey, Pa., on Sept. 22. 
Farm Aid has been held nearly every year since 1985 and has raised more than $40 million to help family farmers remain on their land. The event drew about 16,000 people last year in Kansas City, Kan. Its Farmer Resource Hotline network is now online and helps farmers find alternate sources of credit or specialized training.
''We've built a strong family farm movement to grow our economy, ensure our health and protect our environment,'' Mr. Nelson, the Farm Aid president, said in a statement. ''Farm Aid brings these Main Street values to transform the Wall Street-controlled farm and food system.''
Tickets for this year's show go on sale Friday. Also scheduled to perform are Jack Johnson, ALO, Pegi Young and the Survivors, and Lukas Nelson and Promise of the Real. The festival will feature Farm Aid's ''homegrown concessions'' which are family farm-identified, local and organic foods. Concertgoers will also have an opportunity to meet farmers and learn more about their work.

HEADLINE: Udi Erez

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Erez, 56, is the chief executive of the Elad Group and the chairman of Elad Canada.
The Elad Group, which is based in Manhattan, is an owner of the Plaza Hotel, and has developed or converted many other properties, including the O'Neill Building in Chelsea and 250 West Street in TriBeCa.
Interview conducted and condensed by 
VIVIAN MARINO
Q.You became C.E.O. of Elad about a year ago. What changes have you made or plan to make?
A. First of all, I decided to go for liquidation: to sell and have as much money as we can, and to reduce the leverage. We have done huge deals in Canada to sell income-producing properties: residential, commercial, shopping centers and office buildings. We sold at least 25 properties at more than $400 million. That was my first mission.
As a C.E.O., my job, as I see it, is to increase the value and to develop the business. That was the decision to invest here in the U.S. instead of Canada.
Second: to develop new sites in Manhattan, and also, to sell the Plaza was my recommendation.
Q.Why are you selling your stake in the Plaza?
A. We love the hotel, but now we have to kiss goodbye to the property.
Today the return on investment for the hotel and the condo hotel is low. It's fine to sit on a property like that. And I'm sure it's going only one way -- up -- because of the hotel, the location, the name and the history. But still for me we're going to have more than $200 million net cash flow from this deal. We can use that money in this economy.
Q.Let's talk a little bit about the deal.
A. It's not a firm commitment yet, but it's about to be. We are very close. We are about to close the deal with Sahara group -- it's one of the 10 biggest companies in India.
Q.How much would the deal be valued at?
A. $575 million. We bought it for $625 million, and then we invested in development, and then we sold the condos. But I tell you one thing for sure: one day they're going to learn about this deal in business school, because it was absolutely great.
Q.So you're pretty pleased with your return on investment there.
A. Yes, so now we make a little bit more, and we go on to the next project.
Q.What is the status of 250 West Street, your new TriBeCa condo?
A. We are about to finish 250 West. We're left with 21 units out of 106. The beginning of October, we are starting the occupancy.
Lately we've increased the price again -- almost five or six times since we started. We started at less than $1,500, on average, per square foot. And now it's more than $1,500. Of course some units are much more. So I believe the people who bought at the beginning already made a lot of money.
Q.What's your next New York project?
A. We are going to develop 22 Central Park South -- that's what we're calling, for now, the building beside the Plaza. You are the first one I'm telling. We got it when we bought the Plaza, and now we're going to develop that building. We're going to start renovating it in September and start selling it. We were waiting patiently; now is the right timing.
It's not a big project -- it's about 15,000 square feet -- but the location is good. It's eight floors; each floor will have one unit. It will have a full package of amenities and maybe we could use part of the Plaza amenities. We'll see. That's a direction that we are checking.
Q.Do you have anything else in the pipeline?
A. We are looking desperately to find another site in Manhattan. It's very important for us to develop in Manhattan.
We're looking at two sites now, and we are close to making a deal. This particular deal is a conversion of an office building, but we are checking an empty lot as well. It's in Lower Manhattan. I can't say specifically because we are bidding on that.
Q.Are you looking outside New York, too?
A. We did one deal in Chicago. We bought Sullivan Center there. And now we're checking another huge deal in Chicago. And there the return is like 8 or 10 percent.
And we have in Florida like 11,000 units residential all over -- in Miami, the southeast and southwest -- that we own. And we want a significant part of it to sell as income-producing residential. Three thousand units of those we bought to convert to condo and sell one by one and the rest maybe we'll sell it one-shot like a package of income-producing. I can feel positive change in Florida.
Q. What's the status of the New Frontier Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, which Elad bought for a record $1.2 billion five years ago?
A. They say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, so maybe I won't talk about it. No, but I have to if you ask.
It's an empty lot now. We paid a lot of money -- with expenses, $1.4 billion. The value now is much less, dramatically less. We lost money.
Q.Elad must have plenty of regrets getting involved in that deal.
A. We are going to build -- but not today -- when the market comes back.
If we look now at the deal, it doesn't look like the best deal ever. But at that time, who would know? It looked like a very good deal, because the location is perfect: it's across from the Wynn hotel, and has the best location of the street. But you cannot get new construction loans in Vegas.
We used to say for real estate: location, location, location. But now I learn to say three other words: timing, timing, timing.

HEADLINE: A Rule Sets Overhaul Of Wall St. In Motion

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
8:34 p.m. Updated
Regulators on Tuesday took a major step toward reining in risky Wall Street trading, approving new rules aimed at preventing a repeat of the financial crisis.
The rules, stemming from the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law, will give regulators more control over the $700 trillion derivatives industry, an opaque business that was blamed for many of the ills of the 2008 crisis. While regulators have spent more than two years retooling the sector, the latest reforms laid crucial building blocks for the remaining aspects of the Wall Street overhaul.
''Light will begin to shine on the markets for the first time,'' Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which approved the rules, said at a public meeting. ''This is a very significant day for the American public.'' But another member of the agency questioned whether last-minute changes undermined the new rules, allowing risk to seep back into the system. Bart Chilton, a Democratic commissioner who cast the lone vote against the plan, raised concerns that the fine print created loopholes wide enough for Wall Street to exploit. 
''There are lots of lawyers out there itching to find ways for their clients to get around Dodd-Frank,'' said Mr. Chilton, an outspoken advocate of regulation who had never before voted against a final Dodd-Frank rule.
The agency also approved, after months of frenetic corporate lobbying, a set of policies spelling out a crucial exemption from regulation. Under the plan, many nonfinancial companies and small banks are excused from certain provisions of Dodd-Frank. The carve-out, regulators say, excludes from some oversight about 30,000 manufacturers, gas companies and airlines, including companies like Ford.
Congress enacted Dodd-Frank nearly two years ago, for the first time mandating an overhaul of trading in swaps - the derivative contracts tied to the value of commodities, interest rates and mortgage securities. One form of derivatives, credit-default swaps, nearly toppled the giant insurer American International Group and deepened the financial crisis.
Under Dodd-Frank, big banks and other financial institutions must submit certain derivatives contracts to regulated clearinghouses, which serve as a backstop in case one party in the trade defaults.
But Wall Street was in a holding pattern until regulators took action on Tuesday. The new plan, which defined important derivatives terms - including ''swap'' - will now set in motion a cascade of other Dodd-Frank measures. The definitions underpin the law, ushering in rules that subject big banks like JPMorgan Chase to reporting requirements and capital standards. Some requirements will take effect about two months from now.
''There's no question this is an incredibly foundational rule for the industry,'' said Gabriel D. Rosenberg, a lawyer at Davis Polk, which represents some of the biggest names on Wall Street. ''The clock has started ticking and it's a clock with a very short fuse.''
The agency said its definitions would cover most known swaps contracts while excluding insurance products, so-called forward deals and consumer transactions, like contracts to buy home heating oil. The Securities and Exchange Commission unanimously approved a similar version of the plan last week.
''By finalizing these rules, we are completing the foundation of a new regulatory regime intended to reduce systemic risk and bring greater transparency to this multitrillion-dollar market,'' Mary L. Schapiro, the S.E.C.'s chairwoman, said in a statement.
But Mr. Chilton questioned whether the exclusions were overly broad, going beyond what the S.E.C. agreed to last week. Indeed, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission delayed its Tuesday meeting nearly an hour to negotiate a last-minute compromise over some minor details.
''One man's loophole is another man's livelihood,'' Mr. Chilton said.
Americans for Financial Reform, a group that supports Dodd-Frank, praised the agency's actions on Tuesday while noting that ''the rules do contain significant exemptions that are a threat to effective reform.''
Separately on Tuesday, the futures trading commission unanimously approved a broad exemption from the requirement that derivatives trades go through regulated clearinghouses.
It applies to ''commercial end users'' - like oil companies, airlines and other firms that use swaps to counteract risk associated with a potential swing in value of goods that they buy or manufacture. An airline, for instance, uses swaps to hedge against the fluctuating cost of jet fuel. Commercial companies also buy swaps to protect against jumps in interest rates.
Under the agency's final rule, swaps do not need to go through clearinghouses if at least one party in the trade is a ''nonfinancial'' entity and is using the swap to hedge against its ''commercial risk.'' The exempt firms must still alert regulators when they enter into swap transactions.
Regulators also extended the exemption to small banks and other financial firms outside the glare of Wall Street. The final rule allowed the firms with total assets of $10 billion or less to qualify for the end-user exception.
The approvals whittled down the futures trading agency's lengthy list of Dodd-Frank responsibilities. The C.F.T.C, Mr. Gensler said, has approved some 35 final rules and has about 15 remaining.
''Just by the math you can see we're quite a way into this,'' Mr. Gensler said. ''But I think it is critical we finish the job, protect the market and promote more transparent and healthier markets,'' he added.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Chicago Attracts New Towers With River Views

BYLINE: By ROBERT SHAROFF

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- Encouraged by reports of job creation and companies announcing plans to move back downtown, developers here have introduced plans for half a dozen new office towers in the Loop central business district.
They are the first new buildings to be proposed since the 2008 financial crash and are seen as a hopeful sign that the slump of the last few years is finally ending.
Although many of these projects have yet to secure financing and sign up tenants, at least two are set to break ground before the end of the year.
John Buck, a Chicago developer, said, ''I don't think there's a crying demand for five million square feet of new office space, but there may be room for one or two million square feet.'' He said that he had a project in the early stages of development but declined to discuss it. 
William Rogers, leader of the Tenant Representation Group of Jones Lang LaSalle in Chicago, said that for the projects that will be built, ''the question is, Who is going to get that first big anchor tenant?''
Two of the most interesting projects are River Point and Wolf Point, both to be located at the confluence of the north, south and east branches of the Chicago River in the northwest quadrant of the Loop.
River Point will be located on the west bank of the river at Lake Street, while Wolf Point will be on the north bank at Orleans Street. The River Point site has several small buildings and a large parking lot on it. The Wolf Point site is vacant. Both projects also involve the real estate company Hines of Dallas as co-developer.
Of all the announced projects, River Point is the furthest along, having recently closed on its roughly $400 million financing. In a sign of the uncertainty that still rattles the market here, the exact number of floors and amount of square footage remain unclear.
Kevin Shannahan, Hines's chief executive for Midwest operations, said the building would have 45 to 50 stories and 900,000 to 1.1 million square feet of space, depending on the success of leasing efforts.
The project, which includes a 1.5-acre public park along the river, will break ground by the end of the year and be finished in early 2016.
River Point is being described as the first speculative office building to go up downtown in more than 20 years. Mr. Shannahan, however, said he expected one or more anchor tenants to be in place by the time construction of the tower begins.
''It's about supply and demand,'' he said. ''Large contiguous blocks of space are becoming harder to find downtown.'' He added that ''Google, Groupon, Motorola and Microsoft are all in the market right now with very large space requirements.''
The building is being designed by Pickard Chilton Architects of New Haven, which also designed the last Chicago office tower that Hines built in 2009, 300 North LaSalle.
River Point has a dramatic concave glass facade that, according to the chief designer Anthony Markese, is meant to complement the convex facade of its neighbor across the river, 333 West Wacker Drive. (That building, designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox, was completed in 1983.)
River Point, said Mr. Markese, is ''a like-minded beautifully curving building that addresses the river but also provides a big bay window onto that view.''
Hines's partner at River Point is Ivanhoe Cambridge, the real estate division of a Canadian pension fund, Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec. One of the 10 largest real estate firms in the world, Ivanhoe is providing 85 percent of the project's financing.
Arthur Lloyd, executive vice president of Ivanhoe, said the rate of job growth in Chicago made the city an attractive investment opportunity. Mr. Shannahan, of Hines, estimated that about 10,000 new jobs were announced in 2011, and said, ''That's a great record for the downtown.''
Wolf Point is being developed by Hines, the Kennedy family and the Magellan Development Group of Chicago. The Kennedys have owned the site since the 1940s when the family patriarch Joseph P. Kennedy acquired the adjacent Merchandise Mart. (The family sold the Mart as well as the Apparel Center in 1998 to Vornado Realty Trust, where they remain stockholders.)
The project is being headed by Christopher Kennedy, a son of Robert F. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy moved to Chicago in the late 1980s to manage the family's local real estate interests and has since carved out a successful career as a developer.
Wolf Point is planned as a billion-dollar, three-tower residential and office complex that will take a decade to complete. The residential building, which will break ground this fall, will contain about 500 rental apartments aimed at young professionals. The office towers will follow in the next few years.
The completed project will have upward of three million square feet in residential and commercial space. The project's architects are Pelli Clark Pelli of New Haven and bKL Architecture of Chicago.
Mr. Kennedy said his family planned to continue to own the project. ''We have a long-hold philosophy and a commitment to the city that we think is one for the ages,'' he said. ''We're very comfortable here.''
All of the proposed office projects are betting to some degree on Mayor Rahm Emanuel's aggressive efforts to attract new business to the city. In the last few years, companies like United Airlines, Sara Lee and MillerCoors have all announced plans to relocate all or part of their operations to downtown Chicago. Most have also received public incentives like tax increment financing grants.
More recently, Google is reported to be close to announcing a lease for about 400,000 square feet of space in the Merchandise Mart. It would be used to house Google's recently acquired Motorola Mobility division.
Mr. Buck, the developer, said the trend of companies moving downtown was ''something I've dreamed about for 30 years. The rational place for office buildings is at the center of transportation networks, and in Chicago that's the Loop.''
Robert Wislow, chief executive of U.S. Equities Realty, a large real estate services firm here, said ease of recruitment was a major reason for relocating. ''The work force continues to shift to younger people and many of them -- particularly those in creative fields like marketing and advertising -- have made the choice to work and live downtown,'' he said.
He added that rents remained somewhat higher downtown but that, ''real estate is a very small portion of any company's operating expenses. Payroll is the highest. The cost of real estate pales in comparison to recruiting.''
Mr. Wislow's firm scored what is considered the leasing coup of the year this spring when it signed United Airlines to a long-term lease at the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower), the country's tallest building. United, which is relocating from a suburban office campus it has occupied for more than 40 years, is taking 16 floors in the tower for a total of about 800,000 square feet.
Kate Gebo, vice president for corporate real estate at United, said that management's desire for ''culture change'' was behind the move. Two factors were especially important in the decision. First was a desire to be closer to the firm's customers and partners. ''Boeing is now right down the street from us,'' she said. It also is a recruiting draw.

HEADLINE: Rate Scandal Stirs Scramble For Damages

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
As unemployment climbed and tax revenue fell, the city of Baltimore laid off employees and cut services in the midst of the financial crisis. Its leaders now say the city's troubles were aggravated by bankers' manipulation of a key interest rate linked to hundreds of millions of dollars the city had borrowed.
Baltimore has been leading a battle in Manhattan federal court against the banks that determine the interest rate, the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which serves as a benchmark for global borrowing and stands at the center of the latest banking scandal. Now cities, states and municipal agencies nationwide, including Massachusetts, Nassau County on Long Island, and California's public pension system, are looking at whether they suffered similar losses and are weighing legal action.
Dozens of lawsuits filed by municipalities, pension funds and hedge funds have been consolidated into a few related cases against more than a dozen banks that are involved in setting Libor each day, including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank and Barclays. Last month, Barclays admitted to regulators that it tried to manipulate Libor before and during the financial crisis in 2008, and paid $450 million to settle the charges. It said other banks were doing the same, but none of them have been accused of wrongdoing. 
Libor, a measure of how much banks must pay to borrow money from one another in the short term, is set through a daily poll of the banks.
The rate influences what consumers, businesses and investors pay on a wide range of financial contracts, as varied as mortgages and interest rate swaps. Barclays has said it and other banks understated the rate during the financial crisis to make themselves look healthier to the public, rather than to make more money from clients.
As regulators and lawmakers in Washington and Europe assess the depth of the Libor abuse and the failure to address it, economists and analysts are already predicting it could be one of the most expensive scandals to hit Wall Street since the financial crisis.
Governments and other investors may face many hurdles in proving damages. But Darrell Duffie, a professor of finance at Stanford, said he expected that their lawsuits alone could lead to the banks' paying out tens of billions of dollars, echoing numbers from a recent report by analysts at Nomura Equity Research.
American municipalities have been among the first to claim losses from the supposed rate-rigging, because many of them borrow money through investment vehicles that directly derive their value from Libor. Peter Shapiro, who advises Baltimore and other cities on their use of these investments, said that ''about 75 percent of major cities have contracts linked to this.''
If the banks submitted artificially low Libor rates during the financial crisis in 2008, as Barclays has admitted, it would have led cities and states to receive smaller payments from financial contracts they had entered with their banks, Mr. Shapiro said.
''Unambiguously, state and local government agencies lost money because of the manipulation of Libor,'' said Mr. Shapiro, who is managing director of the Swap Financial Group and is not involved in any of the lawsuits. ''The number is likely to be very, very big.''
The banks have declined to comment on the lawsuits, but their lawyers have asked for the cases to be dismissed in court filings, pointing to the many unusual factors that influenced Libor during the crisis.
The efforts to calculate potential losses are complicated by the fact that Libor is used to determine the cost of thousands of financial products around the globe each day. If Libor was artificially pushed down on a particular day, it would help people involved in some types of contracts and hurt people involved in others.
Securities lawyers say the lawsuits will not be easy to win because the investors will first have to prove that the banks successfully pushed down Libor for an extended period during the crisis, and then will have to demonstrate that it was down on the day when the bank calculated particular payments. In addition, investors may have to prove that the specific bank from which they were receiving their payment was involved in the manipulation. Before it even reaches the point of proving such subtleties, however, the banks could be compelled to settle the cases.
One of the major complaints was filed by several traders and hedge funds that entered into futures contracts that are traded through the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and that pay out based on Libor. These contracts were a popular way to protect against spikes in interest rates, but they would not have paid off as expected if Libor had been artificially lowered.
A 2010 study cited in the suit - conducted by professors at the University of California, Los Angeles and the University of Minnesota - indicated that Libor was significantly lower than it should have been throughout 2008 and was particularly skewed around the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.
A separate complaint filed in 2010 by the investment firm Charles Schwab asserts that some of its mutual funds, including popular ones like the Schwab Total Bond Market Fund, lost money on similar investments.
The complaints being voiced by municipalities are mostly related to their use of a popular financial contract known as an interest rate swap. States and cities generally enter into these swaps with specific banks so that they can borrow money in the bond market. They pay bondholders based on a floating interest rate - like an adjustable-rate mortgage - but end up paying their bankers a fixed rate through a swap. If Libor is artificially lowered, the municipality is stuck paying the same fixed rate, but it receives a smaller variable payment from its bank.
Even before the current controversy, some municipal activists have said that banks took advantage of the financial inexperience of municipal officials to sell them billions of dollars of interest rate swaps. Experts in municipal finance say that because of the particular way that cities and states borrow money, they are especially liable to lose out on their swaps if Libor drops.
Mr. Shapiro, who helps cities, states and companies negotiate these contracts, said that if a city had interest rate swaps on bonds worth $1 billion and Libor was artificially pushed down by 0.30 percent, which is what the lawsuits contend, that city would have lost $3 million a year. The lawsuit claims the manipulation occurred over three years. Barclays' settlement with regulators did not specify how much the banks' actions may have moved Libor.
In Nassau County, the comptroller, George Maragos, said in a statement that according to his own calculations, Libor manipulation may have cost the county $13 million on swaps related to $600 million of outstanding bonds.
A Massachusetts state official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of potential future legal actions, said the state was calculating its potential losses.
''We are deeply concerned and we are carefully analyzing all of our options,'' the official said.
Anne Simpson, a portfolio manager at the California Public Employees' Retirement System - the nation's largest pension fund - said that the fund's officials ''are sifting through the impact, but there certainly is an impact.''
In Baltimore, the city had Libor-based interest rate swaps on about $550 million of bonds, according to the city's financial report from 2008, the central year discussed in the lawsuit. The city's lawyers have declined to specify what they think Baltimore's losses were.
The city solicitor, George Nilson, said that the rate manipulation claims meant that the city lost out on money when it needed it the most.
''The injury we suffered during the time we suffered it hurt more because we were challenged budgetarily,'' Mr. Nilson said. ''Every dollar we lost due to illegal conduct was a dollar we couldn't pay to keep open recreation centers or to pay police officers.''

HEADLINE: Understanding Libor

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
The London interbank offered rate, more commonly known as Libor, is one of the most important numbers in the financial world. But until the Barclays scandal, it received scant public attention. Here is a primer.
Q.
What is Libor?
A.
Libor is the average interest rate at which banks can borrow from each other. London is mentioned in its name because the benchmark is set in that city. 
Essentially, Libor is one of the main rates used to determine the borrowing costs for trillions of dollars in loans. Interest rates on some mortgages, student loans and credit card accounts go up or down when Libor moves. Often the rates are adjusted annually or quarterly, rather than every day.
Q.
Why was Libor created, and by whom?
A.
In the early 1980s, banks started looking for a standard benchmark to calculate the prices on an array of financial products, and the British Bankers Association, an industry trade group, began publishing Libor on Jan. 1, 1986.
The idea was that instead of constantly haggling over the interest rates that would be charged for different types of loans, banks would have a uniform benchmark. There are actually 150 different Libor rates published every day. They cover 10 currencies and 15 maturities.
Q.
How is Libor calculated?
A.
For United States-dollar-denominated Libor, more than a dozen banks - including Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Barclays, UBS of Switzerland and others - estimate how much interest they would pay to borrow money on a short-term basis from other institutions. While the process is still overseen by the British Bankers Association, the calculations are now performed by Thomson Reuters.
Thomson Reuters discards the four highest and four lowest submissions as outliers, and averages the remaining ones.
The data provider then publishes its calculations, generally around 11:30 a.m. London time, along with each bank's submissions. On Tuesday, the three-month United States dollar Libor rate, one of the most common Libor metrics, stood at 0.4576 percent. During the financial crisis of 2008, that rate rose to nearly 5 percent. At the time, banks considered lending to each other much riskier, and thus wouldn't lend unless they got a high interest rate in return.
Q.
What are examples of how Libor is used?
A.
Banks often ask borrowers to pay Libor plus an added amount of interest, reflecting the credit risk of the borrower.
Many mortgage lenders in the United States rely on Libor to determine the interest rates they charge for adjustable-rate mortgages. Typically, an adjustable-rate mortgage might be 2 to 3 percentage points over the six-month Libor rate.
Big corporations with strong credit typically would pay roughly 1 percentage point or less over Libor because they are considered safer bets than individual mortgage borrowers.
Q.
How has Libor's use evolved over time?
A.
Libor was primarily created as a benchmark for banks to determine borrowing costs - and it is largely used in the same manner today, albeit for a broader group of financial products. For instance, many banks now used Libor to set the prices on derivatives, the complicated financial instruments tied to commodities, interest rates, currencies and other assets.
Q.
Why is Libor important?
A.
After more than two decades, Libor still remains one of the most highly cited benchmarks in the financial world.
The British Bankers Association has promoted the rate-setting process as highly transparent and impartial, making Libor a good benchmark for various financial products. The group has argued that no one institution can single-handedly alter the calculations behind the rate.
But amid the rate-manipulation scandal, the integrity of Libor has been called into question. In late June, Barclays agreed to pay $450 million to settle accusations by regulators that it had submitted false Libor rates to bolster its bottom line and deflect scrutiny about its health.
Q.
Is Libor changing as a result of the rate manipulation scandal?
A.
A. It's unclear at the moment. After regulators unveiled their settlement with Barclays, the B.B.A. said that it was ''shocked'' by the revelations and was reviewing all aspects of the Libor-setting process.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Shares Fall on Concerns About Profit Growth

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks fell Tuesday for a fourth consecutive day after a weak start to the earnings season and a sharp decline in oil prices, which sent energy shares sharply lower.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 83.17 points, or 0.65 percent, to close at 12,653.12. Alcoa was the biggest loser in the Dow, dropping 4.1 percent, to $8.40. The aluminum maker reported a slump in revenue late Monday. 
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 10.99 points, or 0.81 percent, to 1,341.47.
The chip maker Advanced Micro Devices fell 11.2 percent, to $4.99, after reporting that a slowdown in China and Europe led to a sharp drop in second-quarter revenue. The company had forecast a modest gain.
That news weighed on other technology stocks, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 29.44 points, or 1 percent, to 2,902.33.
The bad news outweighed hopeful developments in Europe earlier in the day. Before Wall Street markets opened, European finance ministers announced they had agreed on the terms of a bailout for Spain's banks. The first installment of $37 billion in aid can be ready by the end of the month. Investors were concerned that some details seemed to be missing from the plan.
Also weighing on the market were worries about corporate earnings reports. Financial analysts estimate that earnings at companies in the S.& P. 500 fell 2 percent in the April-through-June period compared with a year ago, according to S.& P. Capital IQ. That would be the first drop in nearly three years.
''The past quarter was great, but going forward many companies may have problems,'' said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade, a brokerage firm. ''People are confused about what to think.''
In Norway, a labor dispute that had threatened North Sea oil production was resolved, sending oil prices and energy stocks lower.
Crude oil for August delivery fell $2.08, to $83.91 a barrel in New York trading. Major energy companies dropped as a result, including Occidental Petroleum, down $1.95, to $83.24, and ConocoPhillips, down 85 cents, to $53.48.
Natural gas producers took a hit from a sharp drop in the price of natural gas, which was down 5 percent at $2.74 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Also weighing on commodities was a report from China that import growth fell in half in June from May, a signal its economy might be slowing more than expected. The Chinese economy, the world's second biggest, was growing at its slowest pace since the 2008 financial crisis.
In corporate news, Applied Materials, which makes equipment for chip makers, cut its fiscal year profit and sales estimates because of weak demand. The stock fell 30 cents, to $10.71.
The embattled BlackBerry maker Research in Motion fell 38 cents, to $7.29. The company's chief executive, Thorsten Heins, told a shareholders' meeting that he was not satisfied with the company's performance. Two weeks ago the company announced disappointing earnings, plans to cut 30 percent of its work force and the latest delay in BlackBerry 10.
In the bond market, the price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 4/32, to 102 9/32, while its yield dropped to 1.50 percent from 1.51 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: Invitation to a Dialogue: Does Selfishness Rule?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Is selfishness at the root of America's political and economic problems?
As Kurt Andersen (''The Downside of Liberty,'' Op-Ed, July 4) observed, worries about the relationship between individualism and selfishness are as old as the Republic itself. And in the 1820s, Alexis de Tocqueville voiced his concern that the extreme individualism of the new American democracy could, if not curbed, sap ''the virtues of public life.'' 
Across a broad range of public policy concerns, the debate over the role of government and ''entitlements'' has been hijacked by those who appeal to the selfish instincts of voters. Just consider the opposition to expansion of health insurance, regulation of the financial markets, increasing taxes on the very wealthy or spending to stimulate the economy.
Appeals to selfishness and its next of kin -- envy -- have been used to justify the gutting of pensions and benefits to public employees. Why should they enjoy benefits that you don't have? Efforts to provide relief to homeowners facing foreclosures and college graduates mired in debt have been stymied by the mantra, Why should my tax dollars be used to help someone who was less frugal than I was?
Although actions rooted in selfishness may provide some short-term benefits to those who strive to maintain their relative advantages, they are destructive to society as a whole. As each generation's winners institutionalize their advantages, the opportunities for those who are left behind become increasingly fewer. Economic inequality and powerlessness become the norms.
In the 1950s John Kenneth Galbraith bemoaned the existence of ''private affluence and public squalor.'' This disparity has only grown worse in the past 60 years.
The prognosis for a political culture in which citizens have been conditioned to think only in terms of ''me'' is grim since democracy requires, for its continued vitality, an understanding that we are all in this together.
PAUL L. NEVINS Boston, July 9, 2012
The writer, a lawyer, is the author of ''The Politics of Selfishness.''
Editors' Note: We invite readers to respond to this letter for the Sunday Dialogue. We plan to publish responses and Mr. Nevins's rejoinder in the Sunday Review. E-mail: letters@nytimes.com

HEADLINE: In Manchester United's I.P.O., a Preference for U.S. Rules

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF. 
Steven M. Davidoff is a professor of law and finance at Ohio State University. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook. Follow @StevenDavidoff on Twitter.

 BODY:
Manchester United, the English soccer team with an adoring fan base in Europe and Asia, is filing to go public in the United States.
But the initial public offering is not a reflection of Americans' increasing love of soccer. Instead, it is a reflection of American regulators' light touch.
I'm not kidding. The United States, which has long been criticized for its harsh rules surrounding I.P.O.'s, is now the place where foreign companies go to avoid regulation.
Manchester United may be the world's most popular soccer club, with 659 million fans according to the team's own estimates. In 2005, the American businessman Malcolm Glazer and his family bought control of the team, loading it up with hundreds of millions of dollars in debt. Now, the company is selling shares to raise money and reduce its debt, which stands at about $655 million. 
But the Glazers do not want to give up voting control since, among other reasons, Manchester United fans appear eager to buy back the team from the still-unpopular family. In 2010, a prominent group of Manchester United fans were said to have tried to form a consortium to repurchase the club. The Glazers have uniformly given the same response: the team is not for sale. Now, the Glazers are venue-shopping for their stock.
They passed over the Hong Kong Stock Exchange because it would not give the team a waiver to allow two classes of shares, with different voting rights. The London Stock Exchange also does not allow such share structures, perhaps the reason this natural home was skipped over by the Glazers.
Manchester United declined to comment for this article.
The Singapore Exchange seemed more amenable to the Glazers' plan to list Manchester United and keep control through a dual-class structure. But after the exchange delayed final signoff on the dual-class shares and the Asian markets cooled, the Singapore plans were derailed, according to an article in Reuters.
The soccer team has recently found a home for its stock in the United States. Manchester United filed the papers this month for its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, and the Glazers are taking advantage of the country's willingness to be more flexible when it comes to shareholder rights. Manchester United is proposing a corporate structure that would give the Glazers shares with 10 votes apiece. Public investors would receive one vote for each share.
While the Securities and Exchange Commission tried to ban this type of dual-class voting stock in the 1980s, a federal appeals court struck down the rules. Since then, the structure has become increasingly common. Facebook, LinkedIn and Google all have dual-class shares. The New York Times also has a dual-class voting structure. In 2011, 28 offerings featured dual-class structures that gave greater voting rights to certain shareholders, according to the research firm Dealogic.
The Manchester United offering is a case study in how the American markets have evolved toward deregulation in the past decade.
The company is a beneficiary of the newly enacted Jumpstart Our Business Start-Ups Act, known as the JOBS Act, designed to help private companies raise capital and go public. Although the team was founded in 1878, the JOBS Act classifies Manchester United as an emerging growth company since it has less than $1 billion in revenue. As such, the company, which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands, does not face the same hurdles as American businesses.
The JOBS Act builds on earlier efforts by the S.E.C. to loosen the rules governing I.P.O.'s of foreign companies. Under pressure from stock exchanges and other market players, the agency has exempted foreign issuers like Manchester United from large parts of American securities laws.
Manchester United will not need to file quarterly reports, report material events, file proxy statements or disclose extensive compensation information, all of which American companies must do. Under a different S.E.C. rule adopted in 2008, Manchester United also does not need to report financials under the generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States, but can instead rely on international financial reporting standards.
Because Manchester United will be a controlled company, it does not need to follow the New York Stock Exchange rules adopted in 2003 that require a public company to have a board composed mainly of independent directors. The board of Manchester United will have four directors, two of Malcolm Glazer's sons and two executives of the company.
The legal environment, which investment bankers and lawyers have long argued deterred I.P.O.'s, also appears to be more conducive. This may be because securities litigation reforms put in place by Congress and the Supreme Court have meant fewer cases in recent years. Even after the financial crisis, only 16 companies on the Standard & Poor's 500 were subject to this type of litigation in 2011, the lowest number since 2000, according to the Stanford Securities Class Action Clearinghouse.
It's all a bit unsettling.
After the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002, critics claimed that the new regulation was driving away foreign companies, although at least one academic study rebutted this claim. But as regulators have slowly loosened the rules, the American markets are attracting foreign issuers seeking watered-down rules.
This does not mean that this deregulation is wrongheaded.
The JOBS Act and other initiatives may not have been designed to attract the likes of Manchester United, but such I.P.O.'s do provide work for investment bankers, lawyers and the exchanges. They also build up American prestige by bringing well-known foreign companies to the United States.
At the same time, the deregulation effort means lower compliance costs for businesses. Presumably, that extra money can be invested, bolstering the economy.
The question is whether deregulation is worth the price.
I have little sympathy for investors who buy Manchester United shares. The risks are mainly disclosed.
The bigger question is whether lowering the bar for foreign issuers will come back to haunt the American markets.
Even before the JOBS Act, Chinese companies took advantage of new S.E.C. rules and started going public en masse in the United States. While some of the I.P.O.'s have worked out, there are now more than 100 newly public Chinese companies facing accusations of fraud by either investors or regulators.
The risk is that American exchanges will become more like London's Alternative Investment Market, a lightly regulated stock exchange that has fostered some spectacular flops. If so, investors may lose faith in American markets, and the United States may end up sacrificing long-term stature for short-term gain.
Either way, the next time someone calls the American markets overregulated, you might want to point them to the Manchester United I.P.O. - and remind them that the English soccer club came to the United States to avoid more burdensome foreign rules.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Spreading Scourge Of Corporate Corruption

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the Libor scandal is how familiar it seems. Sure, for some of the world's leading banks to try to manipulate one of the most important interest rates in contemporary finance is clearly egregious. But is that worse than packaging billions of dollars worth of dubious mortgages into a bond and having it stamped with a Triple-A rating to sell to some dupe down the road while betting against it? Or how about forging documents on an industrial scale to foreclose fraudulently on countless homeowners?
The misconduct of the financial industry no longer surprises most Americans. Only about one in five has much trust in banks, according to Gallup polls, about half the level in 2007. And it's not just banks that are frowned upon. Trust in big business overall is declining. Sixty-two percent of Americans believe corruption is widespread across corporate America. According to Transparency International, an anticorruption watchdog, nearly three in four Americans believe that corruption has increased over the last three years.
We should be alarmed that corporate wrongdoing has come to be seen as such a routine occurrence. Capitalism cannot function without trust. As the Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow observed, ''Virtually every commercial transaction has within itself an element of trust.'' 
The parade of financiers accused of misdeeds, booted from the executive suite and even occasionally jailed, is undermining this essential element. Have corporations lost whatever ethical compass they once had? Or does it just look that way because we are paying more attention than we used to?
This is hard to answer because fraud and corruption are impossible to measure precisely. Perpetrators understandably do their best to hide the dirty deeds from public view. And public perceptions of fraud and corruption are often colored by people's sense of dissatisfaction with their lives.
Last year, the economists Justin Wolfers and Betsey Stevenson from the University of Pennsylvania published a study suggesting that trust in government and business falls when unemployment rises. ''Much of the recent decline in confidence -- particularly in the financial sector -- may simply be a standard response to a cyclical downturn,'' they wrote.
And waves of mistrust can spread broadly. After years of dismal employment prospects, Americans are losing trust in a broad range of institutions, including Congress, the Supreme Court, the presidency, public schools, labor unions and the church.
Corporate wrongdoing may be cyclical, too. Fraud is probably more lucrative, as well as easier to hide, amid the general prosperity of economic booms. And the temptation to bend the rules is probably highest toward the end of an economic upswing, when executives must be the most creative to keep the stream of profits rolling in.
The most toxic, no-doc, reverse amortization, liar loans flourished toward the end of the housing bubble. And we typically discover fraud only after the booms have turned to bust. As Warren Buffett famously said, ''You only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.''
Company executives are paid to maximize profits, not to behave ethically. Evidence suggests that they behave as corruptly as they can, within whatever constraints are imposed by law and reputation. In 1977, the United States Congress passed the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to stop the rampant practice of bribing foreign officials. Business by American multinationals in the most corrupt countries dropped. But they didn't stop bribing. And American companies have been lobbying against the law ever since.
Extrapolating from frauds that were uncovered during and after the dot-com bubble, the economists Luigi Zingales and Adair Morse of the University of Chicago and Alexander Dyck of the University of Toronto estimated conservatively that in any given year a fraud was being committed by 11 to 13 percent of the large companies in the country.
Yet it may be wrong to shrug off the latest boomlet of corporate crimes and misdemeanors as a mere reflection of the business cycle. Americans appear to believe that corruption has become more prevalent over the years. And some indicators suggest they may be right.
In 2001, Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index ranked the United States as the 16th least-corrupt country. By last year, the nation had fallen to 24th place. The World Bank also reports a weakening of corruption controls in the United States since the late 1990s, so that it is falling behind most other developed nations.
The most pointed evidence that breaking the rules has become standard behavior in the corporate world is how routine the wrongdoing seems to its participants. ''Dude. I owe you big time!... I'm opening a bottle of Bollinger,'' e-mailed one Barclays trader to a colleague for fiddling with the rate and improving the apparent profit of his derivatives book.
It's difficult to know why corruption may be spreading. But there are a few plausible explanations. From globalization to rising income inequality to the growing role of corporate money in political campaigns, political and economic dynamics may have increased both the scope of corporate wrongdoing and the incentives for business executives to bend, or break, the rules.
Just consider the scale of recent wrongdoing. Libor is one of the most important rates in the economy. It determines the return on the savings of millions of people, as well as the rate they pay on their mortgage and car loans. It is the benchmark for hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of financial contracts.
Bigger markets allow bigger frauds. Bigger companies, with more complex balance sheets, have more places to hide them. And banks, when they get big enough that no government will let them fail, have the biggest incentive of all. A 20-year-old study by the economists Paul Romer and George Akerlof pointed out that the most lucrative strategy for executives at too-big-to-fail banks would be to loot them to pay themselves vast rewards -- knowing full well that the government would save them from bankruptcy.
Globalization can encourage corruption, as companies compete tooth and claw for new markets. And the furious rush of corporate cash into the political process -- which differs from bribery in that companies pay politicians to change laws rather than bureaucrats to ignore them -- is unlikely to foment ethical behavior.
The inexorable rise of income inequality is also likely to encourage fraud, fostering resentment and undermining trust in capitalism's institutions and rules. Economic research shows that participants in contests in which the winner takes all are much more likely to cheat. And the United States is becoming a winner-takes-all economy.
It's hard to fathom the broader social implications of corporate wrongdoing. But its most long-lasting impact may be on Americans' trust in the institutions that underpin the nation's liberal market democracy.

HEADLINE: DreamWorks Animation Announces Plans for Meadowlands Amusement Park

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The Hollywood studio DreamWorks Animation has struck a deal to bring Shrek, Kung Fu Panda and other animated movie characters to a planned amusement park as part of a revived entertainment and retail mall in the New Jersey Meadowlands.
It would be the first theme park based on the studio's animated movies since DreamWorks's earlier plan for a park in Dubai failed to work out. The company also announced this year that it was considering whether to open a park in China. 
DreamWorks has sought to capitalize on the huge popularity of its films, much as Disney and Universal Studios have in the United States, Europe and Asia. The indoor theme park would include rides, attractions and a glass-enclosed wave pool incorporating characters from the studio's movies.
The partnership between the developer, Triple Five, and DreamWorks is a rare bit of good news for a site that has sat vacant and unfinished since May 2009, when the previous developers ran out of money after spending $1.9 billion on a five-story complex just west of Manhattan, near MetLife Stadium, called Xanadu.
In a statement Tuesday evening, Jeffrey Katzenberg, chief executive of DreamWorks Animation, confirmed the deal, saying the theme park would involve the studio's ''characters, storytelling and technology in a unique and innovative family entertainment experience.''
Triple Five, the developer of the Mall of America, has renamed the project American Dream and drawn up plans to make it even bigger, with nearly 1.7 million square feet of retail space, an indoor ski hill, indoor sky diving, bowling, an aquarium, a live theater and the 14.7-acre amusement park.
But the project continues to be dogged by delays. In announcing a tentative agreement between the current owners and Triple Five in May 2011, Gov. Chris Christie said he expected the developer to strike a deal with the owners and get financing for the project by the end of 2011 so that American Dream could be open for the 2014 Super Bowl at MetLife Stadium. But executives working with Triple Five now say that $1.75 billion in financing will not be completed until October and that the complex will not open until September 2014, seven months after the Super Bowl.
Triple Five, which is owned by the Ghermezian family, has built two of the world's largest and most successful entertainment malls. But the company faces special challenges in the Meadowlands, the least of which are the local blue laws that prohibit retail activity on Sundays.
Many retailers say they are reluctant to get involved with the project because of its troubled history. ''There were enough false starts that retailers want to see some substance,'' said Ron DeLuca, a partner at R. J. Brunelli & Company, which represents a roster of retailers who had signed leases at Xanadu. ''Until American Dream becomes a reality,'' he said, ''it is difficult to get retailers to make hard commitments.''
The Jets and Giants, which both use MetLife Stadium, filed a lawsuit last month seeking to block construction of the project, saying it threatens to ''clog the complex's already congested transportation networks'' on game days, when 80,000 fans converge on the stadium.
The State Transportation Department approved the project, however, and Triple Five moved on Tuesday to dismiss the suit.
The deal with DreamWorks provides the project with some Hollywood cachet and underscores Triple Five's emphasis on entertainment.
Entertainment conglomerates like DreamWorks say they view theme parks as a way to expand revenues for an industry buffeted by piracy, flagging DVD sales and a drop in network television viewers.
The theme park industry is slow growing in North America, said John Robinett, senior vice president of economics for the Themed Entertainment Association, although the recent creation of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction at Universal Studios in Florida and a $1 billion makeover tied to ''Cars'' characters at Disney's California Adventure park in Los Angeles have raised attendance substantially.
Triple Five is hoping DreamWorks can do the same in the Meadowlands, where it says it hopes to attract 55 million visitors annually. But that may be easier in Minnesota or West Edmonton, Canada, where Triple Five already operates.
''Not only does northern New Jersey not lack for shopping malls; there are a lot of destination attractions,'' said David L. Malmouth, a developer in San Diego and a former Disney executive. ''Manhattan is a pretty compelling theme park in its own right.''

CORRECTION-DATE: July 16, 2012

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in some editions on Wednesday about a plan by DreamWorks Animation to bring its animated movie characters to a planned amusement park in the New Jersey Meadowlands referred incorrectly to some other places for proposed studio parks. It never announced plans for Abu Dhabi, and it is still working on plans for China. It is not the case that the studio's ''earlier plans'' for parks in China and Abu Dhabi ''failed to work out.'' (As the article correctly noted, DreamWorks's plan for a park in Dubai did not materialize.)

HEADLINE: Trenton Budget Woes Imperil City Museum

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
TRENTON -- This faded, financially ailing state capital is not known for its cultural attractions, lacking Princeton's academic cachet or Newark's shiny Performing Arts Center. But it does have the Trenton City Museum, housed in an 1848 Italianate mansion set in a historic park designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, where it outlines much of the city's history with a collection ranging from local art to dinner plates and tiles emblematic of its past as a national powerhouse of ceramics production.
Just last year the museum announced plans to showcase its porcelain collection by exhibiting four elegant vases believed to have been manufactured here for the 1904 World's Fair, uniting them for the first time in more than a century.
Then everything fell apart. 
Last fall financial troubles led the city to lay off the museum's director and its maintenance man in wide-scale budget cuts that included shrinking the police force by a third. City Hall, which operates the museum with the nonprofit Trenton Museum Society, asked an intern to assume the director's duties.
A donor and some institutions asked for the return of items on loan. According to the Trenton museum, the vase exhibition was canceled after the Brooklyn Museum, citing security concerns, asked for its vase back.
''No one knew if we were open or closed,'' said Robert Sands Jr., a former consultant who ultimately took over running the institution at the Museum Society's request.
The society says things have improved in recent months. Arts sale galas and other events have raised enough funds to keep the doors open and hire back two aides part time.
But the Trenton museum still faces an uncertain future. There is no endowment or corporate grants to underwrite its $100,000 annual budget. Relations between the Museum Society and the city remain strained, and the search for a new director was difficult.
Even in these tough economic times, only 10 people applied for the job, according to Robert Cunningham, president of the Museum Society. Many of the applicants were unqualified, he said, and the society ended up hiring Mr. Sands, but only part time.
''I am very concerned about the future of the museum,'' said Zachary Chester, a city councilman whose district includes the museum. ''The museum is very important. It's part of Trenton's history. It's part of our culture, our tourism.''
Of the 45,000 annual tourists to Trenton, Mr. Cunningham said, about half visit the City Museum, making it, like the more centrally located New Jersey State Museum, one of the city's biggest draws. Besides exhibits, the City Museum provides programs for schoolchildren, workshops, a lecture series and musical program.
The city and the Museum Society split responsibility for the institution, which since 1978 has been housed in Ellarslie Mansion in Cadwalader Park. Under their agreement, the society owns and maintains the collection of historical objects and fine and decorative arts and raises part of the operating budget through donations, memberships and an occasional county grant. The city pays for the building maintenance and some staff salaries, including that of the director.
Society officials, though, said they could not stand by when the city put an intern at the helm. So contrary to the agreement between the city and the society, they hired Mr. Sands, who works three days a week for $30 an hour and no benefits, and continue to pay him. He is also the part-time director of the William Trent House, the original home of the founder of Trenton. It, too, lost its director during the city budget cuts.
Both the Museum Society and Mr. Sands would like to see him run the museum full time, paid by the city, as per the agreement. But communications between the parties have been difficult for a while, according to the society.
At one point last year, Mr. Cunningham said, the locks on the mansion were changed. Society officials say they also learned that the previous director, Brian O. Hill, had been laid off when they saw it in a newspaper.
The city has a management assistant, Colin Cherry, on site to help out. Mr. Cherry said he could not comment on his position, and city officials did not return calls or respond to e-mails .
The Trenton City Museum's treasures include the ornate 100-pound Woodland Vase, manufactured for the 1904 World's Fair, and a ceramic collection that includes dinner plates from the Reagan, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Wilson White Houses. A gallery downstairs showcases the work of local artists, and an upstairs gallery is a reproduction of a Victorian parlor.
Ulysses Grant Dietz, the senior curator of the Newark Museum, an art and science museum, said that while New Jersey cultural institutions struggle in the shadow of their New York and Philadelphia counterparts, the Trenton City Museum remains ''all about local history and local artists.''
''The director and the staff have kept up consistently the ceramics exhibitions, with a lot of input from New Jersey ceramics collectors,'' he said.
The Newark Museum had planned to lend one of its vases to the four-vases exhibition, he said. ''They really represented a moment in the early 20th century when New Jersey was powerful: Trenton in ceramics; Newark in silver, jewelry and leather; and Paterson in silks,'' Mr. Dietz said. ''They were emblematic of an American pride of production and a regional powerhouse.''
The City Museum still hopes to mount an exhibition of the vases, though Brooklyn has reclaimed its. Arnold L. Lehman, the director of the Brooklyn Museum, said in an interview last week that contrary to what the Trenton museum had cited last year, security was not the primary reason his institution had asked for its vase back. The loan period was up, he said, and the Brooklyn Museum wanted to put the vase on display itself, which museum officials said they planned to do next week.
Mr. Lehman said the request for the return came before the Trenton budget cuts.
Mr. Cunningham said he remembered that security was the major issue for the Brooklyn Museum. While the two-year loan had technically ended, the loan of the vase had been repeatedly renewed for more than a decade, according to Mr. Hill, who was the Trenton museum's director from March 1998 until last September, and is now at Fort Morgan, a historic site in Alabama.
In an odd coda to the vase exhibition, further research by Mr. Cunningham revealed that the Brooklyn Museum vase was not manufactured for the 1904 World's Fair, after all, but was made after the fair took place.
Mr. Hill said he was hopeful but realistic about the future of the institution he had run for 13 years.
''The museum was the cultural center of Trenton,'' Mr. Hill said. ''I think the board is doing everything they can to get things back on track, but they took a big hit.''

HEADLINE: Obama and Romney Trade Shots, a Few Possibly Accurate, on Outsourcing

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.; Michael D. Shear reported from Washington, and Richard A. Oppel Jr. from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As President Obama and Mitt Romney rush to define the other, each man is alleging one of the great economic sins: that his rival accelerated the exodus of American jobs to foreign countries.
Mr. Obama accuses Mr. Romney of being at the helm of a firm that invested in companies that outsourced their jobs. Mr. Romney, in remarks on Tuesday, called Mr. Obama the real ''outsourcer in chief'' for sending billions of dollars in stimulus funds to foreign-based firms and companies that ''end up making their products outside the United States.''
The particulars have been denied or defended by both sides, and in many cases picked over by independent fact-checkers. In response, the two candidates and their allies have all but stuck their fingers in their ears while continuing with their outsourcing attacks. 
There is no question of the potential power of the narrative, coming at a time of economic uncertainty and frustration about the tepid expansion of the labor force. But in both cases, there are deep questions about the fundamental truth of the arguments, even as each campaign continues to press forward with its charges. Mr. Obama's attacks on Mr. Romney's time at Bain Capital rely on thinly documented examples of outsourcing that took place when the Republican candidate was, at best, an absentee owner of his firm, having left day-to-day management to run the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.
And Mr. Romney's latest attacks on the president's stimulus spending appear to be based primarily on snippets of news reports about the activities of companies that -- upon contacting the companies themselves -- do not bear out as fact.
The ''You're an outsourcer! No, you are!'' debate threatens to consume much of the summer as both campaigns battle their way across a dozen battleground states in a race that polls show to be tied.
The Republican National Committee on Tuesday morning unveiled a Web site alleging that under President Obama, the American Recovery Act, known as the stimulus, sent billions of dollars to companies operating overseas. In fact, several of the companies cited on the new site said the Republican characterizations of their activities were far from accurate.
According to the Republican committee, ABB Inc., a global energy and technology company, ''received over $16 million in stimulus funds to create green energy manufacturing jobs'' and has ''laid off workers in the U.S. and transferred work to Mexico.''
''That sounds like somebody taking facts and just twisting them,'' said Barry Dillon, the spokesman for ABB, based in North Carolina. Mr. Dillon said the company employs 19,000 people in the United States, and another 8,000 across Canada and Mexico. Employment is up in the United States, he said.
''There's nothing wholesale that we moved from the U.S. into Mexico,'' Mr. Dillon said. In a detailed e-mail, Mr. Dillon wrote that the company has been expanding in both the United States and Mexico to meet rising demands of the market.
The R.N.C. also accuses Mr. Obama's administration of sending $1.3 billion in loan guarantees to a company that will manufacture solar panels in Mexico.
A spokeswoman for the SunPower Corporation, based in California, said a ''large number of the panels'' would be built at the company's facility in Milpitas, Calif., for installation at a ''solar ranch'' in California. Some will be built at its plants in Asia and Mexico, said the spokeswoman, Natalie Wymer. The federal loan guarantee, which was closer to $1.2 billion, actually went to another company, NRG Solar, which owns the solar ranch.
And Fisker Automotive, a manufacturer of luxury hybrid electric cars based in Anaheim, Calif., said the Republican committee's description of the company as a ''stimulus recipient'' was false. The Obama administration approved up to $529 million in loans for the company, but they were under a George W. Bush-era program intended to spur more fuel-efficient technologies, not the stimulus package. The company has taken only $193 million of the loans.
In addition, the company disputes Republican claims that Fisker's federal money ''went abroad for jobs that weren't created in the United States.'' The company is assembling its first electric car, called the Karma, in Finland. But Fisker and Energy Department officials say the portion of the loans being used for the Karma -- about $169 million -- has been spent on hiring and other functions solely in California and Michigan. ''Every single dollar of the loan has been used in the U.S.,'' said Roger Ormisher, Fisker's senior director of global communications.
Mr. Romney has previously attacked the loans to Fisker, which has Democratic connections: One investor, the firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, includes Obama supporters and counts as a senior partner former Vice President Al Gore.
Despite the low-interest federal loans, the company has struggled recently, and it laid off 66 workers earlier this year. Last year, the Energy Department also blocked Fisker's access to most of the loans because the company had not met certain milestones built into the loan agreement. The company said it still had 500 American employees on its payroll.
But Mr. Ormisher said that the company had raised more than $1 billion in private funds and that the company expected to start repaying the federal loans next year.
Mr. Obama spent Tuesday in Iowa, where he focused on his proposal to extend middle-class tax cuts for a year. But his campaign continued to make the outsourcing charge against Mr. Romney, largely through a television commercial running in nine battleground states. The ad alleges that Mr. Romney's companies ''were pioneers in outsourcing U.S. jobs to low-wage countries.''
The ad leaves the impression that Mr. Romney directed those investments. In fact, there is compelling evidence to suggest that Mr. Romney had largely left day-to-day control of Bain Capital to his partners after 1999, when the activity at issue took place.
Stephanie Cutter, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Obama, points out that Bain is listed in Securities and Exchange Commission documents as ''wholly owned'' by Mr. Romney during that period, and that Mr. Romney is listed as a ''general partner and a member of the management committee.''
The central question is whether Mr. Romney's ownership of Bain -- which the campaign does not deny -- makes him responsible for the firm's actions in his absence.
FactCheck.org, which examined Mr. Obama's claims, concluded that it did not. It noted that Mr. Romney stated on federal financial disclosure forms that he had ''not had any active role with any Bain Capital entity and has not been involved in the operations of any Bain Capital entity in any way.''
Advisers to Mr. Obama say those statements are self-serving. And they note that Mr. Romney is often eager to take credit for job growth and other positive outcomes that emerged from Bain's activities long after he left.
There is little indication that either side will give their rhetoric a rest, no matter how much outside truth-squadding calls out both campaigns. On Tuesday, Mr. Romney, campaigning in Grand Junction, Colo., insisted that he was not guilty of outsourcing.
''If there's an outsourcer in chief, it's the president of the United States,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Romney Makes a Push for Black Voters

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
Four years ago, Barack Obama captured 95 percent of the black vote. But in a 2012 election in which every vote may matter, Mitt Romney is not conceding an inevitable rout on that front.
On Wednesday, Mr. Romney will make a pitch to the nation's premier civil rights group, the N.A.A.C.P., testing President Obama's overwhelming support among black voters by trying to pry away some defectors with his pro-jobs message at a time of 14.4 percent unemployment among African-Americans.
Mr. Obama is passing up the chance to address the 103-year-old group at its annual convention in Houston and is sending Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. instead. 
While blacks are expected to solidly back Mr. Obama again this year, he faces challenges in generating the same enthusiasm as in 2008. The level of black turnout could be especially crucial in states like North Carolina and Virginia, where black voters had an outsize influence in the president's relatively narrow victories four years ago.
''In 2008, he won North Carolina by about 14,000 votes,'' said Bill Randall, a black Republican who lost a recent primary for a Congressional seat in the state. But ''support is waning'' he said, adding that the president's ''policies are not doing things that are going to spur economic growth.''
Other black leaders said Mr. Romney would need more than an economic message to improve on Senator John McCain's dismal level of black support in 2008 and return to the 11 percent that George W. Bush won in 2004, according to exit polls.
''Romney could do much better than John McCain,'' said Benjamin Todd Jealous, the president of the N.A.A.C.P. But his message on jobs and the economy ''is not resonating with our base,'' Mr. Jealous said, in part because talk of deregulation brings to mind Wall Street bailouts and how General Motors might have gone bankrupt if Mr. Romney had been in the White House.
''If he's going to pick up more support in the black community,'' Mr. Jealous said, ''he has to send a message that he's prepared to lead on issues that we care about.''
Topping the list is a wave of voter identification laws that Democrats say will suppress minority participation in November. ''We are living through the greatest wave of legislative assaults on voting rights in more than a century,'' Mr. Jealous said Monday in his opening speech at the convention. ''In the past year, more states have passed more laws pushing more voters out of the ballot box than at any time since the rise of Jim Crow.''
Nearly a dozen states have passed strict voter ID laws in the last two years, largely with the support of Republican lawmakers, who say they are needed to prevent fraud. Democrats argue that the laws are really meant to suppress turnout by poor and minority voters, who tend to vote Democratic and who disproportionately lack government-issued identification.
The issue caused a stir recently when a top Republican official in Pennsylvania said the state's new voter ID law would allow Mr. Romney to carry the state.
Texas, as it happens, is one of the states with a tough new law, which is the subject of a federal court hearing in Washington this week as the N.A.A.C.P. meets in Houston. The Justice Department has found that the law will ''disenfranchise at least 600,000 voters,'' many of them members of minority groups. The state is challenging the ruling and a crucial provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
Speaking to the N.A.A.C.P. on Tuesday, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. sharply criticized the Republican-backed state laws, noting that 25 percent of eligible black voters nationally lack a photo ID, but only 8 percent of whites do.
It is unlikely that Mr. Romney will tell civil rights leaders what they are hoping to hear about voter ID laws, since he has rarely weighed in on the issue. A spokeswoman for the campaign, Andrea Saul, summarized his position in an e-mail: ''Governor Romney believes that every legal vote should count.''
Although the Romney campaign recently named an adviser to help frame its message to black voters, and in May the candidate visited a charter school in a poor black neighborhood of West Philadelphia, most of his courtship of minorities has been focused on Hispanics, who could play a crucial role in swing states like Colorado, Florida and Nevada.
There is another possible calculation for Mr. Romney's N.A.A.C.P. appearance: he may not win over many black voters, but he will appear more moderate to independent and undecided whites.
Surveys show that black voters still overwhelmingly support the president. In the latest Gallup weekly tracking poll, 87 percent approved of the job Mr. Obama is doing. But Mr. Jealous said it would be difficult for the president to inspire the same turnout among black voters as in 2008: the historic import of his candidacy for blacks has passed, and people are still struggling in a stalled economy.
It might appear that Mr. Obama is taking black voters for granted by skipping the N.A.A.C.P. event, which he attended four years ago. Mr. Jealous said the president had signaled as recently as a week ago that he would speak to the group, but his office said he had a scheduling conflict. Mr. Biden, who also enjoys strong support among blacks, will speak on Thursday.
Mr. Obama is focused this week on countering a disappointing jobs report released last Friday -- proposing on Monday to extend a middle-class tax cut, a message he planned to repeat Tuesday at grass-roots events in Iowa.
One factor in the president's favor may be that as a result of his success and that of other black politicians, the size of the minority electorate has grown, said Katherine Tate, a political scientist at the University of California, Irvine.
''Black voters are regularly participating in politics nowadays because of their elected numbers in government,'' she said. ''An African-American member of Congress once said that because of Obama his mother now watches cable news regularly and talks to him regularly and heatedly about policy matters.''

HEADLINE: Tied, With Most Minds Made Up

BYLINE: By ALLISON KOPICKI

 BODY:
Results from three recent national surveys show a country that is closely divided between the presidential candidates but not very enthusiastic about voting this fall. Respondents also said that politics were behind the recent action by the Republican-led House to hold the attorney general in contempt, and that the Obama administration should answer all questions about the gun-trafficking case known as Operation Fast and Furious.
A new Washington Post/ABC News poll showed Barack Obama and Mitt Romney tied, each with 47 percent of support among registered voters. 
Most voters also said they were committed to their choices, with just 8 percent of Romney supporters saying there was a good chance they could change their minds, and just 4 percent of Obama supporters saying so.
Despite the even support for the candidates, nearly 6 in 10 Americans said that Mr. Obama would emerge the victor this fall, compared with about a third who said Mr. Romney would win.
The poll showed stronger enthusiasm among Mr. Obama's supporters, with more than half saying they were very enthusiastic, compared with fewer than 4 in 10 of Mr. Romney's supporters. Most of Mr. Romney's supporters said their vote was against President Obama, rather than for Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts.
Americans gave the president less than stellar ratings on the economy, immigration, and health care, with a majority saying they disapproved of his handling of each issue. Voters divided nearly evenly over would will do better on their most important issue, the economy: 48 percent said Mr. Romney would do a better job, while 45 percent favored Mr. Obama. However, Mr. Romney scored lower among voters on qualities like understanding Americans' economic problems, likability and standing up for what he believes.
Gallup examined swing state voters in its recent tracking survey, looking at the responses of 1,200 respondents in 12 states that they deemed as highly contested in this year's election. And while voters in these swing states were more likely to be exposed to television ads from the campaigns, their enthusiasm for voting in the election was not very different from voters nationally.
Among swing state voters, 25 percent said they were extremely enthusiastic about voting in the 2012 election, compared with 22 percent nationwide. Over all, nearly a third of voters said they were not enthusiastic about voting this year.
A CNN/ORC poll conducted in the days after the Republican-led House of Representatives voted to hold Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. in contempt found that just over half of Americans approved of the action taken by the House of Representatives.
However, about 6 in 10 Americans said the Republican investigation of Operation Fast and Furious was mostly to gain political advantage, while about a third said it was due to real ethical concerns. And nearly 7 in 10 Americans said President Obama and his aides should answer all questions related to the investigation - only 27 percent said they should continue to invoke executive privilege.
The ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by telephone July 5 to 8 among 1,003 adults, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points for the full sample and registered voters. The CNN/ORC poll was conducted by telephone June 28 to July 1 among 1,517 adults, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Gallup's swing states survey was based on telephone interviews conducted June 22 to 29 on the Gallup Daily tracking survey, of 1,200 registered voters living in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

HEADLINE: In an Iowa Dining Room, Obama Puts a Middle-Class Face on a Tax Fight

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and ASHLEY PARKER; Mark Landler reported from Cedar Rapids, and Ashley Parker from Grand Junction, Colo.

 BODY:
CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa -- Sitting at a kitchen table here with a middle-income couple and speaking later at a community college to a buoyant crowd of 1,600 supporters, President Obama on Tuesday took his message of tax fairness to Iowa, the battleground state that propelled his first run for the presidency in 2008.
Mr. Obama said his proposal this week to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for families making up to $250,000 would allow his hosts, Jason and Ali McLaughlin, to save as much as $2,000 in taxes next year. And he drew a sharp contrast between his proposals and those of his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, who he said supported $5 billion in tax cuts that would deepen the nation's economic divide. 
''My opponent, his allies in Congress, they sincerely believe that prosperity comes from the top down,'' Mr. Obama said at Kirkwood Community College. ''They believe that if we spend trillions of dollars more on tax cuts, mostly for the wealthy, that it'll somehow create more jobs.''
''I think they're wrong,'' the president said to cheers and whoops. ''We tried it their way through most of the last decade, and it didn't work.''
But Mr. Romney, fresh from a week off with his family and speaking at a town-hall-style meeting in Grand Junction, Colo., said it was Mr. Obama's economic approach that did not work. He heaped disdain on the president's tax proposal, which he said would amount to a ''massive tax increase'' for small businesses.
''When people in Washington say they're lowering taxes, hold on to your wallet,'' Mr. Romney said, ''because in fact he didn't lower taxes for anybody. For some people, he announced your taxes are going to stay the same. In Washington, that means you lowered taxes.''
Declaring the proposal ''the sort of thing only an extreme liberal could come up with,'' Mr. Romney said it would stifle an already gasping economy. ''At the very time the American people are seeing fewer jobs created than we need, the president announces he's going to make it harder for jobs to be created,'' Mr. Romney said. ''I just don't think this president understands how our economy works.''
The cross-fire over Mr. Obama's proposal brought taxes to the foreground in the campaign, helping the president temporarily shift the debate away from the anemic economy. Mr. Obama's advisers believe they have an edge over Mr. Romney in this area with middle-class voters, even as Mr. Romney was giving no ground.
Mr. Obama said the McLaughlins, with one young child and another on the way, had saved $4,900 from assorted tax breaks during his presidency. But if Congress does not extend the Bush-era tax cuts, which expire at the end of this year, Mr. Obama said, the family could face up to $2,000 in additional taxes next year.
''I believe that we should make sure that taxes on the 98 percent of Americans don't go up,'' the president said, referring to families making under $250,000, ''and then we should let the tax cuts expire for folks like me, for the top 2 percent of Americans.''
''This has nothing to do with me wanting to punish success,'' Mr. Obama said. ''We love folks getting rich,'' he added, saying that if his daughters, Malia and Sasha, wanted to make a lot of money, he would heartily endorse it.
It was Mr. Obama's 10th visit as president to Iowa, where polls show him and Mr. Romney essentially even. Gov. Terry E. Branstad, a Republican who has turned out to greet Mr. Obama on previous visits, issued a more barbed welcome this time, describing him in a news conference on Monday as a ''terrible leader'' who visits so often because ''he knows that he's in trouble in Iowa.''
On Tuesday, Mr. Romney also opened a counterattack against the Obama campaign's assertion in television advertisements that Bain Capital, the firm that Mr. Romney once led, advised companies that moved jobs outside the United States.
''It is interesting that when it comes to outsourcing, that this president has been outsourcing a good deal of American jobs himself by putting money into energy companies, solar and wind energy companies, that end up making their products outside the United States,'' Mr. Romney said to a crowd of about 900 at a high school gymnasium. ''If there's an outsourcer in chief, it's the president of the United States.''
The president has kept up a busy pace of campaigning in battleground states since the Fourth of July. Last week, he traveled through Ohio and Pennsylvania by bus, mixing a message of economic fairness with an acknowledgment -- after another weak jobs report -- that the economic recovery was going to be long and arduous.
On Friday, Mr. Obama will barnstorm around Virginia as part of a two-day swing that will allow him to keep pressing for a one-year extension of the middle-class tax cuts. In between, he is squeezing in a stream of fund-raisers to try to catch up to Mr. Romney's pace of raising money.
The president's tax pitch came as the Senate, in a bipartisan vote, decided to begin debating a Democratic small-business tax measure. The bill would offer temporary tax credits for small businesses to bring on new employees or to increase their payrolls, and it would extend an existing White House-backed measure to make purchases of new business equipment fully tax deductible.

HEADLINE: German Finance Minister Asks Court Not to Block Euro Assistance

BYLINE: By MELISSA EDDY

 BODY:
BERLIN -- The German finance minister warned on Tuesday that there would be severe consequences for the euro currency union if this country's highest court blocks Germany's recent ratification of two measures for fighting Europe's financial crisis.
Even if the court eventually approves Germany's commitment to the measures, as is widely expected, legal analysts do not expect a ruling for several months. That could prolong market anxieties that plague euro zone countries like Spain and Italy. 
''A considerable delay could result in additional, significant uncertainty in euro zone markets,'' the finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, told an eight-judge panel of the Federal Constitutional Court at a hearing in the southwestern city of Karlsruhe.
At issue is Germany's commitment of up to 22 billion euros, or about $27 billion, in direct payments, and guarantees for an additional 168 billion euros into Europe's permanent bailout fund, known as the European Stability Mechanism. The other measure before the court is Germany's support of a separate pact to reduce deficits and increase the coordination of the spending rules that 25 of the 27 European Union nations signed in March.
The case before the constitutional court underscores the struggle to adopt long-term solutions to the euro zone's problems, as even Germany -- the country whose leaders have been the strongest advocates for ''more Europe'' -- continues to face domestic opposition to a deeper fiscal and political union within the region. At the core of the debate are questions about how much money richer nations should give out and how much political sovereignty the currency union's members would be expected to give up.
In Germany, opponents of the two treaties that Mr. Schauble defended on Tuesday -- which passed the country's Parliament on June 29 by a clear two-thirds majority -- argue that the treaties' terms violate the German Constitution. Opponents include a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's own center-right coalition as well as lawmakers from the opposition Left Party and other groups of disgruntled citizens.
But Germany is hardly alone in facing domestic opposition to European integration measures that its leaders support.
Dutch and Finnish voters also rankle at the idea that their tax contributions are being spent across wider Europe, while many in France take issue with the limits that European integration would place on how the government sets tax policy.
Many analysts say that without these measures, which were drawn up in the last few months, weaker countries will remain at the mercy of financial market speculators and continue to labor under high borrowing costs as they try to revive their economies.
''The fundamental problem with the euro zone is that what happens at the federal level in the United States still happens at the national level in the euro zone,'' said Philip Whyte, a senior research fellow at the Center for European Reform in Europe.
''Unless they correct that flaw, individual states are going to run into trouble, and when they run into trouble, the markets are going to question how much political appetite there is to keep that country within the euro zone,'' Mr. Whyte said.
It also is not the first time that efforts to save the euro have fallen into the hands of a panel of red-robed judges. In September 2011, the court in Karlsruhe ruled on challenges to the legality of earlier bailout measures. The judges upheld the legality of the measures but required Parliament to have a say in their approval.
Because the German court's full examination of the treaties under dispute on Tuesday could take months, the opponents also filed a separate emergency challenge, one aimed at preventing the German president from signing them until a final ruling is handed down.
Even before the vote last month in Parliament, the judges asked President Joachim Gauck not to sign until they reached a decision on the emergency blocking measure.
That decision had been expected by the end of July. But Andreas Vosskuhle, the presiding judge, indicated in his opening remarks Tuesday that the court would conduct a ''very thorough summary review'' of the issue, an indication that deliberations could stretch on.
''In politics, unusual situations and crises often require unusual measures,'' Mr. Vosskuhle said, pointing out that, though the ruling had implications beyond Germany, the judges were also required to protect the plaintiffs' rights.
The court's action further delays the rollout of the stability mechanism's bailout fund, which was originally envisioned to be in place July 1 or by Monday at the latest. Estonia, Ireland and Italy also have yet to ratify the measures. But given that Berlin's contribution accounts for more than a quarter of the overall fund, the mechanism cannot come into force without German approval.
The German court proceedings helped send the euro to a two-year low against the dollar on Tuesday, falling 0.6 percent, to $1.225 in afternoon trading in New York.
Jens Weidmann, the head of Germany's central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, said at court on Tuesday that it was unclear what effect a delay in the ratification would have on financial markets.
''A temporary ruling does not ensure that the risks can be comprehensively limited. Conversely, a quick ratification is no guarantee the crisis will not escalate further,'' he told the court, Reuters reported.
Many analysts predict that the court will uphold the measures, although some envisioned a compromise similar to one reached last year, with the court requiring approval from lawmakers in Berlin each time the fund is to be tapped.
If a similar approval process is put into effect, Germany will require its partners to wait out its cumbersome legal procedures.
''This would not be so ideal, as it would make Germany the bad guy, and put it in the position of being the one to decide what is 'allowed,' and what is not,'' Christian Jasperneite, chief investment officer for the M. M. Warburg bank in Hamburg, said Tuesday.
Yet that right to decide is what German voters insist is their due.
Protesters gathered outside the courtroom held a symbolic funeral and sang the national hymn, standing over a headstone that reads ''Here Rests in Peace the Constitution of the German Republic, born May 23, 1949, died June 29, 2012.''

HEADLINE: States Face Tough Choices Even as Downturn Ends

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
OCEAN CITY, Md. -- As state governments begin to emerge from the long downturn, many are grappling with a difficult choice: should they restore some of the services and jobs they were forced to eliminate in the recession or cut taxes in the hopes of bolstering their local economies?
The debate over the proper balance between taxing and spending has been raging in Congress, on the presidential campaign trail and in statehouses around the country, and no two states have settled it more differently this year than Maryland and Kansas, whose fiscal years began July 1.
Maryland, a state controlled by Democrats that has a pristine credit rating, raised income taxes on its top earners this year to preserve services and spending on its well-regarded schools -- leading some business groups to warn that the state might become less competitive. Kansas, controlled by Republicans, decided to try to spur its economy with an income tax cut -- which Moody's Investors Service, the ratings agency, recently warned would lead to ''dramatic revenue loss'' and deficits that would probably require more spending cuts in the coming years. 
Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, gave an impassioned defense of his approach to mayors from across the state who gathered here at the end of June at the annual convention of the Maryland Municipal League.
''Without any anger, and without any meanness, and without any fear, let's ask one another in these critical months ahead and years ahead: how much less do we think would be good for our state?'' Mr. O'Malley asked. ''How much less do we think would be good for our country? How much less education would be good for our children? How many fewer college degrees would make our state or our country more competitive?
''How much less research and development would be good for the innovation economy that we have an obligation and a responsibility, a duty and an imperative, to embrace? How many fewer hungry Maryland kids can we afford to feed? Progress is a choice: we can decide whether to make the tough choices necessary to invest in our shared future and move forward together. Or we can be the first generation of Marylanders to give our children a lesser quality of life with fewer opportunities.''
Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas, who sought the Republican nomination for president four years ago, said he was persuaded that his state needed to cut its income taxes and taxes on small businesses significantly when he studied data from the Internal Revenue Service that showed that Kansas was losing residents to states with lower taxes.
''My viewpoint, and the viewpoint of the majority of the Legislature, was we've got to change our tax policy to attract more people and attract more businesses,'' Mr. Brownback said in a telephone interview. ''We're just tired of losing in our league -- I consider the surrounding states as our league -- and we want to start gaining.''
Mr. Brownback said that he initially had hoped to pay for some of the lost revenues -- which are expected to reach a little over $800 million, or 13 percent of general fund revenues, next year -- by ending a number of popular tax deductions, and by phasing in the cuts slowly. But he could not find support for that, so, even as other states are beginning to add spending again, he has been looking for savings and more cuts to offset the projected loss in tax revenues. ''We are going to be going through everything with a fine-tooth comb,'' he said.
The recession and its aftermath have been a tumultuous time for state budgets. As they grappled with the steepest and longest drop in tax collections on record, states cut hundreds of billions of dollars in spending, and many raised taxes -- some temporarily -- to tide them over. Now, though, revenue has been steadily climbing back for nine straight quarters, and a division between Republican- and Democratic-controlled states is coming into sharp focus over whether to restore the lost services and jobs or to lower taxes, which in some states could effectively lock in some of the budget cuts made during the downturn.
Several Republican-led states see holding the line on taxes, or cutting them, as paramount. Ohio, which sharply cut aid to local governments and education during the downturn, announced this week that it had ended the year with a $235 million surplus. It was deposited in the state's rainy-day fund, and Gov. John R. Kasich, a Republican, warned that the money should not be used to restore spending cuts.
In Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Corbett, a Republican, signed a budget last month that eliminated a program that provided cash assistance to the disabled as it lowered some taxes. But in Oklahoma, where the energy sector has helped the economy, Gov. Mary Fallin, a Republican, failed to win passage of an ambitious income tax cut despite strong Republican majorities in the Legislature.
Some Democratic-led states are increasing taxes, saying that it is more important to try to restore the services that were cut -- and some of the 657,000 state and local government jobs lost -- during the downturn. In California, where temporary tax increases imposed during the recession were allowed to phase out before the state was back on solid fiscal footing, Gov. Jerry Brown is warning that the state will need to cut another $6 billion, largely from education, if voters fail to approve a tax increase he is seeking.
The effects of state taxes are hotly debated. This spring, when the George W. Bush Institute held a conference in New York on how to promote economic growth, panelist after panelist asserted that cutting state taxes would jolt the economy; Governor Brownback told the conference that his small-business tax cuts would be ''like shooting adrenaline into the heart of growing the economy.''
But the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonprofit research organization in Washington associated with Citizens for Tax Justice, which advocates a more progressive tax code, issued a report this year that found that the states with high income tax rates had outperformed those with no income tax over the past decade when it came to economic growth per capita and median family income.
The choices made by Kansas and Maryland could provide something of a real-time test of the prevailing political theories of taxing and spending -- though it could be years before the results are in.
When Governor O'Malley spoke here to mayors from across the state -- including more conservative mayors from the Eastern Shore of Maryland -- he got perhaps his warmest reception when he spoke about his desire to raise the gas tax so that he could begin to restore highway financing for municipalities, which he has reluctantly cut sharply in recent years.
''I haven't given up, and I have the scars to prove it,'' he said of his failed effort during the last session. ''I left a lot of blood on the battlefield, but I didn't drop the flag. The truth still remains: unless we update, and unless we find ways to invest in our transportation trust fund in a way that keeps pace with inflation, then every town and every city is going to suffer.''

HEADLINE: Pointless Pain In Spain

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Imposing suffering for no good reason. 

 BODY:
It's no fun being Prime Minister of a debtor nation without its own currency. Unlike the US or the UK, Spain has no easy options.
That said, the new austerity measures just announced make no sense at all.
According to news reports, Rajoy has announced 65 billion euros of tax increases and spending cuts; this will clearly deepen Spain's depression. So what purpose will this serve?
Think of Spain as facing a three-level problem. The topmost level is the problem of the banks; set that aside for now. Below that is the problem of sovereign debt. What makes the debt problem so serious, however, is the underlying problem of competitiveness: Spain needs to increase exports to make up for the jobs lost when its housing bubble burst. And it faces years of a highly depressed economy until costs have fallen enough relative to the rest of Europe to achieve the needed gain in competitiveness. 
So, what do the new austerity measures contribute to the solution of these problems?
Well, Spain's deficit will be smaller. Not 63 billion euros smaller, since the further depression of Spain's economy will reduce revenues; say it's 40 or 45 billion euros less debt, which is around 4 percent of Spanish GDP. Does anyone think this will make a big difference to the long-run fiscal outlook, or restore investor confidence?
What about competitiveness? Let's be frank and brutal: the European strategy is basically for debtor nations to achieve relative deflation via high unemployment. Think of it in terms of a Phillips curve:
I've drawn this curve very flat at high rates of unemployment - which is what all the evidence suggests. If nothing else, this crisis has given us overwhelming evidence that downward nominal wage rigidity is real and a major factor.
Now think about what Spain is doing: basically, it's moving from A to B - driving its unemployment rate even higher. This will possibly lead to a slight acceleration of the improvement in Spain's competitiveness. Maybe. But it won't be significant.
So, Rajoy is imposing harsh further austerity that will raise unemployment while making no significant dent in either the fiscal problem or the competitiveness problem. And this makes sense why?

HEADLINE: Filters and Full Employment (Not Wonkish, Really)

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: No, we aren't operating at potential. 

 BODY:
There's a mini-debate with important economic implications going on over the use of a statistical technique called the Hodrick-Prescott filter. Tim Duy has a round-up and some thoughts of his own. But I thought I should weigh in, partly because I encountered this very same issue way way back when regarding Japan (pdf), partly because what may look like a debate about statistical technique is actually a crucial debate about the nature of our ongoing economic disaster.
So, the HP filter is a technique that is supposed to extract underlying trends from data in which there is a lot of short-term fluctuation around the trend. To do this, it "smooths" the data -- roughly speaking, it takes a weighted average over a number of years. This smoothed measure is then supposed to represent the underlying trend.
When applied to business cycles, the HP filter finds a smoothed measure of real GDP, which is then taken to represent the economy's underlying potential, with deviations from this smoothed measure representing unsustainable temporary deviations from potential.
And what's happening now, as Tim Duy points out, is that some people -- including Fed officials -- are using this kind of filter to argue that the US economy is already operating near potential, so that there is no reason to pursue expansionary monetary and fiscal policy.
What's wrong with this view? The answer is that a statistical technique is only appropriate if the underlying assumptions behind that technique reflect economic reality -- and that's almost surely not the case here.
The use of the HP filter presumes that deviations from potential output are relatively short-term, and tend to be corrected fairly quickly. This is arguably true in normal times, although I would argue that the main reason for convergence back to potential output is that the Fed gets us there rather than some "natural" process.
But what happens in the aftermath of a major financial shock? The Fed finds itself up against the zero lower bound; it is reluctant to pursue unconventional policies on a sufficient scale; fiscal policy also gets sidetracked. And so the economy remains below potential for a long time.
Yet the methodology of using the HP filter basically assumes that such things don't happen. Instead, any protracted slump gets interpreted as a decline in potential output! Here's the chart I made way back in 1998 for the 1930s:
Yep: the HP filter "decided" that the US economy was back at potential by 1935. Why? Because it automatically interpreted the Great Depression as a sustained decline in potential, because by assumption the filter incorporated such slumps into its estimate of the economy's potential. Strange to say, however, it turned out that there was in fact a huge amount of excess capacity in America, needing only an increase in demand to be put back into operation.
It seems totally obvious to me that people who are now using HP filters to argue that we're already at full employment are making exactly the same mistake. They have in effect, without realizing it, assumed their answer -- using a statistical technique that only works if prolonged slumps below potential GDP can't happen.
As always, statistical techniques are only as good as the economic assumptions behind them. And in this case the assumptions are just wrong.

HEADLINE: Help Finding Savings Rates That Beat Inflation

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: A new Nerdwallet feature finds accounts that beat the rate of inflation. 

 BODY:
By now, everyone with a savings account knows that getting interest rates on your money anywhere near a measly 1 percent is increasingly difficult. With the Consumer Price Index running at 1.7 percent, most deposit accounts are losing money to inflation.
To help consumers find better yields to beat inflation, the Web site NerdWallet has started a monthly interest-rate monitor, which will feature deposit accounts that beat the C.P.I., the most widely used measure of inflation. (The Web site focuses on accounts that aren't tied to temporary promotions, but does identify significant promotional rates, too.)
This month, the feature began by identifying more than 1,300 different accounts that offered interest rates higher than the rate of inflation, as reported in June by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The accounts highlighted, however, were offered by credit unions, which may have restricted eligibility requirements for membership.
The highest rate found, for instance, was 2.85 percent annual percentage yield offered by Security Service Federal Credit Union in San Antonio, for a seven-year CD with a minimum of $100,000. While the credit union offers various ways to join, in general members must live or work in one of three states (Texas, Utah or Colorado).
NerdWallet also lists three institutions that offer checking or savings accounts that beat inflation (all offered 2 percent or higher), and all three are credit unions. NerdWallet says three-fourths of the accounts identified with a rate greater than 1.70 percent were from credit unions, not banks. If you see a rate you like, it's worth calling and asking if you can meet the institution's membership criteria.
The site offers a comparison of how inflation can affect your savings. For a consumer with $20,000, for instance, keeping the money in an account with a yield of 0.01 percent would mean you were losing $332 over the course of a year, assuming inflation was constant at 1.7 percent, the site explains.
In contrast, keeping it in the highest-rate C.D. available at Security Service would earn you $226 over the same period.
Do you take inflation into account when searching for a savings account or C.D.?

HEADLINE: Open Education for a Global Economy

BYLINE: DAVID BORNSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: A little-known company's success offering free online education around the world. 

 BODY:
If you or your kids have taken an online lesson at the Khan Academy (3,200 video lessons, 168 million views), been enlightened by a TED Talk (1,300 talks, 800 million views), watched a videotaped academic lecture (Academic Earth, Open Courseware Consortium, Open Culture), enrolled in a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course, now being offered by companies like Udacity and a growing list of universities, including M.I.T., Harvard and Stanford), or simply learned to play guitar, paint a landscape or make a soufflé via YouTube - then you know that the distribution channels of education have changed - and that the future of learning is and .
This is good news for everyone, but it is particularly good for the vast number of people around the world whose job prospects are constrained by their skill levels and who lack the resources to upgrade them through conventional training. It's a problem that a company based in Ireland called ALISON - Advanced Learning Interactive Systems Online - is helping to address with a creative model.

ALISON provides free online interactive education to help people acquire basic workplace skills. It's not a megasite. It has a million registered learners, the bulk of whom live in the United States, the United Kingdom, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, Nigeria and the Middle East, where ALISON has 200,000 students. It is adding 50,000 learners each month, but the kinds of services it offers are likely to proliferate in the coming years.
To understand why, we only have to think back to last week, when the big news was the release of the June jobs report, which found that the unemployment rate had stalled disappointingly at 8.2 percent. As always, the story behind that number is more noteworthy than the political spin it gets. According to the Department of Labor, the unemployment rate for people in "management, business and financial operations" is nowhere near 8.2 percent; it's only 3.8 percent. For workers in "installation, maintenance and repair," it's 5.3 percent. It's workers in certain occupations - like "transportation and material moving" (10.3 percent unemployment) and "construction and extraction" (13 percent) - who are experiencing the most severe economic pain.
That's because the skills of many workers are increasingly out of sync with the demands of the job market, and the gap is likely to grow, particularly given that only a minority of companies provide formal training to employees. This isn't just an American problem, however. There are 200 million unemployed people around the world, 75 million of whom are youths, and many lack rudimentary workplace skills - the ability to use a computer, make a budget, communicate in an office environment. According to a study published last month by the McKinsey Global Institute, by 2020, the world will have a of up to 95 million low-skill workers and a of up to 40 million college graduates.
Free and open online education could help close this gap, but only if it's intentionally directed to the people around the world who most need it. Right now, a lot of free education is thrown online without a clear sense of how it will help people prepare themselves for employment. In May, Unesco, the branch of the United Nations that focuses on education, held an international gathering in China, where representatives concluded that the development of technical and vocational education and training - what one official called the "poor cousin of mainstream education" -- should be deemed a "top priority" to tackle global unemployment.
ALISON addresses this need. It offers some 400 vocational courses at "certificate level" (1 to 2 hours of study) or "diploma level" (about 9 to 11 hours of study) and plans to add 600 more in the coming year. Its most popular course, ABC IT, is a 15- to 20-hour training suite that covers similar ground to the widely recognized International Computer Driving License curriculum. (ALISON's certification is free; ICDL certification can cost over $500). Other popular offerings are project management, accounting, customer service, human resources, Microsoft Excel, health studies, basic study skills, operations management and psychology.
Last year, 50,000 users earned certificates or diplomas, which indicate that they completed courses and scored 80 percent or above on ALISON's online assessment. Employers can verify an applicant's knowledge with an online "flash test" of randomized questions (reminiscent of typing tests for stenographers). ALISON doesn't have the capacity to track its learners' career progress, but it has thousands of testimonials on its Web site. A typical example is one from Mariyam Thiseena, from the Maldives, who wrote: "I love ALISON because you give the feeling that even the poorest person deserves an education." (Thiseena wrote to me that she found ALISON through Google and is currently pursuing a diploma in environmental engineering.)
Another student, Zakiyu Iddris Tandunayir, from Accra, Ghana, completed a diploma in social media marketing. "I've been interested in social media for a long time," he told me by phone, "but when I discovered ALISON, I committed myself to it. I studied day in and day out. I passed my exam, then I set up a page on Facebook to do social media for businesses. I put my number in there and people started calling me." Tandunayir added that he has since received contracts worth $700. "For my eight years of Internet experience I have never felt the way I feel now," he commented.
ALISON is a for-profit social enterprise. "My vision is that all basic education and training is freely accessible online worldwide and accessible by everyone," explains the company founder Mike Feerick, who received an award last year from Unesco for innovation in online workplace education and has been recognized by Ashoka as a social entrepreneur. "Education underpins all social progress. If we can improve the general education level worldwide, global poverty can be dealt with profoundly and a general standard of living can be vastly improved."
Feerick says that the scope of the problem necessitates a business approach. There is not enough philanthropy, and perhaps not even enough government investment, to meet the world's workplace development needs. (Seven percent of the world's people currently have college degrees.) ALISON works to leverage and redirect the large supply of for-profit courses, searching for high-quality vocational offerings and inviting publishers to put some of their courses on ALISON, available free. For example, it carries hundreds of hours of English and French language instruction from the British Council and Alliance Francaise. (It never offers short "teaser" courses that link to paid sites, only modules at a minimum of a certificate level.) It hunts for courses that meet the specific needs of workers or employers in specific industries. For instance, it offers a 5 to 6 hour diploma in European Union public procurement, which sounds a bit dry - unless you're applying for a job in a company that hopes to win contracts from the E.U., in which case it is a standout credential.
Publishers agree to work with ALISON because the company generates business leads for them and shares its revenues, mostly from advertising, sales of certificates and token fees from learners. (A graduate can purchase a paper certificate for $30 or one on parchment for $120, and opt to pay for premium access that loads slightly more quickly and has no ads.) Given its model, the more ALISON grows, the more free courses it will be able to offer.
The decision to make everything on ALISON free remains the key factor that distinguishes the site from others of its type, and makes it globally valuable. (In addition to English, there are courses in French, Spanish, Farsi and Arabic, and the platform is going to be translated into Arabic, Mandarin, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.) Unlike academic instruction, which is increasingly free online - you can take hundreds of lessons in algebra or calculus at the Khan Academy - quality workplace skills training is usually pricey. So is certification. Sites like Lynda.com, which offer training in software tools, require a paid subscription. Udemy, a relatively new education company with some excellent free courses, charges fees for many courses that offer workplace skills. If you're a would-be programmer from Egypt, there is a world of difference between a free course in Microsoft Access and one that costs $99.
Just as there is great variability in teacher quality, online education is a mixed bag. "There's an enormous amount of learning out there," notes Feerick. "There's also an enormous amount of rubbish. It's hard to make out the difference if you don't know what's coming. We turn down a huge number of courses that are low quality." What does ALISON look for? Feerick's staff members ask the following. "Is it good content? Is it interactive? Does it ask you to do something? Sometimes the content really lends itself to video - like language learning where you need pronunciation help. Does it flow logically? Is the content from a reliable source? Is there a way to assess the learning?"
In the United States, ALISON is now offered through government workplace centers in 18 states. When a job seeker goes to EmployFlorida or Virginia Workforce Connection, for example, he or she can work with a counselor to survey the job market and assess skill gaps. The client may then be referred to traditional brick and mortar training or ALISON courses. ALISON also supplies digital literacy training to public schools in the United States. 
Jaime Maniatis, the technology instructor at the Daylight/Twilight Alternative High School, in Trenton, N.J., which serves students who have previously dropped out, has been using its ABC IT course for a number of years. "It's accessible from any computer in the building," she said. "You can listen to it or read it, so it's good for E.S.L. students. It's interactive and has quizzes that help the students stay focused. And with all the cuts in education, it gives me security because I know I'll always be able to use it - because it's free." She added that this year, she plans to spend $165 for a premium service that is ad-free and allows her to track students' progress in three classrooms.
As the cost of formal education has skyrocketed and the job market continues to change at a rapid clip, the responsibility for keeping their skills up-to-date will likely fall more and more on individuals. Many will turn to online learning - for convenience and affordability. There are, of course, drawbacks to this. But there are advantages too - including the ability to work at your own pace and gain exposure to a broad array of topics. (The long tail of the Internet means that online courses can be highly specialized and still cost-effective. A university may offer a general electrical engineering course, but an online site can offer a course in how to operate a Siemens generator.) Perhaps the biggest advantage of online learning will be that women can more easily bypass the sexism and discrimination associated with traditional vocational education.
At ALISON, all students receive a learning record, a kind of archive of their response to life's vicissitudes. Feerick notes: "The record says, 'I might be 58 years of age, but I'm still learning.'"

HEADLINE: FAO Yields to Meat Industry Pressure on Climate Change

BYLINE: ROBERT GOODLAND


HIGHLIGHT: Exactly how much human-caused greenhouse gas is actually caused by livestock? 

 BODY:
The past year has been the warmest ever in the United States, with record heat sweeping across the country last week, causing at least 52 human deaths and also harming livestock. In fact, livestock are not only harmed by human-caused global-warming greenhouse gas, but also cause about 18 percent of it, according to "Livestock's Long Shadow," a 2006 UN Food and Agriculture Organization report by FAO livestock specialists (who normally promote livestock).
In contrast, environmental specialists employed by two other United Nations specialized agencies, the World Bank and International Finance Corporation, have developed a widely-cited assessment that at least 51 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas is attributable to livestock. I'm one of those specialists.
One might expect the FAO to work objectively to determine whether the true figure is closer to 18 percent or 51 percent. Instead, Frank Mitloehner, known for his claim that 18 percent is much too high a figure to use in the U.S., was announced last week as the chair of a new partnership between the meat industry and FAO.
FAO's new partners include the International Meat Secretariat and International Dairy Federation. Their stated objective is to "assess the environmental performance of the livestock sector" and "to improve that performance," starting with a three-year project to establish "methods and guidelines."
Yet within five years, greenhouse gas may increase to irreversibly catastrophic levels if nothing is done to change course, according to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency.
The new partnership assumes that meat production worldwide will "more than double" from 1999 to 2050. But the International Food Policy Research Institute has set out a scenario by which meat production will decline at least through 2030. Climate authorities like Lord Nicholas Stern, author of the seminal Stern Review on the economics of climate change, and Rajendra Pachauri, IPCC chair, have even recommended vegetarian diets to reverse climate change.
FAO's new activity isn't entirely a surprise, as its livestock specialists have elsewhere acted to reverse a common perception that a prescription for less livestock was built into their report "Livestock's Long ShadowFor example, its lead author and a co-author later wrote to prescribe more factory farming, not less, and no limit on meat.
Yet "Livestock's Long Shadow" may not be uniformly endorsed by the whole FAO, as it invited Jeff Anhang and me to present our analysis first at FAO headquarters in Rome, then in Berlin.
FAO's basic purpose is to "promote the common welfare" in a "neutral forum." However, FAO's new partnership includes only four wealthy countries, and no poor country. Yet the former director general of the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), which normally promotes livestock, expressed concern about the impacts of industrially-produced meat on the poor - saying that "factory-farmed" livestock eat grains "that might instead have fed people."
Factory farming was criticized even by a co-author of "Livestock's Long Shadow," Cornelius De Haan, when he was lead author of the World Bank's 2001 livestock strategy. That strategy pegged livestock's adverse impacts at a lower level than in the 2006 "Livestock's Long Shadow"yet the World Bank strategy recommends that institutions should "avoid funding large-scale commercial, grain-fed feedlot systems and industrial milk, pork, and poultry production."
Conversely, the stated goal of Frank Mitloehner, chair of FAO's new partnership, is to promote intensified livestock production.
A new ILRI strategy concludes that "livestock is back on the global agenda," and that increased productivity must come from "intensified" systems. A videotape reveals a push for research to support ILRI's predetermined conclusions, as the new director general states: "How do we elevate the livestock game?...In the past we have not looked so much at the issue of food consumption in urban areas...A good bit of the negative criticism of livestock is its contribution to greenhouse gases and its very high environmental footprint - so we must develop stronger research responses to these challenges."
Evidence shows that ILRI may fear public acceptance of our widely cited assessment that livestock are responsible for at least 51 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas. ILRI was sufficiently concerned about acceptance of the 51 percent figure that it raised the issue with its annual meeting's participants before, during, and after its 2010 meeting - and found that acceptance of the 51 percent figure by the meeting's participants actually rose from about 1.5 percent before the meeting to about 7.5 percent after the meeting.
Yet "Livestock's Long Shadow" apparently undercounted by a large margin the amount of land used for livestock and feed production - estimating it at 30 percent of all land on earth, while ILRI has estimated it at 45 percent. Other gaps in "Livestock's Long Shadow" may have occurred because it was authored by livestock specialists - while international good practice in environmental assessment is to have projects with major environmental impacts (such as global livestock and feed production) be assessed by environmental assessment specialists.
The key difference between the 18 percent and 51 percent figures is that the latter accounts for how exponential growth in livestock production (now more than 60 billion land animals per year), accompanied by large scale deforestation and forest-burning, have caused a dramatic decline in the earth's photosynthetic capacity, along with large and accelerating increases in volatilization of soil carbon.
Agriculture is outdoors to a unique degree, exposing it to greater risk from emissions attributable to livestock than any other industry's risk from the same emissions. So food industry leaders have a compelling commercial incentive to reduce these emissions.
While the FAO and ILRI argue that millions of poor people have no alternative to raising livestock for their livelihoods, tens of millions of poor people's livestock have died in the past few years because of climate disasters. Replacing them would risk a similar fate for the new animals.
Conversely, replacing at least a quarter of today's livestock products with better alternatives would both reduce emissions and allow forest to regenerate on a vast amount of land, which could then absorb excess atmospheric carbon to reduce it to a safe level. This may be the only pragmatic way to reverse climate change in the next five years as needed. Sufficient renewable energy infrastructure is projected to take at least 20 years and $18 trillion to develop.
Substitutes for livestock products require no subsidies or offsets. Consumers can buy more of them tomorrow.

On Tuesday I wrote about the income and wealth distribution of today's workers versus those of a generation earlier, based on a new report from the Pew Economic Mobility Project.
In the report, Pew researchers also examined mobility trends within individual families: That is, regardless of what the generations as a whole look like, are today's Americans better off than their own parents?
The answer depends on how you define "better off."
Pew uses two different metrics for intergenerational economic mobility: mobility, and mobility.
For incomes, "absolute" mobility refers to whether an individual earns more money than his parents did, in inflation-adjusted terms. For example, your parents earned $30,000, and you now earn $50,000. "Relative" mobility refers to whether an individual has been able to move into a different socioeconomic class from the one he was born into; for example, a child born into the bottom income quintile manages to make it to the very top of the income distribution as an adult.
In absolute terms, intergenerational income mobility looks pretty good. Five out of every six Americans have family incomes that are higher than their own respective parents' incomes were:
The country looks far less mobile when you look at relative income classes, though. Americans born into the very top or bottom quintiles were likely to remain there as adults:
If there were complete income mobility, you might expect that people born into any given income class would be about equally likely to end up in any other income class. Instead, 40 percent of those raised in the top income quintile stay there as adults. Just 8 percent of those born into the top quintile fall to the bottom quintile when they grow up.
The Horatio Alger stories are also few and far between, with just 4 percent of people born into the bottom quintile rising to the top one by adulthood. As with the top quintile, 40 percent of those born into the lowest income class stay there.
The wealth numbers show somewhat less mobility, at least in absolute terms.
Only half of Americans are wealthier than their parents were. What's more, children born into the top wealth quintile were likely to surpass their parents' affluence (and their parents' incomes, too, as you may have noticed from the earlier chart):
Nearly three-quarters of people born into the bottom of the wealth distribution ended up richer than their parents were, whereas only one-quarter of people born into the very top of the wealth distribution accumulated a bigger fortune than their parents had.
These figures probably paint a sunnier portrait of the financial situation of the poor than is the case, since the measures do not show the magnitude of the wealth gap between parent and child.
If you grew up with parents who were broke, for example, having even a dollar to your name technically makes you richer than your folks. But you still don't have any semblance of financial security. Likewise, given the growth at the very top of the wealth distribution, the rich children who are worth more than their rich parents are probably orders of magnitude richer than their parents.
As with incomes, relative mobility in the wealth distribution is also somewhat discouraging. The class you were born into is pretty "sticky," especially if you were very poor or very rich.
Of Americans born into the bottom quintile of wealth, 41 percent remain there in adulthood, double the share you would expect if wealth were randomly assigned. Likewise, 41 percent of Americans born into the top quintile of wealth remain there as adults. Just 7 percent of the richest Americans topple all the way to the bottom.
As I noted in the last post, Pew's calculations are all based on the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, or P.S.I.D., a longitudinal data set that has followed families from 1968 to the present. The wealth numbers in particular are based on parents' wealth in 1984 versus the mean of their children's wealth as measured in 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009.

HEADLINE: When Federal Spending Expands the Economy

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Government spending that does not go for goods or services rendered -- like unemployment insurance -- generally leads to a smaller economy, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
The stimulus effect of government spending depends very much on the composition of that spending on purchases and on transfer payments.
Government spending on military personnel and purchases of military equipment vary considerably over time and across different countries. As a result, a number of studies have tried to estimate the effects of military spending on employment and gross domestic product.
Prof. Robert Barro of Harvard has worked years on this topic, with his most recent estimates prepared with Charles Redlick in 2009. They find that military purchases reduce the size of the civilian economy, but the civilian reduction is less than the military expansion, so the net result is a larger economy.
Another way to look at it: some additional military resources come from the civilian business sector, but the rest comes from people and materials that would be not be engaged in the economy at all.

By the same logic, government spending on road building, scientific research and other projects could expand the economy, although in the process they might reduce the size of the private sector. Perhaps road building and scientific research would even expand the economy in the long term as they made labor and capital more productive.
However, government purchases are a minority of federal government spending. The rest consists largely of transfer payments and interest payments on the federal debt. For example, the federal government spent $3.9 trillion in calendar year 2011, of which $2.3 trillion was on transfer payments such as Social Security benefits, unemployment insurance and food stamps.
At first glance, there would appear to be little economic difference between government purchases and transfer payments, because in both cases the government writes a check, so to speak. When the check goes to a person for helping to build a fighter plane or highway, it's called a purchase; when the government writes a check to an unemployed person it's called a transfer. In both cases, the government must tax or borrow to finance the payment.
However, the economic effects of purchases and transfers are quite different. Government checks written for purchases of equipment, roads and so on are payments contingent on work and production: the people cashing the checks received them by virtue of producing something the government values. Moreover, all people use the roads, schools, parks and other projects built by the government without any assessment of their financial worth.
In contrast, people cashing transfer checks are not required to produce anything in return - and, as with unemployment insurance, for example, receive them because they are not producing anything. People who produce too much are ineligible for such payments.
Economists have found that the government gets roughly what it pays for. When it pays people to produce, a number of people accept that offer, and the economy is larger as a result. When government pays people for not producing, a number of people, in effect, accept that offer by working or earning less, and the result is a smaller economy.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act included purchases and transfers (as well as so-called tax credits, which are another story, discussed in a previous post). The transfers served to shrink the economy, while the purchases may have pushed to expand it.
On balance, that is why many Americans had trouble seeing much net economic expansion produced by the act.
