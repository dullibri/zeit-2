HEADLINE: On, And Off, The Wall

 BODY:
THE economy may be bleak, the art auctions listless, but you wouldn't know it from the scene at Manhattan art galleries now. Chelsea's putting on more than a brave face: it's more fierce and exciting than ever, even as the Lower East Side maintains its once-subversive, still surprising edge; elegant Upper East Side aeries groan under marquee names; and SoHo fights mall status with a new and refreshing energy. Bare walls are rare. The weekend stroll is crowded. 
 In a season of such busy-ness -- if not business -- gallery going can be bewildering, even for the experienced. So take the following pages as your autumn gallery guide. Four scouts -- art critics of The New York Times -- have canvassed the prime gallery neighborhoods to offer a field report. It is of course only a sampling of what's available in Manhattan (and only Manhattan) right now, but it does represent much of the best. 
 Some tips for those new to the scene: Comfortable shoes are in order. So are open minds. (Black turtlenecks are optional.) And remember, gallery hopping is the best deal in town. If you're just looking, great art doesn't cost a dime.

HEADLINE: Federal Aid to Hospitals

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 Re ''Hurting for Business'' (Business Day, Nov. 7): 
 When Congress reconvenes, it is imperative that the urgent and worsening fiscal needs of America's hospitals be addressed. 
 Two sensible actions are a new economic stimulus package that includes a temporary increase in the federal share of Medicaid payments to states and a modern version of the Hill-Burton Act, the 1946 law that provided federal grants and low-cost loans to improve the capital structure of the nation's hospital system.
 This is especially important today because the tax-exempt bond market -- the financing mechanism favored by most not-for-profit hospitals -- is virtually frozen shut. 
 Hospitals struggle with shrinking reimbursements, soaring medical malpractice costs, and the swelling ranks of the uninsured in the best of economic times. And whether the stock market is sky high or falling fast, their doors are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
 More than ever, hospitals deserve the government's strong support.

 LAWYERS FILE CASE IN SPAIN
 On 1989 El Salvador Massacre
 Using the Spanish legal principle that crimes against humanity can be prosecuted anywhere, human rights lawyers filed a criminal complaint to revisit one of the most notorious events of El Salvador's civil war: the killing of six Jesuit priests by the Salvadoran Army in 1989. Among those named is the Salvadoran president at the time, Alfredo Cristiani Burkard, and 14 former members of the military. PAGE A10
 SOME WANT TO LEAVE WEST BANK
 The majority of West Bank settlers vow never to abandon the heart of the historic Jewish homeland, but thousands of others say they want to move back to within the pre-1967 borders of Israel. They say that the West Bank settlement enterprise -- at least that part beyond the barrier of wall and fence that Israel has been building -- is doomed and that their lives are at risk. Many say something else as well: The Israeli occupation of land claimed by the Palestinians is wrong. PAGE A6 
 CRITICISM OF RUSSIAN THREAT
 Russia's threat to station missiles along its border with Europe drew strong criticism from senior United States and European officials as they prepared to confront President Dmitri A. Medvedev on the matter before heading together to Washington to discuss reforming the world financial system. The president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, warned that ''cold war rhetoric'' over the issue was ''stupid.'' PAGE A12
 BOMBER HITS AMERICAN CONVOY
 A day after a fierce suicide bombing in southern Afghanistan, insurgents struck an American military convoy in a crowded market in the eastern part of the country, and officials said one soldier and 18 civilians were killed. A suicide car bomber approached the convoy and then swerved into the market around 8 a.m. PAGE A8
 BULGARIA'S FABRIC OF CORRUPTION
 A nongovernmental global watchdog called Bulgaria the most corrupt country in the European Union, but exposing that corruption is not a battle for the fainthearted. The coroner of the capital, Sofia, tried. He died hanging from the jungle gym of a city playground, leaving behind what his longtime staff considered cryptic clues that pointed toward suicide. PAGE A13
 QAEDA'S STRENGTHENING TIES
 Even as Al Qaeda strengthens its hub in the Pakistani mountains, its leaders are building closer ties to regional militant groups in order to launch attacks in Africa and Europe and on the Arabian Peninsula, said the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Michael V. Hayden. PAGE A12

 AS PARTY REGROUPS AFTER ELECTION,
 G.O.P. Veterans Set Examples
 As Congressional Republicans lick their political wounds and try to figure out how to bounce back in 2010 and beyond, they might want to consult with Susan Collins, Lamar Alexander and Peter T. King. The three veteran politicians agreed a more conservative, combative party focused on narrow partisan issues is not the answer. PAGE A22
 VATICAN EXCOMMUNICATES PRIEST 
 The Vatican has informed a Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. Roy Bourgeois, that he will be excommunicated for participating in a ceremony it considers illicit and invalid: the ordination of a woman as a priest. PAGE A19
 U.S. TO DETAIN CHINESE PRODUCTS
 All products from China that contain milk will be detained at the border until tests prove that they are not contaminated, the federal government announced. The Food and Drug Administration issued the alert because of concerns about Chinese products being contaminated with the toxic chemical melamine. PAGE A18
 PLAN TO REMOVE DAMS ON KLAMATH
 The Bush administration joined with the states of Oregon and California and PacifiCorp, a major power generating company, to endorse a plan to remove four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River by 2020. The agreement can be seen as marking the end to a bitter struggle among conservationists, Indian tribes and fishermen in the Klamath basin, on the one hand, and farmers and local communities on the other.

 A LAST TUNE FOR SEATTLE'S TUBA MAN
 Edward Scott McMichael was a busker with perfect pitch and an improbable horn whom most people in Seattle knew by another name, Tuba Man. His mission was to make music in the streets and that he did. But a month ago, he was bludgeoned to death. Along with the president of the Seattle Mariners, Chuck Armstrong, more than 1,000 people turned out for a memorial service near Qwest Stadium. PAGE A14

 ARGUING FOR A CHANCE 
 At a Police Uniform
 Specialist Osvaldo Hernandez, just returned from Afghanistan, appeared in court to argue that he had turned his life around so impressively since his guilty plea to illegal gun possession in 2002 that he deserved the judge's help to realize his dream of joining the New York police force. The judge agreed. But police officials have said that the city's administrative code forbids hiring anyone with a felony conviction as a police officer. PAGE A25 
 TRYING TO SERVE UP SALES
 Employing the same social lubricant that may coax timid traders onto a dance floor Kipton Davis, a real estate broker, lured a half-dozen bankers, traders and friends on a condo tour of four TriBeCa buildings by offering wine and whiskey at every stop. ''Alcohol brings everyone together,'' Ms. Davis said after showing the group a $9.9 million penthouse with an eight-seat hot tub. But did it loosen wallets? PAGE A28

 INDIANS PITCHER BOUNCES BACK
 In an Award-Winning Way
 Cliff Lee's career has had some ups and downs: he finished fourth in the balloting for the American League Cy Young Award in 2005; in 2007, the Indians left him off the playoff roster after a dismal season that included an abdominal injury and a demotion to the minors. This was one of those up years: a 22-3 record with a 2.54 E.R.A. for a .500-team. And it won him the American League Cy Young award. PAGE B17 
 ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN
 For the last six years, the federal agent Jeff Novitzky has been at the heart of virtually every major investigation into the use of performance-enhancing drugs by professional athletes. But he now finds himself left on the periphery of one of the highest-profile cases resulting from it all, the perjury investigation into Roger Clemens. PAGE B11
 ANTIDOPING COMPANY SHUTS DOWN
 In 2007, the Agency for Cycling Ethics was a leader of the new antidoping paradigm in cycling. It was seeking to compile a physiological baseline for each athlete, so that any sudden variation may indicate the body's reaction to doping. But it quietly closed its doors last week. PAGE B13 
 A SPORTING ALTERNATIVE
 Few will draw parallels to a certain Giants Stadium co-tenant if the Red Bulls can complete an unlikely journey to the Super Bowl of Major League Soccer, better known as the MLS Cup, Harvey Araton writes. But he warns against dismissing soccer in America as primarily kid stuff, the sporting equivalent of the piano recital. Sports of The Times. PAGE B11

 SUMMIT MEETING WILL CLARIFY
 Reshaped Economic Map
 Whatever else this weekend's summit meeting by the Group of 20 nations may or may not accomplish, it stands to clarify one thing: how completely the world economic crisis is reshaping the economic map -- rendering obsolete the old club of Western powers that fashioned the financial pillars of the post-World War II era. PAGE B4
 MANAGERS BACK HEDGE FUND RULES
 Five prominent hedge fund managers, testifying before a House committee, said that they would support rules that required hedge funds to provide information about their funds to a regulator, provided the information was not divulged to the public. The strength of their support varied, however, and they disagreed over whether the tax treatment of their funds should be changed and on the need for restrictions on their use of leverage. PAGE B6
 WRONG KIND OF HIT FOR G.M.
 General Motors and NBC worked together on the TV drama ''My Own Worst Enemy,'' forming a partnership that represented a big push for both. The idea for G.M. was to sell vehicles that were also integrated into the show; for NBC is was finding an advertiser to help underwrite some of the production costs of a series. NBC says it still likes the idea. But it canceled the show. PAGE B10
 CHINA EASES MEDIA RESTRICTIONS
 China agreed to loosen restrictions on foreign news and information providers inside the country, settling a trade dispute with the United States, the European Union and Canada. The agreement allows international news and information agencies to more freely compete and sell their services inside China, where government controls were tightened in 2006. PAGE B2

 Recast your mental image of wine country with its rustic charms. A small group of vintners is abandoning the countryside and opening wineries in old factories and industrial showrooms in cities across the country. Even the Brooklyn waterfront in Williamsburg now has its own winery. PAGE D1
 A PLACE FOR SCIENCE LOVERS
 If your idea of fun is investigating the structure of DNA or designing a faster toy bobsled, Boston is an inspiring place to spend a few days. One essential stop on the science circuit is the M.I.T.

Another is the Boston Museum of Science, with its hundreds of interactive and informational displays and kiosks on dozens of topics. PAGE D1

 MI6'S FINEST IS BACK IN ACTION,
 Now With 50 Percent More Angst
 ''Quantum of Solace'' is heavy on the violence and brooding, which almost prompts one to quote a famous movie villain of this year: ''Why so serious?'' Daniel Craig's James Bond is a different animal than the series has been accustomed to, which has always had a hint, if not more, of mischief to go with the gadgets and womanizing. This Bond is angry, has a serious problem with authority and brings to the table a brutal violence, A. O. Scott writes. Page C1
 BACK, LOUD, CRASS AND GLORIOUS
 It was heavy metal at its unadulterated, unapologetic finest, complete with a giant inflatable and barely clothed woman, and AC/DC blasted Madison Square Garden on Wednesday. The band's tour is in honor of its recent album, its first in eight years, ''Black Ice.'' While the band, and the crowd, showed their age, the performance was still what AC/DC always has been about -- unrelenting riffs, base lyrics and astonishing volume, Jon Caramanica writes. Page C6 
 AN ARRAY OF MODERN ANTIQUES
 The prices are fair, nobody is cutting them but as always they are all negotiable. ''Modernism: A Century of Style and Design, 1905-2005,'' at the Armory on Park Avenue, gives its dealers only one day to set up, forcing them to do without lavish stands or trappings and allow the pieces to speak for themselves. Some choice finds are on display in this version, the 23rd since the event's inception, Wendy Moonan writes. Page C31 
 VIOLENCE, RAPTURE AND DANCE
 Robert Battle doesn't usually stoop to explaining his modern dance creations. Often he allows the viewers to draw conclusions of their own. But in ''An Evening With Robert Battle: Signature Solos,'' he broke with tradition, saying that everything the audience would see on stage was valid -- and what they liked was even better. A collection of his choreography from 1992 to 2008, it was full of leading spins and falls. His informal manner suggests a possible ambassadorship for modern dance in his future, Claudia La Rocco writes. Page C6 
 IN THE VEIN OF 'ARE YOU KIDDING?'
 Do you trust your cat to win a million dollars? Do you know what your cat is thinking? A program on GSN, ''Meow Mix Think Like a Cat Game Show,'' may be responsible for bringing about the apocalypse. An embarrassing half-hour of television boils down to little more than a thinly veiled attempt to sell cat food. A million-dollar prize is dangled before the participants and it hinges seemingly on the level of telepathic connection they have with their house pet, Neil Genzlinger writes. Page C16 
 Editorial
 IN IT TOGETHER
 It is tempting to dismiss Saturday's economic summit. President Bush is discredited and on his way out. President-elect Barack Obama has decided, rightly, to stay away. There is a pressing need for leaders to agree on basic steps to jump-start the sagging world economy. The leaders can also begin a serious discussion about the roots of the financial crisis. Page A28
 THE HIGH COST OF HARSH WORDS
 Steve Levy, the Suffolk County executive, is learning that words have consequences. After seven teenagers were charged in the fatal stabbing of Marcello Lucero, an Ecuadorean immigrant, Mr. Levy's past harsh words and actions against undocumented workers have left him cornered with a tragically limited ability to lead the county in confronting this brutal act.

 A Detroit bailout would set a precedent for every single politically connected corporation in America. It is all a reminder that the biggest threat to a healthy economy is not the socialists of campaign lore.

HEADLINE: For a Man Left Alone With 3 Small Children, Help Setting Up a Home

BYLINE: By ANGELICA MEDAGLIA

 BODY:
The second-floor apartment Carlos Feliciano found on a short, hilly street in Highland Park, Brooklyn, not far from the shelter where he and his family had been living, was supposed to be the start of their new life. It was, but not the way he expected. 
 Days after the move his wife, then 22, broke off their strained relationship in letters that she left on the kitchen table, he said. In one, she asked him to take care of their children: Atabeishka, Lennix and Lydiana, all under 6 then. 
It was Dec. 19, 2007, more than a year after the family had moved to New York from Puerto Rico ''seeking a better life,'' he said. They had lived with relatives at first. Mr. Feliciano worked for nine months at a Fresh Direct food packaging plant in Queens, and the family moved to a basement apartment, but he injured his back and was unemployed for several months, he said. When the landlord asked them to leave, his wife suggested they move to the shelter. 
 Once he had moved into the Highland Park apartment and was bringing in a slim income, Mr. Feliciano had more immediate problems than wondering what had happened to his marriage. He needed a better job; the children needed a routine of food and care. 
 During the months that his marriage was in peril, Mr. Feliciano had learned to cook by phoning his mother for advice. Now his mother, Blanca Matias, left her home in the Bronx to stay with her son and grandchildren for long stretches.
 The two-bedroom apartment began to fill up. The statue of Baby Jesus with its pink tunic and outstretched arms was fastened to the outside door; white curtains and a painting of a Caribbean scene were hung in the empty living room. An orderliness that even the play of three children could not undo became soothingly familiar. 
 Support came from the people and the services that helped Mr. Feliciano gain financial footing. Through WeCare, an employment program run by the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, Mr. Feliciano used only a small portion of his income on rent, and committed to save 20 percent for two years -- an amount that WeCare would match for future housing expenses. 
 WeCare helped him find work at Kennedy Airport as a driver and cleaner for $8 an hour. Though his home is not far from the airport, it was a tough commute: ''I would get up at 3 a.m. to catch the J train and switch for the Q10 bus on 121st Street to be at the airport by 6 a.m.,'' he said. 
 In August, Mr. Feliciano started a $9-an-hour job as a delivery driver for Howard Medical, a manufacturer delivering products throughout the city. And his food stamps have been increased to $549 a month. 
 This year, too, Mr. Feliciano brought order to his living room. The Neediest Cases Fund gave him $347 to buy a futon and two chests of drawers for his daughter Atabeishka, 6, and his son, Lennix, 3. Mr. Feliciano bought a third bureau with his own money for his 2-year-old, Lydiana. 
 Mr. Feliciano's wife has reappeared. She visits the children once a week, he said. 
 In March, a family court judge gave him temporary custody of the children. Mr. Feliciano hopes he will win full custody this month because then he would be eligible for subsidized housing under Section 8, he said. 
 Mr. Feliciano, now 27, is optimistic about the future: ''I want to study English, and I want to have a career.'' 
 He is patient with his children, and this, too, is a conscious choice. ''My father abused my mother; he hit her every day,'' he said. ''But I will never hit a woman. And I am not going to do to my children what my father did to me. I want them to have all the things that I could have had, but didn't.''

HEADLINE: Many Line Up for Cash, But Bailout Plan Falters

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED; Vikas Bajaj contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As the government's financial rescue enters a new phase, Wall Street and many ordinary Americans are wondering the same thing: Is any of this working? 
 The short answer is not nearly as much, or as fast, as many had hoped. 
 More than a month and nearly $300 billion into the initial effort, many of the nation's financial arteries seem nearly as sclerotic as they were before. Some of them, in fact, appear to be hardening more. 
 Loans are scarce, and for many people, getting scarcer. Home mortgage rates have barely eased. While solid corporations can borrow money again in the market for commercial paper -- those crucial short-term i.o.u.'s that companies rely on to pay day-to-day bills -- trickier forms of financing remain elusive. Hard-pressed companies are still virtually shut out of the capital markets. 
 The financial blockages, real and feared, were on display Thursday during another spasmodic day on Wall Street. After three days of losses, each worse than the one before, stocks tumbled to their lowest level since 2003 -- and then bolted higher in the final hours. The Dow Jones industrials closed up 552 points, or 6.7 percent. 
 But with a recession, perhaps a long one, now at hand, and uncertainty swirling around the course of further government bailouts, wild swings have become the new normal.
 The Treasury's about-face on Wednesday, when it officially abandoned its original strategy of buying troubled assets from banks, did little to ease investors' anxiety.
 The Bush administration now says it will try to jump-start the stalled credit markets with new lending programs, rather than by buying troubled assets from banks. But the line for help at the Treasury keeps getting longer. A big commercial lender, the CIT Group, applied to become a bank on Thursday in hopes of qualifying for rescue money. American Express took the same step earlier this week. And then, of course, there is the beleaguered auto industry. 
 ''What hasn't improved is the psychology,'' said Max Bublitz, chief strategist at SCM Advisors, an investment firm based in San Francisco. ''This thing has morphed from a credit market issue into a banking crisis into an economic crisis.''
 Some parts of the credit markets have gotten better. Commercial paper rates have fallen markedly in the last few weeks, as have key rates like the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, the benchmark for trillions of dollars of corporate loans and home mortgages. The three-month Libor has fallen to 2.15 percent, from 4.82 percent in early October, when many banks were reluctant to lend to each other. 
 But other parts of the markets remain frozen. Borrowing costs are still elevated for creditworthy companies, as well as for state and local governments. Even banks that are getting money from the government are reluctant to lend, much to the government's consternation. The vast market for bonds backed by credit card debt, auto loans and student loans has effectively shut down. No new credit card securities have been issued since the crisis reached a fever pitch in September.
 The Treasury has thrown a lot of money at the problem. During the last month, the government pumped nearly $300 billion into more than 40 banks and financial companies, including the American International Group, the tottering insurance giant. Banks have until Friday to apply for money under the original program. 
 So far, the Treasury has identified only a handful of the recipients. The government says it does not want to stigmatize companies for accepting -- or being refused -- government money. 
 The takers include nine big banks that are likely to dominate the new landscape of American banking, among them Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, as well as the humbled Wall Street giants Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The rest of the money is going to more than 30 banks, big and small, spread across the country. 
 But now that the Treasury has abandoned its plan to buy the toxic assets of banks, other companies, including insurers and student loan companies, are lining up too. Many on Wall Street say they believe that the cost of the rescue is certain to exceed the $700 billion that was originally designated for it.
 ''Let's be realistic, $700 billion is not enough,'' H. Rodgin Cohen, the chairman of Sullivan & Cromwell and one of the pre-eminent lawyers for Wall Street firms, said at a conference hosted by The Deal magazine on Wednesday. ''I think it's the 'T-word,' '' he said, referring to $1 trillion.
 While many of the banks have yet to receive their money from the Treasury, few are rushing to make the loans that companies and consumers need to cushion the economic slump. 
 Take Cascade Financial, a community bank based in Everett, Wash. Hurt by investments in the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Cascade intends to use the $39 million it hopes to get from the government to bolster its own balance sheet. Only then will it consider lending. 
 ''As a bank, we'd like to make prudent loans,'' said Lars H. Johnson, Cascade's chief financial officer. ''If we have the capital wherewithal, we'd do that. But we have to weigh that against what's going on in the economy.''
 Beginning with $125 billion given to the nine large banks, the government has worked its way down to small community lenders. But not all of those banks are in dire shape. 
 Consider Saigon National, a one-branch, three-year-old bank in Orange County, Calif., that bills itself as the hometown lender of the local Vietnamese community. Saigon National is set to receive $1.5 million, even though a key measure of the bank's financial strength was four times as high as the minimum required by regulators. 
 For John J. Kennedy, Saigon National's chief executive, applying for a piece of the bailout was an easy decision. His bank was well capitalized, he said. But getting an additional $1.5 million for the tiny firm -- the smallest preliminary award announced by any bank so far -- would accelerate its growth plans tremendously. 
 ''I said, 'Let's move it up, let's take the money while it's available,' '' he said.
 Unlike many other banks, Mr. Kennedy said, Saigon National will use the government money as Congress apparently intended: to make loans to its community. Other banks hope to use the money to acquire weaker rivals and bring about a rapid industry consolidation, which the Treasury seems to be encouraging. 
 But for some banks, going cap in hand to the government was not easy. 
 ''It's the hardest decision I've made,'' said Curtis L. Hage, the chairman and chief executive of HF Financial in Sioux Falls, S.D. His company, which runs Home Federal Bank, has won preliminary approval for $25 million. Now, Mr. Hage must take the proposal to his board next week.

HEADLINE: The Overlooked Economic Crisis, Influential Still

BYLINE: By BARRY GEWEN

 BODY:
THE GREAT INFLATION AND ITS AFTERMATH
 The Past and Future of American Affluence
 By Robert J. Samuelson
 309 pages. Random House. $26.
 Robert J. Samuelson, an economics columnist for Newsweek and The Washington Post, says historians have not understood the significance of the ''Great Inflation'' that raged through the economy in the late 1970s and early '80s. It was, he argues in ''The Great Inflation and Its Aftermath,'' one of those watershed moments in American history, not at the level of the Civil War or the Great Depression, to be sure, but perhaps the major turning point of the postwar era. 
 In 1976 the Consumer Price Index rose by 4.9 percent; over the next few years it climbed steadily until it reached double digits, 13.3 percent in 1979 and 12.5 percent in 1980. And with these rising prices, productivity declined, standards of living fell, investors fled the stock market, debt crises followed one upon another. Almost everyone was affected, and not just in their wallets and bank accounts. 
 As he writes, '' 'The economy' is also a social, political and psychological process,'' and the Great Inflation, he explains, did real damage to the American psyche, engendering a feeling of hopelessness, causing citizens to lose confidence in their political and economic institutions. An inflationary psychology took hold, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy as wages chased prices in an ever more destructive cycle. ''In all of American history,'' Mr. Samuelson writes, ''this inflation had no comparable precedent.'' 
 And who was to blame for this unparalleled disruption, this system-threatening state of affairs? According to Mr. Samuelson, we all were. Pogo Possum said, ''We have met the enemy and he is us.'' Mr. Samuelson says so too.
 His tale of culpability begins at the end of World War II. With the Depression a recent memory, Americans entered peacetime worried above all about the return of widespread joblessness. In 1947 Harry S. Truman declared, ''The job today is to see to it that America is not ravaged by recurring depressions and long periods of unemployment.'' Dwight D. Eisenhower agreed. But it was under John F. Kennedy that the nation ambitiously shifted from fighting unemployment to promoting ''full employment.'' 
 Armed with the tools of Keynesianism, Kennedy's team of economic advisers believed they could fine-tune the economy, controlling business cycles and eliminating the possibility of recession. Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon and Jimmy Carter all went along with the new thinking, as did the economists at the Federal Reserve, whose easy-money policies abetted the politicians' full-employment aspirations. A bipartisan consensus had been achieved. But, Mr. Samuelson says, the consensus was wrong. ''Wishful thinking'' had triumphed over reality. 
 Reality came in the form of inflationary pressures. Beginning in the mid-1960s policies intended to promote full employment -- tax cuts, budget deficits, low interest rates, easy credit -- were pushing prices up. Presidents, both Democratic and Republican, chose to ignore the warning signs, or to administer weak palliatives until it was too late. Once the inflationary mentality set in, only the harshest medicine would work. Inflation had to be wrung out of the economy. The costs would be high.
 At this point Mr. Samuelson's story enters its heroic phase: Ronald Reagan and Paul Volcker stepped onto the stage and seized control of history. As chairman of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Volcker proceeded to fight inflation with stern determination, tightening money and credit and dragging the economy into what Mr. Samuelson calls ''the most punishing slump since the 1930s.'' Unemployment climbed to 10.8 percent (still a postwar high), and everyone screamed. Senator Howard Baker, the Republican majority leader, called for the Fed to ''get its boot off the neck of the economy''; others demanded Mr. Volcker's head, or at least his resignation. But his medicine broke the inflationary fever by the mid-1980s, and prices stabilized. Reagan's role in all this was to provide Mr. Volcker with crucial political cover. Unlike the presidents before him, Reagan insisted that inflation be brought under control, even if the cost was high unemployment. Unsurprisingly, his own popularity plummeted. In early 1982 Newsweek ran a cover story headlined ''Reagan's America: And the Poor Get Poorer.'' But in an act of genuine political courage Reagan persevered, and Mr. Samuelson concludes, ''Of all Reagan's economic achievements,'' his successful battle against inflation ''was the most definitive. The rest of his economic record was mixed.''
 After this stirring description of the high drama of the early '80s, the remainder of ''The Great Inflation and Its Aftermath'' is an anticlimax. In fact the narrative dissolves. In bringing his story down to the present, Mr. Samuelson identifies current economic problems and proposes solutions. Some of his arguments are irrefutable, if familiar: the country is going to have to find a way of reforming Social Security and Medicare. 
 But for the most part he gets lost, and loses his readers, in a morass of on the one hand, on the other. We should trim back the welfare state -- but we should also worry about fairness. We should deal with the problems of globalization -- but consensus will be difficult to achieve. The final third of Mr. Samuelson's book has none of the sweep and clarity of the earlier sections.
 Worse, perhaps because Mr. Samuelson finished his book before the current financial crisis fully hit, he spends too much time fighting the last war (or even the one before that). His first policy recommendation, his ''unambiguous message,'' is that we must maintain control over inflation. But at a time when unemployment is predicted to reach 8 percent or higher, and when the economy is feeling deflationary, not inflationary, pressures, a sermon about the evil of rising prices is not the one President-elect Barack Obama most needs to hear. 
 What's more, Mr. Samuelson says the larger lesson of his history of the Great Inflation is to demonstrate the dangers of good intentions. ''Skepticism,'' he writes, ''ought to qualify and restrain our reformist impulses.'' And as a warning against economic activism he adds, ''Just because something isn't perfect doesn't mean it can be improved.''
 Fair enough. We should always question our intentions, heed the naysayers. And since politicians and policymakers almost inevitably overstep, the skeptic is usually proved correct -- eventually. But skepticism can only raise questions; it can't provide answers or solve problems. 
 It's fine to maintain a healthy distance from our politicians and their hired guns, the economists, as Mr. Samuelson urges. Yet in this moment of crisis we would undoubtedly be wiser to be skeptical about Mr. Samuelson's skepticism.

HEADLINE: Cutthroat Preschool Ritual Isn't Like Prison, or Is It?

BYLINE: By SUSAN DOMINUS. 
E-mail: susan.dominus@nytimes.com

 BODY:
When Marc Simon, a lawyer and filmmaker, started thinking about making a documentary about the famously cutthroat process of gaining admission to New York City's elite private preschools, he had no kids and no plans to have any soon. He had little in common with the parents whom he intended to profile. Then, like so many of them, he found he couldn't get in.
 Mr. Simon approached an organization coordinating a panel discussion on the admission process to see if he could bring a camera, but got turned down flat. He was told that preschool was a sensitive issue in New York -- very, very sensitive, so sensitive that parents would be terrified to see cameras anywhere in the room. 
 This was a filmmaker who had just won a Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival for ''After Innocence,'' a documentary on the lives of inmates who had been exonerated by DNA evidence. He'd interviewed some of them while they were still in maximum-security prisons. ''That was sensitive,'' he said last week. 
 But the rebuff from the private school administrator only fueled Mr. Simon's interest in making the preschool film, an interest first piqued by the crazed anxiety of a law firm colleague in the midst of applying. 
 ''It just didn't seem right,'' Mr. Simon said about the supposedly sensitive nature of the system. ''Let's prioritize things -- how scary a process can this be?''
 The results of his perseverance fall somewhere between Freddy Krueger and a Barney film on the scary scale. The film, ''Nursery University,'' will be shown publicly in New York City for the first time on Saturday evening at the Margaret Mead Film and Video Festival at the American Museum of Natural History, with a limited run expected in movie theaters in the spring.
 At the film festival, the study of anxious New York City parents falls into the category of fascinating anthropological subculture, along with Russian adolescents in reform school, primate researchers in Abkhazia and the Kwakwaka'wakw indigenous people of British Columbia. 
 Here are a mother and father squabbling over whether to say in the application that their child hopes to ''engage'' or ''explore'' the school's cultural activities. Here are mothers, fathers, even nannies furiously speed-dialing various preschools, over and over, the day after Labor Day, in the hopes of breaking through busy signals just to get an application. Here is another mother worrying about whether she will be the only prospective parent donating a gift worth less than $500 to the auction of a school where she hopes her daughter will be admitted.
 Though it was made just a few years ago, at moments, the documentary has a distinct other-era feel. One preschool director jokes about making sure her graduates will be prepared to take direction on their first days of work at Goldman Sachs. 
 BRIAN LEHRER, the public radio host on WNYC, is shown asking an admissions expert about whether the pace will ever slow down in New York City for private schools. ''So the rich are only getting richer in Manhattan since the last time we talked about this,'' he says. ''Has the landscape changed very much?''
 Rumors are flying all over New York about strapped parents yanking their kids out of private schools, but Gabriella Rowe, head of school at the Mandell School, which is depicted in the film, said in an interview that at a recent meeting of preschool directors, no one reported a decline in applications.
 Even now, after all the market turmoil, they are not seeing people drop out of the application process in greater numbers than in previous years. Not that a recession would have been an ideal way to solve New York's private preschool crunch anyway. 
 Like paranoiacs who actually have enemies, New York parents, neurotic as they may be, actually have some reason for anxiety when they cannot even get an application to the school of their choice without hiring a small army of phone-dialers. 
 Mr. Simon, who first became interested in the subject after he watched another lawyer rush out of the office to attend preschool interviews, found the sheer struggle just to apply an unnerving element of the process.
 But some parents in the film ultimately found some measure of success that they could live with (a feat more remarkable given the documentary cameras at their backs).
 He was also pleasantly surprised to find that the process was not all about connections or donations or prestige or even parents' personalities. ''It's all part of the package,'' he said. ''But an adorable, precocious kid who really gets their attention -- that can do it, too. The child absolutely matters.'' 
 Any admission story has suspense built in. This one has a surprise ending.

HEADLINE: A Killing in a Town Where Latinos Sense Hate

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE; Angela Macropolis contributed reporting from Medford, N.Y.

 BODY:
PATCHOGUE, N.Y. -- It was an occasional diversion among a certain crowd at Patchogue-Medford High School, students said: Drink a few beers, then go looking for people to mug, whether for money or just for kicks.
Friends of Jeffrey Conroy, a star athlete at the school, say he was known to do it, too. And last Saturday night, after drinking in a park in the Long Island hamlet of Medford, Mr. Conroy, 17, and six other teenagers declared that they were going to attack ''a Mexican'' and headed to the more ethnically diverse village of Patchogue to hunt, according to friends and the authorities.
They found their target in Marcelo Lucero, a serious-minded, 37-year-old immigrant from a poor village in Ecuador who had lived in the United States for 16 years, mostly in Patchogue, and worked in a dry cleaning store, sending savings home to support his mother, a cancer survivor.
After the boys surrounded, taunted and punched Mr. Lucero, the authorities say, Mr. Conroy plunged a knife into his victim's chest, fatally wounding him. 
The attack has horrified and puzzled many in this comfortable Suffolk County village of 11,700. Prosecutors have labeled it a hate crime and County Executive Steve Levy called the defendants, who have pleaded not guilty, ''white supremacists.'' And some immigrant advocates on Long Island have described the attack as a reflection of widespread anti-Latino sentiment and racial intolerance in Suffolk County.
Interviews with business owners, students, government officials and immigrants in the area suggest that illegal immigration has been a wellspring for anger and tension in the neighborhood, with day laborers drawing the greatest fire. Indeed, a number of people -- adults and students alike -- drew sharp distinctions between assimilated immigrants, who they said should be welcomed as friends and neighbors, and newly arrived illegal immigrants, who they said do not belong.
''No disrespect here, but I'm a firm believer that if you want to come to this country, you should have a job waiting for you,'' said the co-owner of the Medford Shooting Range, who gave only his first name, Charlie, and is known by the nickname Charlie Range.
He said he was offended by the behavior of some day laborers -- throwing trash in the street, urinating in the bushes, hooting at passing women -- and complained that illegal immigrants were crowding rental apartments and swelling the ranks of criminal gangs.
''How do you stop the illegal alien influx?'' he wondered aloud. ''How do you stop the rain?''
Thousands of immigrants from Latin America have flowed into Long Island in the past two decades, attracted by employment opportunities, particularly in the construction industry, which until recently was booming. Patchogue's Latino population has risen sharply during this time, village officials say, with Ecuadoreans now being the single largest Latino group.
According to the 2000 census, Latinos were 24 percent of Patchogue's population, up from 14 percent in 1990, and government officials say the percentage has continued to grow. In just the past five years, the Latino student population of the Patchogue-Medford School District has risen to 24 percent from about 4 percent, said Michael H. Mostow, the district's superintendent.
Anti-immigrant hostility has led to several highly publicized attacks in recent years in Suffolk County, including the near-death beating of two Mexican day laborers in 2001 and the burning of a Mexican family's house in 2003, both in the nearby town of Farmingville.
Immigrant advocates have accused some local politicians, particularly Mr. Levy, of helping to fuel anti-immigrant sentiment by promoting tough policies against illegal immigration. But Mr. Levy said this week that the attack on Mr. Lucero ''wasn't a question of any county policy or legislation; it was a question of bad people doing horrific things.''
For all the parsing of motives and rationales in the case, many Latino immigrants here describe Suffolk County as a place where daily life can be a struggle for acceptance in a predominantly white population, particularly in this time of economic crisis. Rocio Ponce, a Brentwood resident and real-estate agent from Ecuador, said that many residents had developed a hatred against recent Latino immigrants ''because they think they're coming to take their jobs.''
Latinos say the attack against Mr. Lucero, if not his murder, was foretold. Some report being threatened and physically harassed in the streets, with bottles thrown at them and their car windows smashed during the night. Anti-immigrant epithets and racially motivated bullying are common in the hallways of the schools, children say.
''They tell us to go get a green card, 'Go back to your community!' '' said Pamela Guncay, 14, an Ecuadorean-American born in the United States.
Many Latinos, particularly those who are here illegally, say they would never report such incidents because they do not trust the police and fear deportation.
''We're here to work, we're not here to do any damage,'' pleaded Cesar Angamarca, 45, who rents a room in a small house where Mr. Lucero lived. ''We're working honorably.''
Friends of Mr. Conroy and the other suspects insisted that the defendants were not racist and said they were shocked that a frivolous escapade by bored, drunken teenagers had quickly turned tragic. They pointed out that one of the defendants, Jose Pacheco, 17, is the son of an African-American mother and a Puerto Rican father, and that Mr. Conroy counted Latino and black classmates among his closest buddies.
''They were good kids,'' said Sean Ruga, 19, who graduated from the high school in 2006 and remained friends with the defendants. ''It's not something I could see them capable of doing.''
Mr. Pacheco's uncle, Jerry Dumas, said his nephew was with the group because he was looking for a ride home and would not have knowingly joined an attack against a Latino, especially considering his ethnic heritage. He also said that Mr. Pacheco's parents had themselves been apparent victims of violent racism: When they moved into the Patchogue area in the early 1990s, Mr. Dumas said, their house was burned down twice.
Mr. Conroy was the best known of the defendants and, according to prosecutors, the leader of the group. He was on the school's lacrosse and wrestling teams, according to his friends, and his lawyer, William J. Keahon, said he had received ''a number'' of offers of college athletic scholarships.
Jeffrey Francis, 18, who is black, said Mr. Conroy befriended him soon after he transferred into the school this fall. They were on the wrestling team together, he said.
Acquaintances of the defendants said it was not unusual for groups of students from the high school to go out looking for people to mug. ''It was just for fun, or for money,'' said Taylor Fallica, 15, a student at the high school who said he was a friend of Mr. Conroy and the other defendants.
A friend who said he had been hanging out with the seven defendants in the park that night said there had not been much in the way of a plan before the group set out.
''We were just chilling, having a few beers,'' said the friend, who requested anonymity because he had also been interviewed by the police and feared making contradictory statements.
Toward midnight, he recalled, ''they said they were going to go jump a Mexican,'' and they left.
Mr. Lucero had come to the United States to help support his family in Gualaceo, Ecuador, said his brother, Joselo, 34, in an interview this week in Patchogue, where he lives. Their father had died when they were young and Marcelo assumed the role of father figure in the family, Joselo said.
Marcelo Lucero was a hard worker and had little social life, according to his brother and a resident in a house where he rented a room. When Joselo joined Marcelo in Patchogue in the mid-1990s, the older brother frequently counseled him on how to take care of himself and be safe.
''He was a like a protector,'' Joselo recalled. ''He told me: 'You have to be a man here. There's no mom here anymore.' ''
As the mob descended, Mr. Lucero's friend managed to escape and contact the police, who rounded up the suspects minutes later.
Mr. Conroy was charged with first-degree manslaughter as a hate crime and first-degree gang assault; the others were charged with first-degree gang assault. They were arraigned on Monday and the case was sent to a grand jury, which began reviewing evidence on Thursday, according to a spokesman for the Suffolk County district attorney's office.
Joselo Lucero said his priorities were now to get his brother's body back to Ecuador for burial and to ensure that justice was served. But he said he felt no bitterness or vengefulness toward his brother's attackers.
''I don't really feel hate,'' he said.
''I feel sorry for the families, in some way, because they have to be responsible for their kids.''
Since Mr. Lucero's death, local officials have almost universally played down any suggestion that ethnic and racial tension had been prevalent in the community. Nonetheless, local, county and state officials have responded to the killing with various plans, including the introduction of sensitivity task forces, outreach programs in the Latino community and community forums.
''It is imperative that we bridge the divide,'' Patchogue's mayor, Paul V. Pontieri Jr., said on Thursday, ''and realize that the things we have in common far outnumber those that divide us.''
Correction: November 15, 2008, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about fear and anger in Patchogue, N.Y., after the stabbing death of an Ecuadorean immigrant in what prosecutors have called a hate crime, referred incorrectly to Jeffrey Conroy, 17, a high school athlete who has been arrested in the case. He has not been offered a lacrosse scholarship to the University of Maryland, as several of his classmates reported. (His lawyer, William J. Keahon, said on Friday that Mr. Conroy had been offered athletic scholarships to other colleges.)

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Hit Level Last Seen After 9/11

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The number of newly laid-off individuals seeking unemployment benefits has jumped to a level not seen since just after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
 The Labor Department reported on Thursday that jobless claims last week increased by 32,000, to a seasonally adjusted 516,000. That nearly matched the 517,000 claims reported seven years ago, and is the second-highest total since 1992. 
 The total also was much higher than analysts expected. Wall Street economists surveyed by ThomsonReuters expected claims to increase only slightly, to 484,000. Initial claims from two weeks ago were revised upward Thursday by 3,000, to 484,000.
 The increase puts jobless claims at levels similar to the recession of the early 1990s. The four-week average of claims, which smoothes out fluctuations, increased to 491,000, the highest in more than 17 years.
 Thursday's figure is the first time claims have topped 500,000 in the current economic slowdown. Jobless claims above 400,000 are considered a sign of recession. A year ago, claims stood at 338,000.
 The number of individuals continuing to seek unemployment benefits rose to 3.9 million, above analysts' estimates of 3.85 million. That is the highest total since January 1983, though the labor market has grown by about half since then. The continuing claims tally is for the week ending Nov. 1, one week behind the initial claims report.
 Recipients stop receiving benefits when they find another job or their benefits run out. The increase in continuing claims indicates that it is taking laid-off workers longer to find a new job.
 Thursday's report could affect the political debate in Congress over whether to enact another economic stimulus package and what it should include. Democrats want to add an extension of unemployment benefits, which last 26 weeks.
 Initial claims have been driven higher by a slowing economy hit by the financial crisis, and cutbacks in consumer and business spending. Claims also rose in late September because of Hurricanes Ike and Gustav, but the department said last week that the impact of the hurricanes had passed.
 The rise in claims has been mirrored by an increase in the unemployment rate. Unemployment reached a 14-year high of 6.5 percent in October, the Labor Department said last week, as the ranks of the unemployed swelled to 10.1 million.

HEADLINE: Rescues Fail to Quell Arrogance

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris's blog on finance and economics is at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
If you are going to hand out rescue packages, it helps to understand how bad the problem is, and to have some grasp of what is needed to fix it.
 Now the automakers are in line for handouts, and we can only hope the government will have a better understanding of their problems -- and a willingness to force painful changes on the industry -- than it did of the financial industry, where the first round of bailouts were made in a process that is looking more and more absurd.
 It is not just that the Treasury and the Federal Reserve pushed Congress to pass a bailout plan that has now been abandoned. Nor is it just that the early recipients are already in line for more handouts. It is that the government seems to have written checks with little knowledge of how deep the rot went.
 There are lessons to be learned, but they can seem contradictory: 
 It doesn't work to be a passive investor when you are handing out bailouts.
 On the other hand, the idea that government planners should determine where companies invest their money does not sound so great either. 
 What is clear is that the Bush administration, in this as in so many other things, will do as it pleases. The bailout legislation contemplated the purchase of bad bank assets. That idea is now abandoned for most institutions. The legislation set up an elaborate oversight mechanism, and required periodic reports. None of that is happening.
 Instead, the first round of bailees are back for second helpings. 
 Before it collapsed, the American International Group was a haughty company that thought it was better than anyone else. It still feels that way.
 Instead of sounding chastened as its second bailout was announced this week, the company was bragging about how wonderful its insurance operations are, and denying this was really a bailout at all. 
 At a minimum, can't the government announce and enforce a rule that companies that receive more than $100 billion in bailout money must at least admit their brilliance is open to question?
 The automakers are next in line. Before the checks are written, the government should confront the question of how this industry can be revived, and force changes to do that. 
 But it is doubtful that a Democratic Congress will have any appetite for huge layoffs and plant closings, and certainly not for reductions in retiree health benefits. There will be talk of better fuel economy and hybrids, but little in the way of pain for anyone except future taxpayers who will owe the money being thrown around now.
 There may be some stringent financial provisions, intended to force the firms to become commercially viable within a few years, but don't pay too much attention to them. The early recipients didn't.
 It was less than two months ago that the government put up $85 billion for A.I.G. The interest rate was high, and the term of the loan was just two years. The company, under a new chief executive, would have to shape up or close down within 24 months.
 That new chief executive, Edward Liddy, now says he saw his first priority as being to negotiate more lenient terms. While he was at it, he asked for more money and for a mechanism to get Uncle Sam to take on the risk of some of his company's worst assets while letting A.I.G. share in the profits if those assets should prove to be valuable. He got it all.
 Then he told the world that this was not really a bailout at all. ''The terms of the restructuring are commercial in nature,'' he said on a conference call. ''All of the facilities being provided by the U.S. government are at market rates.''
 Market rates? The government is getting the London interbank offered rate, plus 1 percentage point, while it takes large risks that the bad assets it is taking from A.I.G. will keep losing value. If they do, A.I.G. is under no obligation to repay that loan. 
 A.I.G. would like us to believe that it is a collection of wonderfully run insurance companies, whose parent company made a mistake or two. That is not exactly accurate. Consider one part of the latest bailout. A.I.G.'s insurance companies -- the ones that Mr. Liddy says ''remain disciplined'' -- lent out securities like corporate bonds to other investors, as do most institutional investors. Also, as is common, the A.I.G. companies received cash temporarily to assure that the securities were returned.
 The normal procedure is for the company doing the lending to put the money into supersafe overnight investments, since the securities may be returned, and the cash paid back, at any time. That produces a small but certain profit. 
 A.I.G. had a different idea. Instead of putting the cash into safe investments, it bought mortgage-backed securities, which promised a much better yield. Now those securities have lost a lot of value, and are difficult to sell. A.I.G. needs to have the government provide the cash.
 That practice was roughly akin to taking the rent money to the racetrack. At least people who do that seem embarrassed when they ask for handouts.
 Now the government will step in to buy those funny pieces of paper. It will put up 96 percent of the cash, but collect only 83 percent of the profits if the securities go up. And the price the government pays will be based on what A.I.G. says they are worth, although the government is looking for a consultant to check those prices.
 Another government bailout that is running into problems only weeks after it was announced is the one for Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored mortgage finance company. 
 At Fannie, the government was not so shy about issuing orders. It told Fannie to borrow less, buy more mortgages, and cut the fees it charges to those who sell mortgages to it, all at a time when losses from existing mortgages were growing. This is akin to a family reacting to a financial crisis by saying it will save more money while increasing spending as income declines. It doesn't work.
 The problem is conflicting government desires. It wants the costs of mortgages to fall, and wants plenty of them to be available. It also wants Fannie to stop growing. 
 This week Fannie said it may need a new bailout. Are you surprised?
 All this reflects the conflicting needs and responsibilities of a government that deems companies to be too important to fail. It wants to keep them going, but also wants them to act in ways that seem good for society, whether that consists of cutting mortgage rates or building fuel-efficient cars. And it does not want to increase economic distress at a time when millions are losing their jobs. 
 So the tough choices that would normally have to be made by a company in trouble can be postponed, thereby prolonging the pain.
 In the meantime, other firms have to compete with wards of the state, on terms that can appear unfair. Competitors say A.I.G. is holding on to customers by cutting premium rates to unreasonable levels. A.I.G. concedes premiums are down, but denies it is leading the cuts. There is a risk that bailed-out carmakers will try to save jobs by cutting car prices to levels even lower than the ones that left them broke.
 Bailing out companies turns out to be a lot like making loans. Getting someone to take the money is easy; getting them to pay it back is not.

HEADLINE: 2 Fox and NBC Stations to Pool Video News Gathering

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
In a move intended to save money in the economically pressed business of local television news, two stations in Philadelphia owned by NBC and Fox are combining some of their video operations with a plan to provide the service to all the stations owned by each company.
 Executives from NBC and Fox compared the arrangement, announced Thursday, to the pool coverage that news outlets use to report on certain events, or to what wire services provide to newspapers. 
 ''It's really taking pool coverage and expanding it to day-to-day news coverage,'' said Jack Abernethy, the chief executive of Fox Television Stations. He said stations could save significantly in such an arrangement, adding that individual stations would not have to each send out ''a truck that costs $250,000 or a crew with lights and tripods that cost $40,000 to $50,000.''
 Local television stations have experienced sharp decreases in their profit margins as the Internet has cut into their reach with local viewers and many reliable local advertisers, like auto dealers, have been in a severe downturn.
 ''It's a tough operating environment,'' said John Wallace, the president of NBC Local Media, ''This is about cost savings, but it's also about being smart about local television news.''
 The stations involved, NBC's WCAU and Fox's WTXF, entered into a pilot arrangement last summer. The idea, Mr. Wallace said, was to create what he called ''an independent news gathering group'' that would provide video footage to the stations over which they would have editorial control. 
 The stations will write their own news copy to accompany the pool footage and edit it as they choose, Mr. Wallace said. He added, ''It will free up the stations to do more enterprise reporting.''
 But it will also enable the stations to cut some staff and curtail other costs. For example, the news service will have its own helicopter, meaning stations will not necessarily have one of their own. ''The capital savings will be significant,'' Mr. Abernethy said.
 The plan is for the service to begin operations in Philadelphia by January and then to expand it to other cities where both companies have stations, like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas and Washington.
 Mr. Abernethy said the idea has already attracted interest from competing stations. ''We expect to have a template that we could roll out nationally,'' Mr. Abernethy said. ''Take what we learn in Philadelphia and begin a business around the country.''
 Mr. Wallace added, ''We see no downside on this.''
 Al Primo, a news director in the early days of Eyewitness News at WABC in New York and who now consults on local television issues, said, ''I think this is inevitable. It's a sea change.'' 
 He said that such pool coverage would probably mean a reduction in certain kinds of additional reporting on events that might have the same visuals, like a mayor's news conference. A station would not be able to add to the pool coverage of the mayor's comments by interviewing an aide at the scene without also sending a separate truck and crew, which would undermine the cost-savings strategy.
 ''It's not ideal,'' Mr. Primo said, ''but it's the new reality.''

HEADLINE: Factories Shut, China Workers Are Suffering

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Guangzhou, and Jimmy Wang from Chang'an. Huang Yuanxi contributed research.

DATELINE: CHANG'AN, China 

 BODY:
Wang Denggui, father of three, arrived more than a year ago in the palm-lined streets of this southern town with a single goal: toil in a factory to save for his children's school tuition.
 But the plans of Mr. Wang and thousands of co-workers unraveled at noon on Nov. 1, when the Taiwanese chairman of their ailing shoe factory climbed over a factory wall to flee the country and his debts. That left several American shoe companies with unfilled orders and 2,000 workers without jobs. 
 ''He just ran without telling anyone,'' Mr. Wang said.
 For decades, the steamy Pearl River Delta area of southern Guangdong Province served as a primary engine for China's astounding economic growth. But an export slowdown that began earlier this year and that has been magnified by the global financial crisis of recent months is contributing to the shutdown of tens of thousands of small and mid-size factories here and in other coastal regions, forcing laborers to scramble for other jobs or return home to the countryside. 
 Furthermore, the slowdown inhibits China's ability to work with other nations in alleviating the worldwide crisis. 
 The Pearl River Delta, known as the world's factory, powered an export industry that pushed China's annual growth rate into the double digits and provided work for migrants from interior provinces with poor farmland. But circumstances have changed quickly. The slowdown in exports contributed to the closing of at least 67,000 factories across China in the first half of the year, according to government statistics. Labor disputes and protests over lost back wages have surged, igniting fear in local officials. 
 After the shutdown of their shoe factory, called Weixu in Chinese and China Top Industries in English, Mr. Wang and some co-workers took to the streets in protest, demanding two months of back pay, or $440 on average. The government called in the riot police. Seven workers were thrown in jail and six were beaten, including Mr. Wang, he said.
 ''I plan to return home once I get my money,'' Mr. Wang said as he stood outside the factory on Tuesday, showing the bloody shin wound that he said resulted from a blow from a metal baton. (The police declined to comment.) ''I'm over 50 years old, and I won't be able to find work. I'll just retire.''
 Under pressure from Beijing to maintain social stability, local officials are also trying to tamp down unrest by doling out back wages. Here in Chang'an, after the worker protest, the government shelled out more than $1 million to pay back wages to most of the workers at the shoe factory. (Mr. Wang and some other laborers say they are still without back pay.)
 The slowdown in exports has accelerated a major shift in the nature of Chinese manufacturing: small factories that were already being pinched by rising costs of labor, transportation and raw materials, as well as by the appreciating yuan, are closing en masse. That is especially the case in these towns scattered around the city of Dongguan, known for churning out low-end products. Soon the labor-intensive factories that rely solely on migrant work could disappear from southern China, and foreign companies could contract with similar factories in Vietnam and other countries where costs are lower.
 ''There's very serious damage being done down there, I don't deny it, and I think it'll get worse because we haven't seen the full impact of the economic downturn in Europe,'' said Arthur Kroeber, managing director of Dragonomics, an economic research and advisory firm based in Beijing. ''I think next year we might see export growth in the country as a whole go down to 0 percent.''
 The export sector is still growing but has slowed considerably; year-on-year growth was at 9 percent in October compared with 26 percent in September 2007, Mr. Kroeber said.
 The social problems arising from the slowdown have stirred anxiety in the top leadership of the Communist Party, whose legitimacy is based on maintaining economic growth. Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is pushing for policies that will increase domestic consumer consumption to wean China off its reliance on exports. Last Sunday, the government unveiled a stimulus package worth $586 billion over the next two years -- the largest ever announced in China -- to help create jobs, mostly by building new transportation infrastructure.
 Foreign governments expecting China to take the lead in addressing the global crisis will be disappointed, say analysts and scholars. Chinese officials say they are focused on trying to ease domestic problems and keeping the country's annual growth rate above 8 percent, which they see as vital to generating enough new jobs. Some analysts say economic expansion could drop to as little as 5.8 percent in the fourth quarter this year, down from about 11 percent in 2007.
 ''I think China foresees that it'll need to spend a lot of money to get itself out of the current domestic situation,'' said Victor Shih, an assistant professor of political science at Northwestern University who studies the political economy of China. ''On the global financial crisis, China will not take a leading role.''
 The mass layoffs have led to a profound change in the movements this year of migrant workers like Mr. Wang who spend virtually the entire year away from home. Many are heading home early for the Chinese New Year, in late January, and say they might not return to work in the coastal regions. A worker in the railway station in Guangzhou said that from Oct. 11 to Oct. 27, there were 1.17 million passengers on trains leaving the station, an increase of 129,000 over the same period last year. There have been reports of a similar jump in other regions.
 Once in the interior, the workers will have less incentive than in the past to return to the coastal provinces. Rising grain prices have made farming more profitable. The Chinese government announced a rural land reform policy last month that could spur some farmers to stay on their land and make better use of it. 
 A growing number of factories have opened in the interior provinces as well. Wages are still lower than on the coast, but have risen quickly in recent years. 
 In Zhangmutou, a town here in the Dongguan area, many of the 7,000 workers who lost their jobs when a Hong Kong-owned toy factory called Smart Union shut down last month have returned home. Li Dongmei, a former human resources employee, said her two older brothers who worked in the factory had taken the 20-hour bus ride home to Hunan Province. Ms. Li, though, still lives across from the abandoned factory building because she is eight months pregnant.
 ''This place isn't too stable economically,'' Ms. Li, 25, said as she sat on a terrace outside her cramped apartment. ''Guangdong isn't so good anymore.''
 As was the case with the Weixu shoe factory, Smart Union closed without any notice, and hundreds of angry workers poured into the streets to demand that the local government pay them back wages. Many such factories were run by Taiwanese or Hong Kong managers who fled the mainland. Chinese police and courts have limited reach in Hong Kong, which has a separate legal system, and they have almost no ability to prosecute people in Taiwan, which is treated as a renegade province and does not have formal political or diplomatic relations with the mainland.
 The wave of factory shutdowns is taking place at a time when migrant workers are more aware than ever of their legal rights and know how to put pressure on local governments. Two national labor laws were enacted in January that, among other things, require companies to pay severance and give out more long-term labor contracts. The laws could lead to more labor disputes and protests, said Mary Gallagher, director of the Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Michigan. 
 ''Increasingly, the migrant workers know their rights,'' she said. 
 Here in Chang'an, nearly 200 workers showed up outside the south gate of the four-story Weixu factory on Tuesday to demand from the government severance payments that generally ranged from $1,500 to $3,700 each. They signed their names on a list and put a red fingerprint stamp next to each signature.
 ''No one's gotten this subsidy yet,'' said a woman from Qinghai Province who spoke on condition of anonymity because local officials had scolded her for talking to a local newspaper. ''The government has been helpful in giving us our back pay, but it hasn't been helpful in paying the subsidy.''
 The Taiwanese chairman of the shoe factory, Zhuang Jiaying, did not return calls seeking comment. The collapse of the factory started a domino effect: Related businesses, like a smaller factory that put labels on Weixu's shoe boxes, have also failed. Hundreds of additional laborers have lost their jobs, and more than 200 creditors have yet to collect millions of dollars, said Yang Qiusheng, the manager of the factory that handled the labels.
 ''I had to fire people who had worked for me for a long time,'' he said. ''When I see this shoe factory, this enterprise, I feel very sad and sorry. I never thought it would end like this.''

HEADLINE: Nations to Talk Finance, As Pillars of Power Shift

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It is not clear how much the leaders of 18 countries plus the European Union, gathering to discuss a fast-moving financial crisis with a soon-to-depart leader of the United States, can hope to accomplish.
 But this weekend's summit meeting by the Group of 20 may clarify one thing: how completely the crisis is reshaping the economic map -- rendering obsolete the old club of Western powers that fashioned the financial pillars of the post-World War II era at a conference in Bretton Woods, N.H., in 1944.
 While President Nicolas Sarkozy of France proposed this meeting, and President Bush agreed to play host, the most sought-after country at a gathering some have called Bretton Woods II may prove to be China.
 With close to $2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves and an economy that is still growing, albeit more slowly than before the crisis erupted, China is one of the few participants with the financial wherewithal to come to the aid of countries in distress, either directly or by swelling the coffers of the International Monetary Fund, so that it can make more emergency loans. 
 The same is true of Saudi Arabia, the sole Persian Gulf oil producer to attend the meeting. Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain has already solicited the wealthy Arab kingdom for money to bolster the I.M.F.
 ''The G-7 was basically the leading 20th-century industrial countries,'' Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter, said. ''But we need something more than a few key players at these meetings. You have to engage other participants.''
 Some of these other participants -- ranging from Argentina to Australia -- have been hit hard by the crisis that began in the United States and spread to Europe. Many have suffered a cash squeeze as Western investors have pulled capital out of emerging markets to cover losses at home.
 For some countries, like South Korea, it is a nasty replay of the Asian financial crisis a decade ago -- except that this time, their governments have pursued generally responsible economic policies and open financial markets.
 What demands these countries make in Washington is one of the big unanswered questions of the meeting. 
 The decision to broaden the invitation list was made by Mr. Bush -- in recognition, his advisers said, that the financial crisis had become a global affliction that demanded global responses.
 Still, with the United States the epicenter and, to many of the attendees, the cause of the crisis, the shift in the power balance has been accentuated all the more.
 President-elect Barack Obama will be conspicuous in his absence. He is dispatching some emissaries to meet with foreign leaders, but taking no position on proposed new regulations for the international financial markets.
 The Bush administration is playing down the prospects for major results from the meeting, partly because it opposes efforts by some Europeans to create a latticework of new regulations and partly because it does not want to commit Mr. Obama to measures that he may not support. Mr. Bush, some observers predicted, could end up a bystander at his own gathering. 
 Given the divergent agendas of the other participants -- and the ambitions of some of its leaders, notably Mr. Sarkozy, to stride across the global stage -- this has raised some intriguing possibilities.
 ''Are the Europeans or the Chinese going to take advantage of this interregnum in the U.S. to set the tone for the future of financial regulation?'' said Simon Johnson, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former chief economist of the I.M.F.
 The Europeans have a long list of measures they favor to prevent a recurrence of the crisis, including executive pay limits and robust oversight of banks, hedge funds and credit-rating agencies. 
 They also want to coordinate financial regulation among countries, perhaps through colleges of supervisors or a global regulatory council, which could be housed at the I.M.F. 
 ''We know it's an awkward time for the United States, but we feel these issues are too important to wait,'' said the British ambassador to the United States, Nigel Sheinwald, in a briefing Wednesday.
 The Bush administration said it would resist any efforts to create regulatory agencies with cross-border authority, something the French have discussed. It opposes regulating hedge funds, something the Germans are keen to pursue. And it is not enthusiastic about bolstering the resources of the I.M.F., as the British have advocated.
 For all their calls to action, the Europeans are not united. The French favor tighter global coordination of regulation than do the British. The Germans are skeptical of financial arrangements that could force them to bail out their neighbors.
 The European Commission has just begun a six-month study on how to harmonize regulations in Europe, which, for now, could limit the options of Mr. Sarkozy, Mr. Brown, and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. ''I'm a little skeptical that they'll do more than float some trial balloons on this,'' said Charles H. Dallara, managing director of the Institute of International Finance, which represents more than 300 global banks.
 In briefings, British, French and German diplomats said they hoped to extract real results, which could be turned into an ''action plan'' and set the agenda for a follow-up meeting in 100 days or so. But China's position on regulations is a mystery, even to those who follow it closely, and other emerging economies have yet to stake out their positions. 
 As a result, the communique issued at the end of the meeting is unlikely to include more than general commitments to sound regulations and closer coordination among countries, officials said.
 As the ambitions for the meeting have narrowed, the talk of a latter-day Bretton Woods has come to seem fanciful. The participants agree that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund -- products of the original Bretton Woods -- should continue to serve as central institutions.
 Europeans want the I.M.F. to have larger resources for emergency aid. But it is not clear how to do that without giving cash-rich countries like China and the oil exporters a bigger voice in its governance.
 With so little agreement on regulations, some experts say, the meeting would be best used as an occasion to pledge a coordinated effort to stimulate the flagging global economy. Here again, China has taken the lead -- announcing a $586 billion stimulus package last weekend.
 ''It certainly puts Hu Jintao into an extremely strong position, coming into the meeting,'' said Nicholas R. Lardy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, referring to China's president, who is traveling with a 100-person delegation.
 Germany just announced a modest stimulus plan and Britain plans one next week, leaving Mr. Bush, who opposes further economic stimulus, as the odd man out. Then again, Mr. Obama favors such a package, and the Democratic Congress has promised to take it up in a special session next week, or in January after Mr. Obama takes office. 
 ''It feels like we're waiting for the new king to arrive,'' Mr. Johnson of M.I.T. said. ''It could be a moment of resurgent American power, especially if nothing gets done this weekend.''

HEADLINE: If the Senate Reconvenes, 2 Seats May Be Empty

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama wants Congress to pass a multibillion-dollar economic stimulus package and a bailout for the sputtering auto industry during a lame-duck session next week. But if the session goes forward, Senator Obama will not be there to vote on the proposals.
 Mr. Obama announced Thursday that he would resign his Senate seat on Sunday, thus avoiding any obligation to show up next week and cutting short the odd overlap period when the next head of the executive branch is still a member of the legislative branch. This is the first time in nearly a half-century that a sitting member of Congress has been elected president. 
 Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois has not tipped his hand about whom he plans to appoint or whether he would do it in time for the new senator to participate in next week's session. The list of Democrats mentioned for the seat is long, including Representatives Jesse L. Jackson Jr., Jan Schakowsky, Danny K. Davis and Luis V. Gutierrez; the State Senate president, Emil Jones Jr.; the state attorney general, Lisa Madigan; and several others.
 Mr. Obama has not publicly endorsed a successor, but he laid a wreath marking Veterans Day here on Tuesday accompanied by another often-mentioned candidate, Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois National Guard helicopter pilot who lost both legs in Iraq. Ms. Duckworth lost a race for Congress in 2006 and is now the state's head of veterans affairs. If Ms. Duckworth does not get the seat, she is seen by some as a possible secretary of veterans affairs in Mr. Obama's cabinet, although some of his advisers favor keeping the current secretary, James B. Peake.
 In the past, the transition from sitting senator to president was not much of an issue because Congress did not meet after the election or, if it did, took up mostly routine matters. But Democratic leaders are considering calling the House and Senate into session next week to address the most urgent issue confronting the nation, namely how to pull out of the current economic slide. The departing Senate remains closely divided, with 49 Democrats, 49 Republicans and 2 independents who caucus with the Democrats.
 Besides losing Mr. Obama's vote, the Democrats are likely to be without another member. Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, of course, was just elected vice president and is not expected to participate in the session.
 Nothing in the rules would have prevented Mr. Obama or Mr. Biden from voting as senators because they have not yet been sworn in to their new jobs. But the Obama camp decided it would be inappropriate for them to act as senators when bigger roles are on the horizon.
 Although the Democrats would be weakened in any lame-duck session should neither Mr. Obama nor Mr. Biden be replaced by next week, Obama advisers played down the likelihood that Congress would be able to agree or that two votes would make a real difference. Lawmakers will either come up with plans that win significant majorities or they will not go forward with votes, some Democrats have said.
 ''It's important to bear in mind that Congress was wrestling with issues like an economic recovery program prior to the election and didn't come to a conclusion,'' Robert Gibbs, a senior Obama adviser, said this week. 
 This is a relatively rare situation. In 220 years of presidential elections, only three other times has a sitting member of Congress won the White House: Representative James A. Garfield in 1880, Senator Warren G. Harding in 1920 and Senator John F. Kennedy in 1960. Garfield resigned right after his election, and Kennedy had no lame-duck session to worry about.
 Harding showed up on the opening day of the lame-duck session that followed his election and gave a short valedictory speech on the Senate floor, taking note of the ''somewhat unusual circumstances'' of his presence and the ''delicacy about my position,'' according to Congressional records. He then boarded a train and returned to Ohio, never casting any votes in his dual role as president-elect and senator.
 Among the senators elected vice president since World War II, Al Gore, Dan Quayle, Hubert H. Humphrey and Lyndon B. Johnson never faced a lame-duck session after their elections, according to Donald A. Ritchie, the associate Senate historian. Alben W. Barkley, the Senate majority leader, had a brief lame-duck session in December 1948 after he was elected vice president but it lasted just two hours and was largely a formality.

HEADLINE: Quinn Vehemently Denounces Bloomberg's Plans

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN and FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
The City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, in harsh language that she seldom uses about Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, denounced his proposal to overhaul the city's senior centers on Thursday, declaring it belongs ''in the garbage can.'' 
 A short while later, Ms. Quinn held a press conference during which she warned that the Council might sue to block the mayor from withholding $400 tax rebate checks for homeowners, saying bluntly, ''We're right and they're not.'' A mayoral spokesman disagreed. 
 The unusually sharp criticism of the mayor by Ms. Quinn drew attention at City Hall. And it left some members of the Council and other city officials wondering: Was Ms. Quinn simply speaking out about issues she feels strongly about? Or was she trying to shore up her support among council members in the aftermath of the bitter term limits battle?
 Ms. Quinn typically delivers her criticism of the Bloomberg administration in private. But to elaborate on her longstanding opposition to the senior services plan, she held an unusual press conference on the steps of City Hall, flanked by almost half of the 51 council members, who nodded and applauded as she spoke. The plan would attempt to streamline the senior centers' practices, but its critics worry that some centers might be consolidated. 
 Some analysts believe that Ms. Quinn is trying to reposition herself as a tougher counterweight to the mayor after collaborating with him so often on countless issues, most notably Mr. Bloomberg's divisive measure to extend term limits for elected officials to 12 years from 8. The Council passed that legislation by a 29-22 vote last month.
 ''She has to demonstrate to the 22 who voted against term limits that she can lead independently from the mayor,'' said Bruce Berg, a political science professor at Fordham University. ''What she's doing is as much for internal consumption for the Council as it is for the mayor and the press.'' 
 The political reality, of course, is quickly shifting inside City Hall. The budget is far bleaker than expected, because of the global economic crisis. That prompted Mr. Bloomberg to deliver, in an unusually detailed quarterly budget update last week, a series of proposals designed to plug what he estimated was a $4 billion budget gap over the next two years.
 The Council's Finance Committee will hold the first of eight hearings on the budget changes on Monday. But already, council members and interest groups have howled about Mr. Bloomberg's desire to slash city spending by $1.5 billion and raise property taxes by 7 percent in January, six months earlier than planned. Mr. Bloomberg has also suggested that the city might need to ask Albany to raise the sales tax or personal income tax, at least temporarily.
 But the most controversial idea, judging by council members' reactions, has been Mr. Bloomberg's attempt to freeze a $400 property tax rebate check that homeowners have been waiting for since early fall. Such a move could save the city $256 million, but council members said that because they already approved the rebates in the last budget, Mr. Bloomberg was obligated to mail the checks out.
 Moreover, several council members say it is unfair for the mayor to hold back the checks on such short notice and so near the holiday shopping season. After all, Ms. Quinn said in a statement last week, many homeowners might have already made plans to spend that $400.
 Hence, the prospect of a legal challenge. Council members argued that any decision to withhold the checks should be subject to Council approval.
 ''I am very confident that the legal advice from our staff is correct, that a local law would be needed to withhold and not give this year's rebates,'' Ms. Quinn said on Thursday. ''It's very, very clear that the mayor's office will see that a law is needed.''
 When asked about the possibility of a challenge, Stu Loeser, Mr. Bloomberg's chief spokesman, said: ''We disagree. There are different ways to read a bill, and we believe our way is correct.''
 But some council members -- speaking only anonymously, for fear of reprisal -- were skeptical of Ms. Quinn's very public stand to save the rebates. They expect that Mr. Bloomberg may end up yielding on the rebates, while pushing for what he truly wants: an increase in property taxes.
 ''It's like professional wrestling,'' said one council member. ''They arrange the moves in private and play them out in public so that people come out and say, 'She's so tough.' ''
 Ms. Quinn acknowledged that she was being unusually outspoken. ''It is atypical for me to be standing at a press conference criticizing the decisions of the mayor's staff,'' she said.
 But when asked whether she was talking tough to undo any impression that she is too close to the mayor, Ms. Quinn, tossing in a bit of Yiddish, said she could not worry about how such things were viewed.
 ''If I had worn closed-toed shoes, you would have said that was a desire to have a tougher shoe so I could kick somebody in the tuchis to seem tougher, and if I had worn open-toed shoes, I came to City Hall with a wimpier attitude,'' Ms. Quinn said.

HEADLINE: Bush Speaks In Defense Of Markets

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and ROBERT PEAR; Sheryl Gay Stolberg reported from Washington and Robert Pear from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Bush delivered an impassioned defense of free-market capitalism on Thursday, on the eve of an international summit meeting where he is expected to get a tongue-lashing from foreign leaders who view the United States and his administration as responsible for worldwide financial misery.
In a defiant declaration in his waning days as president, Mr. Bush traveled to Wall Street -- ground zero for a financial crisis that has spread around the globe -- to declare that the American system is still ''the engine of social mobility'' and deliver an apparent warning to the world's leaders, and the incoming Obama administration, not to draw the wrong lessons.
Mr. Bush suggested those making arguments for ambitious new forms of regulation -- he did not name them, but they include his French counterpart, President Nicolas Sarkozy -- were sorely mistaken. 
''The crisis was not a failure of the free-market system, and the answer is not to try to reinvent that system,'' Mr. Bush said, in a 24-minute speech at Federal Hall in downtown Manhattan.
He added: ''Free-market capitalism is far more than an economic theory. It is the engine of social mobility, the highway to the American dream.''
The president made few references to the stream of bad news that has battered his administration: rising unemployment, increasing home foreclosures and sinking consumer confidence. Rather, the speech, coming from a leader who is overseeing a huge government intervention in the financial markets, was an attempt to put him front and center in advance of the summit meeting, and to frame the debate on his terms.
When leaders of foreign powers arrive in the capital Friday for the emergency meeting of 19 nations and the European Union, the president will have to contend with other heads of government who have their own agendas, and who will remain on the international stage after he is gone. Mr. Bush may also find himself in the shadow of President-elect Barack Obama, who is not even at the session.
''He's going to be much more the host and much less the chairman than he realizes,'' Adam S. Posen, who advises foreign governments on economic coordination, said of Mr. Bush. ''He's going to be providing the snacks and the venue and making sure everybody's comfortable, but he is not going to be driving the agenda; that's the reality. The agenda-setting is with Gordon Brown and Nicolas Sarkozy and Hu Jintao.''
While Mr. Obama has declined to attend the meeting, he is dispatching two high-powered emissaries -- Madeleine K. Albright, who was Bill Clinton's secretary of state, and Jim Leach, a Republican former congressman from Iowa -- to conduct unofficial meetings on the sidelines of the summit talk with any foreign officials who might want them.
For Mr. Bush it is another reminder that his days as ''the decider'' are soon to be over -- and a signal that for all the fanfare surrounding the international meeting, it may wind up being more symbolism than substance. With just two months left in office, Mr. Bush can hardly negotiate on behalf of the United States when neither he nor his foreign counterparts know if Mr. Obama will live up to the commitments he makes.
''I don't think there's any question that a lame duck president conducting an international summit of this kind is a risky endeavor,'' said Leon E. Panetta, a former chief of staff to Mr. Clinton who has advised Mr. Obama's transition team. ''They can't cut a deal anymore -- all they can really do is lay out some principles -- so let's face it. In the end, this isn't really George Bush's game anymore. It's Barack Obama's.''
Then again, financial crises do not run in tandem with American political cycles; the White House says that the meeting, envisioned as the first in a series that will continue once Mr. Obama is in office, is necessary and appropriate, and that the situation is too urgent to wait.
The goal, Bush advisers say, is to forge an international consensus on the root causes of the crisis and lay the foundation for regulatory changes to prevent a similar crisis in the future.
But any discussion of root causes could easily turn into finger-pointing at Mr. Bush and his administration; the Russian president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, has been quite outspoken in saying the United States is to blame. And as Mr. Bush's speech in New York demonstrated, the president is trying hard to push back against the idea, advanced by Mr. Sarkozy and others, that a much stronger international regulatory regime is necessary.
''We must recognize that government intervention is not a cure-all,'' Mr. Bush said, adding, ''History has shown that the greater threat to economic prosperity is not too little government involvement in the market, but too much.''
In defending the American model of capitalism, Mr. Bush pointed out that some European countries, which claimed to have more rigorous regulation than the United States, had ''problems almost identical to our own,'' and in some cases, suffered far worse repercussions because their banks were even more overstretched.
The White House also appears to be trying to use the Group of 20 conference to resist Mr. Obama's proposal for aid to American automakers, and to prod Mr. Obama and other Congressional Democrats into approving a long-stalled free trade pact with Colombia.
Dan Price, an international economics adviser to Mr. Bush who is the so-called sherpa, or liaison to foreign governments, for the meeting, said this week that Mr. Bush would use the gathering as ''an opportunity to urge his fellow leaders not to turn inward or stifle markets.'' He added pointedly, ''Protectionist rhetoric about walling off markets or companies does not help stabilize markets, but in fact leads to greater uncertainty.''
The summit meeting, which will open Friday night with a dinner in the State Dining Room of the White House and continue on Saturday with a working session at the National Building Museum here, was Mr. Sarkozy's idea. But from the start, Mr. Bush sought to take control.
Mr. Sarkozy suggested convening the session in New York; the White House insisted on Washington, giving Mr. Bush the home advantage. Mr. Sarkozy wanted the participants limited to the so-called Group of 8 economic powers. Mr. Bush insisted on an expanded list, the Group of 20, which includes developing nations like China and India -- a smart move, Mr. Posen said.
''That's a real legacy issue,'' Mr. Posen said. ''He will go down in history books as the first American president to include those kinds of countries on an equal footing in an international economic negotiation.''
But many experts say they do not expect much to come of the meeting, in part because it was hastily convened. The session has been called Bretton Woods II, a reference to the 1944 international conference in New Hampshire that remade the global financial system after the Great Depression and toward the end of World War II. But that conference was years in the planning; this one was put together in less than a month.
''The problem is not simply that Bush is a lame duck; it's not simply that he can't commit his successor,'' said Richard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. ''It's also that there is not yet a consensus among the governments about what to do.''

HEADLINE: Worst May Be Yet to Come for Citigroup

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
After a year of red ink, a months-long plunge in its share price and a $25 billion government rescue, you might think the worst was over for Citigroup. 
 It is probably not. 
 Citigroup, which a decade ago set out to rewrite the rules of American finance, is bracing for still more pain now that a recession is at hand. Loans that the financial giant made to consumers in good times are going bad in growing numbers. For the moment, profits seem as elusive as ever, analysts say.
 Once the most valuable financial company in America, Citigroup is withering along with its share price, which this week sank into single digits for the first time in a dozen years. The company is also shrinking in another painful way: by cutting, and cutting, and cutting jobs. Another round of pink slips is expected next week. 
 As Vikram S. Pandit completes his first year as chief executive, many analysts say Citigroup has lost its way. Insiders say the company is racked by office politics at a critical moment in its history. 
 Mr. Pandit is struggling to regain his grip on the company, which operates in scores of countries, after his attempt to buy Wachovia was upended by Wells Fargo. That misstep left Citigroup grasping for a new strategy to lure deposits and build up its branch network in the United States.
 ''Citi doesn't have a credible management team, they don't have a credible board,'' said Christopher Whalen, managing partner at Institutional Risk Analytics. ''If you look at their loss rate, it is almost inevitable that Citi is going to be asking the government for more money next year.''
 Worries about Citigroup's future were apparent in the stock market on Thursday. While the share prices of many of its rivals soared along with the broader market in a stunning afternoon rally, Citigroup's stock fell nearly 2 percent by the end of regular trading. At its closing price of $9.45, the stock has lost almost 68 percent this year, making it the third-biggest loser in the Dow Jones industrial average, behind Alcoa and General Motors. 
 Many Citigroup employees know their jobs are on the line. Executives said that as of the third quarter, the bank had announced plans to eliminate 40,100 jobs. That includes reductions resulting from the divestitures of the company's German retail banking operations and its Indian outsourcing franchise. 
 But Citigroup still needs to hand out pink slips to 9,100 workers to meet its goals, and bankers are bracing for much of the bad news to arrive early next week, according to executives briefed on the situation.
 Investment bankers are expected to bear the brunt of the cuts because senior managers have been asked to reduce expenses significantly. But back-office functions, like the bank's legal and human resources divisions, are also expected to be hard hit. 
 The ax could keep falling. While there are no formal plans for further job cuts, executives say it is possible that Citigroup could shed an additional 25 percent of its work force by the end of next year. Such a reduction would include layoffs, a hiring freeze and work force reductions related to businesses that the company is considering selling. Such a move would reduce the total number of employees to 264,000, from about 352,000 today.
 Christina Pretto, a Citigroup spokeswoman, said that the bank was carefully managing its employee levels as it revamps the company to operate more efficiently in the current downturn. ''Nothing has changed,'' Ms. Pretto said. 
 Citigroup is also grappling with how to position its domestic consumer business, which faces rising loan losses and, analysts say, lacks the leadership and strategy it needs. Having lost Wachovia, Citigroup must now try to stitch together a group of small regional banks to catch up with Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. Executives are looking at Chevy Chase Bank, a small lender in Maryland with $14 billion in assets, among several other institutions, according to people close to the situation.
 But assembling a large franchise could take years, and digesting deals has never been one of Citigroup's strengths. 
 Even with all these problems, Citigroup's board has been bickering over seemingly small issues, including which white-shoe law firm will represent it, according to a person close to the situation. Wachtell, Lipton Rosen & Katz had been representing the board, but that firm is representing Well Fargo in litigation over the Wachovia deal. Cravath, Swain & Moore is now being considered to represent Citigroup's directors, but no decision has been made, according to a person close to the situation.
 Citigroup has tried to put on a united front amid the turmoil. Richard D. Parsons, one of the company's most outspoken directors, said on Thursday that the board was fully behind Mr. Pandit and Winfried F. W. Bischoff, its executive chairman, as it braced for a difficult 2009.
 Mr. Pandit, for his part, led a group of Citigroup executives in buying 1.3 million Citigroup shares as the stock tumbled on Thursday. 
 It was the first time that Mr. Pandit, who had collected $165.2 million from selling his hedge fund to Citigroup before becoming chief executive, publicly disclosed using his own money to buy Citigroup stock. 
 Ms. Pretto, the Citigroup spokeswoman, said the ''purchases reflect their belief in the long-term strength and growth opportunities of the company.''

HEADLINE: Good for G.M., and for the Country?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I couldn't agree more with Thomas L. Friedman (''How to Fix a Flat,'' column, Nov. 12). 
 For years, the Detroit auto industry has been exhorted to produce reliable fuel-efficient vehicles. Instead, it manufactured, as Mr. Friedman correctly points out, the oversized gas-guzzling S.U.V.'s. 
 Now the industry comes to the public trough demanding a financial bailout for its incompetence and callous indifference to marketplace changes among the car-buying public. Why should taxpayers be expected to bear the financial burden for corporate mismanagement? 
 If Congress decides to yield to pressure from the auto industry, it should, as Mr. Friedman argues, show the auto executives the door and replace them with a new team of competent managers.
 Anthony Troncone
 Orangeburg, N.Y., Nov. 12, 2008
 To the Editor:
 It has been 35 years since the OPEC-induced oil crisis. We waited on lines in inefficient gas guzzlers while foreign auto companies stepped up to the plate with more fuel-efficient, better quality vehicles. The American auto industry gave us more of the same under the guise of ''that's what Americans want.'' 
 Well, that is not what Americans want. We want innovative fuel-efficient, safe, well-built vehicles.
 If we have to bail out our automobile industry, Thomas L. Friedman is correct that management should be fired and the government should appoint a receiver or at least a board of overseers. 
 The American taxpayer cannot afford to let the people who have run our automobile companies get away with more of the same denial and lack of understanding of what new car buyers really want and what America needs now. Marilyn Peterman
 Amherst, N.H., Nov. 12, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The automotive industry's business model is reflective of the fuel its gas-guzzling S.U.V.'s rely on. They are both unsustainable.
 Why not change to a sustainable business plan, one based on renewable energy? Latent production plants could also be converted into manufacturing centers for solar panels and wind turbines. Renewable-energy jobs would replace those in the automotive sector, stimulating the economy and the environment. 
 Detroit has the opportunity to become the world's leader in manufacturing renewable-energy technologies. Motor City can re-emerge as Solar City.
 Andrew L. Chang
 Stanford, Calif., Nov. 12, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The problems in Detroit so vividly described in Thomas L. Friedman's column are of longstanding duration. 
 In 1973, I was at dinner with William D. Ruckelshaus, then the first head of the Environmental Protection Agency. He was struggling to get the American auto industry to put catalytic converters on its cars. The industry was resisting strenuously. 
 Clearly frustrated, Mr. Ruckelshaus succinctly described Detroit as a city inhabited by ''second-rate engineers with an erotic attachment to an obsolescent machine.'' 
 Mr. Ruckelshaus, a Republican, recently endorsed President-elect Barack Obama. Perhaps his insights can be used to bring change to an industry in desperate need of new thinking.
 Donald P. Gregg
 Armonk, N.Y., Nov. 12, 2008
 To the Editor:
 For years, I have been cringing at the sight of the vast numbers of American-made gas guzzlers on our roads and highways. Now I am cringing at the thought of giving a blank check to the industry leadership that, in its blind pursuit of short-term profit and in the face of the gathering energy crisis, gave us this glut of albatross vehicles, thereby positioning a major sector of our economy for collapse. 
 I agree with Thomas L. Friedman -- we need a complete do-over for our auto industry. Why don't we retool to produce public transport, and let the already efficient and well-managed automakers like Honda satisfy the market for cars, a market that with luck will shrink as we adapt our 21st-century society to deal with energy shortages and global warming?
 Cynthia Ciani Anderson
 Wakefield, R.I., Nov. 12, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Although most of what Thomas L. Friedman writes in ''How to Fix a Flat'' makes sense, his emphasis on hybrids does not. 
 The hybrid's added complexity, weight and cost ensure that it will never play a major role in motivating Americans to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles. 
 Foreign manufacturers, especially those from Germany and Japan, produce a wide range of gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles that perform well and get excellent fuel economy. If the Detroit automakers are to survive, that's the lead they must follow.
 David Leinsdorf
 Crested Butte, Colo., Nov. 12, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 Bravo, Thomas L. Friedman. Some flats can't be fixed! After buying only American cars for the last 50 years, in 2007 I bought a foreign hybrid that does 30 to 50 miles per gallon.

HEADLINE: Gates and European Officials Criticize the Russian President for His Bellicose Talk

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE; Thom Shanker contributed reporting from Tallinn, Estonia.

DATELINE: NICE, France 

 BODY:
Russia's threat to station missiles along its border with Europe drew strong criticism from senior United States and European officials Thursday, as they prepared to confront President Dmitri A. Medvedev on the matter before heading together to Washington to discuss reforming the world financial system.
 In an interview, the president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, strongly criticized Moscow's threat to put missiles in the enclave of Kaliningrad, which shares a border with Poland and Lithuania, and he warned that ''cold war rhetoric'' over the issue was ''stupid.'' 
 ''We don't need a cold war,'' he said in an interview. ''We need cool heads.''
 Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates used a visit to Estonia and a meeting with NATO defense ministers there to sharpen Washington's criticism of the Russian threat. 
 ''Such provocative remarks are unnecessary and misguided,'' he said.
 Mr. Medvedev, who is due in Nice on Friday for meetings with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, the current European Union president, appeared eager to defuse the strong criticism of his missile threat last week. 
 Mr. Medvedev's speech was widely interpreted as throwing down a gauntlet just hours after Senator Barack Obama was elected president. Mr. Gates noted that it was ''hardly the welcome a new American administration deserves,'' and that the speech provoked widespread alarm in European capitals. 
 ''We are ready to abandon this decision to deploy the missiles in Kaliningrad if the new American administration, after analyzing the real utility of its system for reacting to 'rogue states,' decides to abandon its antimissile system,'' Mr. Medvedev told Le Figaro, a French daily newspaper.
 He was referring to the antimissile system that the United States wants to deploy in Poland and the Czech Republic. The United States says it is intended to counter a threat not from Russia -- as the Kremlin insists -- but from Iran. Mr. Obama has said he will support the deployment of the antimissile system only if the technology is proven to work. 
 Mr. Medvedev added that ''the first reaction of the United States shows that the new administration is reflecting on all this.''
 Mr. Barroso, referring to Mr. Medvedev's speech last week, noted that ''it does not increase security or the perception of security.'' 
 Speaking before Mr. Medvedev's latest comments became public, Mr. Barroso described the ''rhetoric'' over the issue as ''negative.'' 
 Mr. Barroso added that the message from the European Union on Friday would be that ''It is not a good idea to speak about missiles in Kaliningrad. This is not improving European security or your security.''
 He added, ''If we start with the idea that there are missiles on one side or the other, we come back to the cold war rhetoric which is, I would even say, stupid.''
 Despite the concerns raised by Mr. Medvedev's speech, the European Union took a significant step toward restoring normal relations with Russia this week when it agreed to resume negotiations on a comprehensive pact on economy, energy and security matters. Negotiations were put on hold after the Russian war with Georgia in August, but since then the financial crisis has underlined the need for rapprochement.
 Mr. Barroso noted that Europe and Russia needed to cooperate, and he said that the talks on their new pact would resume ''in a matter of days or weeks.''

HEADLINE: If the Senate Reconvenes, Two Seats May Be Empty

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama wants Congress to pass a multibillion-dollar economic stimulus package and a bailout for the sputtering auto industry during a lame-duck session next week. But Senator Obama will not be there to vote on the proposals. 
 Mr. Obama announced Thursday that he would resign his Senate seat on Sunday, thus avoiding any obligation to show up next week and cutting short the odd overlap period when the next leader of the executive branch would still be a member of the legislative branch. This is the first time in nearly a half-century that a sitting member of Congress has been elected president. 
 In the past, this was not much of an issue since Congress did not meet after the election or, if it did, took up mostly routine matters. But next week's session could address the most urgent issue confronting the nation, namely how to pull out of the current economic slide. The outgoing Senate remains closely divided, with 49 Democrats, 49 Republicans and 2 independents who caucus with the Democrats. 
 Besides losing Mr. Obama's vote, the Democrats will most likely not have another of their members on hand either. Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the vice president-elect, is not expected to participate in the session. Nothing in the rules prevents either Mr. Obama or Mr. Biden from voting as senators since they have not yet been sworn into their new jobs. But the Obama camp decided it would be inappropriate for them to act as senators when bigger roles are on the horizon. 
 ''The basic approach has been, he's going to be here in Chicago setting up his economic -- not only his economic team, but the policies he wants to outline for the country as soon as he gets sworn in, so we hit the ground running,'' Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, Mr. Obama's designated chief of staff, said Sunday on CBS's ''Face the Nation.''
 Although losing two votes could hurt the Democrats if next week's issues are divided along party lines, Obama advisers played down the likelihood that Congress would be able to agree anyway. Either lawmakers come up with plans that win significant majorities, or they will not go forward with votes, some Democrats have said. 
 ''It's important to bear in mind that Congress was wrestling with issues like an economic recovery program prior to the election and didn't come to a conclusion,'' Robert Gibbs, a senior Obama adviser, said this week. If Congress does not come to an agreement, he said, ''it will be the first priority'' after Mr. Obama is inaugurated and Democrats return with stronger majorities in both houses. 
 This is a relatively rare situation. In 220 years of presidential elections, only three other sitting members of Congress have won the White House: Representative James A. Garfield in 1880, Senator Warren G. Harding in 1920 and Senator John F. Kennedy in 1960. Garfield resigned from Congress right after his election, and Kennedy had no lame-duck session to worry about. 
 Harding showed up on the opening day of the lame-duck session that followed his election and gave a short valedictory speech on the Senate floor, taking note of the ''somewhat unusual circumstances'' of his presence and the ''delicacy about my position,'' according to Congressional records. He then boarded a train and returned to Ohio, never casting any votes in his dual role as president-elect and senator. 
 None of the senators elected vice president since World War II -- Al Gore, Hubert H. Humphrey, Lyndon B. Johnson, Walter F. Mondale or Dan Quayle -- faced a lame-duck session after being elected, according to Donald A. Ritchie, the associate Senate historian. 
 Senator Alben W. Barkley, Democrat of Kentucky, the majority leader, had a brief lame-duck session in December 1948 after he was elected vice president under Harry S. Truman, but it lasted just two hours and was largely a formality. 
 Like Mr. Obama, Mr. Biden must resign his Senate seat before noon on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, but he has not disclosed his plans and it is not clear what political calculations, if any, are driving that decision. In Illinois and Delaware, Democratic governors will appoint successors, who will serve until the next election, in 2010. 
 Neither Mr. Obama nor Mr. Biden has publicly endorsed a successor, but Mr. Obama did appear this week with Tammy Duckworth, one of the reported candidates to replace him in the Senate. He laid a wreath for Veterans Day in Chicago on Tuesday accompanied by Ms. Duckworth, an Illinois National Guard helicopter pilot who lost both legs in Iraq. Ms. Duckworth lost a race for Congress in 2006 and is now the state's director of veterans affairs.
 Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois has not tipped his hand about whom he plans to appoint or whether he will do it in time for the new senator to participate in next week's session. The list of other Democrats mentioned in Illinois is long, including Representatives Danny K. Davis, Luis V. Gutierrez, Jesse L. Jackson Jr. and Jan Schakowsky; the State Senate president, Emil Jones Jr.; Attorney General Lisa Madigan; and several others. 
 If Ms. Duckworth does not get the Senate seat, she is seen by some as a possible secretary of veterans affairs in Mr. Obama's cabinet, although some of his advisers favor keeping the current secretary, James B. Peake. 
 In Delaware, the situation is more complicated. Gov. Ruth Ann Minner will appoint a successor if Mr. Biden resigns before Jan. 20. But her term ends the same day, and the incoming governor usually decides when the swearing-in ceremony takes place. If Ms. Minner's elected successor, Jack Markell, opts to take power before noon on Inauguration Day and Mr. Biden does not resign until the last moment, Mr. Markell would choose his successor.
 Whoever makes the appointment, the new senator will have to face election in two years to keep the seat for the remaining four years of the term Mr. Biden won last week at the same time he was elected vice president. 
 The most intriguing possibility is Mr. Biden's son, Joseph R. Biden III, the state's attorney general, who is known as Beau. But since he is scheduled to serve in Iraq with the Delaware National Guard until next fall, that may be impractical. Many Democrats speculate that someone might be chosen to hold the seat for two years so the younger Mr. Biden could run in 2010. 
 Others mentioned as possible appointees in Delaware include Lt. Gov. John C. Carney Jr., who lost a Democratic primary to Mr. Markell, and Secretary of State Harriet Smith Windsor.

HEADLINE: For Obama and Family, the Other Transition Is Strictly Personal

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- A couple of weeks ago, Barack Obama headed to the Hyde Park Hair Salon for a trim. He greeted the staff and other customers and plopped down in the same chair in front of the same barber who has cut his hair for the last 14 years.
But when he wanted a trim this week, the Secret Service took one look at the shop's large plate-glass windows and the gawking tourists eager for a glimpse of the president-elect and the plan quickly changed. If Mr. Obama could no longer come to the barber, the barber would come to him and cut his hair at a friend's apartment.
Life for the newly chosen president and his family has changed forever. Even the constraints and security of the campaign trail do not compare to the bubble that has enveloped him in the 10 days since his election. Renegade, as the Secret Service calls him, now lives within the strict limits that come with the most powerful office on the planet. 
He has chosen to spend this interval before his Jan. 20 inauguration at his home in Hyde Park, which has in some ways been transformed into a secure fortress for his protection. After two years of daily speeches and rallies, he has retreated into an almost hermitlike seclusion, largely hidden from public view and spotted only when he drops his two daughters off for school or goes for a workout at the gymnasium in a friend's apartment building.
''This is a tremendous personal transition, as well, far beyond what anyone could imagine,'' said Alexi Giannoulias, the Illinois state treasurer and a close friend. ''Little things, like going to the gym, going to the movies, going to dinner with his wife, none of that will ever be the same again. Things that we take for granted.''
Mr. Obama is putting off the change as much as he can by remaining in Chicago during the transition. ''I am not going to be spending too much time in Washington over the next several weeks,'' he told someone in a telephone conversation overheard by reporters on his chartered plane heading back to Chicago after a White House visit on Monday.
Indeed, he was on the ground in Washington less than four hours for his tour and talk with President Bush. Mr. Obama has yet to take a vacation since the election, as he works on selecting a White House staff, building a cabinet and formulating policies. But friends and aides said he was also using this time to concentrate on his family before moving to the most famous address in the nation.
The personal considerations coincide with political calculation as well. By remaining in Chicago, it may be easier for him to avoid becoming drawn into decisions by the departing administration and may accentuate the sense of change when he returns to Washington as the new president. He will not be around, for example, for the global economic summit meeting starting Friday, nor for the lame-duck Congressional session next week.
But the trappings of his life are increasingly presidential. Although he does not yet have access to Air Force One, he now rides in an armored government limousine, complete with the war wagon and other motorcade vehicles zipping through red lights with traffic blocked. Although the Secret Service long ago set up concrete barriers around his house here, they expanded their perimeter by several blocks after the election and brought in explosive-sniffing dogs.
''It's changed,'' said Mesha Caudle, 45, who lives a block from the Obamas. ''It's a little inconvenient, just a little, when you have to go around three blocks to go one block. I don't mind, though, because I got the president I voted for. If the price is a little inconvenience, that's O.K.''
The Obama house, bought for $1.65 million in 2005, is a stately mansion in the middle of the racially and economically diverse Hyde Park-Kenwood area near the University of Chicago, shielded by trees, not to mention the phalanx of Secret Service agents and Chicago police officers. The neighborhood is a mix of grand homes, aging but well-tended brick houses and dilapidated buildings. Across the street, renovated condominiums start at $190,000. Just blocks away, some houses are boarded up.
Most modern presidents have had a ranch, farm or estate easily isolated from the community around it. Mr. Obama is the first since Richard M. Nixon to be elected while living in a urban neighborhood, and Mr. Nixon soon sold his New York City apartment and retreated during his presidency to exclusive getaways in Florida and California. Mr. Obama, by contrast, is expected to keep his Chicago home.
The streets around Mr. Obama's home have been closed to outside traffic. Residents show picture identification at checkpoints as officers scan lists of pre-cleared people. The K.A.M. Isaiah Israel synagogue across the street gave the Secret Service a list of 2,000 members and regular visitors, who are checked by metal detectors before services. ''It's actually not as big a deal as it may appear,'' said Linda Ross, the temple's executive director.
A property manager trying to rent $750-a-month apartments three doors down from the Obamas said applicants, janitors and contractors all must be cleared. ''The day after he made his speech in Grant Park, things changed dramatically,'' said the property manager, whose boss told him not to give his name to reporters. ''Before they had Chicago police around his house and it was barricaded. The day he became president-elect, they moved the barricades three blocks out.''
For Mr. Obama, it means no more casually stopping by the Medici for pastries or heading over to Valois for lunch or window shopping with the girls at 57th Street Books, at least not without elaborate preparation. He did manage to take his wife, Michelle, on Saturday night to Spiaggia, a four-star Italian restaurant in downtown Chicago, where the future president loves the wood-roasted scallops.
The Obamas have been going to Spiaggia with its lakefront view for years for what they call ''date night,'' including on their anniversary last month and Michelle's birthday earlier this year. ''It's always just the two of them,'' said Tony Mantuano, the chef and co-owner. ''Now it's just the two of them and 30 Secret Service agents.''
His day starts with breakfast with his daughters, aides said, and he has taken them to school a few times. For his daily workout, he uses the gymnasium at Regents Park apartment building where his friend, Mike Signator, lives. He later heads to transition offices set up in the Kluczynski Federal Building and receives daily intelligence briefings. He could be interviewing cabinet candidates, but no one will say.
''He seems to be very, very focused on the transition,'' said his friend, John W. Rogers Jr. chairman of Ariel Investments, who lent office space to Mr. Obama until the federal space was available. ''It doesn't seem to have changed him at all. He's the same relaxed, in-control, engaging Barack that he's always been. I've been struck by that, that it hasn't shifted him.''
Perhaps no one knows that kind of thing more than a man's barber. Mr. Obama's barber, Zariff, 44, who goes by one name, went over to Mr. Signator's apartment on Tuesday to give Mr. Obama his usual $21 cut and said his longtime client still seemed the same. As he walked in, Zariff remembered, he called him ''Mr. President,'' and Mr. Obama laughed.
''He's looking a lot more presidential now; he walks a little different,'' said Zariff, who himself has become a local celebrity and is thinking about opening a shop in Washington. Mr. Obama is no longer the guy strolling around the neighborhood.
''I think he misses that a lot,'' Zariff said. ''But that's the price of fame.''

HEADLINE: In Crisis, a Way to Smooth Bumps in College Tuition

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA

 BODY:
When New York lawmakers need to fill gaps in the state budget, they can hardly turn to prisoners to help offset the cuts to the spending cuts at the Department of Corrections. But in every fiscal crisis since 1976, Albany has asked students at the state's public colleges and universities to pony up in order to stave off cutbacks.
 True to tradition, Gov. David A. Paterson proposed on Wednesday raising tuition at the State University of New York and City University of New York by $300 this spring and $600 next year, allowing the state to reduce its higher-education expenses by $115 million this year and $238 million next year without making the colleges slash spending. The tuition increase, if approved by the Legislature, would be the first since 2003; before that, tuition was flat for eight years. 
 And true to tradition, the proposed increase has sparked an outcry among students, who complained about an unexpected jump in their costs in a dark economic climate, when they can least afford it. 
 ''What basically happens around the country in higher education is that when administrators see a cut coming, they don't gear up to fight it -- they start lobbying for tuition increases,'' said Pat Callan, president of the National Center for Public and Higher Education, noting that California, too, is looking to significantly raise tuition to make up for its own gaping budget holes.
 ''For the lawmakers, it is in their interest to leave the tuition flat so they can dig into the students' wallets when the economic picture gets tough.'' but not at other times.
 Governor Paterson is, in some ways, breaking the routine established over the last three decades, promising that a portion of the tuition increases will be returned to the schools -- 10 percent in the first year and increasing every year if the economy improves. Previously, tuition increases went solely to offset cuts in state funds.
 For officials at SUNY and CUNY, Mr. Paterson's willingness to change long-held practices in how the state uses tuition money has raised hope that the current crisis could provide an opportunity for a more far-reaching change in policy. 
 In recent years, they and other college administrators around the country have been calling for a ''rational'' tuition policy that would allow for modest tuition increases every year, tied to some independent index, rather than larger ones at unpredictable intervals.
 Matthew Goldstein, CUNY's chancellor, described Governor Paterson's proposal as ''the paradigm shift that I have been waiting for.''
 ''I have been advocating for a very long time that we have a rational tuition policy, and overlaid on that is that revenue be used for investment purposes,'' Dr. Goldstein said.
 That was also one of the key recommendations made by the New York State Commission on Higher Education in a report released earlier this year.
 When SUNY officials meet with state officials next week, they will put such a proposal at the center of the negotiations over the governor's plan.
 Carl T. Hayden, the chairman of the SUNY board, said he envisioned future increases tied to an index that tracks the growth in the cost of higher education nationally. That plan will likely meet some resistance, since that would guide tuition increases largely by what is happening at other colleges and universities -- not an index that is representative of the broader economy. Mr. Callan said his group has supported efforts to tie tuition increases to an index that measures family income. Others have suggest tying tuition hikes to the cost of inflation. 
 Dr. Goldstein said that a basket of indexes could be used to find a fair increase. 
 Whatever the mechanism, there is wide agreement that the current system is far from ideal.
 ''The way it is now certainly is not the best way to do things,'' said H. Carl McCall, a member of the SUNY board. ''Any tuition program we put forward would be some program that would look at predictable, regular increases rather than these spikes during a crisis.''
 In the past, he said, such a change has met resistance among lawmakers. ''They feel their constituents are hard-pressed and don't want to pay additional fees every year,'' he explained
 But the current system, Mr. McCall said, has the perverse affect of not only making it hard for families to plan, but also hitting them at times when they are least likely to be able to afford increases..
 Officials in both Mr. Paterson's office and in the Legislature said they were open to discussing proposals to change tuition policy but were noncommittal. 
 The concern is that if the colleges and universities are allowed to increase tuition annually, they will still turn to even-bigger increases during tough economic times because that is easier than the alternative of cutting spending.
 ''It is a whacko system that no one defends,'' said Mr. Callan. ''But it works well enough for the colleges and legislators, so no one is willing to risk changing it.''
 He said the current crisis presented a brief window of opportunity by focusing attention on the problem. 
 ''As soon as this moment passes, then there is no real incentive to fix it,'' he said.

HEADLINE: France's Finance Minister in a Critical Role at Global Economic Talks

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and KATRIN BENNHOLD; Steven Erlanger contributed reporting.

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
At this weekend's emergency summit meeting of world leaders in Washington, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France promises to be at center stage. But that isn't stopping the country's finance minister, Christine Lagarde, from doing everything she can to tamp down expectations for big changes emanating from the meeting. 
 ''It's critical as the beginning of a process,'' she said, emphasizing the word ''beginning'' slowly and deliberately. ''I'm not suggesting we will find solutions or have big announcements that will thrill the media or political observers,'' she added.
 Which is probably just fine with Ms. Lagarde, who, for all the intense attention she has attracted in recent months as the financial crisis intensified in Europe, tends to be cool where her boss is hot. 
 The economic summit meeting offers Ms. Lagarde an opportunity to quietly push the European agenda of better regulation and more coordinated action even as Mr. Sarkozy, President Bush and the 18 other heads of state do the public talking. 
 It is also a role that perfectly suits Ms. Lagarde, 52, whose fluent English and American-style candor combined with French politesse has put her in a perfect position to mediate between Europe and the United States in the search for solutions to the global economic downturn. 
 ''Clearly we are in the middle of a situation that is quite dark,'' she said in an interview during the brief gap between preparatory gatherings in Brazil and Mexico earlier this week and her departure for Washington on Friday. Without some effort to coordinate action, she said, ''it would be the blind leading the blind.'' 
 In playing down expectations, Ms. Lagarde's toughest challenges lie close to home. When the Group of 7 finance ministers were invited to the White House for a working breakfast this fall, she warned Mr. Bush not to raise hopes too much. 
 Did she give her own president the same advice? Ms. Lagarde blushed, then laughed and grabbed for her cup of green tea. While she flashed a grin, she didn't answer, uncharacteristic for Ms. Lagarde, who is rarely at a loss for words. 
 And her candor is often refreshing. For example, when she talked about persuading banks to lend again after committing billions of euros to bolster their balance sheets, she said: ''They can protect their bottom lines but not their bottoms.'' 
 With much of official Washington in a state of waiting between the outgoing Bush administration and the inauguration of Barack Obama, demands for far-reaching and speedy changes in the global financial system are mostly coming from the European side of the Atlantic. 
 Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain, who along with Mr. Sarkozy has taken the European lead in tackling the current financial crisis, called the Washington talks a ''decisive moment'' and said more oversight of the world's 30 largest cross-border financial groups could be achieved ''very quickly.'' 
 European policy makers are hoping to extend financial regulation to more players, from ratings agencies to hedge funds. They also want to introduce more transparency into the so-called shadow banking system that has grown up outside the regulatory system, so that balance-sheet black holes at large banks are spotted sooner rather than later. 
 And they want to give the International Monetary Fund more money and more power as a global financial watchdog, even if might lead to diminishing the influence of Europe and the United States within the I.M.F. to make room for China, India and other big developing nations. 
 Once a member of France's national synchronized swimming team, Ms. Lagarde is especially eager for a choreographed response to the financial turmoil that has wracked the world for more than a year and now looks set to push the global economy into recession. 
 ''We believe no product, no players and no territories should be left without supervision and regulation,'' she said, emphasizing that a new system needs to be created that ''will ring the bell when a threat to the system emerges.'' 
 For all their contrast in temperament, Mr. Sarkozy and Ms. Lagarde, whom he named as finance minister 17 months ago, make a good team. They are both lawyers and neither attended the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the traditional breeding ground of France's ruling elite. 
 The two are born outsiders who had to fight their way to the top, Mr. Sarkozy as the son of an immigrant, and Ms. Lagarde as a woman entering the old boys' club of both corporate law and French politics. Neither drinks alcohol. 
 But unlike Mr. Sarkozy, Ms. Lagarde spent most of her career in the private sector, lived in the United States for six years and speaks flawless English. 
 She was a regular at the annual World Economic Forum meetings in Davos long before she joined the center-right government in 2005 as trade minister. And she was nicknamed ''the American'' long before Mr. Sarkozy was. 
 At times one senses that Ms. Lagarde's more market-oriented instincts are at odds with those of a president who savors the traditional French nationalist posture. 
 One of her biggest concerns, she said, was the rise of protectionism as economic hardship prompted countries to turn inward. ''It's a real threat,'' she said. 
 But ask her about Mr. Sarkozy's proposal to establish a French ''sovereign wealth fund'' to protect companies in France from ''foreign predators,'' and she seems uncomfortable. 
 Governments have been protecting industry in other countries, she said, adding: ''It's been going on everywhere.'' 
 Her biggest fans are business leaders and foreign finance officials who have seen her in action. 
 ''She is a good ambassador for France,'' said Pascal Lamy, director general of the World Trade Organization, who has known Ms. Lagarde for 15 years. ''She has lived extensively outside of France and has been a major player in the private sector. These things give her a perspective that few French leaders possess.'' 
 Lakshmi Mittal, the Indian-born steel magnate, who had found himself under particularly vicious attack in France when merging his Mittal steel business with Europe's Arcelor, said Ms. Lagarde was a refreshing change from past finance ministers. 
 ''She has been able to break the mold here,'' said Mr. Mittal, who first met Ms. Lagarde when she was serving as the first female chairman of the international law firm Baker & McKenzie. ''I can clearly see a very different approach to the language of the previous finance ministers.'' 
 Some of Ms. Lagarde's male colleagues also say it doesn't hurt that a woman with diplomatic skills has been running some tricky European Union meetings during the last few months of the French presidency. 
 ''There is no grandstanding; you can tell that she has held meetings in the private sector,'' said one official, who regularly accompanies one of Ms. Lagarde's European counterparts to European Union talks. 
 Still, as her international profile has grown, her reputation at home has come under sporadic fire. 
 Over the last year, Ms. Lagarde has been the object of a whispering campaign both inside her own ministry and in the Elysee Palace, with officials anonymously spreading rumors that she was about to lose her job. The French media have been enthusiastically reporting her every slip of the tongue. 
 ''The French are always a bit suspicious of a minister who speaks a foreign language fluently,'' Mr. Lamy, who is also French, said. ''This is especially true if that languageis English.'' 
 But in recent weeks the pressure has eased. Her visible work in handling the financial crisis has put her in a better light here, along with her many good connections in Washington, especially now that the internationally popular President-elect Obama prepares to move into the White House. 
 Ms. Lagarde prefers to make light of any attacks on her, reciting one of her favorite quotes, from Eleanor Roosevelt. 
 ''A woman is like a tea bag: You never know how strong she is until she gets in hot water.''

HEADLINE: The U.S. Must Take the Lead on Climate Change

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''The Climate for Change'' (Op-Ed, Nov. 9), Al Gore calls for the United States to pursue carbon cap and trade policies. What he does not call for is unilateral American action to legislate mandated reductions in carbon dioxide to 1990 levels by 2020 and 80 percent below by 2050. That is a crucial omission. 
 I came away from conversations with Indian and Chinese government advisers on climate this summer with the sense that any and all international negotiations will bog down unless the United States establishes its bona fides. 
 We need to engage in what a Chinese adviser called ''a game changer.'' 
 Mr. Gore's other prescriptions are all sensible, but they will take many years to put into effect. His 10-year timetable doesn't factor in the fact that assuming normal continued economic growth, American peak energy demand is going to double within the next 15 years. 
 We need action now that publicly binds us to a course of development over time, come what may. The danger is that this objective may get trumped by the political pressure to chase the chimera of an energy independence policy.
 Martin Bunzl New Brunswick, N.J., Nov. 9, 2008
 The writer is director of the Initiative on Climate and Social Policy at the Eagleton Institute of Politics, Rutgers University.
 To the Editor:
 In ''The Climate for Change,'' Al Gore mars his case for investing in clean energy infrastructure with his swipe at clean coal technology. 
 Far from discouraging investment in carbon capture and storage technology capable of neutralizing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-based power plants, the United States should assert global leadership in accelerating this vital antidote to climate concerns. 
 Mr. Gore complains that no demonstration plants exist, but he does not mention that carbon capture and storage technology is being tested in three plants abroad. 
 Rather than cede technology leadership to others, why shouldn't the United States demonstrate it, especially when the technology will address Mr. Gore's two other priorities -- the economic crisis and energy security?
 Half of the nation's electricity is generated with coal because it is affordable and plentiful, the very reasons coal use is soaring in Asia, where China's greenhouse gas emissions alone surpass our own.
 Without the timely deployment of this technology here and abroad, there is little hope of reducing greenhouse gases in a world destined to need more affordable electricity.

HEADLINE: CHANCES DWINDLE ON BAILOUT PLAN FOR AUTOMAKERS

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Carl Hulse contributed reporting from Washington, and Bill Vlasic from Detroit.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The prospects of a government rescue for the foundering American automakers dwindled Thursday as Democratic Congressional leaders conceded that they would face potentially insurmountable Republican opposition during a lame-duck session next week. 
 At the same time, hope among many Democrats on Capitol Hill for an aggressive economic stimulus measure all but evaporated. Democratic leaders have been calling for a package that would include help for the auto companies as well as new spending on public works projects, an extension of jobless benefits, increased food stamps and aid to states for rising Medicaid expenses. 
 But while Democrats said the stimulus measure would wait until President-elect Barack Obama takes office in January, some industry experts fear that one of the Big Three automakers will collapse before then, with potentially devastating consequences. 
 Despite hardening opposition at the White House and among Republicans on Capitol Hill, the Democrats said they would press ahead with efforts to provide $25 billion in emergency aid for the automakers. But they said the bill would need to be approved first in the Senate, which some Democrats said was highly unlikely. 
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the banking committee, said he did not believe there would be enough Republican support to get the 60 votes needed to move a bill forward. ''Right now, I don't think there are the votes,'' he said, adding that he personally favored aid for the automakers. 
 As the outlook for an auto industry bailout dimmed, President Bush traveled to Wall Street, where he gave a robust defense of capitalism and seemed to warn world leaders -- and the incoming Obama administration -- not to draw the wrong lessons from the global economic crisis by over-regulating markets and hindering free trade. 
 The White House, in resisting calls for aiding the automakers, has also warned repeatedly against throwing taxpayer money at companies that may not be salvageable. 
 Acknowledging the Bush administration's opposition, Mr. Dodd said Democrats had to keep in mind that the Treasury Department already has some authority to help the finance arms of the auto companies but has been reluctant to use it. 
 ''I want to be careful about bringing up a proposition that might fail in light of the fact the authority exists, and under an Obama administration there seems to be a greater willingness to deal with the issue,'' Mr. Dodd said. ''So there are some political considerations to be made.'' 
 Passing any legislation to aid the auto companies would require 60 votes in the Senate. Democrats now control 51 of those votes, but Mr. Obama has said he will resign his Senate seat on Sunday, and Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. is not expected to attend the lame duck session, meaning Democrats would need the support of at least 11 Republicans. 
 With Mr. Bush still wielding his veto authority, the fate of any legislation without White House support would be uncertain.
 The auto companies, however, remained hopeful and said they would send top executives to Congressional hearings next week to make their case. 
 ''We hope all parties recognize there's a pressing need to preserve the domestic auto industry and the jobs and nation's competitiveness that's tied to the industry,'' said Greg Martin, a spokesman for General Motors. ''We're ready and willing to work with all members of Congress to get this assistance.''
 The majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have urged the Bush administration to help the automakers and said they were prepared to try to push through legislation if the White House refused to act. 
 Mr. Reid, on Thursday, said that he would open a lame-duck session in the Senate on Monday, hoping to move forward with legislation that would extend unemployment benefits and to attach an amendment providing aid for the auto companies. 
 Aides to Ms. Pelosi said the House would be brought back into session as of 1 p.m. Wednesday and would remain on standby, awaiting action by the Senate. 
 Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, is working on a measure that would direct $25 billion to the carmakers from the $700 billion financial bailout fund. Aides said Mr. Frank was collaborating with his Democratic colleagues in the Senate. 
 President Bush, however, has not signaled any willingness to tap the bailout fund, which the Treasury has said is money better spent on financial institutions. And some powerful Republican lawmakers have voiced strong opposition to government aid for the automakers. 
 Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the banking committee, said he would not support legislation to aid the auto companies and seemed prepared to let one or all of them collapse. 
 ''The financial straits that the Big Three find themselves in is not the product of our current economic downturn, but instead is the legacy of the uncompetitive structure of its manufacturing and labor force,'' Mr. Shelby said in a statement. ''The financial situation facing the Big Three is not a national problem but their problem.''
 On Thursday, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, also came out strongly against the idea. 
 ''Spending billions of additional federal tax dollars with no promises to reform the root causes crippling automakers' competitiveness around the world is neither fair to taxpayers nor sound fiscal policy,'' Mr. Boehner said in a statement. 
 Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee, in an appearance on Fox News, said: ''You wonder where bailout-mania will end.''
 Mr. Hensarling said American automakers should bear responsibility for their failed operations. ''They are producing high-cost products that consumers don't want to buy. And so now we have Washington on the verge of giving them a bailout simply because we have all heard of them and they have high-priced lobbyists.''
 The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has expressed support for expediting $25 billion in loans for the auto companies that Congress approved in September. But he has not indicated any willingness to provide additional money or to use money from the financial bailout fund for the car makers. 
 ''Earlier this year, Congress acted in a bipartisan way to help the auto industry and protect jobs,'' said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell. ''The Congress passed and the president signed legislation authorizing $25 billion in low-interest loans to help American automakers retool their facilities to make the fuel-efficient cars of the future. It may be that there are changes that need to be made in order to expedite these low-interest loans.'' 
 Mr. Stewart added: ''Other ideas have been floated, and all will receive a review as we approach the Senate's return next week.''
 Ms. Pelosi so far has rejected the idea of easing restrictions on those loans, which require carmakers to develop technologies that will improve fuel efficiency. But Mr. McConnell's suggestion, also encouraged by the White House, may be the only potential compromise and one Republicans could support because it does not require a new appropriation of federal funds. 
 Some Republicans also suggested that there was less support among rank-and-file Democrats for an auto bailout than party leaders were letting on. 
 One Republican, Senator George V.Voinovich of Ohio, whose state relies heavily on the auto industry, voiced strong support on Thursday for using bailout money to help the failing car companies. Mr. Voinovich was working with Senators Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow, Democrats of Michigan, to drum up support for such a plan.
 Mr. Levin met Thursday afternoon with Mr. Reid in the majority leader's office to map out their strategy. 
 Complicating the effort to aid the carmakers is the ownership structure of Chrysler, a limited partnership controlled by Cerberus Capital Management, a private equity firm. The firm said it would give up any profits from a future sale of the company in exchange for financial assistance from the government, hoping to limit political opposition in Washington to aid for a privately held company, according to Bloomberg News. 
 The shaky support for an auto industry bailout in general had left Ms. Pelosi uncertain about whether calling the House back into session would be worth the trouble. 
 Jim Manley, a senior adviser to Mr. Reid, said there was no chance of approving help for the auto companies without broad support from across the aisle. ''We cannot do it without the support of Senate Republicans, who I hope will join us to pass a bill that saves the jobs and protects the livelihoods of millions of hard-working Americans,'' Mr. Manley said.

HEADLINE: Hedge Fund Managers Ask for a Few New Rules

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A House of Representatives committee room was transformed into a club for billionaires for a few hours on Thursday, as five of the richest men in the world testified on the role of hedge funds in financial markets. 
 The billionaires were all hedge fund managers themselves, among the most prominent -- and successful -- in the business. Many of the people crowding the room expected a slugfest, given the growing calls on Capitol Hill for hedge funds, those private investment vehicles, to disclose their investments and business practices. So it came as something of a surprise when the managers agreed, more or less, with the lawmakers. All five managers -- Philip A. Falcone, Kenneth C. Griffin, John A. Paulson, James Simons and George Soros -- said they would support new rules that would require their industry, controlling nearly $2 trillion, to disclose more of its secrets.
 The hearing was crammed with some of the same policy makers who have criticized people who presided over the financial boom that has become a painful bust. But aside from some grumblings about how much money hedge fund managers make, the sharpest remarks were directed not at John Paulson and the other hedge fund billionaires, but at Henry M. Paulson Jr., the secretary of the Treasury. 
 ''The headline of this hearing is definitely Paulson v. Paulson,'' joked Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland.
 For all the theatrics, a consensus seemed to be emerging. More than a year into the financial crisis, the hedge fund industry's leaders seem to realize that regulation may be inevitable, that operating under the radar may no longer be possible, and that their riches have torn away their cloak of anonymity.
 Mr. Griffin, the founder of the Citadel Investment Group, displayed the most resistance to the changing tide, at first saying that greater regulation of the industry was not needed. Then, growing flush, Mr. Griffin, who began trading bonds out of his Harvard dorm room, said he would ''not be averse'' to greater disclosure, so long as the information was shared only with regulators.
 Mr. Soros, seated at one end of the panel with his most recent book in front of him, was the strongest advocate of greater disclosure and new rules about margin requirements and leverage, or borrowed money. But while his testimony -- and willingness to sign autographs -- may have pleased some Democrats, some Republicans took the opportunity to criticize him for his liberal ideas.
 ''Your intervention in the drug area has been appalling,'' said Representative Mark E. Souder, Republican of Indiana.
 Mr. Soros, well-known for his daring bet against the British pound in 1992, is used to testifying before Congress, but some of the other hedge fund titans took the hearing as an opportunity to introduce themselves.
 ''I was born in Chisholm, Minn., population 5,000, on the Iron Range of Northern Minnesota,'' said Mr. Falcone, the co-founder of Harbinger Capital Partners. ''I was the youngest of nine kids who grew up in a three-bedroom home in a working class neighborhood.''
 Mr. Falcone, a stock picker, said he favored greater transparency of hedge funds and public companies. He also added, ''It's important for the committee and the public to know that not everyone who runs a hedge fund was born on Fifth Avenue.''
 Even the smallest of details provided in the hearing had traders around Wall Street glued to a webcast of the hearing. Mr. Paulson, whose fund gained prominence because he correctly bet against the mortgage market, became the topic of widespread emails when he revealed that he now managed $36 billion, employed 70 people, and that 80 percent of his assets come from foreign investors.
 Like several of the other managers, Mr. Paulson tried to emphasize that he not only does well, he does good. He included a press release about a donation he gave to a nonprofit organization in his written testimony. And he pointed out that he has created jobs.
 ''Over the last five years, our firm has increased our employee count by 10 times, creating numerous high-paying jobs for Americans,'' Mr. Paulson said.

HEADLINE: Can Obama Help Kill Baggy Pants Look?

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Two robbery suspects, hands cuffed behind them, were taken from a police station house in the Bronx a few days ago. Like many young men, they wore baggy trousers. They wore them low, very low, so low that the beltless jeans of one suspect slid down almost to his knees.
 Guilty or innocent, he looked ridiculous. President-elect Barack Obama, we're willing to bet, would have agreed. 
 The first order of business for the new president will no doubt be to get America to hitch up its pants and give the economy a kick-start. It will be interesting to see if he can also get America to hitch up its pants, period. This is a matter of no small concern to New York, where changes in fashion mean jobs, reputations and -- count on it -- money.
 Just before Election Day, Mr. Obama appeared on MTV and took a question about laws in some municipalities that ban a popular street look among young men who go around in low-slung pants that expose way more underwear than many of us care to see. Those ordinances, the candidate said, are ''a waste of time.''
 ''Having said that,'' he continued, ''brothers should pull up their pants. You are walking by your mother, your grandmother, your underwear is showing. What's wrong with that? Come on.''
 ''Some people might not want to see your underwear,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I'm one of them.''
 The question now is whether as president he can bring about a change in urban fashion by sheer dint of example.
 There is a persistent belief that President John F. Kennedy delivered a knockout blow to traditional hats by preferring to go hatless. In an earlier generation, Clark Gable supposedly devastated the men's undershirt industry when he unbuttoned his shirt in the 1934 comedy ''It Happened One Night'' and revealed himself to be bare-chested.
 (Has anyone ever explored whether hitchhiking women of that era started flashing some thigh to stop cars, as Claudette Colbert did in that classic film?)
 J.F.K. as hat killer is dismissed as a myth by many fashion experts, who say that American men were abandoning fedoras and the like even before Kennedy took office in 1961. In fashion, said Anne Hollander, the author of ''Sex and Suits'' and other books on how we dress, ''when you look more closely, there's evidence that a thing happened before it took hold, and no single person was responsible.''
 Having said that, to borrow from Mr. Obama, the new president may be able to set a well-tailored example that others will follow. ''It could have an influence, indeed,'' Ms. Hollander said. ''Everybody's looking at him all the time. That means they're going to absorb it. Even unconsciously, they're going to do it.''
 Ruth P. Rubinstein, a sociology professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan, agreed. ''It's very clear that what a president wears has an impact on the population,'' she said.
 Not everyone believes that words alone are enough. One doubter is Alan Flusser, a designer of men's wear in Manhattan who has written several books on fashion. When it comes to Mr. Obama and the brotherhood of the sagging pants, ''I don't think his commenting on it one way or another is going to influence anybody,'' Mr. Flusser said.
 Then too, said John Birmingham, the editor in chief of DNR, a men's wear trade publication, the prison look reflected in this style is past its prime. ''A more cleaned-up and kind of preppy'' fashion is ascendant, he said.
 ''One of the things fashion people say is that when you see something everywhere, that means it's dead,'' Mr. Birmingham said. Nonetheless, the low-slung look hangs on even if the pants themselves do not. ''I don't mean to say that this is dead and you won't see it anymore,'' he said. ''But you might see less of it and think, 'I guess Obama had some influence here.' ''
 Never sell a president (or his pants) short.
 With ''slight refinements,'' Mr. Flusser said of Mr. Obama, ''he has the potential to raise the bar relative to stylishness.'' Mr. Flusser suggested a simple white pocket square as a nice touch. In general, the president-elect ''looks pretty comfortable in his clothes,'' he said. ''He looks like he's wearing them as opposed to them wearing him.''
 Maybe if he can get young men to do away with drooping pants, Mr. Obama can then take on the shrunken tailoring that has become popular -- you know, the suits with sleeves that end well shy of the wrists and trouser legs that never make it to the ankles. Why anyone would spend a few thousand dollars to dress like Pee-wee Herman remains one of life's mysteries.
 The economy? Iraq? Afghanistan? Never mind them. Let's see if the president-elect can persuade men to abandon what some call the Thom Browne look. ''That,'' Mr. Birmingham said, ''would be a test of his influence.''

HEADLINE: Three Cities Ask Treasury For Help in Meeting Costs

BYLINE: By JON HURDLE

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
Philadelphia, Phoenix and Atlanta will seek at least $50 billion in emergency financing on Friday from the federal Treasury to help with infrastructure renewal, pension costs and short-term borrowing, which have all been curtailed by the credit crisis. 
 The cities are calling on Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. to release the money from the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program authorized by Congress to bail out banks and financial institutions.
 About a half-dozen other cities, including Chicago, are reviewing the plan and may sign on, said a spokesman for Mayor Michael Nutter of Philadelphia, who is leading the initiative. On Friday, Mr. Nutter will personally give Mr. Paulson a letter outlining the proposal.
 In the past three weeks, Philadelphia, New York and other cities have announced cuts to services as revenues hit by the economic slowdown create budget deficits. Philadelphia will lay off about 220 city employees, and shut libraries and swimming pools to close a $108 million gap in its current $4 billion budget.
 ''We who run some of America's larger cities are dealing with the economic damage wrought by the credit and housing crises,'' the letter says. ''The economic contraction precipitated by these twin crises is forcing us, and mayors all over the country, to dramatically reduce programs and services for millions of residents we serve.''
 The cities will ask Mr. Paulson to set up a $50 billion fund to rebuild infrastructure. Half the fund would be a grant, while the remainder would take the form of loans to cities at an interest rate of 50 basis points above that of 30-year Treasury bonds.
 The cities are also seeking loans of an unspecified amount to cover some pension liabilities so they can fully finance their pension systems, the letter says.
 It cites the example of Philadelphia, whose pension fund lost more than $650 million in value in the first nine months of 2008 because of plunging stock markets, and which faces $300 million in increased pension costs from the fiscal years 2010 to 2013.
 The credit crisis has ''all but eliminated'' the ability of cities to borrow in the private capital markets to meet their pension obligations, the letter says.
 It also calls on the Treasury to provide unspecified one-year loans to cities to allow them to meet cash-flow needs resulting from an inability to borrow.

HEADLINE: Michael Froman

BYLINE: By JODI KANTOR

 BODY:
 As he prepares to take office, President-elect Barack Obama is relying on a small team of advisers who will lead his transition operation and help choose the members of the Obama administration. Following is part of a series of profiles of potential members of the administration. 
 NAMEMichael Froman
 BEING CONSIDERED FOR An international economics or foreign policy post, perhaps at the Treasury Department, the Agency for International Development or the White House. He is already a member of Mr. Obama's transition advisory council, and while family issues may prevent him from taking an immediate role, he would most likely remain an outside adviser to the president-elect.
 WOULD BRING TO THE JOB Expertise in emerging markets, sustainable development and alternative energy, as a lawyer, an economic policy wonk and a manager.
 IS LINKED TO MR. OBAMA BY Late nights and long meetings at The Harvard Law Review. After graduation, the two lost touch, until Mr. Froman heard that Mr. Obama was running for the Senate and offered assistance. A prodigious fund-raiser, especially among New York's young finance crowd, Mr. Froman introduced Mr. Obama to Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, who has become a key adviser. 
 IN HIS OWN WORDS: ''Creating sustainable economic growth and increasing standards of living cannot solve the region's political and ethnic problems.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Fails to Continue Rally of the Previous Day

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
A day after the major exchanges closed more than 5 percent higher in an afternoon buying frenzy, Wall Street tried, but failed, to repeat the feat on Friday. 
 After creeping into positive territory in late trading, markets did a U-turn and slid back to where they had spent most of the day -- deep in the red. This time, a frenzied last-minute sell-off sent stocks 4 percent lower and erased most of the gains from Thursday's rally.
 ''It's almost a classic bear market response,'' said Michael Holland, manager of Holland and Company. ''We've got incredible volatility, we've got a bear market, we've got lousy economic news. For people to take a chunk of that off the table before the weekend is to be expected.'' 
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 337.94 points, or 3.8 percent, to 8,497.31. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was 38 points lower, or 4.1 percent, to 873.29. The Nasdaq fell 79.85 points, or 5 percent, to 1,516.85.
 For the week, the Dow declined 5 percent while the S.& P. fell 6.7 percent.
 ''We're looking at a deep recession here,'' Jay Bryson, global economist at Wachovia, said. ''The one prop to the U.S. economy, which has been exports, is about to get kicked out from underneath it,'' referring to reports this week that exports declined 6 percent decline in September.
 For investors who wondered whether the market had found its bottom, the continuing losses and grim economic numbers suggested that the problems would continue. On Friday, the Federal Reserve chairman Ben S. Bernanke told a bankers conference in Germany that the American economy was under ''severe strain,'' and the president of the Cleveland Fed said the economy was in a recession.
 ''It has been a weakening environment, and we haven't found the bottom yet,'' said Mark Miller of William Blair and Company. 
 The mortgage finance giant Freddie Mac reported a $25.3 billion loss and requested money from the federal government. Shares in Freddie, which have been consistently below $1 since last week, closed at 67 cents on Friday. 
 Energy stocks and crude oil prices fell on Friday after surging on Thursday on hopes that the OPEC cartel would cut production when it met on Nov. 29. Energy companies including Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Conoco Phillips all finished down, and the price of crude oil fell $1.20, to $57.04 a barrel.
 Interest rates on Treasury notes fell. The Treasury's 10-year bill rose 31/32, to 100 4/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 3.73 percent, down from 3.85 percent late Thursday.
 The department store chain, J. C. Penney, said Friday that its total sales dropped 8.7 percent in the third quarter, and that same-store sales -- sales at stores open at least a year -- fell 10 percent. The department store's net income fell 52 percent in the quarter. 
 Shares in J. C. Penney fell $2.01, or 10 percent, to $17.27, luxury retailers and discount supercenters took a hit. Shares in Abercrombie & Fitch fell 20 percent after the clothing retailer reported that its revenue had fallen 8 percent, and warned that its same-store sales could drop by as much as one-fourth by the end of the year. 
 Macy's and Sears were off, and Saks was down more than 21 percent. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, which has reported steady sales, was down 4 percent.
 The lower outlook from J. C. Penney came as the Commerce Department reported that retail sales plummeted 2.8 percent in October, a record, and were down 4.1 percent from October 2007. Flagging automobile sales, which are 23 percent below last year's numbers, led the plunge.
 Spending at gasoline stations dropped sharply, by nearly 13 percent, as falling oil prices pushed down the price of gasoline.
 Consumers cut back their spending across nearly every sector, like furniture, electronics and clothing. The data portend a bleak Christmas shopping season that will force retailers to make deep discounts, analysts said.
 ''It's just brutal,'' said Eric Beder, retail analyst at Brean Murray and Company. ''It's a very bleak time for the consumer. Unless it's something supercompelling or really necessary, they're not going to the mall, they're not spending.'' 
 Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock Financial, said the falling numbers were a sign that consumers, praised throughout the last decade as an indefatigable driving force of the economy, are now ''cowering.'' 
 ''Consumers feel like the bottom is falling out and that they better pull back,'' Mr. Cheney wrote in a note. ''Probably less than half of the people working today were working during the early 1980s recession when we faced this level of job losses. It is staggering both economically and psychologically.''

HEADLINE: Nokia Rolls Back 4th-Quarter Outlook

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: HELSINKI, Finland 

 BODY:
Nokia, the world's largest cellphone maker, on Friday downgraded its outlook for industrywide mobile device volumes for the fourth quarter, citing pressure from the economic crisis and currency volatility. 
 It also announced that it planned further cost cuts in 2009 ''to respond appropriately to the market conditions,'' but said that it would provide more details on Dec. 4 when it holds its capital markets day in New York.
 The Finnish company warned in a statement that the rapid changes in consumer spending would probably hit the mobile device market.
 It now expects industry mobile device volumes in the fourth quarter to come in below previous forecasts, to around 330 million in the fourth quarter and 1.24 billion for the year. It had earlier forecast 1.26 billion units for the year.
 In its preliminary outlook for 2009, it also said it expected industry mobile device volumes to be lower than in 2008, mainly because of the overall economic slowdown.
 In the Nokia and Siemens joint venture, Nokia Siemens Networks, preliminary estimates indicate that the markets for mobile infrastructure, fixed infrastructure and related services will be down next year compared with 2008, the company said.

HEADLINE: Poor Economy Starting to Shape Sports Landscape

BYLINE: By JULIET MACUR and DAVE CALDWELL

 BODY:
The economic crisis made its first obvious mark on American professional sports Friday when a major cycling event and Nascar announced substantial changes because of financial woes.
 Officials from the Tour de Georgia, one of the marquee road cycling races in the United States, canceled the event for 2009 because of lack of sponsorship. They plan to host the weeklong race in 2010 if the economy is back on track, said Phil Jacobs, a member of the Tour de Georgia Foundation's board of directors.
 ''It's going to be a very tough year for everyone, no matter what business you are in,'' Jacobs said in a telephone interview. ''We worked long and hard, but just didn't have a choice but to skip the race in 2009.'' 
 Nascar officials also announced a cost-saving measure Friday that will markedly change the way teams prepare for races. 
 Starting next season, testing at Nascar-sanctioned tracks will be suspended, Nascar's president, Mike Helton, said in a news conference. ''Hopefully, it's a temporary situation,'' he said, adding that the move would save tens of millions of dollars. Some top teams in the Sprint Cup series, the top level of stock-car racing, say they spend about $1 million annually per car for those testing sessions. Those sessions allow teams to set up and fine-tune their cars for races at that track or tracks with similar dimensions.
 Like Nascar, professional cycling is sponsorship driven and susceptible to downturns in the economy. The Tour de Georgia has struggled to find a title sponsor over the last several years, losing sponsors like Dodge and Ford since the race's debut in 2003. 
 In the past two years, the race has relied on the state of Georgia for $400,000 of its $3.2 million budget. But in a shaky economy, that money was not guaranteed for 2009. With Georgia facing a budget shortfall likely to exceed $1.5 billion, event officials said they knew they could not count on the state to renew its financial commitment.
 ''We literally discussed all options to save it, from having a single-day race to reducing the number of stages, but we hated to sacrifice the quality of the event,'' Jacobs said. 
 Talks with several other sponsors revealed reluctance from companies to commit for 2009 -- or to commit at the level they had been giving -- because of economic hardships, Jacobs said.
 Another blow to the race came when Lance Armstrong, a seven-time Tour de France winner, did not commit to competing in the event. Organizers said that Armstrong, who came out of retirement this year, never gave a firm commitment to enter the race.
 ''It's sad to see any big race like that to disappear in the United States, but in a weak economy, the weaker properties get culled,'' said Jonathan Vaughters, race director of Team Garmin-Chipotle. ''The Tour of Georgia struggled in a strong economy. That didn't bode well for it down the road.''
 Organizers of the other premier cycling races in the United States -- the Tour of California and the Tour of Missouri -- said their sponsorships and their races were strong, and even growing.
 Jerry Dowell, the executive director of the Tour of Missouri, said the race had renewed about 60 percent of its sponsors for next year and was adding a few major ones. 
 Right now, the race's main sponsor is the Missouri Division of Tourism. But maintaining cash flow as the economy worsens has not been easy, Dowell said.
 ''We have to go to more companies and have lowered the expectation from each one,'' he said. ''Every company's budget person I've talked to says they are tightening their belts.''
 The Tour of California's title sponsor, Amgen, has signed a long-term contract with the race. Still, that race may have an easier time persuading other sponsors to sign on or stay on because Armstrong has agreed to compete in the 2009 event. 
 ''If we didn't have such a good story to tell, we'd be in trouble,'' said Andrew Messick, president of AEG Sports, which owns and operates the Tour of California. He added that race organizers had positioned themselves to be impervious to fluctuations in the economy because they have worked so hard to market the race.
 In Nascar, however, teams cannot avoid the effects of a faltering economy and an automobile industry fraught with financial problems. 
 Attendance at Nascar races has fallen; a Sprint Cup race Nov. 2 in Fort Worth drew an estimated crowd of 165,000, nearly 20,000 less than the same race in 2007.
 Costs have risen for race teams, with some fighting to stay in business. Officials from Chip Ganassi Racing and Dale Earnhardt Inc. announced earlier this week that they were merging, prompting what was said to be 110 layoffs at Earnhardt's shop.
 Officials in the sport say they hope that these bad days are fleeting, and that the testing at tracks will return when the economy improves. 
 For now, though, Helton said testing will not be permitted at tracks that host Sprint Cup, Nationwide Series and Camping World Truck Series races. Testing for teams in the Camping World East and West regional series will also be suspended. It is still possible for teams to test at racetracks that do not host Nascar events.
 Some drivers said they were discouraged by the testing ban. 
 The two-time Sprint Cup champion Jimmie Johnson, who is expected to win his record-tying third straight championship Sunday, said he understood the need for cutting costs, but said it would be better to devise a compromise, like allowing testing on Fridays before races.
 ''I think it's a mistake,'' he said of the freeze. ''I think the teams need a chance to work on their cars to improve their programs, to put on a better show.''
 Others, like the 2000 series champion Bobby Labonte, said the move was necessary.
 ''They can't control the cost of the teams and what they spend, but I hope Nascar can help control a major chunk until the storm is over,'' he said. ''Hopefully, this rule will accomplish that.''

HEADLINE: Your Insurance Company, and Related Worries

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER.

 BODY:
Ever since the problems at the American International Group burst into the consciousness of everyday consumers two months ago, a sort of low-grade fear has set in among policyholders at insurance companies of all kinds. 
 This week, the concern moved up a notch or two. First, the federal government raised its A.I.G. bailout commitment to $150 billion. Then, a Goldman Sachs research report suggested that some life insurance companies might have to exit the business altogether.
 All of this raises many questions: What has happened in the past when insurance companies have gone under? What might happen to your life policy or annuity in the worst case? Is there anything you can do to protect yourself?
 We will get to the somewhat unsatisfying answers to that last question below. But before we do, let's indulge our inner worrywarts with a brief history lesson. It's the 17-year saga of what was once California's largest life insurance company, whose collapse featured cameos by Michael Milken, David Geffen, Sam Zell and a brain-damaged child who is out seven figures and counting. 
 The company was called Executive Life, and at the time of its demise in 1991, it had about two-thirds of its assets invested in junk bonds (Mr. Milken's company sold them, and Executive Life's parent company eagerly took them in.) 
 When the value of those bonds fell, many policyholders took their business elsewhere, in an insurance version of a run on the bank. California's insurance commissioner seized the company's unit in that state, a move regulators elsewhere quickly copied. 
 While Executive Life continued to pay out claims when people died, other policyholders who stayed with the company were not allowed to cash in their policies or borrow against them except in case of hardship. Some types of monthly annuity payments dropped to 70 percent of what they were supposed to be. 
 The measures were supposed to be temporary, but the stopgap ended up lasting for two and a half years because of ugly legal wrangling that pitted some policyholders against one another. 
 California's insurance commissioner auctioned off the company and all kinds of people turned up to kick the tires (enter Mr. Geffen and Mr. Zell). Eventually, a consortium of companies emerged as the winners, with a unit of the French megabank Credit Lyonnais buying the junk bonds and other French companies taking over the policies themselves. 
 Things got ugly for consumers from there. After having waited so long, many saw interest rates, premiums or other terms on their policies change for the worse. Though some people were made whole, it happened very slowly. Stan Richelson, a certified financial planner with the Scarsdale Investment Group in Blue Bell, Pa., owned some Executive Life guaranteed investment contracts and just noticed a few weeks ago that an additional $60 had recently turned up in an old 401(k).
 Others were not so lucky. The parents of Katie Watson, a girl in Phoenix who suffered permanent brain damage after a hospital stay, put the proceeds from their legal settlement into an Executive Life annuity to help care for her. After the company's demise, however, their annuity payments fell nearly by half. 
 Her father, Vince, said that the Watsons ended up in foreclosure on a home they had bought to accommodate caring for Katie, and the total shortfall between what the family had received and what it was supposed to get was at least $1 million. In all, policyholders lost about $4.5 billion. 
 It got worse from there. In 1999, a whistle-blower came forward and charged that Credit Lyonnais had broken both state and federal laws involving foreign and bank ownership of insurance companies. Jean Peyrelevade, the former chairman of Credit Lyonnais, later pleaded guilty to two felonies in 2006 (though under an arrangement that simultaneously allowed him to declare his innocence) and was banned from setting foot in the United States for three years. 
 The Executive Life story is not over yet. At least one legal case involving the California insurance commissioner is still winding its way through federal courts. 
 A lot would have to go wrong for something like this to happen again. First, insurance experts know of few, if any, companies that have gone under so far because of the current financial crisis. Risk managers learned valuable lessons from Executive Life and other companies that fell apart. State insurance regulators keep pretty strict tabs on companies now.
 The regulators could lend a hand in the coming months by lowering minimum capital requirements for insurance companies, giving them some breathing room. The federal government could also make loans or other assistance available to insurance companies of any sort; only ones affiliated with banks or savings and loans are eligible right now. 
 In the event of emerging problems, the regulators would try to broker the sale of weak companies to stronger ones that would honor the policies and terms. Failing that, each state has something called a guaranty association that provides a sort of backstop to policyholders, within certain limits, and covers them if their troubled insurer cannot.
 For life insurance companies, the state associations usually cover a policy for up to at least $300,000 in death benefits, $100,000 in cash surrender or withdrawal value for life insurance and $100,000 in withdrawal and cash values on annuities (though the investment risk in a variable annuity is yours alone to bear). 
 This was what allowed many Executive Life policyholders to get their money back but left the Watson family short, since their annuity was much higher than their state's limits.
 Some states offer higher caps, and others may raise theirs soon. You can look up your own state's coverage and read more about how the guaranty associations work at nolhga.com. 
 A payout from a guaranty association does not happen instantaneously. Again, at Executive Life, it took two and a half years for many policyholders to start collecting their money. The process would take months at least, with worried people in limbo in the meantime.
 Plenty of things could cause another run on insurance companies. A devastating earnings report or financial filing could set one off. So could comments from public officials.
 So what actions should you consider taking in the coming months? One big problem with pulling money out of an insurance company is that it can cost you dearly. There might be penalties called surrender charges. Tax consequences lurk. And there is no guarantee that you can get similar coverage elsewhere, or buy it at an affordable price. 
 Then, you need to convince yourself that your new insurance company isn't similarly troubled or won't be soon. ''Consumers don't have much option other than to rely on agency ratings'' of insurance company soundness, said Joseph Belth, a professor emeritus of insurance at Indiana University who edits a periodical about the industry. ''They can't do the analysis themselves.'' 
 A.M. Best, Fitch Ratings, Moody's and Standard & Poor's all rate insurance companies and have free information on their Web sites. There are links from the version of this column at nytimes.com/yourmoney. The company's grading systems differ from one another, so look them up first.
 That said, Mr. Watson, the father of Katie, is quick to note that when selecting his daughter's annuity, he consulted the ratings carefully before deciding on Executive Life. ''Our attorney said that banks have failed, savings and loans have failed, but never in the history of ourrepublic has an A. M. Best top-rated company failed,'' he said. ''That was enough for me.''
 If you're looking to switch insurance companies, start with a top-rated one, but also keep an eye out for too-good-to-be-true terms or brand new riders or features. They may not be truly battle-tested. Also, don't stop paying premiums on your old policy until the new one is up and running. You don't want to be caught dead, literally, during a coverage gap.
 And if you want to be as close to safe as possible, said Francine Duke of Aqua Financial Planning in Lincolnshire, Ill., split your coverage between two companies in case one of them runs into trouble. ''It's like double locking your door,'' she said.
 Or triple locking it if you need to work with three companies to put your mind at ease. Or sextuple locking it. This level of paranoia, alas, is what we've come to now.

HEADLINE: Today's Special

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN; Christopher Maag contributed reporting from Cleveland.

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Minn. -- The economy is in tatters and, for millions of people, the future is uncertain. But for some employees at the Hormel Foods Corporation plant here, times have never been better. They are working at a furious pace and piling up all the overtime they want.
The workers make Spam, perhaps the emblematic hard-times food in the American pantry.
Through war and recession, Americans have turned to the glistening canned product from Hormel as a way to save money while still putting something that resembles meat on the table. Now, in a sign of the times, it is happening again, and Hormel is cranking out as much Spam as its workers can produce. 
In a factory that abuts Interstate 90, two shifts of workers have been making Spam seven days a week since July, and they have been told that the relentless work schedule will continue indefinitely.
Spam, a gelatinous 12-ounce rectangle of spiced ham and pork, may be among the world's most maligned foods, dismissed as inedible by food elites and skewered by comedians who have offered smart-alecky theories on its name (one G-rated example: Something Posing As Meat).
But these days, consumers are rediscovering relatively cheap foods, Spam among them. A 12-ounce can of Spam, marketed as ''Crazy Tasty,'' costs about $2.40. ''People are realizing it's not that bad a product,'' said Dan Johnson, 55, who operates a 70-foot-high Spam oven.
Hormel declined to cooperate with this article, but several of its workers were interviewed here recently with the help of their union, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union Local 9. Slumped in chairs at the union hall after making 149,950 cans of Spam on the day shift, several workers said they been through boom times before -- but nothing like this.
Spam ''seems to do well when hard times hit,'' said Dan Bartel, business agent for the union local. ''We'll probably see Spam lines instead of soup lines.''
Even as consumers are cutting back on all sorts of goods, Spam is among a select group of thrifty grocery items that are selling steadily.
Pancake mixes and instant potatoes are booming. So are vitamins, fruit and vegetable preservatives and beer, according to data from October compiled by Information Resources, a market research firm.
''We've seen a double-digit increase in the sale of rice and beans,'' said Teena Massingill, spokeswoman for the Safeway grocery chain, in an e-mail message. ''They're real belly fillers.''
Kraft Foods said recently that some of its value-oriented products like macaroni and cheese, Jell-O and Kool-Aid were experiencing robust growth. And sales are still growing, if not booming, for Velveeta, a Kraft product that bears the same passing resemblance to cheese as Spam bears to ham.
Spam holds a special place in America's culinary history, both as a source of humor and of cheap protein during hard times.
Invented during the Great Depression by Jay Hormel, the son of the company's founder, Spam is a combination of ham, pork, sugar, salt, water, potato starch and a ''hint'' of sodium nitrite ''to help Spam keep its gorgeous pink color,'' according to Hormel's Web site for the product.
Because it is vacuum-sealed in a can and does not require refrigeration, Spam can last for years. Hormel says ''it's like meat with a pause button.''
During World War II, Spam became a staple for Allied troops overseas. They introduced it to local residents, and it remains popular in many parts of the world where the troops were stationed.
Spam developed a camp following in the 1970s, mainly because of Monty Python, the English comedy troupe. In a 1970 skit, a couple tried to order breakfast at a cafe featuring Spam in nearly every entree, like ''Spam, Eggs, Sausage and Spam.'' The diners were eventually drowned out by a group of Vikings singing, ''Spam, lovely Spam, wonderful Spam.''
(Familiar with the skit, Internet pioneers labeled junk e-mail ''spam'' because it overwhelmed other dialogue, according to one theory.)
Here in Austin, local officials have tried to capitalize on Spam's kitschy cultural status, even if a decidedly unpleasant odor hangs over the town (a slaughterhouse next to the Hormel plant butchers 19,000 hogs a day). Austin advertises itself as ''Spamtown,'' and it boasts 13 restaurants with Spam on the menu.
Jerry's Other Place sells a Spamburger for $6.29. Johnny's ''Spamarama'' menu includes eggs Benedict with Spam for $7.35. At Steve's Pizza, a medium Spam and pineapple pizza costs $11.58.
''There are all kinds of people who have an emotional connection to Spam,'' said Gil Gutknecht Jr., the former Minnesota congressman, who was in the gift shop at the Spam Museum buying a Spam tie, sweatshirt and earrings. Mr. Gutknecht recalled that he once served as a judge in a Spam recipe contest.
''The best thing was Spam brownies,'' he said, with more or less a straight face.
No independent data provider compiles sales figures that include all the outlets where Spam is sold, including foreign stores, so it is not clear exactly how much sales are up. Hormel's chief executive, Jeffrey M. Ettinger, said in September that they were growing by double digits.
The company would not discuss more recent sales of the product or permit a tour of the Spam factory, citing rules that Hormel said prevented it from speaking ahead of a forthcoming earnings report.
However, Hormel executives appear to be banking on the theory that Spam fits nicely into recession budgets. Workers on the Spam line in Austin -- more than 40 of them work two shifts --see no signs that their work schedule will let up.
''We are scheduled to work every day except Thanksgiving and Christmas,'' said Darwin Sellers, 56, a Spam ''formulator'' who adds salt, sugar and nitrites to batches of Spam. ''Mr. Ettinger is negotiating with the man upstairs to get us to work eight days a week.''
Mr. Sellers said he had not seen much of his family in recent months, but the grueling schedule had been good for his checkbook. He bought a new television and planned to replace a 20-year-old refrigerator.
Unlike his colleagues though, he has no plans to stock up on Spam. ''It's not something I've ever developed a taste for,'' he said.
A rising segment of the public, it seems, does have a taste for Spam, which is available in several varieties, including Spam Low Sodium, Spam with Cheese and Spam Hot & Spicy.
James Bate, a 48-year-old sausage maker, was buying it at Wal-Mart in Cleveland recently. Not only was it cheap, but he said it brought back fond memories of his grandfather's making him Spam sandwiches.
''You can mix it with tomatoes and onions and make a good meal out of it,'' he said. ''A little bit of this stuff goes a long way.''
Correction: November 18, 2008, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about Spam, the canned meat product, misstated an ingredient used as a preservative. It is sodium nitrite, not sodium nitrate.

HEADLINE: Forget It, Football Fans; Doubleheader Isn't Doable

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

 BODY:
With the Giants and the Jets sitting in first place in their respective divisions, their success has prompted the N.F.L. to begin considering a potential problem: What happens if two teams that share a stadium were to host conference championship games?
The N.F.C. and A.F.C. championship games are scheduled for Jan. 18. One is an afternoon kickoff, the other would be in the early evening. If the Giants (8-1) and the Jets (7-3) advanced to their conference's championship game, and were the higher-seeded team, Giants Stadium would be needed for both games. 
''Logistically impossible'' is how the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which operates Giants Stadium, described the possibility of playing two games on one day in one stadium.
''You would have to empty it, clean it, get 80,000 out of the parking lot and get another 80,000 people in,'' said John Samerjan, spokesman for the sports authority. ''The N.F.L. would have to do something.''
A day after the Jets' victory over New England vaulted them to the top of the A.F.C. East, the stadium subject became a topic of conversation in the N.F.L. offices. But it is not yet a real enough possibility to develop anything resembling a plan.
''The answer is, we would evaluate all the options and make a decision at the appropriate time,'' said Greg Aiello, the spokesman for the N.F.L. ''We are not ready to discuss what those options are.''
Clearly, one of the games would have to be moved. The options would be to play it on Saturday or on Monday night. The problem is, the league will not know if that will be necessary until the Sunday before, when the divisional games are played. The bigger problem might be placating the network whose game is moved to Saturday or Monday, less desirable broadcasting spots for a game.
Fox will televise the N.F.C. championship game, and CBS has the rights to the A.F.C. game.
According to Neal Pilson, a former president of CBS Sports, a network might prefer the game be moved to Monday night because ratings would be better than on Saturday, but it might make more economic sense to move the game to Saturday. That is because the network would be pre-empting less valuable regular programming. He said a Monday night game would replace perhaps $3 million to $5 million worth of programming and Saturday's programming might be worth half that number.
''Of course, how you make the decision of which network's game to move, that might be something as unique as a coin flip,'' Pilson said.
But the N.F.L. would also take into consideration whether an earlier or later game would affect the competitive balance, whether one team would have not enough days -- or too many -- between the divisional game and the conference championship.
Samerjan said it would not be unusual to stage games on consecutive days, and it would not be an unmanageable turnaround from Saturday to Sunday or Sunday to Monday. And it would be fun, he said.
''What a delightful problem to have,'' Samerjan said. ''It would be wonderful for the local market.''
It would then raise the next issue: a potential Giants-Jets Super Bowl. Of course, that would be played in Tampa, Fla.

 HAMAS FIRES ROCKETS INTO ISRAEL;
 18 Hospitalized as Tensions Rise
 Hamas, the Palestinian rulers of Gaza, fired a barrage of rockets into southern Israel as part of what it called retaliation for the killing of 11 militants over the past 11 days and the increased closings of Gaza crossings by Israel. The rockets sent 18 Israelis to the hospital with mild injuries and shock and has increased tensions between Hamas and Israel. Hamas said that it wanted to continue the five-month-old truce but that Israel's actions showed they did not. Page A7 
 TWO REPORTERS HURT IN PAKISTAN
 A Japanese journalist and an Afghan colleague were wounded in a shooting during a botched kidnapping in Peshawar. The attempt came after the men had conducted interviews with Taliban fighters in the nearby tribal region, the police and local journalists said. The attack followed several others, all part of a surge of militant violence in Peshawar, including the assassination of an American aid worker on Wednesday. Page A6 
 RUSSIA MOVES TO EXTEND LIMITS
 It was the old-timers from the Communist Party who stepped in with the only word of protest as Russia neared passing a bill to extend the presidential term to six years from four. The bill's rapid trip through the lower house of Parliament has drawn harsh criticism from opposition leaders. But the opposition has little presence in the house, so the bill is almost nearly assured of becoming law, leaving the Communists as virtually the only dissenters. Page A8 
 PILOT ERROR IN MEXICO PLANE CRASH
 The authorities said that a Mexican government Learjet crashed last week, killing the interior minister, because it flew too close behind a jumbo jet and lost control in the turbulence created by the larger plane. The report on the crash, which killed all nine people on board and five on the ground, said that the pilot and co-pilot appeared to be confused about how to operate the Learjet's controls. Page A8 
 UNDER PINOCHET, THE WHOLE STORY
 Heraldo Munoz was willing to die for an insurrection that never materialized and life under the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. He later became Chile's permanent representative to the United Nations and head of the Security Council's antiterrorism committee. His book, published this fall, ''The Dictator's Shadow: Life Under Augusto Pinochet,'' offers the whole story, even an anecdote about creeping through Santiago with unstable dynamite strapped to his chest.

 CONCERNS OVER GUANTaNAMO
 As New Administration Nears
 As Senator Barack Obama moves closer to assuming responsibility for the Guantanamo Bay prison, his vows to close it are bringing to the fore thorny questions his advisers are now considering. For example, what if some detainees are acquitted or cannot be prosecuted at all? That concern is at the center of a debate among national security, human rights and legal experts that has intensified since the election. PAGE A13
 HEATED SENATE RACE IN MINNESOTA
 The vote gap between the incumbent Republican senator, Norm Coleman, and his Democratic challenger, the comedian Al Franken, in Minnesota's still-undecided Senate race has narrowed since Election Day, but the hostility and vitriol surrounding the race seem to grow by the hour. Stakes are high, because with three Senate races yet to be decided, Democrats still have a chance of winning the 60 seats needed to break Republican filibusters in Washington. PAGE A13
 ANOTHER BLOW DEALT TO GALVESTON
 Still struggling to recover from Hurricane Ike, the battered economy of Galveston Island suffered another severe blow this week when the University of Texas decided to lay off 3,800 people, a third of the work force, from the medical center that is the largest employer on the island. PAGE A10
 REVAMPING THE SPACE STATION
 While previous NASA missions have often focused on adding modules or solar panels to the International Space Station, a 15-day shuttle mission is devoted to work on the $100 billion orbiting outpost to transform the inside so that crew size can be doubled to six. A crew of six will allow more scientific work to be performed, and will change the dynamic of life in orbit. PAGE A10

 RUMORS OF CLINTON APPOINTMENT
 Create Anxious Buzz in New York
 When word passed that Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton was a contender to serve as President-elect Barack Obama's secretary of state, it set off a buzz of speculation in New York -- who would replace her? According to New York election law, Gov. David A. Paterson would appoint her successor if she takes the job. Two people close to the governor said that Mr. Paterson believes he might have to do so. Page A15 
 WINNING DESIGN FOR BIKE RACKS
 A circle struck through by a bar, sort of like the Ghostbusters logo, except not red, and well, no ghost either. Actually, never mind, they're not much alike. A new bike rack created by Ian Mahaffey and Maarten De Greeve, two designers from Copenhagen, has won the CityRacks Design Competition, officials announced. It will become the city's new standard bicycle rack. Page A15 
 PHASING OUT A LEGENDARY THUG
 It's hard out here for a thug -- the only job he managed to land was getting shot at by the police, and he may be facing retirement. For four decades, the Police Department firing ranges have been using ''the Thug,'' a silhouette target created in the 1960s. Initially designed to make it harder to gauge where shots hit the target, it is being phased out in favor of one that makes it easier to score from a distance, a police spokesman said. Page A15

 YANKEES MAKE A RECORD OFFERING
 While Prowling Free Agent Market
 The Yankees have been laying in the cut for a while. They passed on trading for Johan Santana, eager to slip another ace into their hand while not giving up their best prospects, and Friday they got their chance, making an offer to C. C. Sabathia that would be a record figure for a pitcher. According to two people with intimate knowledge of the deal, the six-year offer is worth $140 million, an amount that exceeds the $137.5 million deal the Mets gave Santana. Page D1 
 LAW'S TALK TO JETS BEFORE WIN
 The night before the Jets triumphed in fine fashion over New England, Ty Law, a day into his tenure with the team, gave his new teammates a window into the Patriots' opinion of the Jets: that given enough space, they would find a way to lose. Mr. Law spent nine seasons with New England and was himself responsible more than once for serving up defeat to the Jets. They now have a chance to rise above their previous collapses, and a superior quarterback to help them do so. Page D2

 THE OPTIONS ARE GETTING THINNER
 For Corporate Health Care
 It's that time of year again, when corporate America gets to choose medical plans for the coming year. But even if employees are in the enviable position of having a job, when so many positions have been trimmed, using the word choice for their medical options should maybe be in quotes. The menu is short. Another typical new feature is a health plan with a high annual deductible that is likely to reach $1,100 for an individual and even more for family coverage. Page B1 
 WALL STREET CLOSES ON LOW NOTE
 After late trading slowly inched shares toward positive territory, Wall Street did a 180-degree turn and shares sank back, deeply in the red, where they had spent most of the day. On this occasion, a last-minute sell-off of stocks absorbed most of the gains from the rally on Thursday, when major exchanges closed more than 5 percent ahead. Experts called it ''almost a classic bear market,'' adding that taking a piece of that back before the weekend was to be expected. Page B5 
 INSURANCE AND RELATED WORRIES
 When the American International Group became a household name two months ago, a small-time fear began to creep into the minds of policy holders at all kinds of insurance companies. That fear heightened when A.I.G. increased its bailout needs to $150 billion and Goldman Sachs suggested that some companies might go under entirely, leaving policy holders to fret over what to do and ways to protect themselves.

 AT LEAST THE STASH OF SPAM IS SAFE
 We named one of the most obnoxious side-effects of the digital age after it -- Spam. A rubbery processed food made of pork and ham, it has a reputation as a notorious hard-times food. And in a struggling economy with a dark financial future, the Hormel Foods factory that makes the stuff has been working around the clock to manufacture more, seven days a week since July, as Americans explore more cheap foods. Page B1 
 NONPROFIT, EMPHASIS ON THE 'NON'
 With people gripping ever tighter to their purse strings, imagine the effect this has had on charities and nonprofit groups that depend on private donations. While the average person has been allowed the luxury of waiting for the other financial shoe to fall, nonprofit groups and charities have not. That shoe has fallen -- fast, hard and on their necks. Coupled with the demand for their services growing sharply, the decline is even grimmer. Page B6

 BELOVED TAXIDERMIST LOST, 
 Parisians to the Rescue
 When a fire ripped through Deyrolle, the 177-year-old taxidermist in Paris, last February, it was as if a dagger had been plunged into the heart of the city. Ninety percent of the shop's stock, including a celebrated fossil collection and a 19th-century diorama of more than 100 birds, was lost. But Paris has since come together in an unusual display of solidarity to save the store. Hermes reissued a limited-edition scarf to raise money, and private donations have included 50 boxes of butterflies, and a bull's head. PAGE C1 
 FOLLOWING MARCO POLO'S FOOTSTEPS
 Back in 1993, Denis Belliveau and Francis O'Donnell, two friends from Queens, decided it would be fun to try to follow the trail supposedly blazed by Marco Polo more than 700 years earlier.

 WHAT'S NEXT FOR CABLE NEWS?
 Over the last three months of the 2008 presidential campaign, ratings for the cable news channel MSNBC were up 158 percent over the same period a year earlier. They were up 101 percent for the Fox News Channel. For cable channels with strong points of view, it was a very good election. But for all the media outlets that set viewership records in recent months, the looming question after Senator Barack Obama's election is: What happens now? PAGE C5

HEADLINE: TECH COMPANIES, LONG INSULATED, NOW FEEL SLUMP

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE; Miguel Helft contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The technology industry, which resisted the economy's growing weakness over the last year as customers kept buying laptops and iPhones, has finally succumbed to the slowdown.
 In the span of just a few weeks, orders for both business and consumer tech products have collapsed, and technology companies have begun laying off workers. The plunge is so severe that some executives are comparing it with the dot-com bust in 2000, when hundreds of companies disappeared and Silicon Valley lost nearly a fifth of its jobs.
 October ''was like turning a switch,'' said Robert Barbera, chief economist at the Investment Technology Group, a research and trading firm. ''Everything pretty much shut down.'' 
 After industry leaders like Intel and Nokia warned of slowing sales this week, investors aggressively sold technology stocks. On Friday, the Nasdaq composite index, which is full of technology names, fell 5 percent. Advanced Micro Devices and eBay both dropped more than 10 percent.
 Tech companies directly account for about 4 percent of the nation's employment. And globally, companies and governments spend about $1.75 trillion on technology a year, according to Forrester Research. But the industry's importance to the world economy is larger than its size might suggest. Technology has fueled many of the productivity gains of the last two decades. And about half of the capital spending by corporations goes toward technology products, according to Moody'sEconomy.com. 
 As struggling businesses cut back on spending of all kinds, a slowdown in tech proved inevitable.
 During the dot-com crash, technology companies were victims of Internet hype that they helped create. Once the enthusiasm faded, so did the boom-era sales on software and infrastructure equipment.
 However, consumer enthusiasm for products like video games, wireless phones and high-definition televisions helped the industry recover. 
 This time around, the tech sector finds itself at the mercy of a double-barreled slump in both corporate and consumer spending caused by the housing decline and the economic crisis on Wall Street. Technology companies are also feeling the effect of frozen credit markets as business and government customers struggle to finance computer and software purchases that can run to millions of dollars. 
 ''We have never seen anything like this in history,'' said William T. Coleman III, a Silicon Valley veteran who founded the software maker BEA Systems and is now chief executive at a start-up called Cassatt. 
 Best Buy, the leading electronics retailer, declared this week that ''rapid, seismic changes in consumer behavior'' had fostered the worst conditions in its 42-year history, and its main rival, Circuit City Stores, filed for bankruptcy protection. Nokia, the world's largest maker of cellphones, predicted Friday that global sales of handsets would fall in 2009, which would be only the second decline ever.
 Technology giants like Intel, which makes chips for personal computers and servers, and Cisco Systems, which makes network equipment, warned that revenue was plummeting at rates last seen in 2001. 
 Dozens of start-ups, like the messaging service Twitter and the electric carmaker Tesla Motors, have been cutting staff members as they prepare for a slow economy.
 And on Friday, Sun Microsystems, a leading maker of computers used by financial services companies, announced that it would lay off as many as 6,000 employees, or 18 percent of its work force.
 The turnaround has been as sudden as it is severe. Until late September, a number of large technology companies maintained an optimistic stance, despite the obvious distress in the global economy.
 Cisco was the first large technology company to reveal its sales data from October, noting a 9 percent fall in sales compared with the same month last year. On Nov. 5, Cisco, which is based in San Jose, cautioned that because of a ''completely different environment,'' revenue in its current quarter could plummet as much as 10 percent -- a major reversal from the 7 percent growth that Wall Street had been expecting.
 Intel, the world's largest chip maker, followed this week, warning that sales in the fourth quarter could fall as much as 19 percent compared with the same period last year.
 Even Google, an advertising juggernaut that many analysts said they believed would weather a downturn better than other companies, is now feeling the impact. 
 About eight weeks ago, the company's chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt, told reporters, ''My guess is that the drama is in New York and not here.'' A month later, Google surprised Wall Street when it reported strong financial results for the quarter that ended Sept. 30, sending its shares up 10 percent.
 But Google's stock has dropped 16 percent since, as the same analysts who were upbeat about its results have since cut their revenue and profit forecasts. This week, its shares dipped below $300 for the first time in three years, well below their $742 peak. And the company, known for its torrid hiring and free-spending on employee perks, has begun the most serious belt-tightening in its 10-year history.
 ''We don't know as managers how long the crisis goes,'' Mr. Schmidt said last week. 
 For all the gloom, the tech industry is still far healthier than Wall Street. Unlike the banks, many technology companies are flush with cash. Cisco has close to $27 billion; Google, $14 billion; and Apple, $24 billion. It is likely that some of these funds will go toward acquiring struggling competitors. ''The guys that aren't as strong will be good pickings,'' Mr. Coleman said.
 Powered by technology, Silicon Valley has stood out as a bright spot for jobs in the United States, with employment growing at about 2 percent a year while national employment slowed. Through 2007, the region continued to add 20,000 jobs, although that positive trend has started to change. 
 ''With this now having become a worldwide event, it's clear that the job losses will come,'' said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. 
 Given the unpredictability of the current economy, the industry's past experience will only go so far, said Chris Cornell, an economist with Economy.com. ''It would be a tragic mistake for C.E.O.'s who did a great job fighting the last recession to think the same tactics will work this time,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Democracy and Ukraine

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''As Ukraine Staggers, Its Leaders Quarrel'' (news article, Nov. 4): 
 Part of the recent criticism aimed at Ukraine stands in sharp contrast with very real achievements in many areas that define Ukraine as a modern and dynamic country.
 I would not deny that some critical remarks aimed at Ukrainian authorities are to the point. Yet we are committed to democratic procedures. 
 The decision on early parliamentary elections announced by the decree of the president has clearly demonstrated his adherence to democratic values. His position might not be shared by various political forces, but this was his response to their inability to create an effective coalition according to the provisions of the Ukrainian Constitution.
 By requesting explicit compliance with the constitutional principles and resolutely advocating the national interests, the president of Ukraine has shown again that he is the undisputed focal point of the nation's consolidation, the leader capable of protecting it from economic or political crisis.
 Having faced the aggravation of the situation in the financial sector, he suspended his decision on elections, so that Parliament could approve the stabilization package and adopt other urgent socioeconomic measures.
 I am positive that we shall overcome all the difficulties no matter how complicated the process of our development may look from the outside.
 Centuries of struggle for independence and freedom have taught us to uphold them.

HEADLINE: A Record Decline in October's Retail Sales

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Dragged down by plummeting automobile sales, retail sales fell by a record amount in October, the Commerce Department reported on Friday.
 Sales were down 2.8 percent in October from September, and 4.1 percent from October 2007 as consumers pared their spending in the face of plunging stocks, rising unemployment and growing worries that the United States was headed into a recession. 
 ''It's just brutal,'' said Eric Beder, retail analyst at Brean Murray and Company. ''It's a very bleak time for the consumer. Unless it's something super-compelling or really necessary, they're not going to the mall, they're not spending.'' 
 October's decline was the fourth consecutive monthly drop, and was worse than Wall Street's expectations of a 2.1 percent decline. The government also revised September retail sales downward by 0.1 percent. The October decline topped the 2.65 percent drop in November 2001, which came after the terrorist attacks.
 Also on Friday, the Commerce Department reported that business inventories declined 0.2 percent in September, the first drop since March 2007. The drop followed a 0.2 percent rise in August. Economists had expected inventories to be flat.
 But as bad as the reports were, analysts said they are only likely to get worse if unemployment continues to swell and more workers find their hours cut back or holiday bonuses clipped. Unemployment reached 6.5 percent last month and many economists think that it could hit 8 percent by the middle of next year.
 ''We haven't found the bottom yet,'' said Mark Miller, an analyst at William Blair and Company.
 Sales of cars and auto parts plunged 23.4 percent from last year, the Commerce Department said. Industry sales in the United States have fallen 14.6 percent this year, and 31.9 percent in October, carmakers reported earlier this month. Sales began declining in the spring because of rising gas prices, but have since gotten worse. The sales rate in October was the lowest recorded in 25 years and analysts predict the market will remain weak into 2009. 
 Shares in American automakers, the Ford Motor Company and General Motors, have fallen to multi-decade lows as the companies reported billions in losses. Some lawmakers have called for a bailout of the auto industry, but Democratic leaders said Thursday that the odds of a rescue package looked dim.
 Excluding autos, retail sales fell 2.2 percent, the report said. With consumer spending the engine that drives about two-thirds of the economy, the slowdown portended an extended, severe recession. Gross domestic product fell 0.3 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter.
 Sales of furniture and home-furnishings fell by 13.5 percent compared with 2007, the latest report said, and Americans also spent less money at retailers who sell home electronics, appliances and sporting goods, books and clothes. 
 Sales at the nation's largest retailers plummeted in October. Of the more than two dozen major retailers that reported sales last week, most had declines, the majority of the decreases in double digits. Sales at Neiman Marcus, the luxury department store, dropped nearly 28 percent in October. Sales fell 20 percent at Abercrombie & Fitch, nearly 17 percent at Saks, 16 percent at Gap and nearly that much at Nordstrom.
 Spending at gasoline stations dropped sharply, by nearly 13 percent, as falling crude-oil prices pushed down the price of gasoline.
 While most retailers are suffering, Mitchell Kaiser of Piper Jaffray said that 99-cent stores like Family Dollar Stores or Dollar Tree have seen their shares rise and their business increase. The rest of the retailing world has not been as fortunate.
 ''We set a record in October, and it's probably going to persist into the holidays,'' Mr. Kaiser said. ''The early commentary out of November is that things could take another step down. The demand side is just very limited.''
 In another report released Friday, the Labor Department reported that import prices declined 4.7 percent in October after falling by a revised 3.3 percent in September, mostly because of slumping oil prices.

PERSON: Carl D. Keith 

HEADLINE: Carl D. Keith, 88, a Father Of the Catalytic Converter

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Carl D. Keith, a co-inventor of the three-way automotive catalytic converter -- a major advance in eliminating the toxic tailpipe emissions that once blanketed cities in smog -- died Sunday while visiting one of his daughters in New Bern, N.C. He was 88 and lived on Marco Island in Florida.
 His grandson Leonard Hardesty Jr. confirmed the death. 
 Working with John J. Mooney and a team of other chemical engineers at the Engelhard Corporation, one of the world's largest mineral refining companies, Dr. Keith designed the three-way catalytic converter in the early 1970s, just as the stricter emission requirements of the Clean Air Act Extension of 1970 were coming into effect. 
 ''Billions of people around the world breathe cleaner air because of this invention,'' Margo Oge, director of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality at the Environmental Protection Agency, said Friday. 
 The three-way converter was a significant improvement over what is called the oxidizing converter, the patent for which is held by General Motors. The three-way is now standard for cars and light trucks made in the United States and in most of the rest of the world.
 Lindsay Brooke, a senior editor of Automotive Engineering International, the magazine of the Society of Automotive Engineers, said Thursday in an interview, ''The catalytic converter, combined with the transition to unleaded gasoline, led to a dramatic improvement in air quality and enabled the auto industry to meet the Clean Air Act regulations.''
 A catalytic converter is a can-shaped device installed beneath a vehicle as part of the exhaust pipe. Inside the converter, a bricklike ceramic honeycomb with hundreds of tiny passages is coated with a catalyst material, typically platinum or palladium. When the exhaust flows out of the engine and passes over and through the catalyst coating, a chemical reaction renders three toxic compounds harmless. 
 The oxidizing converter worked for two of those compounds, turning carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons into carbon dioxide and water. The three-way device designed by Dr. Keith and his colleagues added the conversion of nitrogen oxides into nitrogen and water, greatly reducing the emission of harmful particulates into the air.
 According to an E.P.A. statement, today's cars are 98 percent cleaner in terms of nitrogen oxide emissions than those built in the 1970s, ''and the three-way catalytic converter is the greatest contributor to that reduction.'' 
 David Doniger, the director of climate policy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, agreed, pointing out that ''smog has gone down sharply, even as the number of cars and the size of the economy has more than doubled.''
 Carl Donald Keith was born in Stewart Creek, W.Va., on May 29, 1920, one of three sons of Howard and Mary Rawson Keith. His father was a steelworker, and his mother worked in a bakery.
 Dr. Keith graduated from Salem College, in Winston-Salem, N.C., in 1943. He received a master's degree in chemistry from Indiana University in 1945, and a doctorate from DePaul University in 1947. 
 He was a chemist for Sinclair Oil from 1943 until 1957, and then joined Engelhard Industries. From 1976 to 1985, when he retired, he served as an executive vice president, president and then chairman of the company.
 Dr. Keith's wife, the former Edith Birmingham, died in 2000. He is survived by two daughters, Judith Hardison of New Bern and Carla Hardesty of Randolph, N.J.; six grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.
 In 2002, President Bush presented Dr. Keith and Mr. Mooney with the National Medal of Technology, the nation's highest honor for technological innovation.

HEADLINE: Automakers Offer Big Incentives to Spur Sales

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- This is a miserable time to be selling cars, as the billions of dollars in losses gushing from the Detroit automakers show, but it may be the best opportunity ever to buy one.
Automakers are throwing cash rebates at would-be shoppers who have been scared off by the troubled economy and tighter credit. Many dealers are advertising discounts that even they have a hard time comprehending.
How does $14,000 off the price of a 2008 Ford F-150 pickup sound? Or $12,000 off a Jeep?
''We've never gone this deep before,'' said Paul Walser, co-owner of the Walser Automotive Group, which sells 13 brands at nine dealerships around Minneapolis. One of them is offering a $15,000 discount on G.M.C. Yukon sport utility vehicles this weekend in hopes of making room for a newer vehicle that is profitable. 
''We're going to be losing money on these things,'' he said, ''but it just costs us too much to keep vehicles that are $30,000 or $40,000 in our inventory for six months.''
The biggest deals are on 2008 models, which are no longer in production but still clogging dealers' lots. Many 2009s can also be had for thousands below sticker price, including new vehicles like the Chevrolet Traverse crossover from G.M.
And while the bigger the vehicle, the bigger the discount, deals are available for some small, fuel-efficient cars as well. Ford, for instance, is offering $2,500 off its Focus compact sedan.
The deals have ballooned through a combination of nationwide offers and customer loyalty incentives from the manufacturers as well as dealer discounts. Some dealers have gotten creative in their wheeling and dealing, offering bonuses like Ford or G.M. stock (though the shares of G.M. closed at $3.01 on Friday and Ford at $1.80).
So far, the growing discounts have failed to stem the dismal sales climate. Total industry sales fell 31.9 percent in October, to the lowest rate in 25 years.
''Consumers don't want to make a big-ticket item purchase like a car when the economy is so uncertain,'' said Jesse Toprak, executive director of industry analysis at Edmunds.com, a Web site that gives car buying advice. ''They don't know what their house is going to be worth next year, and they don't know if they're going to have a job. They just don't want to go spend money.''
General Motors and Ford both have been spending more than $2 billion a month of their cash on hand, and dumping their stocks of unsold vehicles at a loss certainly compounds that problem. But the automakers also cannot afford to just wait for the economy to turn around and for buyers to come back on their own.
G.M., whose sales fell 45 percent in October, began its year-end ''red tag'' sale several weeks earlier than usual. Chrysler extended rebates of as much as $6,000 and no-interest, six-year loans through November after its sales fell 35 percent last month.
Even foreign automakers, which typically avoid big discounts, have been venturing into deal territory. Zero-percent financing is available for the first time on 11 Toyota models. Nissan also has zero percent deals on some popular models, while Honda and BMW are dangling historically low-rate loans.
''There's more money on the hood than I've ever seen,'' said Rick Resinger, sales manager at the Champion Chevrolet dealership in Howell, Mich. ''For the right person, I can get $10,000 in rebates. That's just huge. It's like getting a second car free.''
One recent customer there, Ron Ford, got a $9,200 discount on a $36,000 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck last month. He said he had been thinking about replacing his diesel-powered Ford F-250 to save money on fuel but was hesitant until G.M.'s sale ''put me over the top,'' he said.
''G.M.'s giving these trucks away,'' said Mr. Ford, 46, who, though unrelated to the automaking family, had always driven Ford vehicles until now. ''Ford had some decent deals, but they couldn't match G.M.''
Mr. Ford, a land surveyor, got a 4.99 percent loan from a local credit union, a route many recent car buyers have taken as the automakers' own lending arms cut back. GMAC Financial Services, for example, now requires a credit score of at least 700, leaving G.M. scrambling to reassure consumers that its dealers can still get them loans from ''hundreds of banks.''
Mr. Resinger, of the Chevrolet dealership, said the credit crisis had deterred many shoppers who would easily qualify for a loan.
''They don't want the embarrassment of coming in and being one of 'those people' who can't get financed,'' he said. ''Yet there's very few people we can't get financed. The only people we can't are those who really shouldn't have been able to before.''
As buyers disappear, so too are dealerships in cities across the United States, many of which survived decades of market ups and downs but can no longer pay their bills in this dismal environment. In Junction City, Ore., a Ford store that sold Model T's when it opened in 1921 closed last week, and the nation's largest Chevrolet dealer, Bill Heard Enterprises, closed its 13 showrooms in Texas, Florida and other states earlier this fall.
The National Automobile Dealers Association says 667 dealerships closed from January to October. Its chief economist, Paul Taylor, said the full-year total for 2008 may reach 900, and that 2009 could see even more casualties.
The average dealership has not made money from new car sales since 2005, he said. One slight positive is that more customers are coming into dealers' service and parts departments.
''As people make a choice to defer a new car purchase,'' Mr. Taylor said, ''that means they're going to drive the old one further, and that creates parts business.''
Amid such gloom, plenty of dealers continue to hang on. They just hope the huge discounts they are offering will ultimately be enough to overcome consumers' insecurities and persuade them to shop again.
''There's enough people out there that still have the wherewithal to buy and are going to recognize a bargain,'' said Mr. Walser, the Minneapolis dealer.
''In the 30 years I've been in this business, I've never seen a more interesting time,'' he said. ''Of course, it would be easier to say that if I was watching from the sidelines instead of trying to sell cars.''

HEADLINE: 2 Journalists In Pakistan Are Wounded By Gunmen

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ and PIR ZUBAIR SHAH

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 

 BODY:
A Japanese journalist and an Afghan colleague were shot and wounded in an attempted kidnapping in the northern city of Peshawar on Friday after conducting interviews with Taliban fighters in the nearby tribal region, the police and local journalists said.
 The attack comes amid a surge of violence by militants in Peshawar, including the assassination of an American aid worker on Wednesday, and the kidnapping of an Iranian diplomat on Thursday. 
 Modoki Yotsukura, the Islamabad bureau chief of the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun, and Sami Yousafzai, a correspondent for Newsweek, were in a car in the Hayatabad section of Peshawar when a gunman opened fire on them, according to accounts by the police and local journalists.
 They were returning from Khyber, an area of the tribal region that abuts Peshawar and one where Taliban militants have a strong presence, according to the accounts.
 ''They went to Khyber to interview Taliban commanders,'' said Mushtaq Yusufzai, a journalist in Peshawar. ''There was a car with gunmen who wanted to kidnap them. The driver didn't stop, and they opened fire on them, and they escaped.''
 The bureau chief for Newsweek in Pakistan, Ron Moreau, said Mr. Yousafzai had been shot in the chest, hand and arm, and had been admitted to the hospital in Peshawar. Mr. Yotsukura was shot in the right leg, the Japanese Embassy said, and was taken to Islamabad for further treatment.
 The killing on Wednesday of Stephen D. Vance, a development expert who was involved in a project, financed by the United States Agency for International Development, shook the community of foreign aid workers, diplomats and journalists in Pakistan. He was shot in a relatively quiet residential section of Peshawar.
 The Hayatabad neighborhood, where the two journalists were shot on Friday, has become a notoriously dangerous area of the city, where kidnappings for ransom have become very frequent. The Taliban remain active in the nearby tribal region of Khyber. 
 A sprawling city of several million that serves as the frontline urban center for the tribal region, Peshawar has become an increasing focus of the militants. There have been 20 attacks by suicide bombers in the city so far this year.
 According to official records, 127 police officers have been killed in Peshawar, and 260 wounded, by bomb blasts, explosive devices and suicide bombers this year. In 2006, 22 policemen died in such attacks.
 Also on Friday, missiles from a remotely piloted aircraft killed 11 people and wounded three others in North Waziristan, near the border with Afghanistan, according to Pakistani accounts. The Bush administration has intensified the attacks from such aircraft after backing away from using American commandos for ground raids into the tribal belt.
 Some of those killed in the attack were apparently foreign fighters, possibly Arabs, Chechens or Uzbeks, Pakistani television stations said.
 The target of the strikes was a family compound in Uddin Khel, near the town of Razmak, about 50 miles south of the Afghan border, said Safdar Hayat, a journalist in North Waziristan.
 Three of the dead were members of the family of Amir Gul, a local resident who appeared to have sheltered the foreigners, Mr. Hayat said. Other bodies were destroyed beyond recognition and may have been those of the foreigners, he said.
 The attack appears to have been at least the 20th by a remotely piloted Predator aircraft in the tribal areas since the beginning of August. In the first seven months of 2008, there were five such strikes.
 President Asif Ali Zardari has said that the intensified American airstrikes in the tribal area of Waziristan are a violation of Pakistani sovereignty. He has called on the United States to end them.
 The United States has not publicly responded to the Pakistani government's calls to cease the attacks, which Pakistani officials say cause a surge in anti-American feeling among Pakistanis and few results in the campaign against the militants.

HEADLINE: Record Offer Starts Yanks' Courtship Of Sabathia

BYLINE: By TYLER KEPNER; Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Yankees had been waiting for Friday for roughly a year. Since determining last winter that they would not trade for Johan Santana, they were eager to sign an ace without giving up their best prospects in the process. When an ace hit the open market on Friday, the Yankees pounced.
 On the first day teams could negotiate with all free agents, the Yankees made an offer to C. C. Sabathia that would be a record for a pitcher. According to two people with knowledge of the team's plans, the six-year offer is believed to be worth at least $140 million, exceeding the $137.5 million deal the Mets gave Santana in February. 
 The Yankees did not stop there, also preparing offers for the other two top pitchers on the free-agent market, A. J. Burnett and Derek Lowe. The Yankees hope to entice at least one of them -- in addition to Sabathia -- to join a rotation that would also include Chien-Ming Wang and Joba Chamberlain.
 The Yankees could round out their rotation by bringing back the free agent Andy Pettitte for a one-year contract. They are interested in retaining Mike Mussina, but all indications are that Mussina, who turns 40 next month, will retire.
 Sabathia, 28, is the obvious centerpiece to the Yankees' off-season planning. After entrusting two young starters with spots in the rotation last spring, with poor results, the Yankees are taking no chances this time. They want proven commodities to pitch for them, with offense a lesser priority.
 That was all but confirmed by Thursday's trade with the Chicago White Sox for first baseman Nick Swisher, a deal consummated before the Yankees could formally negotiate with Mark Teixeira, the top free-agent first baseman. The Los Angeles Angels will try hard to retain Teixeira, and signing him would probably mean they could not also afford Sabathia.
 If the Angels do not bid on Sabathia, there would seem to be few -- if any -- teams willing to approach the Yankees' offer, especially in the current economic climate. The Boston Red Sox are thought to be interested in Lowe, but a run at Sabathia seems unlikely considering Boston's ace, Josh Beckett, is unsigned past next season.
 The San Francisco Giants and the Mets have already splurged on a starter in recent years -- Barry Zito for the Giants, Santana for the Mets. The Los Angeles Dodgers are focused more on re-signing Manny Ramirez, and their owner, Frank McCourt, would seem unlikely to give a six-year contract to a pitcher.
 The Milwaukee Brewers have reportedly bid $100 million over five years to keep Sabathia, but the Yankees' offer dwarfs that. And while Sabathia led the Brewers to the playoffs this season, the Yankees would seem much more likely to be a regular contender.
 Those who know Sabathia say he wants to sign quickly and has no desire to visit possible destinations. He has played in New York many times, and has already spoken by phone with Derek Jeter. By making Sabathia a bold early offer, the Yankees believe they showed him the sincerity of their interest.
 Sabathia's agent, Greg Genske, did not return a telephone call. But if the Yankees' offer is considerably higher than any other team's, the players' union will be eager for Genske and Sabathia to take it. Because the offer would set a new standard for pitchers' salaries, it is hard to envision Sabathia's turning it down.
 Meanwhile, the top reliever on the market is closer Francisco Rodriguez, who set a record for saves with 62 for the Angels last season. His agent, Paul Kinzer, said he received no formal offers on Friday.
 ''It could go on for several weeks and months,'' Kinzer said in a telephone interview. ''I wasn't expecting to have a deal today. Especially with a guy like this, there are a lot of things behind the scenes. They are looking at his medical reports and everything else, like with any big pitcher.''
 Kinzer said the Mets and the Angels were among four teams that had expressed substantial interest in signing the 26-year-old Rodriguez. However, he said the Angels appeared to have made re-signing Teixeira their top priority.
 ''You want as many of the six big-market teams to be interested for Rodriguez,'' Kinzer said, referring to the Mets, the Yankees, the Dodgers, the Angels, the Red Sox and the Cubs. ''If those other teams were involved, this would be much more interesting.''
 The Cubs have not inquired about Rodriguez, Kinzer said, and the Yankees, the Dodgers and the Red Sox have closers for next season. 
 Kinzer said more teams had expressed interest in another one of his clients, shortstop Rafael Furcal.
 ''There are about eight to 10 teams interested in him, and five of them have called today again expressing their interest,'' Kinzer said.
 Kinzer said teams had been scrutinizing Furcal's medical records because he had surgery in July to relieve pressure on a disk in his lower back. 
 ''The doctor gave him a clean bill of health,'' Kinzer said.

HEADLINE: With Credit Tight, U.S. Gives Small Business a Hand

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
Small businesses have been hit hard by the slowing economy, facing declining demand and having a difficult time getting loans. Some have been seeking relief from their advocate in Washington, the Small Business Administration, which this week relaxed some of the lending rules that banks must follow.
 Santanu K. Baruah, known as Sandy, the agency's acting administrator since August, sat down recently in his office to talk about changes the agency is making to help small companies weather the economic downturn. 
 Q.What are the changes that the agency adopted to increase capital for small businesses?
 A. We are encouraging our lending partners to make more loans available for small businesses by not restricting them to using the prime rate when pricing S.B.A.-guaranteed loans. We are now allowing them to also use Libor -- the London interbank offered rate -- which determines what lenders pay for money. The credit crisis has disrupted the normal relationship between the two rates, which has limited the number of small-business loans our lenders are willing to approve.
 Q.Have you done anything else to increase liquidity for the small companies?
 A. We adopted another emergency rule to simplify assembling S.B.A.-guaranteed loans for sale on the secondary market. It allows loans to be packaged using an average interest rate instead of requiring that all loans packaged together for sale on the secondary market have the same interest rate. This will make it easier for such loans to be assembled for sale and should encourage S.B.A. lenders relying on the secondary market for funds to continue to originate loans, which helps increase the availability of capital to small businesses. 
 Q.Lending in your main loan programs has decreased significantly. Why?
 A. The overall number the S.B.A. approved in October was down roughly 68 percent versus October 2007. The dollar value decrease in the same program, 7(a), was 36 percent less than the same period last year. Economic development loans were down 45 percent in volume and 32 percent in dollars. It's hard for small businesses to obtain initial credit, and to maintain the credit they have. But it's also a difficult environment to risk taking a loan and starting a business. 
 Q.Does the agency plan to lower fees for small-business loans, in response to complaints that they are too high?
 A. We're not proposing that now. Loan fees are a cost-of-capital issue. But it's an access-to-capital crisis we're facing. If the cost were a deterring factor, then we'd be at record loan volumes today because the interest rate has dropped for S.B.A.-backed loans in the past 18 months. That has dramatically reduced the cost of capital, far outweighing any fee we charge.
 Q.The S.B.A. also helps small businesses and individuals in disasters, with low-interest loans to rebuild. Lawmakers of both parties have complained that the victims of the recent Midwest floods can get loans only at a higher rate than the 4 percent maximum offered after Katrina, as well as shorter repayment periods. Why is that and what is being done?
 A. Last year, the agency eased rules so applicants who can obtain credit elsewhere -- meaning private sector loans -- may still qualify for an S.B.A. loan, at rates and terms that are in line with the private market. Those who can't get private sector loans can get 4 percent loans for up to 30 years, although the rate fluctuates. 
 Q.The agency has said that at least $5 billion in federal contracts listed as going to small businesses actually wound up at large corporations. What percentage of contracting agency data does the S.B.A. review, and what steps can it take to make sure contracts are properly directed?
 A. It's a sampling. The data that is out there is better than it was, but clearly more needs to be done. There are six million contracting actions yearly, so realistically we have to rely on the data provided by our federal partners. In the next couple of months, I want to get the agency on a glide path to see what we can do to improve the integrity of the data. 
 Q.The revised rule requiring that female-owned businesses receive 5 percent of federal contracts has been criticized as falling short of its goal. How can the agency assure women they will get the percentage Congress set?
 A. The law does not mandate set-asides, but offers them as an option. We have followed advice and guidance to make the program constitutionally consistent because set-aside programs are continually subject to legal challenge.

HEADLINE: Past and Future in Championship Fight

BYLINE: By R.M. SCHNEIDERMAN

 BODY:
A classic matchup of youth versus experience will be on display Saturday when Brock Lesnar faces Randy Couture for the Ultimate Fighting Championship heavyweight title in Las Vegas. But the fight also represents a generational shift for both mixed martial arts and amateur wrestling.
 Couture, 45, is the crafty mixed martial arts veteran, the standard-bearer for the sport for more than a decade. Lesnar, 31, is the up-and-coming star, a former World Wrestling Entertainment fan favorite whose popularity prompted the U.F.C. to grant him a shot at the title after only three bouts. 
 Couture is also a member of the old guard of amateur wrestlers who turned to fighting when doing so offered little money or fame. Lesnar is part of a growing trend of amateur wrestlers who hope to make top dollar as professional fighters.
 Today's fighters have to be well versed in wrestling, submissions and striking, but since the U.F.C. began 15 years ago, many with stellar wrestling backgrounds have found success. In the 1990s, amateur wrestling standouts like Couture, Mark Coleman, Don Frye, Kevin Randleman and Dan Severn fought their way to U.F.C. titles. 
 Part of the reason is that wrestlers can often control where the fight takes place, by bringing it to the ground. The rigorous conditioning and training of college and Olympic wrestlers also prepares them for the grueling preparation for mixed martial arts.
 Couture has found success for both of those reasons. In 1992, he finished his wrestling career at Oklahoma State and opted for a low-paying coaching job at Oregon State while he trained for the Olympics. (He was an alternate on four Olympic teams.)
 Five years later, after Frye, a former college teammate, won the U.F.C. tournament in 1996, Couture decided to test himself in the Octagon.
 ''I saw the direct application of years of wrestling training and wrestling technique in the sport,'' he said. ''I also heard about the type of paychecks the guys were making.''
 Couture won two fights in one night and earned $20,000, nearly his entire year's salary as a college wrestling coach.
 Now the economic incentives of mixed martial arts are much larger. Entry-level fighters can still make as little as $3,000 a bout in the U.F.C., but top stars command millions of dollars a year for their fights and endorsement deals. Over the past four years, the U.F.C.'s success has brought the sport to a mass audience.
 In 2000, when Lesnar won an N.C.A.A. wrestling championship, the U.F.C. -- then under different ownership -- was an unregulated fringe sport with limited money and limited visibility. Lesnar wanted to continue his athletic career, but saw only two options: trying to make the Olympic wrestling team or playing football, a sport he had not played since high school.
 ''Going to the Olympics, there's really no money in that,'' he said. ''I was a guy from Webster, S.D., who didn't even have two nickels to rub together.''
 Instead, Lesnar opted to turn to professional wrestling and became a star. 
 Last year, after five years of ''wrestling-entertainment,'' a number of injuries and a failed stint with the Minnesota Vikings, he realized his dream of becoming a professional athlete. While Lesnar is still developing his fighting skills, the influx of young, top-level wrestlers is certain to increase the talent pool in mixed martial arts.
 ''A higher caliber athlete is coming,'' said Marc Laimon, the coach of Team Takedown, a management company that recruits top wrestlers and tries to mold them into mixed martial artists and that is the owner of Cobra Kai Jiu-Jitsu in Las Vegas.
 ''The guys who fight in the U.F.C. to get chicks in the clubs, those guys are going to fade away.''
 Ted Ehrhardt, one of Team Takedown's founders, said he received 20 to 30 e-mail messages a week from fighters asking about management.
 ''I'm taking the very top wrestlers in the world,'' he said.
 Among the company's clients are Jake Rosholt, a three-time N.C.A.A. champion; Johny Hendricks, a two-time N.C.A.A. champion; and Shane Roller, a three-time all-American. Ehrhardt said he was also interested in signing Henry Cejudo, an Olympic gold medalist, and Muhammed Lawal, a former N.C.A.A. champion and Olympic hopeful. 
 Despite the increased financial incentives, and the success of fighters like Couture and Lesnar, not every wrestler is looking to follow in their footsteps.
 ''It's not for everyone,'' Ehrhardt said. ''A lot of guys who like to wrestle might not necessarily like getting punched in the face.''
 But if wrestlers continue to succeed, wrestling at all levels could reap the benefits.
 ''Mixed martial arts and its recent success have put a spotlight on wrestling,'' said Gary Abbott, a spokesman for USA Wrestling, the amateur sport's governing body.
 Regardless of who wins on Saturday, that spotlight seems likely to expand.

HEADLINE: After Loss, Freddie Mac Seeks Aid

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
 WASHINGTON -- Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance giant, is asking for an initial injection of $13.8 billion in government aid after posting a large quarterly loss.
 The mortgage finance company is making the first request to tap the $200 billion promised by the Treasury Department to keep it and its sibling company, Fannie Mae, afloat after the two were seized by federal regulators more than two months ago. Freddie Mac said it expected to receive the money by Nov. 29. 
 The company, which is based McLean, Va., posted a loss Friday of $25.3 billion, or $19.44 a share, for the third quarter.
 The results compared with a loss of $1.2 billion, or $2.07 a share, in the year-ago period. Analysts were looking for a loss of 89 cents a share for the latest quarter, according to ThomsonReuters.
 The loss was mainly because of a $14.3 billion charge to reduce the value of tax assets, but also was driven by $9.1 billion in write-downs on mortgage securities, and $6 billion in credit losses because of soaring mortgage delinquency rates and foreclosures.
 Freddie Mac said that rising unemployment rates, tightening credit and deteriorating economic conditions ''contributed to a substantial increase in the number of delinquent loans,'' including prime loans made to borrowers with strong credit.
 ''Continuing home price declines and growing unemployment are now affecting behavior by a broader segment of mortgage borrowers,'' the company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
 Freddie Mac's overall delinquency rate rose to 1.22 percent, from 0.9 percent at the end of June, and 0.5 percent a year earlier. The number of foreclosed properties that Freddie Mac holds rose to 28,000, from 22,000 in June.
 On Monday, Fannie Mae posted $29 billion loss in the third quarter as it took a tax-related charge. While Fannie Mae said it might have to seek the government's help in the coming months, it has not yet done so.
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which own or guarantee around half of the $11.5 trillion in outstanding home loan debt, operate in a conservatorship that enables the government to inject up to $100 billion in each company in exchange for ownership stakes of almost 80 percent. 
 Both Fannie and Freddie have changed their accounting for their deferred-tax assets, which can emerge from operating losses, and can be used to reduce future tax expenses. Companies must be able to show they will be profitable if they intend to use the tax assets for earnings in later periods.
 Freddie Mac's net worth -- the value of its assets minus the value of its liabilities -- fell to negative $13.8 billion at the end of September.

HEADLINE: Agency Wants to Help 1.5 Million Households Avoid Foreclosure, but Finds Dispute

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Breaking with the Bush administration's position, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation proposed Friday to use $24 billion in government financing to help 1.5 million American households avoid foreclosure. 
 The source of the money, though, is in dispute. Agency officials want to use part of the $700 billion bailout of the financial industry to pay for it. But the Treasury Department is opposed to that idea. 
 Testifying on Capitol Hill Friday, Neel Kashkari, the Treasury Department's assistant secretary for financial stability, said the intent of the $700 billion plan was to make investments with the hope of getting the money back. That, he said, was ''fundamentally different from just having a government spending program'' that would disburse money with no chance of ever seeing any returns.
 Congressional Democrats could take up the plan when they return for a lame-duck session next week. Or the plan could set the stage for a new foreclosure prevention initiative once President-elect Barack Obama takes office in January.
 The agency's plan, posted on its Web site Friday, would guarantee 2.2 million modified loans -- mainly risky loans made to borrowers with weak credit or small down payments -- through the end of next year. Borrowers would get reduced interest rates or longer loan terms to make their payments more affordable.
 The F.D.I.C. said the government's backing will make the lending industry more willing to modify loans because taxpayers will absorb half of the losses if the borrower defaults again. Also, loan servicing companies, which collect and distribute mortgage payments, would be paid $1,000 for each loan they modify.
 Even if a third of borrowers default again on their modified loans, 1.5 million homes would still be saved, the F.D.I.C. says. Under the agency's plan, monthly payments should not total more than 31 percent of homeowners' pretax monthly income.
 On Capitol Hill, lawmakers complained to Mr. Kashkari that the administration was ignoring the will of Congress and slighting homeowners on the verge of foreclosure in its latest approach to spending $700 billion in the bailout fund.
 ''It's very clear that Treasury cannot and will not make the effort to keep people in their homes,'' said Darrell Issa of California, top Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee on domestic policy.
 Dennis Kucinich, Democrat of Ohio and chairman of the panel, said the change in the bailout announced this week by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. ''breaks with Congressional intent, contradicts public assurances previously made by Treasury and leaves the federal government without an adequate mechanism to stem the tide of home foreclosures.''
 Mr. Paulson, citing the worsening credit squeeze, said that Treasury no longer planned to buy up troubled mortgage assets.

HEADLINE: 'Drop Dead' Is Not An Option

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
The famous Daily News headline, ''Ford to City: Drop Dead,'' ran on Oct. 30, 1975.
 New York was on the verge of bankruptcy, and President Ford (who never actually said ''drop dead'') had made it clear, after listening to conservative hard-liners both inside and outside of his administration, that he planned to veto any federal rescue plan.
 It was yet another case of the worshippers of abstract economic notions (let the markets run their infallible courses) ignoring the potential consequences of their smug certainties. 
 Felix Rohatyn, the financier who played such a large role in the city's economic recovery, has told me many times of the economic summit near Paris in November 1975 in which President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of France and Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany explained to Mr. Ford that allowing New York to go bankrupt might well light the fuse to an international financial crisis and would foster the idea that America itself was no longer creditworthy.
 Mr. Ford was persuaded that the cascading effects of a bankruptcy were potentially catastrophic and could not be risked. He relented. Loan guarantees were made; the city went through the long ordeal of getting its financial house in order; the loans were repaid; and New York not only recovered but thrived.
 The city's fiscal crisis of the 1970s was in no way comparable in scale to the myriad crises facing the country right now. But it's still instructive. The ideological hard-liners have now cast their collectively jaundiced eye on Detroit's automakers. Their response to the very real danger that General Motors might crumble into bankruptcy is: C'est la vie.
 Unlike President Ford, Senator Richard Shelby, a Republican of Alabama -- to cite just one example -- is not troubled by thoughts of cascading effects, such as the toll of domino-like business failures and swelling unemployment moving like a toxic virus through an economy that is already ill.
 ''The financial situation facing the Big Three is not a national problem, but their own problem,'' he said.
 Whoa!
 I can agree that it's impossible to make a positive case for the backward, self-destructive practices of the auto industry over many years. (Just as it was difficult to defend the practices that led to New York's fiscal crisis.) But in the current environment, allowing one or more of the Big Three to go bankrupt would be like offering up your nose to Sweeney Todd to spite your face.
 It's not just General Motors or Chrysler or Ford. The U.S. auto industry is the cornerstone of American manufacturing. It supports millions of jobs, directly or indirectly, in a vast array of businesses.
 Start with the thousands of parts in each vehicle. They are produced by suppliers across the country, from one coast to the other. Those supplies have to be manufactured, packaged and transported. Truck drivers, railway systems and shipping companies are involved.
 And, of course, there are dealers everywhere. And the auto repair industry. And the insurance industry. And vast systems of advertising supporting every kind of job you can imagine, from messengers to accountants to filmmakers and beyond. All of that advertising funnels absolutely crucial revenues to television, magazines, newspapers -- you name it.
 If G.M., which is on life support, or Ford or Chrysler were to go bankrupt, the reverberations would kill the jobs of entire armies of American workers. It would undermine the standard of living of hundreds of thousands of families and shutter the entrances of untold numbers of small and intermediate businesses.
 Senator Shelby might want to do some homework before embarrassing himself again with the absurd comment that the crisis facing the Big Three is not a national problem.
 Gov. Jennifer Granholm of Michigan, a state that is already writhing in pain from the auto industry's troubles, would tell Mr. Shelby that the industry ''supports 1 in every 10 jobs in the country.''
 It's easy to demonize the American auto industry. It has behaved with the foresight of a crack addict for years. But even when people set their own houses on fire, we still dial 9-1-1, hoping to save lives, salvage what we can and protect the rest of the neighborhood. 
 This whole matter needs some intensive thought. At the moment, Washington has tremendous leverage over the failing auto industry. The government should craft a rescue plan that is both tough and very, very smart. That means dragging the industry (kicking and screaming, no doubt) into the 21st century by insisting on ironclad commitments to design and develop vehicles that make sense economically and that serve the nation's long-term energy security requirements.
 What I would like to see is creative thinking on both ends of the bargain. Let the smartest minds design a bailout that sparks a creative revolution in the industry. Think of it as project synergy.
 Time's wasting.

 BODY:
Still struggling to recover from Hurricane Ike, the battered economy of Galveston Island has suffered another severe blow with the decision by the University of Texas to lay off 3,800 people next week from the medical center, the largest employer on the island.
 ''It's a gut shot,'' said Jim Yarbrough, the chief executive of Galveston County. ''It has longer term ramifications than Hurricane Ike, for sure.'' 
 The university's board of regents voted unanimously on Wednesday to dismiss the 3,800 people, a third of the work force at the hospital, the University of Texas Medical Branch. The goal is to staunch losses of almost $40 million a month since the hurricane flooded the school's buildings and shut down most of the John Sealey Hospital, the main hospital of the branch, which has for decades provided care for indigent patients from across the region. 
 The decision will drastically shrink the 435-bed Sealey Hospital and other parts of the regional medical center, which before the storm had one of the best trauma centers in the country, a children's hospital and a well-regarded burn hospital. The complex is centered on Texas's oldest medical school and a new national laboratory devoted to finding defenses against biological weapons.
 But Hurricane Ike flooded many of the medical center's buildings, causing $710 million in damages. The main hospital's pharmacy, blood bank, radiological department and kitchens were destroyed. Only the maternity ward is open; the rest of the hospital remains eerily empty.
 Several regents said the only way to ensure the survival of the medical school and hospital in the long run was to slash the staff now and start rebuilding slowly. 
 But local officials have pointed out that in six months, under the regents' plan, the island of nearly 60,000 residents will have, at best, only a 200-bed hospital with limited capabilities. They said the loss of so many well-paid jobs would hurt local restaurants, stores and other businesses, many of which are still trying to clean up and reopen after the storm.
 ''To rebuild our economy after Ike was difficult enough, and this just compounds the economic impact,'' Mayor Lyda Ann Thomas said.
 Karen H. Sexton, vice president for hospitals and clinics, said the medical center was caught in a trap. It cannot begin to take on patients, open up wings and generate revenue until it repairs critical operations like its blood bank, pharmacy, kitchens and radiology department, but it lacks the millions needed for the repairs, and so far the federal and state governments have not come through with aid.
 She said the institution hoped someday to return to the size it was before the storm, but she acknowledged the cutbacks might be permanent. ''We can't make any promises,'' she said, ''because we don't know what's going to happen. We are committed to getting back into the health care business. We know we have to be a lot smaller right now.''
 The hospital was losing money before the storm, she said, in part because the state Legislature in recent years had cut back on paying for charity cases, a major portion of its caseload. It ended its last budget cycle with a $35 million deficit and had planned some cuts. ''We expected a tough year, but certainly we didn't expect Ike,'' Ms. Sexton said.
 In the halls of Sealey hospital, worried nurses and doctors went about their jobs, wondering if they would be out of work next week or working in a much smaller and less prestigious hospital. Some lost their homes in the storm and now faced losing their jobs as well, in the teeth of a national economic recession. 
 ''It's terrible,'' said Deborah Warren, a surgical technician who was born at the hospital, went to school there and has worked for the last 13 years in its neonatal unit. ''It's a hard time for the hospital, our city and our state. I'm just curious to know if they can bail out Wall Street, why they cannot bail out U.M.T.B.,'' referring to the medical center.
 Some doctors worried that it would be hard to continue teaching young doctors with a smaller caseload. As a regional magnet for poorer patients, the hospital was a great training ground, presenting its interns and residents with a wide array of cases, diseases and complications.
 The layoffs will affect hundreds of orderlies, janitors and other menial laborers, hospital officials said. Luz Maria Cisneros, 62, an orderly who was cleaning rooms, said she lost her home in the storm and had been living in a motel with her son and two granddaughters. If she was laid off, she said she would leave the state and start over elsewhere. 
 ''I will find some kind of work cleaning houses,'' she said.
 Even those who had learned they would keep their jobs said they knew their departments would shrink. Several pediatric nurses said they had been told their wing would open with only 10 nurses, down from 55. Without an intensive care unit, they could not take any dangerous cases, they said.
 ''It's not going to be the same, like it was,'' said Kathleen Lund, 46, a veteran in the department. ''We had a great department. It's very very sad.''
 Others at the hospital said they had resigned themselves to the possibility of looking for work.
 ''I guess I will just have to look for another job,'' said Beverly Zingrich, 50, an administrative assistant. ''I don't think it's going to be easy because this area is going to be flooded with people looking for jobs, and a lot of businesses have gone out of business.''

HEADLINE: Tight Times Even Tighter For Charities

BYLINE: By M. P. DUNLEAVEY

 BODY:
IF you've been chewing your nails, wondering what the next few months have in store for you, imagine what the mood is like for charities and nonprofit groups, which depend on the kindness of strangers to keep sending money their way.
 ''For the last 45 days we have not had a daily deposit,'' said Mark Holleran, chief executive of Central Arizona Shelter Services, an organization of three homeless shelters in Phoenix. ''That may not sound like a lot, but we always had some money coming in every day. I've been here 13 years and I've never seen this.'' 
 Mr. Holleran describes the drop in small, daily donations as one of the many ''little road signs'' that he is seeing right now, signaling trouble ahead. 
 Another, he said, was when a neighboring charity, which had long donated food to his shelters, was forced to start charging them for it. ''Their donations are down too, and they're getting less in-kind donations,'' he said.
 Mr. Holleran used the term that seems to be on everyone's lips these days: ''It's a perfect storm.'' But few other phrases could do justice to the unfortunate synchronicity of so much bad financial news, especially in the nonprofit sector. 
 While the rest of us, or many of us, are still in a holding pattern with regard to our own finances (how bad is it going to get?), the fallout from the financial crisis is striking nonprofit groups and charities fast and hard. As much as people might like to sit still until their own finances feel stable again, many nonprofit agencies need additional support now. 
 Donations to charities grew about 4.5 percent in the 2007 fiscal year (which ended in July for most groups), to what sounds like a reassuring $72.5 billion. The data is from an annual survey of the 400 charities that raise the most from private sources, done by The Chronicle of Philanthropy, a biweekly publication that covers the nonprofit sector.
 But that number doesn't reflect the sudden downturn in donations these last few months, as large financial institutions (and historically generous donors) have collapsed, dozens of states have announced huge budget deficits, many municipalities are cutting their support of social service agencies -- and some nonprofit agencies are facing a drop in individual contributions.
 And all of this is occurring as demand for many groups' services is growing sharply.
 Because the end of the year is when nonprofit groups typically expect a jump in contributions -- and because that surge is so suddenly and completely in question -- program administrators say they are scrambling to keep up. 
 ''We have seen an increased need from people who are facing foreclosure, job loss and decreased work hours,'' the Rev. Michael M. Boland, chief executive of Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Chicago, said in an e-mail message. ''We are seeing a lot of renters forced out of apartments because the owners were foreclosed upon, and we've seen an increase in the number of requests for our emergency services, which include food pantries and hot dinners for the hungry and homeless,'' he said.
 AT a food pantry in Cicero, Ill., Father Boland said, 150 new families needed assistance in August, while 250 more requested help in September. ''The increases are astonishing,'' he said.
 Mr. Holleran of Central Arizona Shelter Services said that a new population was seeking help. ''We're up about 20 percent, as far as demand goes,'' he said, ''but these are people who have never, ever been in a homeless environment, the John Q. Public types, people who have lost their businesses, a lot of disabled and elderly.''
 Historically, in periods of financial stress Americans haven't cut back all that much on giving. ''Even during recessionary times, Americans have always tended to give about 2 percent of their discretionary income to charity,'' said Robert F. Sharpe Jr., president of the Sharpe Group in Memphis, a financial consulting firm for nonprofit groups.
 The times are such that even a $50 or $100 gift can seem like too much, when measured against one's own anxiety. 
 I am anxious, but I find that whenever I manage to give anything at all, I feel a lot better.

HEADLINE: Saving Detroit From Itself

 BODY:
We have seen a lot of posturing, but we haven't heard a lot of sense in the debate over whether the government should spend even more to bail out Detroit's foundering automakers. 
 Senator Richard Shelby, a Republican of Alabama, is wrong when he says that the troubles of the Big Three are ''not a national problem.'' The Detroit companies support nearly 250,000 workers and more than a million retirees and dependents, as well as millions of workers at part makers and dealerships. A messy bankruptcy filing by any of the big car companies, in the midst of this recession, would likely cost the government and the economy more than trying to keep them afloat.
 At the same time, Congressional Democrats and President-elect Barack Obama, who are pushing for many billions worth of emergency aid for the nation's least-competent carmakers, must ensure that tough conditions are attached to any rescue package. If not, the money will surely be wasted. 
 This goes beyond firing top management, forbidding the payment of dividends to stockholders and putting limits on executive pay -- all necessary steps. The government should insist on a complete restructuring of any company it pours billions of public funds into.
 All three car companies have been hamstrung by the legacy costs of providing pensions and health care to hundreds of thousands of retirees. But Detroit's problems are mostly of its own making. 
 The automakers hitched their fate to gas-guzzling trucks, and they obstinately refused to acknowledge that oil is a finite resource and that burning it limitlessly is harming the planet. They lobbied strenuously against tighter fuel-efficiency standards. That wrongheadedness did them in as gas prices spiked and consumers flocked to energy-efficient cars made by Toyota and Honda. 
 It makes no sense at all to give these companies billions just so they can struggle on for a few more months down this disastrous path. 
 Before it approves any bailout package, Congress must insist that any company receiving government money must commit to a specific plan to improve energy efficiency. The average fuel efficiency of the American auto fleet peaked at 25.9 miles per gallon in 1987 and then leveled off as gas prices fell and the automakers churned out more sport-utility vehicles and pickups. 
 Last year, Detroit managed to extract a promise of $25 billion in subsidized loans from Congress in exchange for a new target of 35 m.p.g. by 2020. But the industry can do better. If Detroit were willing to make smaller cars, as European companies do, it could probably achieve a fleet-wide average of 50 m.p.g. by 2020.
 The companies also are struggling under a mountain of debt. And any restructuring would mean that creditors would have to swallow a loss or accept equity -- as under a regular bankruptcy filing. Restructuring would likely require more plant closures and layoffs. 
 Rescued car companies would almost certainly have to re-open labor agreements on pay and benefits. These steps would be painful for many workers. But they also are necessary.
 Even then, there is no guarantee that these companies will survive after years of failed management. We are sure they won't if they don't make sweeping changes in the way they do business. If Congress is going to take the risk and invest billions more of the taxpayers' money in the companies, it must insist on those changes.

HEADLINE: Words Fly, But No Aid For Detroit

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting from Washington, and Bill Vlasic from Detroit.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The White House urged Congressional Democrats on Friday to speed up access to $25 billion in federal loan guarantees for the ailing automakers and accused the Democrats of ''choosing a path that will only lead to partisan gridlock'' by also insisting on tapping into the financial industry bailout fund to help the carmakers. 
 Congress and President Bush approved money for the loan guarantees this fall as part of a major spending bill, but those loans were restricted for the development of more advanced, fuel-efficient vehicles. A 2007 energy bill, which set the rules, also limited the loans to ''financially viable'' companies, raising doubts about whether General Motors could qualify. 
 A consensus among industry analysts is that General Motors alone needs about $15 billion in unrestricted aid, which would keep it afloat for a year at most. 
 Democrats in recent days have called repeatedly on the Bush administration to provide $25 billion in financial assistance to the automakers using money from the $700 billion financial bailout, known as the Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP.
 The administration has said that money should go only to financial institutions to improve the flow of credit and has suggested easing access to the loan guarantees instead by relaxing the fuel-efficiency requirements. 
 In the administration's most forceful push-back so far, the White House press secretary, Dana Perino, on Friday said: ''We stand ready to accelerate the funds as soon as Congress acts. We believe the opportunity to help the auto companies is there for the taking.'' 
 The majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, swiftly rejected the White House proposal as ''unacceptable.'' Mr. Reid, in a statement, insisted that the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., had the authority to use some of the TARP money to help the auto industry without additional legislation, which seems unlikely amid the rancor. 
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also voiced opposition to easing the restrictions on the loan guarantees and said she wants new aid for Detroit. ''The president's proposal would unwisely divert money urgently needed for modernization of the U.S. auto industry,'' she said in a statement. 
 The war of words on Friday was just the latest sign that efforts to fashion an aid package for the automakers are in serous trouble.
 Next week Congressional Democrats plan to bring up legislation that would force the Bush administration's hand. The Senate will consider a bill to lengthen unemployment benefits and then move to add aid for the auto industry as an amendment. But the bill must first be approved in the Senate, where it needs 60 votes to pass. 
 The Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has endorsed a similar approach to the White House plan by easing access to the loan guarantees. 
 Mr. Reid sent Mr. McConnell a letter urging him to join with Democrats in seeking new aid for the automakers.
 In a terse response, Mr. McConnell reminded Mr. Reid that the Democrats have not provided any draft legislation or cost estimate. He also suggested that many rank-and-file Democrats were opposed to the idea. 
 ''The silence from the Democrat rank and file on this matter has been deafening,'' Mr. McConnell said in a statement, adding: ''We owe it to the people of Nevada, Kentucky, and all across America to make known the impact this bailout would have on the deficit.'' 
 Some lawmakers complained that the Bush administration was already preparing to lower the standards for the loan guarantees. In a letter to the Department of Energy, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, and Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, urged the administration to set a high bar for new fuel-efficient cars. 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 17, 2008

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about the debate between the White House and Congress over aid for struggling automakers described incorrectly the Bush administration's position on $25 billion in loans already approved for the auto industry. The White House has urged Congress to speed access to those loans, instead of providing new aid; it has not suggested easing access to the loan guarantees by relaxing fuel-efficiency requirements.

HEADLINE: Crisis Hits Tech Sector With Layoffs as Sales Slump

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

 BODY:
Joining a rapidly growing list of technology companies reeling from the financial turmoil, Sun Microsystems, which sells server computers, has started a broad overhaul in which up to 6,000 employees could lose their jobs.
 Before the stock market opened Friday, Sun disclosed that it would lay off 5,000 to 6,000 workers, or 15 percent to 18 percent of its work force. The company, already dealing with layoffs announced in May, expects to save $700 million to $800 million a year as a result of the moves, while also taking up to $600 million in charges in the next 12 months. 
 ''The focus here is to eliminate some of the inefficiencies that have made it hard to do business with Sun,'' said Jonathan I. Schwartz, chief executive at Sun, adding that a ''new economic reality'' had taken hold in the market. Sun shares were up about 3.9 percent in afternoon trading. 
 In the last two weeks, several of the technology industry's biggest names have issued dire forecasts. 
 Last week, Cisco Systems, the largest provider of network equipment, warned that sales in its current quarter could drop 10 percent. Intel, the world's largest producer of chips used in PCs and servers, added to the gloom this week saying its sales for the current quarter could plummet as much as 19 percent as both consumer and corporate customers had pulled back on technology spending. 
 In addition, other Silicon Valley companies tied to the chip industry, including Applied Materials and National Semiconductor, have started layoffs. 
 While many of the companies focus on corporate sales, others closer to consumer markets are suffering as well. Qualcomm, which makes chips used in cellphones, said mobile device makers have suddenly cut back on their orders. Nokia, a large cellphone maker, confirmed as much Friday by lowering its industrywide sales outlook for the fourth quarter and announcing further cost cuts in 2009. 
 For many companies, the sudden drop in orders started in October and worsened in November. 
 ''Even during the 2000 bust, the decline was more measured,'' said Ashok Kumar, an analyst with Collins Stewart. ''This seems to be going into a free fall.''
 Sun's change in strategy follows a period of intense scrutiny for Sun and Mr. Schwartz as the company has fought longer-term problems. Sun, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has battled for years to offset a slow, steady decline in its primary high-end server business. 
 Defending those sales has become more difficult as Sun's customers on Wall Street curtailed their technology spending because of the financial turmoil. Sun is more dependent on Wall Street business than rivals like I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and Dell. 
 ''We were certainly the first to enter this,'' Mr. Schwartz said, ''and I would like to believe we will be the first to exit it.'' 
 Late last month, Sun reported a first-quarter loss of $1.68 billion and a 7 percent year-over-year drop in revenue to $2.99 billion. At the time, Sun cautioned that it would probably reorganize to bring costs in line. 
 While Sun has talked of a ''new reality,'' its investors have been reacting to the company's larger issues for some time. Sun's shares have lost more than 80 percent of their value in the last year, reducing the company's market value to $3 billion. 
 In its last fiscal year, Sun posted revenue of $13.8 billion and has $2 billion in cash. 
 Southeastern Asset Management, an investment firm based in Memphis, has increased its stake in Sun to more than 20 percent in the last year. Recently, it disclosed an intention to talk with Sun's management and possibly other companies about the ways to make the most of Sun's assets, which include a vast software intellectual property portfolio. 
 In addition, Relational Investors, founded by the activist investor Ralph V. Whitworth, has purchased close to 15 million shares of Sun since the end of June, giving it close to a 3 percent stake in the company. 
 Mr. Schwartz maintained that these large Sun investors agree with the company's strategy. ''I just met with Ralph,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''We're all focused on the same thing.''
 Sun's management continues to remain optimistic when speaking about the company's future, pointing to a number of fast-growing hardware and software businesses. The company has spent the last few years developing products and acquiring software makers, leaving it with what many analysts consider a strong portfolio. The major challenge has been expanding these businesses at a rate strong enough to offset declining sales from Sun's traditional businesses.
 In an effort to move forward, Sun has realigned its management structure to create a pair of software organizations aimed at different parts of the technology market. The moves include the resignation of Rich Green, formerly executive vice president in charge of Sun's software business. Mr. Green returned to Sun just two years ago in a bid to inject new life into the company's software business.
 Sun has bet on an open-source software strategy where it offers free access to top products such as its Solaris operating system and MySQL database. The company argues that this model increases interest in its products and can translate into hardware sales. 
 With plenty of cash on hand and a sympathetic board, Sun has rejected calls for more radical action, like selling off part of its hardware business or going private. 
 Analysts, however, remain concerned that Sun's costs are too high given current economic conditions and the ongoing decline in sales. 
 ''This by itself is not enough,'' Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst with Calyon Securities, said.
 Mr. Schwartz declined to delve into all of the specific areas where Sun's job cuts will occur, although he did say that the sales group would be affected. 
 ''We are not canceling products or exiting businesses,'' Mr. Schwartz said, adding that Sun remained committed to using the open-source strategy as a way of trying to attract business.
 ''We are going to go plow the market and auger it open with the world's most compelling price tag,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Mayor Staking His Popularity On Budget Fix

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
A year before the next mayoral election, Michael R. Bloomberg appears to have settled on his campaign message: higher property taxes, smaller school budgets, shuttered dental clinics, more parking fees and a new surcharge on plastic shopping bags. 
 And by the way, he advises ordinary New Yorkers, buy fewer dresses and put off that new car.
 It is a seemingly toxic sales pitch at a moment when the city's economic engine, Wall Street, is imploding, thousands of jobs are disappearing and New Yorkers are on edge.
 But in persuading the City Council to revise its term limits law so he could seek a third term, Mr. Bloomberg cast himself as an economic white knight who is uniquely capable of leading the city through a steep downturn. And he is acting swiftly to fulfill that promise. 
 Yet the severity of what he must do, the short time he has to accomplish it and his frequent lack of delicacy could threaten his popularity at a time when he needs it most. Already, New Yorkers are dialing up the city's 311 information hot line and their council members' offices to fume about higher property taxes.
 ''He is going after the middle class to cover the budget, and it bothers me a lot,'' said Mordy Roman, the owner of a liquor store in Brooklyn. ''In hard times I don't see this going over very well with people.'' 
 The mayor and his aides see his ability to confront a financial crisis and make painful decisions as his greatest strength -- and the explanation for his strong showing at the polls in 2001 and 2005. 
 So far, however, the mayor's economic decisiveness is not exactly winning over New Yorkers. Just days after engineering the change to term limits last week, Mr. Bloomberg infuriated thousands of homeowners by stopping the city from mailing out an annual $400 property tax rebate, which many families rely on to buy holiday gifts or pay winter heating bills. The move would save the city $250 million -- a fraction of the city's $60 billion annual budget, but the mayor said it was a prudent step.
 ''People are starting to get really annoyed with him,'' said Jayson Levitz, a homeowner in Queens, who had been waiting for his $400 rebate check. ''He is so arrogant that he feels only he can handle this meltdown. But it does not take a brainiac to increase taxes.''
 Mr. Levitz, who said he voted for Mr. Bloomberg in 2001 because ''the city needed a business person,'' now hopes to see the mayor defeated.
 Jeanette Didio, a homeowner in Brooklyn who is currently unemployed, called the city's hot line to plead for her rebate check, without which she cannot pay for a visit to the dentist, she said. 
 ''I don't think this mayor realizes that there are people more needy than others,'' she said. ''I need that money.''
 The mayor's rush to carry out politically unpopular budget cuts and tax increases has dumbfounded some members of the Council, especially since the next election is less than a year off. Council members, who also face re-election next year, must approve many of the mayor's tax and fee increases.
 ''In bad times, you cannot expect people to smile and say, 'Why don't you take my money and not pay me the money you owe me,' '' said Councilman Simcha Felder, a Bloomberg ally. ''It's just not going to happen.''
 He added that even if Mr. Bloomberg's plans ''have merit, how can you push it through in an election year?''
 Edward Skyler, deputy mayor for operations, said that with the city facing a budget shortfall of $4 billion over the next two years because of lower tax revenue, the mayor ''has no easy options in front of him.'' 
 ''We saved for a rainy day, but instead we are in monsoon season,'' he said. ''The depth of this emergency means there are no longer any sacred cows.''
 To close the budget gaps, the mayor has proposed a 7 percent property tax increase, the elimination of the rebate and across-the-board spending cuts, like canceling the next training class of 1,100 police cadets, eliminating 300 jobs in the parks department and closing 44 dental clinics for the poor. The measures are expected to balance this year's budget but will still leave the city with a $1.3 billion shortfall next year, requiring further cuts and, possibly, more taxes.
 Mr. Bloomberg has played the role of the clear-eyed C.E.O. of New York City before: after the Sept. 11 attack, when as a new mayor he cut spending and sharply raised taxes. His political advisers are convinced that just as they did back then, voters will initially grouse but ultimately reward the mayor for tough, popularity-be-damned decisions in the middle of a crisis.
 But much is different this time around. In 2002, shortly after Mr. Bloomberg was elected, the state and federal governments rushed to deliver financial assistance to the city. Now, both are buried in debt. In 2002, it became a patriotic duty for consumers to spend money in New York. Now, the nation's collective wallet has snapped shut. 
 In 2002, Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire former businessman, seemed perfectly poised to lead a recovery -- he was the anti-politician and he did not need the job. Now, after a bruising battle for the chance to remain in office for a third term, some of those qualities seem tarnished, or at the very least, undercut.
 And in 2002, as his aides are painfully aware, Mr. Bloomberg had more time -- three years, in fact -- to recover politically from property tax increases and spending cuts before he faced voters in his re-election bid. During that period, his approval ratings steadily rose to 67 percent from 25 percent, in part because he introduced the $400 rebate to mollify angry homeowners.
 This time around, although the mayor's approval ratings are high, Mr. Bloomberg has less than a year until Election Day, and he is taking the rebate away. 
 Mr. Bloomberg has acknowledged the differences between the two periods, suggesting that the economic outlook may be more dire today. ''Sept. 11 was a precipitous act, and then people pulled together, sort of with a spirit of 'Nobody is going to beat us,' '' he said this week.
 ''Today,'' he added, ''I think if you look in stores and restaurants, there is a crisis of confidence. People are not spending, and they are creating the very reality they are worried about.''
 Aides to Mr. Bloomberg said he was unperturbed by the political ramifications of his economic proposals, which he considers vital to steadying the city's finances. Mr. Bloomberg has repeatedly refused, despite the unpopularity of taxes, to simply cut his way out of the current budget woes, a mistake he says was made in the 1970s, when crime soared and garbage was piled high on city streets. 
 ''We are a high-tax city,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''We expect to get something for it.''
 Some critics of the mayor have suggested that he is addicted to taxes, and has been shy about taking on daunting budget burdens, like union pay and benefits.
 But Mr. Skyler, the deputy mayor, said, ''It's hard to argue that a mayor who is proposing fewer police officers and the elimination of a property tax rebate is making decisions based on politics, rather than the best interest of the city.''
 Paul L. Dickstein, who served as budget director under Mayor Edward I. Koch, said that Mr. Bloomberg stood a strong chance of rallying New Yorkers, rather than alienating them, with his tough economic choices. ''When somebody candid and credible tells people what has to be done, they appreciate it,'' Mr. Dickstein said. 
 Mr. Koch, for example, remained highly popular from 1979 to 1981, despite raising taxes and cutting spending, ''because he did the right thing at the right time,'' Mr. Dickstein said. ''The political mistake'' for Mr. Bloomberg, he added, ''would be to not do anything. Then he would just be like everyone else.'' 
 But many members of the City Council, and their constituents, are not yet ready to rally around Mr. Bloomberg's austerity measures. Councilman Vincent J. Gentile, who represents Brooklyn, said that scores of residents had pleaded with him to fight the mayor's tax proposals, especially the elimination of the $400 rebate, which he called ''a lifeline'' for the working class.
 ''People are just holding on by their fingertips,'' he said, adding that the Bloomberg administration ''has a tin ear when it comes to the concerns of everyday New Yorkers.''

HEADLINE: Be Glad You're Not Warren Buffett

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
FEELING bad about how much you have been hurt by the stock market plunge? At least you don't have a lot of stock options.
 A survey of the paper losses suffered by 175 chief executives of American companies shows that they lost a total of $52.3 billion through Oct. 27, when the stock market hit lows that were tested this week.
 To be sure, $15.9 billion, or nearly a third of the total amount, was lost by the richest man in America, Warren E. Buffett, whose stock in Berkshire Hathaway was still worth $45.8 billion. 
 The survey, by Steven Hall and Partners, a compensation consulting firm, looked at the reported holdings of stock and stock options by chief executives of the Fortune 200 companies -- generally the companies with the most sales in the country, both at the end of the company's most recent fiscal year and at the close on Oct. 27. Executives whose companies have been acquired, or who have announced retirement dates, were excluded, leaving 175 bosses.
 The bulk of the loss went to a handful of chief executives who were also company founders, and therefore owned a lot of stock. On average, the richest 10 percent of bosses -- just 18 people -- lost $2.2 billion each. That was only a 33 percent drop, however, leaving them with much smaller losses on a proportional basis than their less-wealthy colleagues.
 For those executives whose company holdings were largely in stock options, rather than stock, the decline in wealth has been huge. Options allow holders to buy shares at a fixed price, and thereby multiply profits on the way up. But options also multiply losses on the way down. Over all, the options have lost 76 percent of their value.
 These losses are far more widespread than in the last bear market, the one that ended in 2002. Then the biggest declines were in a handful of industries. But this year, the losses have hit virtually every company. And of course, they have hit executives down the ranks.
 The Hall survey also covered chief financial officers, who have lost 54 percent of their wealth in their company's securities.
 The accompanying chart looks at the average wealth of chief executives in three groups. Besides the top group, the others are the 10 percent of chief executives with the smallest wealth before the plunge -- who suffered losses of 59 percent, and the 80 percent in the middle, whose holdings are down 55 percent.
 The figures do not show total wealth, of course, because they do not reflect holdings of other securities or of real estate, although it is likely that those holdings have also lost value. Nor do the figures reflect any money the bosses might owe. Those who borrowed against the value of their securities may be hurting much more than the figures indicate.
 The members of the poorest group are still well off, and still have high-paying jobs. But at least two of them no longer have securities in their companies worth $1 million, the Hall computations indicate.
 The charts show the value of four types of holdings -- company stock that is owned outright; shares that have not yet vested, but will do so in future years; options that could have been exercised but were not; and options that have not yet vested. The unvested securities will vest if the executive remains with the company or, in some cases, if performance targets are met. The option values shown reflect the profit that would be realized if the executive executed the option and sold the stock.
 Until the last seven or eight years, restricted stock was a relatively rare part of compensation packages. But after the scandals of 2001, options were criticized for giving executives an incentive to take risks, since there was a disproportionate gain to be made from a rapidly rising price. That led to more use of restricted stock, and executives should be grateful for that.
 All told, the 175 chief executives had restricted stock worth $2.9 billion, and options worth $4.8 billion, at the end of their fiscal years. By Oct. 27, the figures were $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion.
 Add the decline of high-paying Wall Street jobs, and this may be a glum holiday season at those retailers who cater to the well-off.

HEADLINE: When Wall Street Runs Dry

 BODY:
Gov. David Paterson of New York spends his time these days explaining why he has to cut Medicaid and school aid, why he has asked public unions to forego a pay raise and why he wants to raise tuition in state colleges. Wall Street has turned off the spigot. ''The well has run dry,'' he said as he unveiled his latest proposals to control state spending. 
 More proposals will come; those he presented Wednesday would fill a $1.5 billion hole in this year's $121 billion budget if the Legislature adopts them at a special session in Albany on Tuesday. Only $8.8 billion would then have to be cut from next year's budget, not the $12 billion now projected. Only $8.8 billion? 
 The reason Mr. Paterson is going after untouchables like Medicaid and school aid is that New York suddenly finds itself in a terrible fix. Anybody who won't acknowledge this is simply hiding under the desk.
 Which is just about where some Senate Republicans and union leaders can be found these days. Mr. Paterson's cuts are unfair, they argue -- or, as Senator Dean Skelos, the majority leader and a Long Island Republican, unhelpfully suggests, not very creative. But nobody has offered anything more creative. Meanwhile, the Democrats in the State Senate, on the verge of a majority, are so disorganized that they can hardly agree on anything, let alone tough budget cuts.
 Instead of all this whining, what Mr. Paterson and the state need is for the rest of the state's leadership to stand up and give him a hand -- in particular to calm the restive health, civil service and teachers' unions that are urgently campaigning to protect their own nests. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who has at least conceded that the state's economic outlook is ''bleak,'' could be especially helpful with these powerful groups. 
 Mr. Paterson is asking state workers to defer five days of pay until retirement. This should be an easy sell. Asking them to defer next year's 3 percent raise and to adjust future medical co-payments will be harder, but their benefits are very generous and they should agree to modest rollbacks to avoid layoffs. 
 The Legislature also should quickly accept the governor's proposals to close empty prisons and youth facilities upstate. Adding water and juice bottles to those requiring a nickel deposit is also an efficient way to curb littering and finance the state's environmental efforts.
 Mr. Paterson's candor at this time is admirable. As a 20-year veteran of Albany, he knows firsthand how rapidly New York's budgets can grow. ''We will not get out of this quagmire until we stop spending,'' he warned. And until the state starts cutting, it will only get deeper.

HEADLINE: Michigan's Economy Is Sole Issue For Governor in National Spotlight

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY and SUSAN SAULNY; Monica Davey reported from Lansing, and Susan Saulny from Detroit.

DATELINE: LANSING, Mich. 

 BODY:
This is what a day looks like for Jennifer M. Granholm, the governor of Michigan, the state that sits, miserably, at the leading edge of the nation's economic crisis. 
 Morning: Rev up government workers and ministers at a huge conference in Detroit to cope with expanding signs of poverty. Afternoon: Tell a room crushed with reporters here, in the state capital, why a federal bailout is essential for the Big Three automakers, who are also, of course, residents of her state. Evening: Pack for Israel and Jordan, where Ms. Granholm hopes to persuade companies that work with wireless electricity, solar energy and electric cars to bring their jobs to Michigan.
 Whatever else Ms. Granholm, a Democrat in her second term, might once have dreamed of tackling as a governor (she barely seems to recall other realms of aspiration now), the economy is nearly all she has found herself thinking about, talking about, fighting about over the last six years. And Michigan, which has been hemorrhaging jobs since before 2001 and was once mainly derided in the rest of the nation as a ''single-state recession,'' now looks like an ominous sketch of just how bad things may get. 
 ''This has been six straight years of jobs, jobs, jobs,'' Ms. Granholm said, punctuating the word with three somber claps at her office table. Despite scathing critiques from some here who say she has failed to turn around Michigan's woes, Ms. Granholm said in an interview that she still believed that her efforts to remake the state's economy -- in part by luring jobs that make something other than cars -- would eventually overcome the steady stream of vanishing jobs.
 ''We were hoping it was going to be in 2009 where we'd see the balance tip, but with this financial meltdown and the challenges now in the auto industry obviously, I'm not sure whether that's going to happen,'' she said. ''Probably not. But we're going to still hammer away at it.''
 She finds herself in the national spotlight more than ever. She is loudly pushing for the auto industry rescue while Michigan's Congressional delegation works votes on Capitol Hill. President-elect Barack Obama has put her on his transition economic advisory board (an appointment her strongest critics here deride as ludicrous, akin to putting a tobacco executive on a health board). 
 Ms. Granholm, who played Sarah Palin in Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s warm-ups for the vice-presidential debate and who is barred by term limits from seeking re-election in 2010, has been mentioned as someone Mr. Obama may appoint to his cabinet. It is a notion Ms. Granholm -- long a Bush administration critic for what she describes as inconsistent enforcement of trade pacts and a lack of manufacturing policy -- gently dismisses: ''I really want to be governor when I have a partner in the White House.''
 Her critics seem dismayed by the speculation. They blame her and the state's business regulations and taxes, at least partly, for Michigan's long list of dismal rankings among the states (No. 2 in unemployment; No. 5 in foreclosure starts; No. 51, including the District of Columbia, in attracting new residents). The governor's approval ratings dropped to slightly less than 50 percent favorable last month from a high of near 70 percent in 2003. 
 ''I fear if she has the president's ear,'' said Michael D. LaFaive, director of fiscal policy at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a research group in Midland, Mich., that advocates a free market. ''There's a reason people are fleeing the state, and it has much to do with the bad public policies this state has embraced over the last 6 to 12 years.''
 But Ms. Granholm's supporters say she has done all she could, given gloomy times brought on long before she arrived by monumental changes in the nation's manufacturing, and, most of all, in the auto industry. As Ms. Granholm sees it, the state has responded by revamping just about everything -- taxes, education, even the sorts of businesses it is seeking.
 In her constant courting of companies in the United States and overseas, Ms. Granholm said she had focused on bringing home businesses that work with alternative energy (like wind turbines), domestic security (a field auto suppliers might easily move into), advanced manufacturing (like robotics) and life sciences.
 The state has recently enacted a tougher, college-preparatory-style curriculum in its high schools. Its ''No Worker Left Behind'' retraining program depends on what jobs local employers say they actually need to fill. And this year, it began offering incentives to moviemakers in the hopes of building a ''creative economy,'' a concept, Ms. Granholm says, ''we haven't necessarily had since Motown days.''
 In all of this, her efforts have brought more than 120,800 new jobs to the state since she took office in 2003, her office says. (Her staff noted those ''direct'' jobs were estimated to have brought two to three times as many new ''indirect'' jobs that cropped up around the others, and said state efforts had helped ''retain'' 233,000 jobs from companies that had hinted of leaving Michigan.) 
 Still, net losses since mid-2000 (and just for manufacturing jobs, since 1999) swamp the picture. Since June 2000, the state's net job loss was more than 500,000; since Ms. Granholm took office, the net loss was 281,500.
 ''Sometimes leadership is planting trees under whose shade you'll never sit,'' she said. ''It may not happen fully till after I'm gone. But I know that the steps we're taking are the right steps.''
 Jennifer Mulhern Granholm (she took the last name of her husband, Daniel, as her middle name and he did the same with her last name), 49, was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. She briefly considered an acting career and was once a contestant on ''The Dating Game,'' and graduated from University of California, Berkeley, and Harvard Law School. Eventually, she moved to Michigan. A former prosecutor, she was elected Michigan's attorney general in 1998, then became the state's first woman to be elected governor four years later. She has three children.
 Even her critics praise Ms. Granholm's political skills, her engaging speaking style, her ability to make even her most vocal opponents in the Legislature admit that they like her. But they say she started off as a nearly untested policy maker trying to solve an economic problem that would have challenged someone with far more experience.
 ''I think she's a good politician, but at the same time, she's not necessarily a great decision maker,'' said Saul Anuzis, the state Republican Party chairman. 
 But Mark Schauer, the State Senate's Democratic leader who was elected this month to Congress, pointed to a ''hostile'' Legislature -- both chambers were controlled by Republicans until 2006 (and the Senate still is) -- for a ''lack of urgency'' despite Ms. Granholm's ''focus and tenacity'' on the economy.
 In 2007, a contentious standoff over how to solve a more than $1.5 billion deficit in the state budget dragged on for months, finally ending in the face of a government shutdown and with tax increases -- deeply difficult, Ms. Granholm said, but unavoidable.
 This year, there were more distractions: For months, a scandal enveloped Kwame M. Kilpatrick, then the mayor of Detroit. Eventually, as Ms. Granholm began proceedings to determine if he should be removed, Mr. Kilpatrick resigned and pleaded guilty to felony charges -- but not, she said, before more economic damage had been done, with conventions canceled and businesses not wanting to move to Detroit. ''One crisis at a time,'' she said in the interview.
 For now, all eyes here are on whether Congress will provide $25 billion in emergency aid to the automakers, and whether lawmakers will do it soon enough, before some industry experts fear one of the Big Three may collapse. The mere possibility makes Ms. Granholm wince. The likely result, she said, would be catastrophic on residents, so many of whom work in the industry and all its offshoots. 
 ''It would be such a huge, huge strain on our safety net,'' she said. ''It would be of double Katrina-like proportions. We would absolutely need assistance.''
 But she said she felt confident that the aid would be granted. Still, she said, Michigan is a cautionary tale against putting a state's entire hopes in a single industry.
 ''Now, we love our auto industry,'' she said. ''But if we had worked harder on diversifying this economy long ago, then if one of the legs of the stool starts to get wobbly, at least you've got three other legs to stand on.''

HEADLINE: Meeting's Key Decision May Be to Keep Talking

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Leaders from nearly two dozen countries, large and small, converged here Friday to take part in a financial summit meeting with an agenda as broad and complex as the crisis it is meant to stem.
 With the global economy slipping into its most serious downturn in decades, the Group of 20 seemed likely to agree on a few modest measures, according to a senior American official, including a commitment to have banking regulators coordinate their efforts more closely.
 The bulk of the communique, which some diplomats have begun referring to as the Washington declaration, will be devoted to setting in motion a series of working groups to develop new financial regulations, this official said. These measures -- some of which sharply divide the United States and Europe -- would be taken up at subsequent meetings. 
 ''It's safe to say that the best thing to come out of this will be an agreement to have future meetings,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard. ''The elephant in the room is regulation, and they're surely not going to solve that in one meeting.''
 In keeping with the gravity of the economic situation, there was little of the pageantry usually associated with such gatherings. President Bush played host at a working dinner Friday evening at the White House.
 Earlier, police set up concrete barriers blocks from the White House and at hotels where the leaders were staying and holding their own meetings. By early evening, the rain-slicked streets were gridlocked as motorcades of presidents and prime ministers, as well as a German chancellor and a Saudi king, made their way to the White House dinner. 
 As the leaders prepared for the summit meeting at the National Building Museum on Saturday morning, many freed up time to meet two emissaries for President-elect Barack Obama: former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and a former Republican congressman, Jim Leach.
 Mr. Obama is not taking part in the summit meeting, but he made Mrs. Albright and Mr. Leach available to meet with delegations -- an offer eagerly accepted by many of the participants.
 Mr. Obama's representatives shuttled between hotels and downtown office buildings to meet with the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon; the presidents of South Korea, Mexico and Argentina; and senior officials from Canada and Germany. More meetings were set for Saturday afternoon, once the summit meeting is adjourned.
 ''People are vying for Obama's attention,'' said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund.
 Though Mr. Obama has not detailed his views on international financial regulations, he has backed a stimulus program to revive the American economy, which is a theme at this meeting.
 China and Germany have recently announced stimulus packages, and Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain signaled his government would announce a package of measures next week.
 Still, the participants were unlikely to agree on a statement of support for a coordinated worldwide stimulus because Mr. Bush opposes a further package in the United States, having approved a $168 billion measure earlier this year. Administration officials said they believed such a statement was not necessary. 
 ''If every country does what's good for its economy, you'll get what you need,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the communique had not yet been approved.
 Mr. Bush finds himself in an unusually constrained position at this summit meeting, with just over two months left in office and as leader of the country from which the financial crisis erupted. Nevertheless, he offered a ringing defense of free markets in a speech in New York on Thursday, warning against efforts to adopt a latticework of regulations.
 The White House is likely to sign on to a European proposal for a so-called college of supervisors. Under the plan, regulators from several countries would meet periodically to share information on the largest global financial institutions.
 The Bush administration said it was important for the leaders to reach broad agreements on principles and have committees of experts come back with concrete proposals for the next meeting. These will cover issues like accounting, transparency and risk management.
 The summit meeting is also likely to address executive pay and accounting rules. But an official cautioned that the issues would not be addressed in detail in the communique. ''You can't expect the leaders to say what accounting standards should be,'' he said. ''What they can do is set the guiding principles.''
 On the eve of the meeting, Japan pledged $2 billion to a World Bank program to recapitalize banks in smaller developing countries. While welcoming the commitment, the president of the World Bank, Robert B. Zoellick, said he worried that the format of the meeting -- with its emphasis on wealthy countries and major emerging economies like Brazil and China -- might give short shrift to the poorest nations.
 One of the meeting's European participants, Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende of the Netherlands, returned home Friday evening after learning that his father had died.
 In his remarks at the start of the dinner, Mr. Bush said he had received a phone call with the news from Mr. Balkenende. Mr. Bush said he offered his ''heartfelt sympathies and prayers'' to the Dutch leader.

HEADLINE: Central Bankers Ready to Act Together

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
Central bankers indicated on Friday that they were ready to do more to ease credit strains and support faltering economic growth.
 A month after central bankers around the world coordinated an unprecedented reduction in rates, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, told a conference in Frankfurt that ''policy makers will remain in close contact, monitor developments closely and stand ready to take additional steps should conditions warrant.'' 
 Mr. Bernanke added that it was increasingly likely that there would be a convergence of government spending and tax cut policies among the largest economies as they tried to ride out the economic crisis. 
 ''If everyone takes action together, it may be more effective than if each acts alone,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
 The coordinated rate cut in October, he said, was intended to send a strong signal that central banks would act together to address the challenges. 
 In recent weeks, countries from Germany to Japan and China have enacted budgetary measures intended to restart sluggish consumer spending and drive corporate investment.
 Other countries, like Britain and the United States, are working on plans to complement the series of interest rate cuts and direct injections of taxpayer funds into the moribund banking sector, which were the initial response to the slowdown.
 The president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, offered broad support for more economic stimulus -- with a caveat: Not all euro area countries have the necessary wiggle room to enact budgetary stimulus, he said.
 ''The most important reasons for the different policy paths are differences in underlying economic structures and differences in the timing, nature and duration of economic shocks,'' Mr. Trichet said.
 One member of the European bank's governing council, Athanasios Orphanides, went further than Mr. Trichet in endorsing another interest rate cut in Europe. He was quoted by Reuters as saying: ''I do not think that a further easing of monetary policy under the circumstances should be considered unlikely.''
 Su Ning, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, told the conference that other countries should focus ''less attention on monetary policy and more on fiscal policy.''

HEADLINE: New Yorker Nominated To Monitor U.S. Bailout

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
President Bush has nominated a federal prosecutor from New York City for an important role in monitoring the administration's $700 billion financial markets rescue operation.
 Neil M. Barofsky, an assistant United States attorney in Manhattan, was named Friday to be special inspector general for the Treasury's Troubled Assets Relief Program, the linchpin of the emergency bailout plan enacted last month by Congress. 
 A prosecutor for the last eight years, Mr. Barofsky runs an eight-member division investigating mortgage fraud, predatory lending and deceptive foreclosure scams. While he has also handled important narcotics cases, he is best known on Wall Street for leading the government's successful fraud prosecution of two senior executives of Refco, the commodities trading firm that collapsed in 2005.
 If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Barofsky will fill one of the three oversight roles built into the complex bailout legislation -- a role similar to that of the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction, Stuart W. Bowen Jr., whose office has been monitoring that federal contracting process since 2004. 
 The bailout law also gave monitoring duties to the federal Office of the Comptroller General, which has already assigned staff members to the new Treasury operation. And the law further required the Congressional leadership to create a five-member board, called the Congressional Oversight Panel, to provide legislative review for the bailout and recommend regulatory reforms.
 Three of those members were announced Friday within hours of Mr. Barofsky's nomination.
 The Democratic leadership's three appointments are Richard H. Neiman, a former bank executive who is now the New York State superintendent of banks; Elizabeth Warren, a law professor at Harvard who specializes in consumer bankruptcy and commercial law; and Damon A. Silvers, an associate general counsel of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and a member of several federal regulatory advisory committees.
 Two additional members will be named by the Republican leadership.
 These oversight panel appointments do not require confirmation as Mr. Barofsky's does. But some lawmakers said they thought Mr. Barofsky would move through the process quickly in their post-election session.
 ''There is an eagerness to get him on the job as quickly as possible,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. ''He's just the right guy for the job, and I haven't heard of any opposition.''
 Mr. Barofsky, 38, has a formidable academic record. He earned a law degree with highest honors from New York University in 1995 after simultaneously earning two bachelor's degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, one in economics from its Wharton School of Business, in 1992. He worked in private practice until 2000, when he joined the United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York.
 Former colleagues described him as savvy and smart, with what one called ''a sharp and sometimes withering wit.'' Several said his experience as a litigator has prepared him well for the frequent Congressional interrogations that are part of any special inspector general's job. 
 As part of the confirmation process, Mr. Barofsky is scheduled to appear Monday before the Senate Finance Committee, led by Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, and on Wednesday before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, led by Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut.

HEADLINE: Election's Over, So What's Next for the Cable News Channels?

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
Over the last three months of the 2008 presidential campaign, ratings for the cable news channel MSNBC were up 158 percent over the same period a year earlier. They were up 101 percent for the Fox News Channel. On Comedy Central, ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart'' hit a record high of 3.6 million viewers for a guest appearance by Senator Barack Obama on Oct. 29.
 For cable channels with strong points of view, it was a very good election. 
 But for all the news media outlets that set viewership records in recent months, the looming question after Senator Obama's election is: what happens now? 
 In some instances -- especially for the most partisan of outlets, like Fox News and MSNBC -- the change may entail a role reversal like something out of a Shakespearean comedy, with characters changing costumes to be the opposite of what they were during the last act.
 MSNBC, by taking on the voice of the hostile opposition, finally gained traction during the 2008 campaign after being, in the words of its president, Phil Griffin, ''out of the discussion'' for its entire previous history. But it now faces the prospect of changing into the clothes of the administration's ardent defender. 
 At the same time Fox News, which had been the most significant media supporter of the Bush administration, is now expected to revert to the position it held when it first broke through during the Clinton years: the aggressive voice of the opposition. 
 ''The administration has changed, but the politics haven't,'' said John Rash, an advertising executive who teaches a course in media and politics at the University of Minnesota. ''The liberal and conservative commentators who dominate each news network will have to invert their roles.''
 Keith Olbermann, the host of ''Countdown'' on MSNBC, said: ''There's no question that it's going to change. Of course we don't know exactly what's going to happen. I think you could say I'm going to take a different position on the diamond, but it's the same approach. It's an interesting switch of poles but by no means a switch of roles.''
 Mr. Olbermann noted that ''Fox News and Rush Limbaugh rose during the Clinton years,'' whereas he and his fellow MSNBC host Rachel Maddow ''rose during the Bush Administration.'' 
 ''But after the Bush inauguration,'' he added, ''Fox and Limbaugh didn't go off the air. If you're any good at all, you should be able to react to a changed landscape.'' 
 MSNBC and Fox News, along with their chief competitor, CNN, and every comedy show and Web site specializing in political satire, thrived during an election year that captured the attention of viewers across the spectrum of television and the Internet. 
 All the news networks showed significant ratings gains, especially for the high moments of the race. CNN, whose ratings grew by 124 percent in the final three months of the campaign, soared every time there was a campaign event -- especially election night, when it had 13 million viewers, more than any other news organization. 
 On Fox, Bill O'Reilly drew a record number of viewers when he had Mr. Obama as a guest. 
 MSNBC grabbed special attention by topping CNN in prime time for the last month of the race, something it had never done before, and by occasionally topping Fox, the perennial leader, in the audience category to which news advertisers pay most attention: viewers between the ages of 25 and 54. 
 ''We know we're not going to be able to maintain this level,'' Mr. Griffin of MSNBC acknowledged when discussing the channel's ratings performance. ''But nobody is.''
 That could also include entertainment shows like Comedy Central's twin topical satire series, ''The Daily Show'' and ''The Colbert Report.'' So far the ratings for Comedy Central remain strong, and the numbers for the cable news networks have not shown precipitous declines. But the news is still mainly about the election and the transition. 
 Roger Ailes, the chief executive at Fox News, said in an interview this week in the trade publication Broadcasting and Cable: ''There may be certain elements of our audience that turn away between now and the inauguration. I think cable numbers over all will drop, although there is a fascination with Obama.'' (Through a spokeswoman, Fox News declined to comment for this article.)
 But Jonathan Klein, the president of CNN/U.S., predicted that his channel's approach -- news without an overt ideological spin -- would prevail in the long term. He said CNN had made its biggest statement on election night, when it dominated the cable competition, doubling its overall audience from 2004. CNN beat every other network from 8 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. during that coverage. 
 Mr. Klein also said that going forward, especially as troubling economic news grabs headlines, CNN would find an advantage. ''This is a serious time,'' he said. ''People are looking for sobriety.'' 
 Some neutral observers said CNN's argument had some validity, especially if Mr. Obama succeeds in his stated goal of tempering the partisan heat that has characterized political discourse in recent years.
 ''To the degree that a President Obama is able to keep his cool -- and that was one of his chief advantages in the campaign -- it may impact the news channels,'' Mr. Rash of the University of Minnesota said. ''Many Americans may be looking for a conflict-diminished -- I don't think you'll see conflict-free -- government.''
 Andrew Tyndall, who analyzes television for his Web site The Tyndall Report (tyndallreport.com), said: ''I think CNN is less vulnerable. It wasn't running around chasing viewers; it was chasing news. The political season is over. That makes the ideological sources, like the blogs, more vulnerable.'' But those sources are not likely to include Fox News, he said, because of its coming shift to the opposition voice.
 ''Fox News may be affected short term,'' Mr. Tyndall said. ''But they can hunker down during the Obama honeymoon and have their talking points ready.'' 
 He added that MSNBC could be more vulnerable as it switches roles with Fox: ''Fox is the leading conservative voice in the media, and the conservative audience is loyal. The liberal people have more options.'' Mr. Olbermann and Ms. Maddow, he added, ''thrived by presenting themselves as smarter than the people in the administration.''
 ''They won't be able to do that anymore,'' Mr. Tyndall continued. 
 Mr. Griffin made the case for MSNBC's continued popularity, even as it loses the mantle of the righteous rebels seeking overthrow of a corrupt leadership. ''Our personalities built followings during this campaign,'' he said. ''We've arrived.'' 
 Ms. Maddow said she did not expect her show to change significantly. ''There are always stories to be covered, and I've got an opinion about everything,'' she said. ''I feel like it is my job to explain what's going on, and make fun of and take on people who are being dumb.'' 
 She noted that her talk show on Air America Radio did not change much after the elections of 2004 and 2006 ''even though the outcomes were vastly different.'' 
 Comedy Central executives are not worried about the future, said Michele Ganeless, the president of the channel. Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, she said, can make fun of whatever happens to be in the news. 
 And indeed, this week ''The Daily Show'' appeared to slide Mr. Obama seamlessly into the bull's-eye. On Tuesday night, after showing the phalanx ofadvisers Mr. Obama has enlisted, Mr. Stewart noted that ''white presidents travel with a wing man, but an African-American president? Oh, he travels with a posse.''
 Later the show inaugurated a segment, ''Greatness Watch: The Road to Rushmore,'' with a graphic of Mr. Obama's face inserted to the right of Lincoln's.

 IS LINKED TO MR. OBAMA BY A late-in-the-campaign conversion to his cause, having supported Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton until she dropped out of the race. 
 IN HER OWN WORDS The economic expansion in the Bush years ''has been marked by the fact that employment growth has been extremely weak. It's marked by the fact that this is the first economic expansion on record -- on record -- where the family incomes of working families have declined in real terms.'' (on Fox News.)

HEADLINE: In Transition, Tangle of Ties To Lobbying

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK; Kitty Bennett, Mark T. Mazzetti and Barclay Walsh contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama has imposed stricter conflict-of-interest restrictions on his White House transition team than any president before him. But a list of transition team members that his office made public on Friday includes a complicated tangle of ties to private influence-seekers.
 Among the full roster of about 150 staff members being assigned to government agencies between now and Inauguration Day are dozens of former lobbyists and some who were registered as recently as this year. Many more are executives and partners at firms that pay lobbyists, and former government officials who work as consultants or advisers to those seeking influence.
 After campaigning on promises to end the influence of lobbyists in the White House, Mr. Obama has imposed rules that bar officials on his transition team from handling any issues in areas of policy where they have lobbied over the last 12 months or from seeking to influence the same agencies for the next 12 months. 
 The rules also bar officials from working on matters where family members or recent business associates may have a direct conflict of interest. In cases where there is even an ''appearance of conflict,'' officials must seek a waiver from the transition's executive director, an Obama Senate aide and law school classmate, Christopher Lu.
 At least one official initially involved in the transition appears to have been reassigned because of concern about his lobbying or legal work. Henry Rivera, a former Democratic commissioner on the Federal Communication Commission who was involved in planning for the agency's transition, has dropped out of that role because he had represented clients on communications policy in the last year, the newsletter Communications Daily reported Friday. 
 Instead, on the list that was made public on Friday, Mr. Rivera was listed on the team handling science, technology, space and the arts. The rules permit people who have lobbied in one area to join an Obama transition team in another. (With Mr. Rivera is Jim Kohlenberger, executive director of an advocacy group for Internet companies.)
 Representatives of the transition team declined to comment on the assignment, and Mr. Rivera did not return a phone call seeking comment.
 Transition officials said that their policy went further than any previous White House to avoid self-dealing or influence-trading in the formation of the new administration, and that in the modern Washington it would be foolish to try to eliminate anyone who had worked in public policy for a private interest -- or who had a family member in that business -- from contributing to the transition.
 Stephanie Cutter, a transition spokeswoman, said in a written statement that the transition team reflected what she called Mr. Obama's ''commitment to change the way Washington does business and curb the influence of lobbyists on our government.'' 
 ''While these rules disqualify many well-qualified professionals from participating in the transition as a result, they also put in place the right safeguards to prevent any potential conflicts of interest,'' Ms. Cutter said. 
 Some appear to skirt the edges of the ban on working in areas of the transition where they have recently lobbied. Handling some Interior Department issues is Keith Harper, who lobbied earlier this year for Native American tribes. Overseeing the Consumer Products Safety Commission is Pamela Gilbert, a former executive director of the agency who as recently as two years ago lobbied for a consumer advocacy group. Within the last year she has lobbied for the company Barr Laboratories, for an investor group, and for an antitrust enforcement group.
 Among the group handling the Justice Department and civil rights areas of the transition is Theodore Shaw, a litigator for an arm of the N.A.A.C.P. He has registered as a lobbyist for the group in the past, but N.A.A.C.P. officials say he has not lobbied in the past 12 months.
 David J. Hayes, part of the 12-member group overseeing the transition and co-head of the team handling the areas of energy and natural resources, is the chairman of the environmental practice at the law and lobbying firm Latham & Watkins. He was personally registered as a lobbyist as recently as 2006, for clients including San Diego Gas and Electric. 
 Sally Katzen, another member of the supervisory group who is also on teams for the office of the president and government operations, was registered last year to lobby for the pharmaceutical company Amgen on Medicare reimbursements. Louisa Terrell, another member of the top working group, is on leave from the public policy office of the Internet company Yahoo! Tom Wheeler, another of the 12, is on leave from a firm that invests in technology companies and before 2004 lobbied for the cable television and wireless industries.
 John L. White, a former Clinton official charged with overseeing the new Defense Department, is a partner in a firm that invests in defense contractors. Michael Warren, charged with overseeing Treasury, is chief operating officer of a firm that lobbies for clients including the U.S.-India Business Council. 
 Several of the officials have ties to Fannie Mae, the government-backed mortgage firm whose implosion this fall contributed to the financial meltdown. Thomas Donilon, overseeing the State Department, is a partner in the law and lobbying firm O'Melveny and Myers who until three years ago lobbied for Fannie Mae. Wendy R. Sherman, the other official charged with reviewing the State Department, once headed Fannie Mae's charitable foundation. And James Johnson, a former top officer of Fannie Mae, is on the economics and international trade team, charged with reviewing the Commodities Futures Trading Commission.
 Even Mr. Lu, the transition's executive director charged with policing potential conflicts of interests, may have his own appearance problems. His wife, Kathryn Thomson, is a lawyer who represents corporate clients dealing with federal environmental regulations, while his older brother, Curtis Lu, is a top lawyer for Fannie Mae. (Such family connections may not be disqualifying conflicts depending on the nature of the transition job, ethics lawyers said.) 
 Mr. Lu has his work cut out for him in deciding which apparent conflicts may be of real concern, said Robert Walker, a Washington lawyer and former staff director of the Senate Ethics Committee. ''I don't think it is the brightest of bright lines, and there is going to be a lot of time spent thinking about just where that line is,'' Mr. Walker said. 
 The people involved in the transition teams assigned to each federal department and agency have begun meeting with their current staff to collect information on budgets, pending issues and personnel matters. For now, the advisers assigned to each agency report back to the central 12-person working group, which coordinates the efforts.
 The vast majority involved are second-tier officials of the Clinton administration, eager to help another Democrat take control of the White House. With the exception of a few academics, almost all of them spent the intervening years in the private sector, usually capitalizing on the connections and expertise they developed in the Clinton years. 
 For example, Sandy Berger, the Clinton national security adviser, founded Stonebridge International, a consulting and lobbying firm focused on helping clients resolve government issues here and overseas. 
 Mr. Berger took with him Mr. Warren, the former executive director of the president's economic council who became chief operating officer of Stonebridge and has now become a major contributor to the transition in the pivotal areas of the Treasury Department and economic policy. Although not a registered lobbyist, Mr. Warren helped manage Stonebridge while it lobbied the government for clients including the U.S.-India Business Council within the last year as well as Dynergy International, Airbus and Conoco in earlier years. (More of Stonebridge's business involves using government expertise and connections to help corporate clients abroad.) 
 Some transition officials now work at firms that do business with the agencies they are examining. John O. Brennan, a former Central Intelligence Agency official working on its transition, is president and chief executive of the Analysis Corporation, an intelligence contractor.
 On the NASA review board, Lori Garver is now president of a strategic consulting company, Capital Space LLC, and previously worked for the aerospace company DFI International.
 Among the transition officials charged with reviewing the Securities and Exchange Commission -- likely to come under significant scrutiny amid the financial meltdown -- is Mozelle Thompson, who runs a legal and policy consulting business for publicly traded companies including Facebook.com. One name on the transition list comes unencumbered by potential conflicts but instead by bad luck. Jami Miscik, leading a review of American intelligence agencies, was the head of intelligence analysis at the Central Intelligence Agency during its biggest embarrassment: the botched assessments about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Then she moved on to become a senior official managing risks in emerging markets for the investment bank Lehman Brothers, until its collapse this fall.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 17, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about President-elect Barack Obama's transition advisers and their ties to private interests misidentified the official reviewing candidates for the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and misstated his occupation. The adviser is James E. Johnson of the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton -- not James A. Johnson, the former chief executive of the mortgage giant Fannie Mae.

HEADLINE: Jason S. Grumet

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
As he prepares to take office, President-elect Barack Obama is relying on a small team of advisers who will lead his transition operation and help choose the members of a new Obama administration. Following is part of a series of profiles of potential members of the administration. 
 Name: Jason S. Grumet
 Being considered for: White House energy and climate adviser or other senior environmental/energy position.
 Would bring to job: Expertise on environmental and energy issues; knowledge of energy politics in Congress; wide contacts in environmental, academic and industry circles.
 Used to work as: Executive director of the National Commission on Energy Policy, a position he still holds. Mr. Grumet helped create the nonpartisan group, which studies energy, climate and security issues. He is also a founder of the Bipartisan Policy Center, which proposes policies on national security, health care, energy, agriculture and transportation; its advisory board includes former Senators Bob Dole, Tom Daschle, Howard Baker and George Mitchell. He also served as executive director of a body that coordinates air quality policy for a consortium of New England States.
 In his own words: ''For almost 20 years, automakers and environmentalists have been locked into an often-vitriolic and rarely productive fight over fuel economy. The upheaval in the Middle East has crystallized recognition that these issues are much bigger than just how many jobs in the upper Midwest are affected. Other industry leaders, outside of the auto industry, are starting to express concern that the volatility of oil and gasoline prices are exposing a fundamental weakness in our economic competitiveness.'' (In December 2007, during the Congressional battle over auto mileage standards.)
 ''The underlying premise of Senator Obama's approach to climate change is the recognition that there is a tremendous urgency to act, and to do so, we have to find a voice and a set of policies that can be embraced not just by 51 percent of the Congress or even 61 percent of the Congress -- a platform that speaks to the severity of the problem as well as the real anxieties that have made it so difficult to act until now.'' (Earlier this year, on climate change legislation, to the environmental Web site Grist.)
 Is linked to Mr. Obama by: Having advised him on energy issues when he entered the Senate in 2005. Mr. Grumet helped Mr. Obama fashion an automotive fuel-economy proposal similar to one that passed in 2007; he joined the Obama campaign early on as his top adviser on energy and the environment.
 Carries as baggage: Has been criticized by environmentalists as being too close to industry and too wedded to the use of nuclear power, ethanol and coal to generate energy. He has also been criticized by the industry for proposing mandatory climate change legislation and pollution rules that would raise the cost of producing electricity and manufactured goods.

 BODY:
THE owners of the South City Grill restaurants in New Jersey opened the first of three planned upscale steakhouses this year, and the decor was one of opulence and glamour. The owners ''wanted it to sparkle like jewelry,'' recalled Anurag Nema, one of the designers. 
 The interior featured shimmering silk curtains, ruby-tinted glass and a hulking crystal chandelier. The stainless steel accents were polished to mirror brilliance, said Mr. Nema, who designed the steakhouse, South City Prime, in Little Falls, with Orit Kaufman.
 The second restaurant is scheduled to open in January in Montvale, N.J., but the sparkle is gone, the designers said. With the economy in free fall, the concept is now sturdy American grill and the name is now Wildfire by South City. 
 Wooden shutters and brick have replaced the silk curtains. Salvaged wood from a barn will stand in for the ruby-tinted glass. As for the chandelier, well, there is no chandelier. 
 ''There's a shift to get away from glitz,'' Ms. Kaufman said. ''I'm almost starting to feel that luxury is a dirty word.'' 
 It is no secret that consumers are cutting back, anxious about jobs, plummeting home values and shrinking retirement savings. But that belt-tightening seems to have also prompted a reconsideration of what is acceptable consumerism even for those relatively unaffected by the economic cataclysm. 
 When just about everyone is making do with less, sometimes much less, those $2,000 logo-laden handbags and Aspen vacations can seem in poor taste. ''Luxe'' is starting to look as out of fashion as square-toed shoes. 
 As sales at high-end stores like Neiman Marcus plunged by nearly 30 percent in October, compared with a year earlier, Costco sales slipped just 1 percent and Wal-Mart reported gains.
 Henri Barguirdjian, the president of Graff, the diamond merchant, said on CNBC last week that the market for pieces from $20,000 to $100,000 had grown softer. Marine Products Corp., an Atlanta-based maker of yachts and pleasure boats, saw net sales decrease by nearly 40 percent in the quarter ending in September compared with a year earlier.
 ''The era of conspicuous consumption, at least for the foreseeable future, has come to a close,'' said Paco Underhill, the author of ''Why We Buy,'' which explores the science of retail. ''Consumption will still happen. It's just not going to be as public.'' 
 He cited a story from an Audi dealer: a buyer of an S4 high-performance sedan requested the nameplate be removed, ''so only the person who really knew what they were looking at,'' he said, ''would know what it is.'' 
 Today, bejeweled fashionistas are pegged as tone-deaf Marie Antoinettes. ''It's not good taste in our business to walk into a party loaded with the biggest diamonds you can find,'' said Bud Konheim, the chief executive of Nicole Miller. ''You don't brag about paying $10,000 for a dress for a party. The feeling now is, so what are you telling us? You're either a sucker or showing off when people have lost jobs.''
 Conspicuous consumption has gone out of style before, in the recession that followed the 1980s stock market boom; and briefly after Sept. 11, 2001, until spending was recast as patriotic. But for a precedent for such a complete about-face in people's attitudes toward luxury, you would have to look to the Great Depression. In 1932, wary of insulting the vast number of unemployed Americans, J. P. Morgan Jr. kept his 343-foot yacht, Corsair IV, in the boatyard, Ron Chernow wrote in ''The House of Morgan.'' 
 Among those who remained solvent in the Depression, there was ''a widespread sense that you don't flaunt your success,'' said David E. Kyvig, the author of ''Daily Life in the United States, 1920-1940: How Americans Lived Through the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression.'' 
 The economic collapse was also seen as a chance, after the 1920s bacchanalia, for moral cleansing. The industrialist Andrew W. Mellon said it would ''purge the rottenness out of the system. People will work harder, live a more moral life.'' 
 Mr. Konheim of Nicole Miller, who was born in 1935, said he grew up in a mansion on Long Island with servants, but even for his family, waste was bad form. 
 ''We had three cars, and they were all Plymouths,'' he said. ''When the soap got down to slivers, what you did was squeeze soap together to make a soap bar -- you didn't throw it out.''
 Today, such thriftiness might make a comeback, said Alexandra Lebenthal, president of the wealth management firm Lebenthal and a contributing editor for the Web site New York Social Diary. It has become fashionable, she said, for socialites to talk enthusiastically about sample sales, eBay bargains and postponements at the hair salon in the interests of thrift. 
 ''It's now chic to cut back,'' she said. ''If you ask people if they are going away for the holidays, they say, 'No, we're just spending a very quiet holiday with family' -- instead of 'We're going to Anguilla for Thanksgiving.' ''
 Harry Slatkin, the founder of Slatkin & Co., a home fragrances company, said he and his wife, Laura, recently canceled a 50th birthday party for her at the Pool Room at the Four Seasons. Instead, they plan to have a party at home, with defrosted White Castle cheeseburgers served on silver trays. ''It's not time to have splashy birthday parties,'' Mr. Slatkin said. ''It's a time to stay home, spend time with friends and connect.''
 Harrison Group, a market research firm in Waterbury, Conn., recently did a survey of attitudes toward wealth among people with household discretionary incomes above $100,000, in partnership with American Express Publishing. While 83 percent of respondents said they were in ''good shape to endure this economic climate,'' those who agreed that ''a few luxuries are important in tough times'' slipped to 50 percent, from 61 percent, from June to September.
 ''The definition of living well is changing,'' said Jim Taylor, a Harrison vice chairman. ''There is a desire to not stand out. If you're laying people off, you don't want to buy a Ferrari.''
 Julien Tornare, the United States president of the Swiss luxury watchmaker Vacheron Constantin, predicted that his industry would move toward a period of ''subtle luxury.''
 ''I think people are going to go with more conservative, not ostentatious -- something more discreet that only the connoisseur would know and appreciate, not the bling bling,'' he said. 
 The rich were not the only ones consuming conspicuously in recent years, said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst for NPD Group. The middle class, bingeing on cheap credit, also treated itself. Sub-Zero refrigerators, $300 jeans and Cadillac Escalades seemed within reach, even in average homes. ''Those consumers were beneficiaries of false wealth, and they were living, literally, like millionaires,'' Mr. Cohen said. 
 Now as the middle class goes back to living like the middle class, Mr. Cohen said, the culture itself might feel more modest. Consumers may put a premium on comfort over flash. At restaurants, for example, ostentatious fare may look less tempting, said Bobby Flay, the chef and television personality.
 ''Not to take anything away from chefs who specialize in edible paper, pea shoots and fennel pollen,'' Mr. Flay said, ''but I think classic American dishes with substance are what people will grasp onto.''
 In other words, roast chicken will be very popular.
 WHILE fashion is always headed in three directions, consumers are turning away from disposable style -- the overdesigned ''it'' handbag, for example -- toward high-quality pieces that will endure over multiple seasons, said David Wolfe, creative director of the Doneger Group, which forecasts fashion and retail trends. 
 The British company Mulberry has seen a shift toward its unadorned handbags, said Sarah Geary, its marketing director. Until a few months ago, consumer tastes were ''focused on extravagance, irrespective of price,'' she said in an e-mail message, but ''in the coming months, the mood will be against that 'blind consumption.' ''
 Any new era of no-frills consumption, however, might last only as long as it takes for the Dow to recover, which could take months, years or decades.
 But Mr. Konheim recalled that after the Depression ended, conspicuous consumption was still vaguely sinful. When he was in high school in 1949, for instance, a girl at his school received a mink coat for her Sweet 16 party.
 ''The whole town was in shock,'' he said. ''It was just a different atmosphere in the entire country.''

HEADLINE: The Faces of FSBO For Sale By Owner

BYLINE: By SAMANTHA STOREY

 BODY:
HAL RUZAL personifies the do-it-yourself spirit. 
 He installed his own kitchen, built loft spaces for his office and sleeping area and tore down walls to convert his apartment in the meatpacking district from a one-bedroom to an open loft space. In the same vein, he is trying to sell his apartment without the aid of a real estate broker. 
 ''The first five letters of broker is broke,'' said Mr. Ruzal, 54, a mechanic at Bicycle Habitat in SoHo. ''Say I get $525,000, a broker will get around $32,000 of that. I make $40,000 a year. For no work, they are getting about the same amount of money.''
 Mr. Ruzal was referring to the 6 percent commission that real estate agents might earn on the sale of his 550-square-foot apartment, currently on the market for $525,000. 
 Since listing his apartment at the end of September on Craigslist.org with the tag line ''Cheaper Than Renting,'' Mr. Ruzal has spent every weekend walking around his neighborhood with a cardboard sign, shouting ''Apartment for sale,'' to passers-by and to diners sitting outside at the restaurant Pastis. 
 ''You have to be original,'' Mr. Ruzal said. ''If you're boring, you'll just get passed over.''
 Common wisdom might suggest that in an economic downturn, Mr. Ruzal and others taking the for-sale-by-owner, or FSBO (pronounced FIZZ-bo), route, would do better with a broker's knowledge of the market and powerful advertising reach. On the other hand, at a time of cutting corners, the savings implied by a FSBO sale may appeal more than ever. 
 During the housing boom in recent years, online FSBO sites surged, enabling homeowners to market properties on their own and save the broker's commission, said Jonathan Miller, the chief executive of Miller Samuel Inc., a real estate research company. 
 The housing market now, though, is on the decline. ''We are in an environment where the actual success rate in FSBOs has fallen off considerably,'' Mr. Miller said. ''In this downturn, there is a greater volume of listings. Sellers are going to be much more conservative when competing with more listings.'' And, he added, they will be more likely to list their homes with brokers. 
 But many sellers aren't giving up yet. In August, in response to user requests, Craigslist added a FSBO category to its real estate section, said Susan MacTavish Best, a spokeswoman for the company. 
 ''We have seen in the last three years much more enthusiasm on the part of homeowners to post their real estate on the site themselves as a FSBO property,'' Ms. MacTavish Best wrote in a recent e-mail message. ''It's appealing for owners to post the ads themselves, controlling much of the home-selling process throughout.'' 
 There is no official multiple listing service in New York City and FSBO sales are not tracked. But in the real estate advertising section of nytimes.com, the Web site of The New York Times, the number of listings bought as individual ads tripled, to 14,117, in 2007, from 4,640 in 2002, according to internal data compiled by The New York Times. Brokers typically buy multiple ads. In the first 10 months of 2008, nytimes.com had 12,649 single listings, about the same number as for the same period last year.
 Even with the advertising reach of the Internet at their finger tips, sellers are still facing a slumping market. 
 ''It's a little scary right now,'' said Boris Schaefer, 38, director of customer relations for a German cosmetics-packaging company, who is trying to sell his five-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath colonial in Montclair, N.J. ''Right after the bank crisis, traffic slowed down,'' Mr. Schaefer said. ''There were less people calling and responding to ads.'' 
 After cleaning and decluttering their home, he and his wife, Silke Willms, also 38, first listed their property for $689,000 over the summer.
 He created a slide show of interiors and exteriors on Flickr.com, a photo-sharing Web site, and placed ads on Craigslist and the Park Slope Parents classifieds list, an online bulletin board for families living in or near Park Slope, Brooklyn, hoping to interest those looking for more space. 
 He attended open houses in Montclair to see how they were staged and to gauge the right selling price. ''I compared those houses with the condition of our house,'' he said. He and his wife held open houses and received a couple of offers, but they fell through. 
 Mr. Schaefer decided not to use a broker because he had the time to sell the property himself, he said, and he doesn't want to pay a commission. ''Six percent is a lot of money,'' said Mr. Schaefer, who is returning to his native Germany at the end of the year for his job. (His wife and two children moved in August to start the school year there.) 
 Brokers say that FSBO sellers are missing out on the marketing prowess of agencies, expertise in setting a price and the ability to present a home to the right potential buyers. ''I think the vast majority of FSBOs are not serious sellers,'' said Ari Harkov, an associate broker with Halstead Properties in New York. ''They are only willing to sell at a certain price.''
 After a series of disappointments, Mr. Schaefer had been considering going with a real estate agent after all. But at one of his open houses, he met a broker who lamented that her agency had only five houses go into contract over the previous four weeks.
 ''That explained to me why the last weeks were so quiet,'' Mr. Schaefer said. ''I am thinking if there are no buyers out there, the Realtor cannot do a better job than me.''
 Since then, he has dropped his asking price by $40,000, to $649,000, and listed his home on realtor.com through a company called Housepad, a flat-fee listing service that posts properties on multiple listing services on behalf of sellers who are not licensed real estate agents. He is hopeful that the new listing will attract more potential buyers. 
 With the recent victory of Barack Obama in the presidential election, Mr. Schaefer said he believed that ''many people in our area will be more optimistic about the future.'' If he cannot sell his home by the time he has to move back to Germany, he said he would either list the house with a broker or find a renter.
 Some sellers who are bullish on the FSBO process actually sold before the current financial crisis. 
 ''It's all common sense,'' said Matthew Morse, 46, a magazine editor. He and his wife, Sarah, sold their two-and-a-half-bedroom one-bath co-op in Brooklyn Heights on Pierrepont Street in June. 
 ''We put it on the market at $799,000,'' Mr. Morse said. ''We didn't want to go below asking, but we ended up selling it for $737,500. I don't think a broker would have gotten full asking price, and they would have chopped off 6 percent.''
 The couple created a Web site with photos and a floor plan, advertised the apartment on nytimes.com at the beginning of May and then held open houses every weekend. Before each open house, they cleaned their apartment and crammed their children's toys into closets. 
 Apart from the time it took to show their property for six weekends in a row, ''the most annoying thing were the real estate agents and brokers who constantly called and harassed us to get our business,'' Mr. Morse said. 
 Other FSBO sellers agree, saying they have scores of business cards from agents angling for a listing.
 Still, Mr. Morse said that if he were selling in today's market, he would go with a broker. He said he would worry about how long it might take to find a buyer and did not think he could put in the time needed. ''It's a whole brave new world out there,'' he added.
 But Greg Healy, the vice president of operations of ForSaleByOwner.com, sees that brave new world in a different way. ''This market has been really tough,'' Mr. Healy said. ''We are seeing a strong surge of people who need to sell by owner.''
 The number of sellers in the five boroughs of New York City advertising on ForSaleByOwner.com has increased by 22 percent so far this year over the same period last year, Mr. Healy said. 
 Customers surveyed by the site said they had seen their retirement and college savings hit hard by the financial crisis, Mr. Healy said. They are trying to get every penny they can from the sales of their homes. 
 ''I think there are people out there who can do this,'' said Lawrence Burak, 61, who listed his East End Avenue one-bedroom one-bath apartment for $850,000 on ForSaleByOwner.com at the beginning of October.
 Eschewing open houses to avoid the possibility of damage to his home, Mr. Burak, a sales and marketing consultant in broadcast media, is showing his apartment by appointment. He believes the strongest selling point of his eighth-floor 950-square-foot co-op, as described in his ad, ''is the totally unobstructed, and never to be obscured, northeastern view of the East River.''
 A few people have come to see the apartment, he said, but he has not received any offers. ''The view is worth the asking price,'' he said. ''To this day, when I look out the window of where I live, I never tire of it.''
 For Allison and Marc Milgrom, the owners of a duplex apartment in Park Slope that is listed for $599,000, working with brokers over the summer was frustrating. ''I felt like I had all the marketing ideas,'' said Ms. Milgrom, a stay-at-home mother. ''They did everything I asked, but didn't offer anything more. They just didn't seem to have a lot of experience.'' 
 Once the listing expired, the Milgroms decided to take a stab at selling the apartment themselves. But when it came to writing a description of their co-op for a listing, they found themselves in a quandary. ''At first we described it as a 'two-bedroom, plus office apartment,' '' Ms. Milgrom said. The apartment has a master bedroom on the ground floor, and a windowed 400-square-foot lower level that could be renovated into a bedroom and office space. ''But families with kids came by and were disappointed that there weren't two real bedrooms.''
 When they changed their listing to say ''one-bedroom plus'' instead, they received more inquiries from couples and individuals. There were a few offers, but none have come to fruition. 
 Recently, Ms. Milgrom placed a for-sale sign in a street-level window, which resulted in a couple of showings. ''I think if we don't sell it soon, we will rent it,'' she said, ''because we have to do something.'' 
 The Milgroms have bought a two-family house nearby and cannot continue paying two mortgages.
 Not all sellers have a deadline to find a buyer. Though Mr. Ruzal is hoping to buy a house in the Midwood section of Brooklyn, he is not worried about how long it may take to sell his studio in the meatpacking district. 
 ''You succeed in this world if you actually try at doing something,'' he said. ''The worst that can happen is I am stuck with the apartment -- I'll have a roof over my head.''

HEADLINE: Easing the Burden of Public Defenders

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Citing Workload, Public Lawyers Reject New Cases'' (front page, Nov. 9): 
 The assertion that despite increasingly overwhelming workloads, public defenders must ''tighten their belts'' during these times of severe reductions in state and local revenues is an affront to the constitutional guarantee of effective assistance of counsel for indigent criminal defendants.
 We must not shortchange our Constitution regardless of our economic woes. There are, however, huge savings to be had that would substantially reduce the financial burden on public defenders' offices and other components of our criminal justice system while maintaining our constitutional commitment to ensuring that all defendants receive quality representation. 
 As has been established by numerous studies in numerous states, including California, North Carolina, Maryland, New Jersey and Tennessee, the repeal of capital punishment would save taxpayers many millions of dollars a year. 
 The time has come for Americans and their elected representatives to seriously consider whether we can afford our error-prone, discriminatory and bankrupting death penalty system. 
 John Holdridge Director, A.C.L.U. Capital Punishment Project Durham, N.C., Nov. 10, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Your article accurately described the difficulties public defenders across the country are facing as they grapple with increasing caseloads and diminishing resources. Ethics requires that they resist more cases than they can effectively handle.
 What is not so apparent is how this problem reaches beyond public defenders and their clients and then to our communities.
 Public defense -- like the prosecution, the courts and the police -- plays a vital role in ensuring that the justice system works reliably and efficiently. When the system is working right with adequate resources, the guilty are convicted, victims get the closure they deserve, the rights of the innocent are upheld and community safety is maintained. 
 When public defenders lack the time and resources necessary to prepare a full and fair defense for each client, the horrible result can be wrongful convictions that inevitably leave criminals free in our communities. Public defenders are seriously overworked and underpaid. 
 States that fail to recognize the importance of public defenders to a functioning justice system are ultimately playing Russian roulette with our safety.
 John Wesley Hall President, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers Little Rock, Ark., Nov. 10, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 I just got back from working an arraignment shift, and decided to check my e-mail before I left for the Elmhurst Hospital prison psychiatric ward, where I need to interview a client who has been waiting for an arraignment since last Sunday (first arrest, minor charges). It is Saturday. I need to interview her tonight, because I don't have enough time to conduct a proper interview on Monday, which is her arraignment date. 
 On Monday, I have to handle seven cases in four court parts, including three cases on which hearings are supposed to occur, and must attend a psychiatric examination as well as make time for this arraignment.
 These seven cases include two assault, a contempt, a burglary, an attempted murder of a corrections officer, and a homicide case. 
 A rare-bookseller friend of mine e-mailed me your article, which I then e-mailed to the lawyers in my office. One of my colleagues promptly replied (from her office): ''I can't believe you are in the office. Get a life (LOL).'' 
 This is the life of a public defender.

HEADLINE: How Industries Survive Change. If They Do.

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
By some logic, there is no earthly reason why bicycles should still exist.
 They are a quaint, 19th-century invention, originally designed to get someone from point A to point B. Today there are much faster, far less labor-intensive modes of transportation. And yet hopeful children still beg for them for Christmas, healthful adults still ride them to work, and daring teenagers still vault them down courthouse steps. The bicycle industry has faced its share of disruptive technologies, and it has repeatedly risen from the ashes.
 Other industries (cough, cough, newspapers) should be so lucky. 
 For some businesses, the current economic downturn is a bit problematic. For those already facing fundamental threats -- like newspapers and American auto makers -- it could accelerate the path to what, it has been said, might be death. 
 But history offers some reason for optimism. Industries like bicycle manufacturers, when faced with a threat of obsolescence, managed to creatively reinvent themselves. What lessons do they provide for today's struggling industries?
 There's no clear route to cheating industrial death. Those companies that have survived technological challenges have in common some combination of perseverance, creativity, versatility and luck. Their precise strategies vary. Some made sweeping changes, and abandoned their original products entirely; others were able to endure by changing little but their marketing.
 Take, for example, a certain class of luxury goods. Inventors have created more user-friendly writing implements than fountain pens, more dependable time-keeping devices than mechanical wristwatches, and more efficient ways to heat houses than fireplaces. Yet, many consumers still gladly opt for the cultural cachet of technologically more primitive goods. 
 These older technologies have survived by recasting themselves as luxuries and by marketing their sensory, aesthetic and nostalgic appeal. Their producers emphasize their experiential rather than functional qualities. 
 In short, they were Ye-Olde-ed, and a boutique-y rump of the original industry now survives.
 The popularity of newspapers the day after Barack Obama's election -- when they were probably valued more as historical artifacts than as sources of news -- had a whiff of this development.
 But newspapers were not designed with maximum tactile pleasure and durability in mind. ''Newspapers were always this scrubby sheet of paper with ink that came off, and that deteriorate in a few hours,'' said Gregory Clark, an economic historian at the University of California at Davis. 
 For that reason, he said, it is somewhat difficult to imagine newspapers remarketing themselves as a luxury product. 
 Perhaps there are other qualities unique to newspapers that can be exploited, just as previous creative industries have discovered when facing disruptive technologies.
 Photography might have killed Western painting and portraiture, for example, because painters knew they couldn't compete with the speed and accuracy with which photographs represented the visual world. Instead, many painters and other traditional visual artists innovated with more abstract and less representational images. 
 Similarly, television might have crowded out movies. Instead, Hollywood focused on bigger, more spectacular, more risque films -- the stuff that television couldn't deliver.
 Some survivor industries discovered new customer bases.
 Bicycles, for example, grew in popularity through the late 19th century, peaking in the 1890s, but the craze weakened around the turn of the last century. After the First World War, manufacturers discovered a new youth market, which lasted until the baby boomers were kids. Then bikes fell out of favor again, but were revived during the 1970s when those boomers, and their kids, became more interested in personal exercise and gas-free, environmentally friendly modes of transportation. 
 Radio is an even better example. In its 1940s heyday, it was the center of national entertainment. Then, in the 1950s, television began stealing radio's biggest stars, like Jack Benny and Abbott and Costello. National advertisers -- radio's revenue base -- followed the talent. ''Radio, actually shockingly, was pronounced dead in 1953,'' says Susan J. Douglas, chair of the communication studies department at the University of Michigan. 
 But the industry revitalized itself by tapping into new markets. First it stumbled upon the youth music market, congregating around the car radio. Then radio innovators found other neglected markets, including underground music movements, longer-form news and talk radio. Along the way, radio's business model changed; the medium cultivated new niche advertisers, rather than national advertisers, to pay for its new niche programming. 
 For some companies, nestling into a marketing nook wasn't enough. They made radical transitions to new products and new industries, and survived through evolution, not preservation. 
 ''Much of the history of the 'American system of manufacturing' is the story of inventors moving from a declining industry to a new expanding industry,'' says Petra Moser, an economic historian at Stanford who studies innovation. ''Inventors take their skills with them.''
 Gun makers learned to make revolvers with interchangeable parts in the mid-19th century, Ms. Moser says. Then those companies (and some former employees, striking out on their own) applied those techniques to sewing machines when demand for guns slackened. Later, sewing machine manufacturers began making woodworking machinery, bicycles, cars and finally trucks.
 Some famous companies have taken more improbable turns, either because their original business was fading or because they saw better growth opportunities. Before making cellphones, Nokia made paper. Before making cars, Toyota made looms (a Toyota textile business still exists). Corning is still a specialty glass and ceramics company known to most consumers for its tableware, but for more than a century it has also profited from uses as diverse as early light bulbs, space, defense and fiber-optic cable.
 Some superstar companies managed to reinvent themselves multiple times -- I.B.M., for example. Over a century, the company has nimbly transitioned from punch-card accounting equipment (its original business) to large mainframe computers, to personal computers, and finally to information-technology -- each time facing skepticism from analysts who thought I.B.M. might be too big, too old or too entrenched to adapt. 
 These companies survived by keeping their ears to the ground. New customer needs emerged, and smart corporations positioned themselves to meet them. ''You have to be willing to walk away from the things that have made you great,'' says Scott D. Anthony, president of Innosight, which consults with companies (including newspapers and automotive businesses) on how to foster a culture of innovation. He argues that the incumbents in the newspaper industry were caught sleeping during the initial meteoric growth period of Web sites like Wikipedia because the avenue for innovation -- letting crowds rather than experts aggregate and filter data -- seemed so antithetical to what newspapers did well. 
 Of course, straying too far from what a company does well has also proven dangerous. ''If you look at the history of firms that have tried to diversify their businesses, you'll see it's virtually an impossible thing to do,'' says David A. Hounshell, a historian at Carnegie Mellon University who studies technology and social change. ''Usually when a firm announces a program to diversify, they've pretty much written their death warrant.'' 
 Newspapers have faced challenges before and have adapted -- including through efforts at diversification. Can these historical precedents teach newspapers how to defeat the economic forces of technological change once again?
 Like previous industries fearful of obsolescence, newspapers can either develop a new product, or find a way to remarket and remonetize the old one. Right now, newspapers are doing a little of both: They're adapting their product to the Web to attract new audiences, and they're trying to re-monetize by delivering more targeted advertising. 
 Meanwhile, we've already seen some of the ''destruction'' half of Joseph Schumpeter's famous ''creative destruction'' paradigm, with many newspapers cutting staff and other production costs. Unfortunately for newspapers, historians say, the survivors in previous industries facing major technological challenges were usually individual companies that adapted, rather than an entire industry. So a bigger shakeout may yet come. 
 But perhaps the destruction will lead to more creativity. Perhaps the people we now know as journalists -- or, for that matter, autoworkers -- will find ways to innovate elsewhere, just as, over a century ago, gun makers laid down their weapons and broke out the needle and thread. That is, after all, the American creative legacy: making innovation seem as easy as, well, riding a bike.

HEADLINE: Will the Safety Net Catch the Economy's Casualties?

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Economists rarely agree on anything, but a great many do agree on one unfortunate matter these days: the current economic downturn is likely to develop into the worst recession since the downturn of 1981-82.
 The United States is a far different place. Government programs in place then to cushion and counter recessions have been scaled back sharply, raising questions about whether they are up to the task as the economic outlook darkens today.
 Unemployment insurance is not as generous now. Yet the unemployment rate is at 6.5 percent and some forecasters say it could top 8 percent next year. It hit 10.8 percent in the early 1980s. 
 This is also the first severe economic slump since President Bill Clinton overhauled the welfare system and made it tougher to qualify for, and keep receiving, benefits. Many people who lose their jobs now and fall into poverty may not qualify for public assistance. Other programs designed in part to counter hard times -- like job training and housing subsidies -- have also been cut back. 
 ''Some of the core elements of the social safety net have eroded,'' said Jacob Hacker, author of ''The Great Risk Shift'' and a professor of political science at the University of California at Berkeley. 
 ''Unemployment insurance has been weak for a long time, but right now it seems to be quite anemic relative to the need,'' he said. ''The social safety net in general has not been kept up to date with the changing nature of the work force and the increased economic risks that working families are facing.''
 With a Democratic president and Congress set to be sworn in this January, many liberal groups are maneuvering to strengthen the nation's safety net -- the web of government programs, including food stamps, welfare, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, that are intended to cushion Americans from hardships like layoffs, disability and old age.
 Two such groups -- the Center for American Progress and the National Employment Law Project -- issued a report on Friday making their case for expanding unemployment insurance. 
 According to the report, tighter rules mean that just 37 percent of unemployed Americans are receiving jobless benefits today, down from 42 percent during the 1981-82 recession and 50 percent during the 1974-75 downturn. Americans today receive a maximum of 39 weeks of unemployment benefits, down from 65 weeks in the 1970s. The average weekly benefit is $293. And low-income workers -- a category that tends to include women and those in part-time employment -- are one-third as likely to receive unemployment insurance as higher-income workers.
 Another liberal group, the Center for Budget Policy and Priorities, said that as states have imposed tougher restrictions on welfare, just 40 percent of very poor families who qualify for public assistance today actually end up receiving it, compared with 80 percent in the recessions of 1981-82 and 1990-91.
 Liberal economists say the deterioration of the safety net will not only mean more pain and poverty for millions of families, but a longer recession. They say spending on social programs helps to stabilize the economy and counter the downward tug of recession. But many conservative economists argue that the existing safety net is plenty large, and that in any event, it will be less effective in fighting a downturn characterized by an extraordinary credit crunch.
 ''Is it the case that automatic stabilizers that are in place will prevent the kind of downturn we've seen most recently -- I think the answer is no,'' said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who was John McCain's chief economic adviser during the presidential campaign. Mr. Holtz-Eakin said the current downturn is ''an asset-bubble-driven recession,'' fueled by declining housing and stock prices. The increased income that automatic stabilizers put into people's pockets is not an antidote to an economy in which banks are scared to lend, he said.
 During the Great Depression, Franklin Delano Roosevelt strived mightily to build a broad and strong safety net that included unemployment insurance and aid for families with dependent children. After Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, Washington started trimming and tightening many social programs. To boost the economy, Mr. Reagan called for smaller government, lower taxes and more self-reliance. The unemployment insurance and welfare programs were trimmed to reduce spending and discourage recipients from dawdling. But President Reagan also expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, which gives a credit of several thousand dollars to low-income workers.
 Bill Clinton presided over a further tightening of welfare, with the federal government limiting the amount of time most recipients can receive benefits and many states imposing strict work requirements. Federal housing subsidies have also been cut by nearly two-thirds since the 1980s, after inflation. 
 But Brian Riedl, senior federal budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the automatic stabilizing effects of these programs remained strong. ''Antipoverty spending is at its highest level in American history,'' he said. ''It's topped 3 percent of gross domestic product.''
 Economists say that it is sometimes hard to determine whether certain social programs fuel recessions or fight them. As 1.2 million workers have lost their job this year, for instance, many have turned to Medicaid, causing some states to spend more on health care, boosting the economy in the process. At the same time, some cash-strapped states have cut Medicaid, losing federal matching funds and slowing down the economy.
 Some see a similar effect with the Earned Income Tax Credit. ''The E.I.T.C. is a fantastic wage subsidy program that's been hugely effective in reducing poverty, but when jobs disappear, the E.I.T.C. doesn't help you,'' said Jared Bernstein of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group. He was one of the economists invited to a meeting of President-elect Barack Obama's top economic advisers on Nov. 7. ''When people lose their jobs, they often stop receiving E.I.T.C., and I fear that the program becomes less countercyclical and more pro-cyclical, meaning it reinforces recessionary forces,'' he said.
 The president-elect is on record in support of an economic-stimulus package and extending unemployment benefits. But many advocacy groups are churning out reports and position papers urging him to take further steps to enhance jobless and welfare benefits. 
 Rebecca Blank, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, noted that the recession of 2001 hurt factory workers most but had little effect on the low-wage jobs that many women hold. 
 ''But this recession is really hitting those jobs, and the question is what will happen to that group of women. Is there a safety net?'' she asked. Ms. Blank complained that low-wage-earning women often failed to qualify for unemployment benefits because many states do not provide such assistance to part-time workers or those who fail to work six quarters in a row.
 ''The other safety net for this group of workers is the traditional welfare program,'' Ms. Blank said. ''On that front, the news is not promising at all.''

HEADLINE: Here Today, Gone Tomorrow

BYLINE: By EDDIE ALTERMAN

 BODY:
HYBRID versions of the Chrysler Aspen and Dodge Durango seem likely to secure a spot in automotive history: the two vehicles fell under the executioner's ax in the same month they went on sale.
 The hybrid S.U.V.'s became available at dealerships in early October. But on Oct. 23, Chrysler announced that at the end of the year it would close the Delaware plant where they are built. 
 Production of the hybrid models began on Aug. 22. Even if production continues until Dec. 31, the Aspen and Durango hybrids are almost certainly the shortest-lived new models from a major manufacturer in modern times. 
 One of the shortest previous model runs was for the Lincoln Blackwood, a luxury pickup that failed to excite buyers in 2001-2.
 A Chrysler spokesman, Ed Saenz, said last week that 400 of the hybrid S.U.V.'s had already been built; this suggests that total production may not exceed 800.
 The Durango and Aspen hybrids, which are 2009 models, use the two-mode gas-electric powertrain that was jointly developed by General Motors, BMW and DaimlerChrysler. 
 G.M. was first to market with the technology and is now offering two-mode versions of the Chevy Tahoe, GMC Yukon and Cadillac Escalade; it also plans two-mode versions of the Saturn Vue crossover and full-size pickups. 
 Since Daimler and Chrysler have split, both parts have claimed the technology; Mercedes-Benz plans a two-mode S.U.V. called the ML450 BlueHybrid to go on sale in fall 2009.
 The two-mode system packaged a suite of fuel-efficient technologies in one powertrain. Along with engine cylinders that shut down when not needed, there are two motor-generators in the transmission that provide electric propulsion when electronic sensors see fit.
 Chrysler has been building its two-mode S.U.V.'s alongside other Aspens and Durangos at a plant in Newark, Del., which had been scheduled to close at the end of 2009. But a collapse of consumer demand pushed Chrysler to close the factory roughly a year ahead of schedule.
 The models are not built anywhere else, so the Newark plant's closing effectively means the end of the line for the Aspen and Durango, including the hybrid versions.
 Chrysler will not disclose how much it spent to produce the two-mode models, although Mr. Saenz said, ''The investment was minimized.'' 
 Asked why the company built the hybrids in a plant set to close, and brought them to market only to pronounce them virtually dead on arrival, Mr. Saenz responded: ''Why not build them there, if we've got these large vehicles and they're going to get better fuel economy by adding a hybrid?'' 
 He added, ''There have been significant market changes from the time we started to put hybrids in these vehicles until the time we decided to close the plant early.''
 The hybrid Aspen and Durango aimed to resolve buyers' needs for large multipassenger vehicles with consumer demands for better fuel economy. They did that, but although they are rated at 20 m.p.h. in city driving they could not withstand the collapse of the credit markets, the volatility of fuel prices and the social stigma, for some, of driving any large S.U.V. at a time of looming economic austerity. 
 Chrysler intends to use the hybrid system in the 2010 Dodge Ram full-size pickup. Two of the three plants that build the Ram -- St. Louis North in Missouri and Warren Assembly in Michigan -- were recently upgraded at a cost of $200 million each.

HEADLINE: Shows, and Renovation, Go On at Film Palace

BYLINE: By HELENE STAPINSKI

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY 

 BODY:
 IT was a miserable night, but the line at the Loew's theater snaked around the corner, just as it used to in the old days. Umbrellas blew inside out as scores of people patiently waited beneath the brightly lit marquee in Journal Square. 
 Once past the antique bronze doors, heads went back and eyes popped to take in the Grand Lobby, which resembles the inside of a Faberge egg. There is dripping gold leaf, faux-marble Corinthian columns, swirling balconies, red velvet draperies and a Czechoslovakian crystal chandelier hung back in 1929, just a month before the stock market's Great Crash.
 ''This place was made in a time of rich robber barons for people who couldn't be rich robber barons,'' said Marie Lyons, 29, a New Yorker who said she was ''dragged'' to Journal Square by friends from Jersey City two years ago. Ms. Lyons has since revisited the Loew's for a rock concert and a classic film, but each time she enters, she is still taken aback. 
 ''It's like: 'Oh my God. How does this place even exist?' '' she said. 
 Amid fears that another depression could be looming, the Landmark Loew's Jersey Theater is enjoying its long-awaited, hard-earned renaissance. On that rainy October night, the silent film ''Phantom of the Opera,'' with live accompaniment from the newly restored Wonder Morton Organ (which rises, falls and turns on a lift on the stage) drew 860 people -- a record for the Loew's revival house program. 
 ''The Loew's is really hitting its stride,'' said Steve Lipski, the Journal Square ward's representative on the City Council, who stood on line in the rain. ''There's something magical and mystical about the theater that attracts people to come from Connecticut, Pennsylvania and New York.''
 The story of the theater has been long and suspenseful, with a cast of hundreds of volunteers who have put the Loew's back together, inch by inch. There have been villains and last-minute plot developments, but through it all, the theater has endured.
 ''Just look over there,'' said Vincent K. Guagenti, 42, a horror and science fiction film professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University. He points to a billowing curtain. ''The place is breathing.''
 Designed by the architects George and C. W. Rapp to showcase the new ''talkies,'' the movie palace was created as one of five Loew's Wonder Theaters. (The theaters in Queens and Harlem are now churches, one in Brooklyn is empty, and another in the Bronx has been the site of a few concerts and boxing matches.) Its first show was ''Madame X,'' directed by Lionel Barrymore, and included a stage performance by Ben Black and his Rhythm Kings and the Loew's Symphony Orchestra. All for 35 cents.
 Local legend has it that Frank Sinatra came from Hoboken to see Bing Crosby perform live here -- and on that night decided to become a crooner himself.
 The Loew's enjoyed a long and successful run. But with the growing popularity of television, and a declining population in Jersey City, the audience started to fall off in the 1960s. By 1974, the theater was divided into a triplex, with cheap wallboard cutting the coffered auditorium ceiling in two. But the lobby retained its old glamour, fueling the movie fantasies of a whole new generation.
 ''I can't tell you how many times I snuck in here as a kid,'' said Matt Barrett, 51, one of two firemen on duty at a recent showing. Because the theater is not yet up to code, fire marshals must be present at each performance.
 In 1986, the Loew's showed its last first-run film (ominously, ''Friday the 13th Part VI'') and sold the building to the developer and pet-supply giant Hartz Mountain Industries, which planned to demolish the theater and replace it with a $10 million office tower.
 Within a year, crowds of Jersey City residents began packing City Council and Planning Board meetings, calling for the city to save the Loew's. Colin Egan, 45, and Pattie Giordan, 56, who now run the theater, were among hundreds of people crowded into City Hall.
 ''I think the key thing was that the theater hadn't been closed long enough for people to forget about it,'' Mr. Egan said. He and Ms. Giordan helped gather 10,000 petition signatures and formed a nonprofit preservation group called Friends of the Loew's.
 Faced with growing opposition and the bottom falling out of the real estate market, Hartz sold the theater to the city for $325,000 in 1993. 
 But the battle was just beginning.
 After more hearings and negotiations, the city leased the theater to the nonprofit Jersey City Economic Development Corporation. Under the direction of Mr. Egan, who was paid by the corporation, Friends of the Loew's secured $2.5 million in financing and enlisted hundreds of volunteers.
 Over the next decade, they repaired the 35-foot-deep stage, the terra cotta facade, the chandelier, the boiler, 1,500 orchestra seats, the lobby's columns and the marquee. They knocked down triplex walls and chased pigeons from the projection booth, scrubbing guano from every surface. Then they rehabilitated the orchestra pit with WD-40 and spray paint (the cost to fix it had been estimated at $250,000, Mr. Egan said, but they spent only $37). Each volunteer had his or her specialty: bookkeeping, machine repair, construction, fixing the organ.
 Despite concerns that the project was too big for a nonprofit group, the city signed a 15-year lease in 2004 with Friends of the Loew's, promising nearly $3 million in Urban Enterprise Zone financing. All seemed well. Then two years ago, Jersey City declared the lease illegal and cut Mr. Egan's salary altogether.
 Mayor Jerramiah T. Healy said that he would like the theater to be the center of a neighborhood improvement plan and that he would like to see more professional management and regular programming. 
 ''Colin and Pattie are hard working and dedicated,'' Mr. Healy said. ''But I don't see them bringing in the level of entertainment we'll need to make the theater self-sustaining.''
 Mr. Egan said that the Friends of the Loew's had proven its management ability and that he was eager to move to the next level, but without the support the city promised in its lease, he could do only so much.
 Despite the volunteer group's hard work, the theater still lacks some essentials, including sprinklers, smoke alarms and fire escapes. Without them, the balcony cannot be reopened and more ambitious programming cannot be scheduled.
 On weekends that the theater is not booked, the volunteers continue the renovation work, refurbishing by hand each original seat cushion and armrest from the 1,800-seat balcony. Once the theater's 70-millimeter projectors are repaired -- in time, it is hoped, for the theater's 80th anniversary next year -- they plan to show films like the epic ''Lawrence of Arabia,'' which will fill the entire 50- by 25-foot screen.
 ''You do it out of love,'' said Scott Franklin, 51, a computer systems administrator who is a volunteer projectionist. '' 'Cause the money ain't great.''

HEADLINE: What Is Art For?

BYLINE: By DANIEL B. SMITH. 
Daniel B. Smith is the author of ''Muses, Madmen, and Prophets: Hearing Voices and the Borders of Sanity,'' from which his last article for the magazine was adapted.

 BODY:
Last April I asked the writer Lewis Hyde if he would take a trip with me to Walden Pond, in Concord, Mass. At 63, Hyde has boyishly tousled brown-gray hair, freckled, soft-looking cheeks and the slightly abstracted gaze of a man who spends a disproportionate amount of his time in library carrels. He has an ironic streak, but his default mode is a kind of easygoing acquiescence, and so one slate gray Saturday afternoon he picked me up in Cambridge, where he lives and works half the year, and drove us the 12 miles west to Walden.
Hyde knows the area well -- among his ongoing projects is a detailed series of annotations of Henry David Thoreau's essays -- and he led me down a dirt path from the parking lot to the site of the cabin where, more than 150 years ago, Thoreau wrote his celebrated paean to solitude and self-reliance. The cabin no longer exists. In its place there is a lightly excavated, cordoned-off square of soil and, to its side, a waist-high cairn erected in commemoration by generations of pilgrims. 
Our own visit wasn't commemorative, but it was a pilgrimage of a sort. Hyde has been writing and publishing for more than three decades, and he has received numerous high-profile awards, including a MacArthur ''genius grant'' in 1991, but his name is still obscure to most readers. His body of work is slim; he has published two books, a volume of poems and a smattering of essays, translations and edited anthologies. His reputation, however, is rich. David Foster Wallace called him ''one of our true superstars of nonfiction.'' Hyde's fans -- among them Zadie Smith, Michael Chabon and Jonathan Lethem -- routinely use words like ''transformative'' and ''life-altering'' to describe his books, which they've been known to pass hand to hand like spiritual texts or samizdat manifestoes. The source of much of this reverence is Hyde's first book, ''The Gift'' (1983), which has never been out of print (it was recently rereleased by Vintage in a 25th-anniversary edition) and which tries to reconcile the value of doing creative work with the exigencies of a market economy.
Hyde began his career as a poet in the naturalistic vein of Gary Snyder or Mary Oliver, but over the years he has transformed himself into an accomplished scholar. ''The Gift,'' the core argument of which depends on establishing an analogy between the making of art and how objects accrue value in traditional ''gift economies,'' has been praised as the most subtle, influential study of reciprocity since the French anthropologist Marcel Mauss's 1924 essay of the same name. His second book, ''Trickster Makes This World'' (1998), a cross-cultural study of the mischievous, mythological trickster figure (examples from the 20th century include Duchamp, Picasso and Ginsberg), weaves together literary strands from West Africa, India and China and concludes with a new translation of the ''Homeric Hymn to Hermes,'' for which Hyde spent months working one on one with a tutor in ancient Greek. Jonathan Lethem told me that when he first read ''The Gift,'' he pictured its author as a kind of inapproachable seer, either long dead or soaring so high in the intellectual stratosphere as to be unreachable. ''It'd be like reading a book by Nietzsche or Freud when they were alive and thinking, Oh, I gotta send this guy a note!''
Hyde's admirers often point out with awe (and his reviewers with frustration) that his books are all but impossible to summarize. Hyde doesn't object to this assessment. He wrote ''The Gift'' because he could find no place where his own motivations for writing poetry were well articulated, but articulating them required a poet's suggestiveness. ''One thing I've always liked to read is the kind of literature you find in Jung and Freud, which combines personal anecdote, philosophy, mythology, dreams,'' he told me in his Cambridge office last May. ''I like the way it jumps from one discursive realm to another.'' His books exhibit this lively heterogeneity to an at-times dizzying extent; in the course of 12 pages in ''The Gift,'' Hyde hops from a discussion of a Pali Buddhist parable to Marx's ''Capital'' to the Ford Pinto and then moves quickly on, in the next 3 pages, to Christmas, country-western music and the psychological fates of Vietnamese refugees in Southern California.
In the late 1990s, Hyde began extending his lifelong project of examining ''the public life of the imagination'' into what had become newly topical territory: the ''cultural commons.'' The advent of Internet file-sharing services like Napster and Gnutella sparked urgent debates over how to strike a balance between public and private claims to creative work. For more than a decade, the so-called Copy Left -- a diverse group of lawyers, activists, artists and intellectuals -- has argued that new digital technologies are responsible for an unprecedented wave of innovation and that excessive legal restrictions should not be placed on, say, music remixes, image mashups or ''read-write'' sites like Wikipedia, where users create their own content. The Copy Left, or the ''free culture movement,'' as it is sometimes known, has articulated this position in part by drawing on the tradition of the medieval agricultural commons, the collective right of villagers, vassals and serfs --''commoners'' -- to make use of a plot of land. This analogy is also central to Hyde's book in progress, which looks closely at how the tradition of the commons was transformed once it was brought from Europe to America.
For the Copy Left, as for Hyde, the last 20 years have witnessed a corporate ''land grab'' of information -- often in the guise of protecting the work of individual artists -- that has put a stranglehold on creativity, in increasingly bizarre ways. Over dinner not long ago, he told me about the legal fate of Emily Dickinson's poems. Dickinson died in 1886, but it was not until 1955 that an ''official'' volume of her collected works was published, by Harvard University Press. The length of copyright terms has expanded substantially in the last century, and Harvard holds the exclusive right to Dickinson's poems until 2050 -- more than 160 years after they were first written. When the poet Robert Pinsky asked Harvard for permission to include a Dickinson poem in an article that he was writing for Slate about poetic insults, it refused, even for a fee. ''Their feeling was that once the poem was online, they'd lose control of it,'' Hyde told me.
In highlighting the absurd ways in which intellectual copyright has overreached, Hyde brings to mind such iconic Copy Left figures as Lawrence Lessig, a constitutional-law scholar at Stanford. Yet Hyde's new book, which he allowed me to read in draft form (it is unfinished and untitled), addresses what he considers a more fundamental issue. We may believe there should be a limit on the market in cultural property, he argues, but that doesn't mean that we have ''a good public sense'' of where to set that limit. Hyde's book is, at its core, an attempt to help formulate that sense.
If this sounds like a heady goal, it is. But it is also eminently practical, and eminently American. For Hyde, redressing the balance between private (corporate, individual) and common (public) interests depends not just on effective policy but also on recovering the idea of the cultural commons as a deeply American concept. To that end, he excavates a history of the American imagination in which the emphasis is not on the lone genius (Thoreau scribbling hermetically in the Massachusetts woods) but on the anonymous pamphleteer, the inventor eager to share his discoveries. In an essay that offers a preview of his book (posted, fittingly, on his Web site), Hyde posits that the history of the commons and of the creative self are, in fact, twin histories. ''The citizen called into being by a republic of freehold farms,'' he writes, ''is close cousin to the writer who built himself that cabin at Walden Pond. But along with such mainstream icons goes a shadow tradition, the one that made Jefferson skeptical of patents, the one that made even Thoreau argue late in life that every 'town should have a primitive forest , where a stick should never be cut for fuel, a common possession forever,' the one that led the framers of the Constitution to balance 'exclusive right' with 'limited times.' It is a tradition worth recovering.''
For nearly 10 years, Hyde has devoted himself to that task.
Hyde's Cambridge office is located in the back of a converted carriage house near Porter Square, in the residential heart of the town. The space was offered to him rent-free by an architect who had seen him speak about ''The Gift'' and who liked the idea of sponsoring a ''poet in residence'' at her firm. Hyde's office is bright and inviting, with meticulous piles of papers covering the surfaces, books on American intellectual and legal history stacked on the shelves and, tacked to a far wall, photocopies of several abstract drawings by the artist Max Gimblett -- part of a collaborative project to reproduce an ancient parable of Buddhist enlightenment.
The countercultural air these illustrations give off goes hand in hand with Hyde's reputation. He has often been criticized for a sort of hippie anti-corporatism. Not surprisingly, he has also been praised for the same thing: in recent years, ''The Gift'' has been adopted as something like the theory bible of the Burning Man festival. Yet the association hardly matches the style of his mind, which is sharp and skeptical and far from starry-eyed. Years ago, when Hyde's hippie friends fled the city to ''live off the land,'' he would make sport of their idealism. ''Smelting your own iron yet?'' he would ask. ''Distilling that kerosene?'' He prefers to think of himself in an aesthetic light rather than a political one, as a writer who is upholding the tradition of the ''poet-essayists who never stop being poets'': Czeslaw Milosz, William Carlos Williams, D. H. Lawrence, Emerson, Thoreau.
Hyde's link with this tradition is temperamental as well as literary. In many ways, his life embodies the diversity of experiences and exchanges he is at such pains to value in his nonfiction. Although he is currently a fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society and a tenured professor of creative writing at Kenyon College in Ohio, his self-identification remains that of a ''scholar without institution'' -- a writer and thinker working outside the public and academic arenas.
As wide-ranging as Hyde's intellectual flights have been, they haven't carried him far from his origins. His Cambridge office is located six blocks from where he was born, in 1945, to a father studying for a Ph.D. in optical physics and a mother with a master's in psychology. The atmosphere was intellectual, but in a way that Hyde now sees as narrow. ''I was raised in a family where science was the real thing,'' he says. ''Science was the thing you did.''
As a teenager, Hyde thought he might become a geologist. By the time he was through with his studies, he had made poetry his vocation. He attended the University of Minnesota in the early '60s, benefiting enormously from the various figures he encountered there: John Berryman, who taught poetry at the university and became a model of impassioned devotion to literature; Robert Bly, whom he met on a bus to an antiwar demonstration in D.C. and who encouraged him to try his hand at translation; Garrison Keillor, then the editor of the campus literary magazine, who was the first person to take Hyde's poetic efforts seriously and who published Hyde's earliest nonfiction. He spent a few years in a graduate program in comparative literature at the University of Iowa and then, bored by academia, quit and moved to western Minnesota to write.
It was in its way as much a move to the literary wilderness as was Thoreau's move to Walden. To make ends meet, Hyde worked as a carpenter and bluffed his way into a job as an electrician at a mobile-home factory. He eventually headed East, following a girlfriend -- and was unceremoniously dumped while standing at a pay phone in West Virginia. Unmoored in Boston, armed with only a youthful bravado and an essay he wrote about schizophrenia titled ''The Tuber Mind,'' Hyde presented himself at the psychiatric ward at Cambridge City Hospital and announced, ''I'm here to be your poet in residence!'' He was hired as the night guy on the drunk ward.
Strangely, the job marked the beginning of Hyde's lifelong study of the roots of the creative imagination, and of his literary ascent. At the time, Berryman was writing and publishing his landmark ''Dream Songs.'' In the anguished, self-pitying tone of the poems, Hyde heard an echo of the tales spun by the residents on the ward, and he wrote a long essay drawing the parallel. ''Alcohol and Poetry: John Berryman and the Booze Talking,'' published in 1975, was widely anthologized and widely debated. More important, it won Hyde a $7,500 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, which he lived on for a year and a half as he haunted libraries, tramped around and tried to figure out what he wanted to do next, and how. ''I worked on how I work'' is how he puts it.
At the time, Hyde's passion for poetry was quickly being matched by a passion for cultural anthropology, particularly the writings of Ivan Illich, an Austrian priest-cum-social-critic who drew wide public attention for his book ''Deschooling Society'' (1971) -- a polemic against modern public education. Hyde traveled to Cuernavaca, where Illich ran a language center and salon for Western missionaries heading to Latin America. It was Illich who lent Hyde a book of anthropology that contained a chapter about Marcel Mauss's essay on gift exchange. Hyde's intellectual course for the next several years was set.
The work captivated Hyde. ''There was language in this which seemed to me metaphorically related to creativity,'' he told me. Mauss was a scholar of the old polymathic sort -- a sociologist, a linguist, a historian of religion, a Sanskrit expert, a philosopher. His essay on gift exchange drew on the work of the seminal turn-of-the-century ethnographers Franz Boas and Bronislaw Malinowski to explore aboriginal societies in which the person of consequence -- the man or woman who is deemed worthy of adulation, respect and emulation -- is not the one who accumulates the most goods but the one who disperses them. Gift economies, as Mauss defines them, are marked by circulation and connectivity: goods have value only insofar as they are treated as gifts, and gifts can remain gifts only if they are continually given away. This results in a kind of engine of community cohesion, in which objects create social, psychological, emotional and spiritual bonds as they pass from hand to hand.
The ideas resonated deeply with Hyde. For nearly a decade he had been struggling to explain -- to his family, to nonartist friends, to himself -- why he devoted so much of his time and energy to something as nonremunerative as poetry. The literature on gift exchange -- tales, for example, of South Sea tribesman circulating shells and necklaces in a slow-moving, broad circle around the Trobriand Islands -- gave him the conceptual tool he needed to understand his predicament, which was, he came to believe, the predicament of all artists living ''in an age whose values are market values and whose commerce consists almost exclusively in the purchase and sale of commodities.'' For centuries people have been speaking of talent and inspiration as gifts; Hyde's basic argument was that this language must extend to the products of talent and inspiration too. Unlike a commodity, whose value begins to decline the moment it changes hands, an artwork gains in value from the act of being circulated--published, shown, written about, passed from generation to generation -- from being, at its core, an offering.
Hyde worked on ''The Gift'' for seven years, barely scraping by, spending long months hunting through obscure folk tales for narratives that reflected what he came to call ''the commerce of the creative spirit.'' When the book was finally published, the critic Martha Bayles castigated it in The New York Times for naively ''esp[ying] a noble savage in every struggling artist'' -- a critique that was echoed elsewhere. Yet the artistic community immediately embraced Hyde's work. A bevy of poets, including Robert Pinsky, Donald Hall and Gary Snyder, published a group letter in The Times responding to Bayles's review and praising Hyde's ''search to regain the unity of economic, aesthetic, social and religious life.'' Bill Viola, the pioneering video artist, remembers New York artists in the 1980s excitedly exchanging dog-eared, marked-up copies. ''In a society that mostly talks about money,'' says Margaret Atwood, who keeps a half-dozen copies of ''The Gift'' on hand at all times to distribute to artists she thinks will benefit from it, ''Lewis carved out a little island where you can say, 'Life doesn't always work that way.' ''
Since the mid-1980s, when his work began to gain in popularity, Hyde has often been invited to speak publicly about creativity and gift exchange. Invariably, the discussions following his lectures have wound their way to a practical question: If creative work doesn't necessarily have any market value, how is the artist to survive?
In the course of writing ''The Gift,'' Hyde underwent an intellectual transformation on this subject. He began the work believing there was ''an irreconcilable conflict'' between gift exchange and the market; the enduring (if not necessarily the happy) artist was the one who most successfully fended off commercial demands. By the time he was finished, Hyde had come to a less-dogmatic conclusion. It was still true, he believed, that the marketplace could destroy an artist's gift, but it was equally true that the marketplace wasn't going anywhere; it had always existed, and it always would. The key was to find a good way to reconcile the two economies.
Following this line of thinking, Hyde grew enamored of a bill introduced in 1994 by the Democratic senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut. The ''Arts Endowing the Arts Act'' was an unusual piece of legislation. It proposed auctioning off 20 additional years of copyright protection for creative works and using the proceeds to build a permanent endowment for the arts and humanities. In essence, Dodd wanted to create a gift economy.
The bill failed to gain any traction. The entertainment industry, led by Disney, which faced the imminent expiration of its massively lucrative copyrights on Mickey Mouse, Pluto and Donald Duck, lobbied for the expansion of copyright terms without restriction. In 1998, the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act passed, adding 20 years to the length of copyright, both pro- and retroactively, and ensuring that thousands of creative works poised to enter the public domain remained in private hands.
As we sat in Hyde's office on a warm day last spring, he talked passionately about why the C.T.E.A. was not only unfortunate but also unconstitutional. For Hyde, as for many legal and political scholars, the C.T.E.A. (the ''Mickey Mouse Protection Act'' to its detractors) represents a blatant abrogation of the purpose of intellectual-property law. As he sets out to show in his book, copyright was enshrined in the Constitution for civic rather than commercial purposes. For the founders, intellectual property was a great privilege; copyrights and patents were primarily meant to serve, in Madison's words, as ''encouragements to literary works and ingen/ious discoveries.'' By extending copyright retroactively, Hyde told me, the C.T.E.A. negated the logic of incentive: Mickey Mouse can't be invented twice.
Hyde is not a free-culture purist; he holds copyrights on his books, and those copyrights contribute to his income. But the passing of the C.T.E.A. convinced him, as it did many observers, of what Hyde calls a looming ''market triumphalism.'' ''I see in the paper that there is now a Congressional proposal to have a White House level 'IP Czar,' '' he wrote in an e-mail message to me in May. ''Daily this stuff ticks me off!''
The C.T.E.A. spurred Hyde to action. He wrote letters to every member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He published an op-ed, the first of his career. In 1999, with the writer Brendan Gill and Archibald Gillies, then the director of the Andy Warhol Foundation, he started the Creative Capital Foundation, a nonprofit that offers financial support to artists in return for a small percentage of any net profits generated by their work, which the foundation uses to finance other projects. He helped organize a low-fee writers' room in Boston. And in 2004, he became a fellow at Berkman.
For all his activism, however, Hyde maintains that little of true political worth will be accomplished until the very terms of the ''intellectual property'' debate are changed. This was brought home to me one rainy evening last April, when Hyde and I met at a Harvard auditorium to attend a lecture on corruption in Congress by Lawrence Lessig. For a decade, Lessig has been the most-visible exponent of the position that institutions like Berkman were founded to promote: that the Internet should serve as a virtual communal space. In 2002, Lessig helped found Creative Commons, an organization that carves a middle path between the near-absolute stringency of intellectual-property law and absolute generosity by allowing creators to specify the level of control they want to maintain over their work.
After the lecture, as we walked across the darkened campus, I mentioned to Hyde that I had found Lessig's talk to be logical and well crafted.
''A little too well crafted, if you ask me,'' Hyde said.
This took me by surprise -- Hyde is a polite man who rarely speaks critically of others -- and I later asked him to elaborate. ''Look, Lessig is a lawyer,'' he said. ''I like him, I think he's solid. But it's a very particular way of thinking.'' Hyde himself makes use of the Creative Commons, yet there's a formality to the setup that troubles him. ''All of the C.C. licenses use the lever of the law,'' he said. ''They have the assumption of private ownership behind them. So Lessig, in a certain sense, is confining himself to one slice of this stuff, which is not as capacious as a true commons would be.''
''Capaciousness'' is the keynote of Hyde's own approach to the commons and suggests why he might feel a little out of place at a Harvard think tank. To date, the most prominent thinkers to adapt the idea of the commons to contemporary issues have been lawyers -- most notably, Lessig and a current Berkman co-director, Yochai Benkler -- and, being lawyers, they have an instinct to draw sharp distinctions that lead to policy solutions. Thus Lessig is careful to distinguish between ''rivalrous'' resources, like drinking water, in which one person's use by definition competes with another's, and ''nonrivalrous'' resources, like the English language, which cannot be depleted no matter how many people make use of them.
Hyde is interested in this distinction, too. ''Shakespeare's plays,'' he writes, ''will never collapse, no matter how many people read them -- and such commons therefore serve as a kind of limiting case for the argument that the market will serve us well in every sphere of life.'' Yet he is more interested in ''fleshing out'' (a pet phrase) how the commons can embody cherished values -- indeed, cherished American values -- that private property cannot. As Hyde sets out to show, the contemporary impulse to think of culture as ''intellectual property'' contains far more of ''property'' than the founders intended.
Thinker-politicians like Jefferson, Adams and Madison were just as familiar as we are with the metaphor that likens created work to physical property, especially to a landed estate. But they thought of that landed estate in a new way -- as the basis of a republic. An American's land was his own -- he owed allegiance to no sovereign -- but his ownership imposed on him an almost sacred moral requirement to contribute to the public good. According to Hyde, this ethic of ''civic republicanism'' was the ideological engine that drove the founders' conception of intellectual property, and to his mind, it undercuts the ethic of ''commercial republicanism'' that dominates our current conception of it. Our right to property is not absolute; our possessions are held in trust, as it were. Seen through the prism of early civic Republicanism, Hyde asks, what might the creative self look like? Do we imagine that self as ''solitary and self-made''? Or as ''collective, common and interdependent''?
There's a line of Emerson's from 'Self-Reliance,' '' Hyde told me one day in his office, ''where he says of Benjamin Franklin: 'Where is the master who could have instructed Franklin? Every great man is a unique.' Well, it's crazy! There's a long list of masters who taught Franklin! And yet the Emersonian song is the one that sticks in everyone's head.''
Suffice it to say that Hyde goes to heroic lengths to unstick it -- and with a striking directness. A full 60 pages of his new manuscript are devoted to debunking the Emersonian view of Franklin as ''America's first self-made man'' and replacing it with a portrait of Franklin as a ''commoner,'' a man whose defining talent was for absorbing, repurposing and synthesizing the culture around him, like some colonial M.C. The law of conservation of charge, the eponymous stove, the precise path of the Gulf Stream: Hyde shoves aside each of Franklin's ''discoveries'' to uncover thick foundations of pre-existing knowledge and scientific collaboration. The point of all this is not to prove that Franklin wasn't a genius but to show that his genius didn't burst out of thin air. ''It takes a capacious mind to play host to others and to find new ways to combine what they have to offer,'' Hyde writes, ''but not a mind for whom there are no masters, not a 'unique.' Quite the opposite -- this is a mind willing to be taught, willing to be inhabited, willing to labor in the cultural commons.''
In Franklin, Hyde has found a subject to give canonical voice to his own beliefs. Despite Franklin's notorious talents of self-promotion, he was explicit that his inventions were not and should not be his to claim as property. Offered an exclusive patent on the Franklin stove, he refused on the grounds that the invention was based on previous innovations -- specifically, on theories of heat and matter articulated by Isaac Newton and the Dutch physician Hermann Boerhaave. ''That as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others,'' Franklin wrote in his ''Autobiography,'' ''we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours, and this we should do freely and generously.''
Of course, you might say, this was an easy position for Franklin to take: he was rich. People need their copyrights to live. But that's exactly Hyde's point: copyrights are utilitarian things. They generate money to pay a mortgage and buy groceries and continue working. Extended too far beyond their practical usefulness, copyrights not only contradict their original intent; they also wall creators off from the sources of their inventiveness. Genius, Hyde believes, needs to ''tinker in a collective shop.''
''I've thought of doing a version of Emerson in which you simply take every sentence of 'Self-Reliance' and flip it,'' Hyde says. ''So like at the beginning he says, 'Yesterday I read in a book somebody stating very well an idea I had myself, and I felt ashamed that I hadn't expressed it myself.' Well, you could say, 'Yesterday I read in a book somebody stating very well an idea I had myself, and I felt glad that I was not alone, and that my ideas were not my ideas.' You know, where is the master who could teach Emerson?''
There happens to be an answer to this question -- many answers, in fact. As Emerson himself acknowledged, his intellectual life was chaotic with debts, influences and fellow travelers. And the greatest influence of all was an influence that looms large in Hyde's own work as well, and whose quietly unsettling, deeply informed prose bears a more-than-passing resemblance to his own: Thoreau. Hyde still isn't sure if Thoreau will make an appearance in his commons book, but it's possible. In 1998, he published an essay in which he took the same approach to Thoreau as he does to Franklin, showing that for all his vaunted individualism, Thoreau could not have produced his work without the rich community and communal institutions surrounding him in Concord. It was the first expression of the thesis that would grow into the heart of Hyde's new project, and it was the first piece of the project that I read.
It was also the impetus for our trip to Walden, and to the site of Thoreau's cabin. Although, as Hyde's essay strives to make clear, it wasn't really Thoreau's cabin at all but Emerson's. The older man owned the land and acquired the structure after his protege vacated. He offered the land in the first place because he believed -- rightly as it turned out -- that with a little space and solitude, Thoreau could do great work. He had already employed Thoreau as a handyman and tutor and given him access to his circle of illustrious friends and his unrivaled library. In other words, ''Walden,'' the premier document of American individualism, was in a sense born out of the generosity of the American prophet of self-reliance.
I had hoped to talk about these issues as Hyde and I walked alongside the pale water to Thoreau's cabin, but the path was too narrow for us to chat comfortably, and we made our pilgrimage mainly in silence. The next day, however, things got a little more capacious, as it were. Hyde invited me to have brunch with him and his wife at his house in Cambridge. It is a beautiful, bright house, in whose back garden stands the trellis-covered studio -- a former turkey pen -- where Hyde was a tenant when he wrote ''The Gift.'' Afterward, as we sat around his dining-room table, Hyde got up, pulled a CD by the Canadian singer-songwriter Bruce Cockburn off a shelf and handed it to me. The album contained a song called ''The Gift.'' ''I'll leave you with this ringing in your ears,'' he said, and pressed play on his stereo. The melody was jaunty, and the lyrics were unambiguously based on Hyde's masterpiece:
In this cold commodity culture
Where you lay your money down
It's hard to even notice
That all this earth is hallowed ground
The gift keeps moving
Never know where it's going to land
You must stand back and let it
Keep on changing hands.
As Cockburn strummed and sang, I read through the liner notes and noticed that Hyde was credited as an inspiration alongside E. E. Cummings and, wryly, the manager of the Chernobyl nuclear-power plant. I mentioned this to Hyde. He grinned, opened his hands and gave a curt bow. ''All illustrious company to be in,'' he said.

DATELINE: SAYVILLE 

 BODY:
 LIFE'S demands have so far kept college and a career out of reach for Monica Juarez. She is 19 and a single mother of two. She works two jobs -- at a Waldbaum's supermarket in Hauppauge and a Teachers Federal Credit Union in Amityville -- and shares a one-room apartment in Central Islip with her boys, Alexavier, 2, and Geremiah, 3 months.
 That hasn't kept her from yearning for something better. ''It's too hard,'' she said last month, standing outside a community college classroom in Sayville. ''I need a bigger place for my kids. Everything is for my kids.'' 
 What brought her to the Sayville Downtown Center, a branch of Suffolk County Community College, is not the usual quest for an associate's degree. 
 Instead, Ms. Juarez has spent most weekday evenings since mid-September with eight other students as they hustle through the college's Pharmacy Technician/Pharmacy Technician Assistant Program. That eight-month, noncredit course will prepare them for a national certification exam. If they pass, they can make $11 to $25 an hour as a retail or hospital pharmacy assistant. 
 It is one of the fastest-growing occupations in the country, according to the Department of Labor, and Ms. Juarez has decided it is her path to a solid future. ''Everyone's going to need medical care, right?'' she said.
 Students across the region, and the country, are swelling the rolls of community colleges, seeking a two-year associate's degree as a bridge to a four-year university or as a way to retrain after a job loss. But in these shaky economic times, more students are skipping a degree and heading straight for the colleges' noncredit training and certification programs -- courses that end in months or weeks, designed to propel them swiftly into the job market. 
 Once viewed more as a way to learn flower-arranging or how to work your new computer, noncredit programs have been steadily shifting their focus to the workplace. First-time students use them as a jumping-off point for a career or an entree to higher education (some noncredit courses can be used toward a credit degree). Some take skill-boosting classes to help insulate themselves from a layoff or to chart a new career path.
 The courses are generally listed under the heading of Continuing Education or Lifelong Learning and are sometimes created in cooperation with local industry, labor departments and unions. (Local 338 of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union is paying for Ms. Juarez's program.) 
 Although the classes meet in college buildings and are administered by the college, the teachers are paid through the noncredit class tuition and the programs are not subject to the same lengthy state accreditation process required for degree programs. As a result, courses can sometimes be set up in weeks.
 ''Continuing education has changed,'' said Andrea Morville, assistant dean of Continuing Education at Westchester Community College. She said career programs had gone from about 25 percent to 40 percent of the classes in her division in the last 10 years. 
 Other administrators put their numbers even higher. In Connecticut, about 50 percent of noncredit courses are aimed at job training, said Mary Anne Cox, assistant chancellor for the System of Connecticut Community Colleges. And in New Jersey, the number of registrations for noncredit professional training increased by 20,000 between 2005 and 2007, said Jacob C. Farbman, spokesman for the New Jersey Council of County Colleges.
 Lifestyle-enhancing courses are still popular, of course (Suffolk Community offers basket-weaving this fall), and predominate at some colleges. But at many others, the shift toward job training has broadened into a significant role in stocking the work force.
 Noncredit offerings increasingly read like a roster of where jobs are. Of the 30 occupations for which the Labor Department is predicting the largest national growth in the next eight years, 22 are in areas that do not require a college degree. Most are directly addressed by continuing education.
 Courses in health care, high-skills manufacturing, management, hospitality and culinary arts, and -- as always -- computers are booming, regionally and nationally. But so are many other continuing education programs tailored to the needs of the surrounding community. 
 ''Instead of designing those courses to get state aid, we design courses that will travel well in the workforce,'' said G. Jeremiah Ryan, president of Bergen Community College. 
 Program directors scan the job landscape like doctors seeking a pulse. A new industry requirement, a government regulation, a lifestyle trend or a product release, like the Microsoft Office 2007 program, can send droves of workers back to class. 
 ''I don't plug into my crystal ball and imagine what industry might be interested in, I ask them,'' said Lynn Lederer, director of professional community programs at Middlesex County College in New Jersey. ''I check with industry experts, census figures on demographics, watch the classes that have increased enrollment and maybe add a section of something similar.'' 
 A program on beginning an animal-based business was successful, for example, so she added a veterinary assistant program. Real estate licensing classes may be down, but enrollment spiked in a course on buying foreclosures, Ms. Lederer said. 
 At Westchester, ''green'' lifestyle classes are beginning to migrate to the workforce side, Ms. Morville said. Next spring her college will offer a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification program to builders and others seeking accreditation by the United States Green Building Council, she said.
 Costs vary depending on a course's length and intensity, but tuition for a noncredit program is far less than for an associate's degree. The seven-month Computerized Healthcare Billing and Coding Certificate Program at Bergen Community College in New Jersey, for example, runs $2,995, while a two-year degree program for a medical office assistant costs about $8,500.
 ''It takes much longer to get a degree, where with a noncredit course I can have them in the work force in 16 weeks making between $13 to $18 an hour,'' said David Chrzanowski, director of extended studies at Norwalk Community College in Connecticut.
 While classes are often aimed at entry-level access to the job market, students take them for all sorts of reasons.
 ''Some of them have bachelor's or master's but now they want to learn about information systems,'' said Jennifer Dudley, the continuing education director at Passaic County Community College in New Jersey. Enrollment is up for English as a Second Language study and in a citizenship training course she runs.
 At Essex County College, one of the Labor Department's One-Stop Career Centers is situated at the Newark campus to match the underemployed with noncredit programs, said Mitra Choudhury, director of Training Inc. at the college. Allied health courses are particularly popular, she said.
 Among the biggest areas of growth is customized training for businesses or government agencies, coordinated by the colleges and held on campus or at the business site. Connecticut's 12 community colleges provide such programs to about 600 businesses a year, said Ms. Cox, the assistant chancellor.
 Designed to help workers upgrade skills in a downsizing job market, company-subsidized classes can offer targeted training in areas like management, business writing and high-skill manufacturing. Programs can be started in as little as a few weeks, said James Polo, associate vice president of lifelong learning at Nassau Community College, which recently ran a medical coding program for employees of Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola. Work force training programs also help prepare workers for shudders in the local job market -- for example, when a large hotel breaks ground or a major employer moves out.
 When the Peter Paul plant closed in Naugatuck, Conn., last year, Naugatuck Valley Community College in Waterbury worked closely with the Northwest Regional Workforce Investment Board, a private, nonprofit organization constituted by the General Assembly that administers federal and state funds to dislocated workers for retraining. 
 And when Executive Greetings closed its New Hartford offices several years ago, ''we were able to take a host of those people and turn them into health care employees because they had computer graphic-type skills; you look at a CAT scan and it's a computer graphic,'' said Catherine Awwad, the board's executive director. ''Re-educated at the community college level.''

HEADLINE: Table's Bounty: Keeping It Local

BYLINE: By SUSAN M. NOVICK

 BODY:
WHILE the agricultural bounty of Long Island can provide a rich and varied menu, even committed locavores -- those trying to eat only food that has been produced within 100 miles -- bump up against some geographic limitations when it comes to creating a traditional Thanksgiving feast. 
 Sarah Lansdale, 34, of Huntington, the executive director of Sustainable Long Island, a nonprofit public policy group, is trying to cook local food for the holiday, but admits that some of the spices she will use don't fall into that category. So she abides by a ''Marco Polo exception'' that she discovered in a locavore pledge made by residents of Burlington, Vt., last summer. ''We use spices that are sustainably harvested from some other place,'' she said. She and her husband, Ron Rudaitis, 38, try their best to get the ingredients for the rest of the meal locally. 
 Proponents of the local pantry say that it strengthens the local economy by keeping money in the community, reduces the carbon footprint caused by trucking foodstuffs thousands of miles and encourages responsible land development by supporting local farms and farmers. 
 In four years of hosting a locavore Thanksgiving, Ms. Lansdale has found that planning the menu early helped her stick to her commitment. ''In the beginning it took some time and creativity to find local ingredients,'' she said. Now she supplements her share in the Green Thumb Farm C.S.A. (community supported agriculture group) in Water Mill with turkey, cider and pies from nearby family farms and asks the greengrocer in her neighborhood supermarket to identify the local seasonal products on its shelves. 
 Jeri Woodhouse, 65, who usually feeds a gathering of 16 to 18 people at her Orient home on Thanksgiving, takes a more relaxed approach. A cook and co-owner with Jayne McCahill of A Taste of the North Fork, she browses farm stands on the East End in search of inspiration for her condiment business and her holiday menu. ''For me it's fun to just go out and buy what looks good from the farm stands a day or two before Thanksgiving,'' she said. ''Most of the foods I cook really simply -- I just roast all the vegetables together.'' 
 Ms. Woodhouse tries to keep her Thanksgiving ingredients as local as possible, including a turkey raised by Art Ludlow, who also runs Mecox Bay Dairy in Bridgehampton, and a selection of wines from Long Island vineyards. There are some family traditions, however, that defy locavore limits. 
 ''We have a brandy Alexander in honor of my grandmother every year,'' she said, ''and none of that is local.''
 Many Long Islanders have used the locavore philosophy to inspire flexibility and freedom in creating their Thanksgiving menu. Brian Halweil, 33, and his wife, Sarah, 36, a nurse, have prepared a locavore Thanksgiving for six years since they moved from Washington to Sag Harbor. Mr. Halweil is the editor of Edible East End, Edible Brooklyn and Edible Manhattan, part of a network of magazines celebrating communities through food. 
 Instead of focusing on the turkey as the centerpiece of the meal, the Halweils often include a striped bass from Shinnecock Inlet, a duck from Iacono Farms in East Hampton and local oysters. And though one year Mr. Halweil foraged for wild cranberries in the dunes between Amagansett and Montauk, the Halweils get much of their produce from a series of farm stands on Sagg Main Street in Sagaponack, as well as from their garden.
 Patricia Wood, 57, of Port Washington, the executive director of Grassroots Environmental Education, a nonprofit group that runs the Port Washington Organic Farmers Market among its projects, has prepared Thanksgiving dinner using almost exclusively local ingredients for at least 20 years. Her sources include C.S.A.s and the products of her garden. 
 At November's end, Ms. Wood's pantry will typically include winter squash, brussels sprouts, potatoes, onions, carrots, beets, broccoli and rutabaga. A family favorite for the Thanksgiving table is raw kale salad, finely chopped with red pepper (harvested earlier in the season and frozen) and red onion. The dressing is maple syrup and olive oil (which is, of course, not local). For dessert, she bakes pumpkin custard sweetened with organic honey from her backyard beehive and topped with slivers of local persimmons hardy enough to survive a first Northeastern frost. 
 Although Ms. Wood has prepared several vegetarian Thanksgivings, she frequently accommodates friends and family with a turkey that has been raised within 100 miles. 
 With no cranberries available nearby, she makes a relish of currants (frozen from a June crop) and raspberries instead of the traditional condiment. 
 While hundreds of years ago, ''you got your food locally by default,'' Mr. Halweil said, ''now farmers have become more creative at extending the season and there's a much more creative mix of crops to choose from.''
 Though not indigenous to Long Island, the mesclun mix and bok choy that come out of the greenhouses at Sang Lee Farms in Peconic, for instance, are locally grown ingredients that can enrich a Thanksgiving table. 
 The locavore challenge ''isn't necessarily about changing your entire lifestyle overnight,'' Mr. Halweil said. ''Just have a goal of putting one local dish on the table.'' 
 Ms. Wood agreed: ''Any step in that direction can be worthwhile. You can actually taste it in the food.''

HEADLINE: SAVING BUFFALO'S UNTOLD BEAUTY

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

DATELINE: BUFFALO 

 BODY:
 ONE of the most cynical cliches in architecture is that poverty is good for preservation. The poor don't bulldoze historic neighborhoods to make way for fancy new high-rises. 
 That assumption came to mind when I stepped off a plane here recently. Buffalo is home to some of the greatest American architecture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with major architects like Henry Hobson Richardson, Frederick Law Olmsted, Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright building marvels here. Together they shaped one of the grandest early visions of the democratic American city. 
 Yet Buffalo is more commonly identified with the crumbling infrastructure, abandoned homes and dwindling jobs that have defined the Rust Belt for the past 50 years. And for decades its architecture has seemed strangely frozen in time. 
 Now the city is reaching a crossroads. Just as local preservationists are completing restorations on some of the city's most important landmarks, the federal government is considering a plan that could wipe out part of a historic neighborhood. Meanwhile Mayor Byron W. Brown is being pressed to revise a proposal that would have demolished hundreds of abandoned homes. 
 The outcome of these plans will go far in determining the city's prospects for economic recovery, but it could also offer a rare opportunity to re-examine the relationship between preserving the past and building a future.
 Buffalo was founded on a rich tradition of architectural experimentation. The architects who worked here were among the first to break with European traditions to create an aesthetic of their own, rooted in American ideals about individualism, commerce and social mobility. And today its grass-roots preservation movement is driven not by Disney-inspired developers but by a vibrant coalition of part-time preservationists, amateur historians and third-generation residents who have made reclaiming the city's history a deeply personal mission. 
 At a time when oil prices and oil dependence are forcing us to rethink the wisdom of suburban and exurban living, Buffalo could eventually offer a blueprint for repairing America's other shrinking postindustrial cities. 
 Touring Buffalo's monuments is about as close as you can get to experiencing firsthand the earliest struggles to define what an American architecture would look like. 
 The city's rise began in 1825 with the opening of the Erie Canal, which opened trade with the heartland. By the end of the 19th century the city's grain silos and steel mills had become architectural pilgrimage sites for European Modernists like Erich Mendelsohn and Bruno Taut, who saw them as the great cathedrals of Modernity. In their vast scale and technological efficiency, they reflected a triumphant America and sent a warning signal to Europe that it was fast becoming less relevant.
 Yet it is the parade of celebrated architects who worked here as much as the city's industrial achievements that makes Buffalo a living history lesson. Daniel Burnham's 1896 Ellicott Square Building, with its mighty Italian Renaissance facade, towers over the corner of Main and Church Streets. Just a block away is Louis Sullivan's 1895 Guarantee Building, a classic of early skyscraper design decorated in intricate floral terra-cotta tiles. 
 Across town, Henry Hobson Richardson built his largest commission: the 1870 Buffalo State Asylum for the Insane, composed of a pair of soaring Romanesque towers flanked by low brick pavilions. Light and air poured in through tall windows; spacious 18-foot-wide corridors were designed to promote interaction among the inmates, an idea that would be refined by Modernists in their communal housing projects decades later.
 But it was Wright who made the decisive leap from an architecture that drew mainly on European stylistic precedents to one that was rooted in a growing cultural self-confidence. Wright built two of those great pillars of American architecture here, the 1904 Larkin Building and the 1905 Darwin D. Martin House. 
 Although torn down in 1950, the Larkin Building, designed as the headquarters of the Larkin Soap Company, remains one of the most influential designs of the 20th century. Wright invented floor-to-ceiling glass doors, double-pane windows and toilets affixed to the walls for this monument to American business. Massive, forbidding brick piers anchoring the exterior signaled a break with classical historical styles. The light-filled atrium piercing its five floors, with managers visible at their desks at the bottom, turned the traditional office hierarchy on its head.
 The Martin House, a Prairie House complex of five buildings on a vast suburban lot, is the domestic counterpart to this vision. No European architect had come close to imagining such a fluid world. A composition of low brick structures, terraces, pergolas and gardens in which man and landscape were in tune, the design celebrated a democratic ideal of family life in which traditional social barriers, and the walls that reinforce them, were finally torn down. 
 Yet Wright's genius lay in his ability to accomplish this feat while conveying a profound serenity. The low roof and broad cantilevered eaves both beckoned to the horizon and provided shelter. The grid of wood beams in the living room, set just below ceiling level, visually broke down the space into discrete rooms while maintaining a sense of openness. Above all this architecture represented freedom both from Europe's suffocating traditions and from the feelings of cultural inferiority that had defined American architecture since the earliest days of the republic.
 This departure from recycled European precedents is reflected in the city's late-19th-century urban planning as well. Buffalo's original plan from the early 19th century was loosely based on Pierre Charles L'Enfant's 1791 plan for Washington, an Americanized version of Paris's system of radiating boulevards. Its civic core, dominated by a mountainous City Hall, reads as an isolated fragment of a City Beautiful plan that was never fully realized.
 Olmsted, as much social reformer as landscape architect, had visited John Paxson's Birkenhead Park near Liverpool, a pioneering project designed to better the lives of the city's working class. When he returned to New York, he expanded on that vision in his designs for Central and Prospect Parks, which he conceived as realms of psychological healing that could also break down class boundaries.
 In Buffalo he realized an even grander ambition, creating a vast network of parks and parkways that he hoped would have ''a civilizing effect'' on the ''dangerous classes'' populating the American city. Flanked by rows of elm trees, the parkways were broken up by a series of gorgeous landscaped roundabouts, slowing the city's rhythms of movement into something more majestic yet distinctly democratic. 
 It didn't last of course. By the 1950s Buffalo's economy had already embarked on its long path to disintegration. The completion in 1959 of the St. Lawrence Seaway, which created a more direct route to the Atlantic Ocean, made the Erie Canal obsolete and deprived the city of its commercial lifeline. Economic decline was exacerbated by race riots in 1967 and white flight to the suburbs. By the mid-1970s the inner city was being abandoned.
 Even so, many of the city's most revered monuments survived. Despite the destruction of some surrounding structures, the main house at the Martin complex remained intact. Richardson's asylum closed in the mid-1970s, and though one of its wings was demolished to make room for a new hospital next door, the bulk of the building still towers over Olmsted's park.
 Today Buffalo is a collection of fragile museum pieces with a covey of local stewards struggling to preserve them as a means to help save the city. 
 It would not be the first place to see its history as a means of attracting tourist dollars. (Boston and New Orleans are among the obvious precedents.) What makes this historic revival so heartwarming, however, is that it is driven by genuine civic pride in the face of daunting odds. 
 When a group of private citizens took control of the Martin House in 1992, for example, their ambitions were relatively modest: to restore the main house, one of three structures that had not yet been demolished. As time wore on, the group began to see the entire complex as a singular vision that could not be understood unless it was fully brought back to life . 
 In the early 1960s its conservatory and pergola had been ripped out to make way for an unsightly apartment complex; in 1994 the group raised the money to purchase the structure, tear it down and rebuild the elements of Wright's complex that had been destroyed. A few years ago they bought the small gardener's cottage that anchored the northwest corner of the site as well.
 The project's overall cost soared to more than $50 million from $10 million. But most of the structural and exterior work is now complete, and now, for the first time in decades, you can fully glean the genius of Wright's work. 
 Other projects have been less high profile but equally exemplary. On the October day I arrived, I met with Monica Pellegrino Faix, a representative of the Richardson Center Corporation, a local nonprofit group trying to save the asylum. The state has committed $76 million to help restore the complex, and the group is now trying to come up with potential uses for its vacant buildings, including using one for an architecture museum.
 Later that day I met with a group of local activists who have been rebuilding single-family houses in some of the city's most run-down historic neighborhoods. On Richmond Avenue, one of Olmsted's grand decaying parkways, Harvey Garrett, a strategic planning consultant, spent several years renovating a 19th-century Victorian house before an arsonist set fire to it in 2006. He rebuilt it, and he is now one of the city's busiest community organizers and strongest preservation voices. Dozens of houses are now being renovated along the avenue, and an entire neighborhood that was once considered crime ridden is now livable again.
 In a mostly abandoned factory area not far from downtown, Douglas Swift, a developer whose family has lived in Buffalo for generations, recently completed the restoration of a former Larkin warehouse, an early example of concrete frame construction; the project, which is now an office complex, has spurred a range of new development in the area.
 What we see is a more egalitarian, diverse and socially tolerant vision of the city. It is both pro-density and pro-history. These residents have come to recognize through firsthand experience that social, economic and preservation issues are all deeply intertwined.
 Sadly, not everyone has been so enlightened on this issue. Preservationists raised an outcry this year when Mayor Brown unveiled his plan to demolish 5,000 houses over the next five years as part of an effort to clean up some of the city's poorest neighborhoods. The National Trust for Historic Preservation and the mayor's office are now trying to hammer out a compromise. 
 And as the preservation movement has grown, it has inevitably gotten involved in bigger, more complex urban issues. The federal Homeland Security Department has proposed an expansion of the entrance to the Peace Bridge, the city's main border crossing into Canada. Preservationists balked. The project, which includes a vast new parking plaza for commercial trucks, would require razing five blocks of Columbus Park, a neighborhood of historic houses mostly built from 1860 through the late 1920s. A 20-foot-high berm would also be built alongside Olmsted's Front Park, which flanks one side of the neighborhood, blocking out sublime views of Lake Erie and the Niagara River.
 The National Trust, which opposes the plan, has suggested moving the new parking plaza to the Canadian side of the border -- a possibility that the Canadian government says it will consider -- or rerouting traffic to one of four other bridges. But those prospects appear doubtful.
 Meanwhile the city has begun to take a few cautious steps into the present. Toshiko Mori, a New York architect and the former chairwoman of the architecture department at Harvard's Graduate School of Design, is putting the finishing touches on a gorgeous new visitors' center at the Martin House. Gwathmey Siegel & Associates of New York has designed a sleek new zinc- and cast-stone-clad home for the Burchfield-Penney Art Center near the historic district of Elmwood Village, which opens next Saturday. 
 But how these projects will be forged into a cohesive vision for the city's future is less certain. The best-intentioned preservationists, however determined, can accomplish only so much. Often developers co-opt the achievements of these trailblazing individuals and nonprofit groups by dolling up historic neighborhoods for private gain. The city's rough edges are smoothed over to satisfy the hunger for more tourist dollars. Shiny new convention centers and generic boutiques follow. Yet schools, roads, bridges and electrical and power lines continue to crumble.
 Buffalo is an ideal testing ground for rethinking that depressing model. Its architectural heritage embodies an America that thought boldly about the future, but believed deeply in the city as a democratic forum. What's needed now is to revive that experimental tradition.

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the architectural gems by Frederick Law Olmsted and others in Buffalo misstated the name of the designer of Birkenhead Park in Liverpool, England, which Olmsted used for inspiration in creating Central Park in Manhattan and Prospect Park in Brooklyn. He was Joseph Paxton, not John Paxson. The article also misspelled the name of the Louis Sullivan skyscraper that is decorated in intricate floral terra-cotta tiles. It is the Guaranty Building, not the Guarantee Building.

HEADLINE: My Hybrid Is Bigger Than Your Hybrid

BYLINE: By EZRA DYER

 BODY:
I STARE across the intersection at the driver of the Honda Fit. What a jerk that guy is. He's sitting there idling at the red light, his engine spewing hydrocarbons needlessly into the atmosphere. Go ahead buddy, ruin the planet with your profligate ways! Send some more money to Saudi Arabia. Why not strap a polar bear to your tiny hood?
 I'm just going to sit here in silence, the engine dormant in my environmentally friendly hybrid. Right now, I'm zero-emissions, unlike the cretin in the diminutive Honda. 
 Then the light changes, I step on the gas and my 6-liter engine fires up. I am, after all, driving a Cadillac Escalade. 
 Actually, it's the Escalade Hybrid, a kinder, greener version of a vehicle so iconic that it's the only Cadillac that still has a name instead of letters. The regular Escalade is a favorite ride of pro athletes, hip-hop stars and the characters on HBO's ''Entourage,'' and this one endeavors to offer all the glitz along with a dash of environmental chic. 
 You can coax the Escalade Hybrid into electric-only mode, same as a Prius, but if you need to accelerate at all, or go up the slightest hill, or go faster than 30 miles an hour, you awaken the 332-horsepower V-8 under the hood. 
 Therein lies the dilemma of this truck: its mileage is great compared with a regular Escalade's, but that's like saying the American economy is great compared with Zimbabwe's. 
 Speaking of the economy, the Escalade Hybrid may someday be viewed as the worst-timed car introduction ever -- a luxury hybrid that arrives just as Americans are losing their shirts, taking the shine off flashy S.U.V.'s, and as gas prices are plunging, perhaps making the shift to hybrids less urgent. No single vehicle is going to rescue General Motors from its perilous financial situation, of course, but the company certainly did not catch a break with this one. 
 I managed to eke out 22.3 miles a gallon on one highway-biased trip, and about 20 m.p.g. over all. The hybrid system's benefit is most pronounced in urban driving, where Cadillac claims a 50 percent improvement in fuel economy. (The gas-only Escalade is rated 12 m.p.g. in town, 18 on the highway, with all-wheel drive.) 
 Bizarrely, the Environmental Protection Agency does not provide mileage estimates for the four-wheel-drive Escalade Hybrid because its weight vaults it into the category of heavy-duty trucks, which need not be rated.
 This is like McDonald's adding a low-fat burger that has no calorie count because the F.D.A. says it's too big to be classified as food. 
 The two-wheel-drive version, though, is rated at 20 m.p.g. in town and 21 on the highway.
 To create the Escalade Hybrid and its full-size Chevrolet and GMC siblings, G.M. cooperated with BMW and the former DaimlerChrysler to develop a mind-boggling hybrid transmission that can deploy two 60-kilowatt electric motors in tandem with a gas engine, operating either in continuously variable mode or through four fixed gears.
 The system also captures regenerative braking energy and uses an auto-stop feature to minimize idling. Using this technology, G.M. can wring more than 20 m.p.g. out of its full-size S.U.V.'s. 
 But we're still talking about a three-ton truck. Mercedes boasts that a 200-pound man can sit atop a C-Class door without damaging the hinges; with the Escalade, it feels as if the 200-pound-man is already inside the door.
 What if, instead of all the hybrid trickery, you simply subtracted 1,000 pounds of weight, using unibody construction and a direct-injection V-6 engine paired with a conventional six-speed automatic? Couldn't you have an equally posh and enormous three-row interior with all-wheel-drive and 20 m.p.g. economy? You certainly could, because I just described the Buick Enclave, a vehicle in G.M.'s own portfolio that underscores the Escalade Hybrid's Rube Goldberg approach to efficiency. 
 But maybe you really need a full-size S.U.V. Last summer, I used a Toyota Sequoia to tow my 5,000-pound boat out of the water and then take eight people on a weekend trip. I couldn't have done that with a minivan -- or with an Enclave, for that matter.
 And call me a heathen, but it's satisfying to use a full-size S.U.V. for jobs that only a full-size S.U.V. can accomplish. The fatal flaw, and the one the Escalade Hybrid tries to address, is the dismal mileage that owners of big sport utilities endure even when they're not using the full abilities of their vehicles -- which is, let's face it, most of the time.
 The Escalade Hybrid is a step in the right direction, but its economy is merely respectable rather than outright impressive. 
 I find the whole idea of this vehicle confounding. One part of my brain says that G.M. is to be commended for reducing fuel consumption, however slightly. But another part wonders who is going to buy this rig, which comes so loaded with amenities -- heated and cooled leather seats, magnetic ride control, a side-mirror blind-spot warning system -- that the only option on my test vehicle was fanciful power-deployed running boards for $1,095. 
 The total as-tested tab was $75,330, although you get a $2,200 federal hybrid tax credit unavailable to the wastrel who instead buys a Honda Fit.
 The Escalade is by definition proudly decadent, unapologetic in its message of chromed, big-rimmed excess, and that style is wildly at odds with the righteous conservationism proclaimed by most hybrids. A hybrid Escalade is like alcohol-free Scotch, a hemp-banded Rolex, a cinematically subtle Jerry Bruckheimer movie. The socially conscious Escalade is a contradictory formula, and with the hybrid labels plastered all over the thing, it's as if G.M. is telling the Escalade it should be ashamed of itself. 
 I ask you, is a grizzly bear ashamed of its claws? 
 I have a theory about these full-size G.M. hybrids. With all the money and time spent on developing this system, G.M. must see a lot of potential in it. And when you drive this Escalade, gently trying to coax every precious foot of electric travel out of it before the gas motor awakens, you quickly realize that the potential lies in the batteries. 
 Imagine if, instead of 22 m.p.g., this thing could store enough electrons to edge closer to 30 m.p.g. and still tow 5,600 pounds and exude its 22-inch-rim'ed attitude. Maybe this is the palaver of a nonengineer, but I suspect that the Chevy Volt team isn't the only group at G.M. waiting, fingers crossed, for the perfection of lithium batteries. In the meantime, the Escalade Hybrid offers a choice for a rare breed of customer -- the Escalade driver with a guilty conscience. 
 INSIDE TRACK: A hybrid with room for its own social baggage.

HEADLINE: How Rates Are Set

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
INTEREST rates are often a mystery for many people applying for home loans. How is it possible, for instance, for mortgage rates to rise after the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate, which was what happened in late October? Then, in the week that followed, mortgage rates fell after a report was released showing that the unemployment rate had soared.
 Borrowers can make smarter financial choices, industry executives maintain, by better understanding the economic forces that propel rates, and by keeping a watchful eye on the economic news. What is good for the Fed's banking customers, they say, is not necessarily good for mortgage borrowers. 
 But that misunderstanding is common, said Alan Rosenbaum, the chief executive of the GuardHill Financial Corporation, a mortgage broker based in Manhattan. ''We get that from clients all the time,'' he said, ''but the mortgage market isn't tied to the Fed's rate at all.''
 Rather, Mr. Rosenbaum and other mortgage industry executives said, home-loan rates are influenced by longer-term economic indicators. The Federal Reserve Board's benchmark rate, the federal funds rate, is the interest that banks charge one another for overnight loans. And that, in turn, is closely tied to the prime lending rate that the banks charge preferred customers.
 Some variable-rate short-term loans are based on the prime, including home-equity lines of credit. But for the most commonly held mortgage -- a 30-year fixed-rate loan -- lenders take a longer view when determining rates. That is why the performance of the 10-year United States Treasury note is a better indicator of where mortgage rates are headed.
 Earlier this month, the yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped to about 3.78 percent, compared with nearly 4 percent in late October. Rates on 30-year-fixed mortgages, meanwhile, dropped to 6.2 percent from nearly 6.5 percent in late October. (Last week, Freddie Mac said, the rate was 6.14 percent.) In New York, New Jersey and other Northeastern states, the average rate was 6.17 percent.
 Mortgage rates and 10-year Treasury yields tend to drop in times of bad economic news, Mr. Rosenbaum said, in part because investors flock to safer investments like Treasuries. And that was indeed the case early this month. 
 In announcing a drop in mortgage rates in early November, Freddie Mac's chief economist, Frank Nothaft, cited ''new indications of a pullback in consumer spending and a weaker jobs market.'' That week, for instance, the government announced a sharp increase in the unemployment rate, to 6.5 percent in October from 6.1 percent the previous month, and a shrinking of the overall economy.
 The relationship between the 10-year Treasury note and long-term mortgage rates changed during the mortgage crisis, however. In past years, Mr. Rosenbaum said, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage borrowers could generally find an interest rate about 1.25 percentage points higher than the prevailing 10-year Treasury yield. But in recent months, the difference has been as much as 2.75 percentage points. 
 Lenders have been building a higher profit margin into their mortgage deals to recoup losses from the last year, and to hedge against a still-declining real estate market, which threatens a bank's mortgage assets. Once the fiscal crisis eases, mortgage executives said, the difference between the 10-year Treasury note and long-term mortgage rates should return to normal.

HEADLINE: Your Mileage May Still Vary

BYLINE: By CHERYL JENSEN

 BODY:
DRIVERS have complained for years that their cars could not attain the optimistic fuel economy figures listed on the window sticker. But since the Environmental Protection Agency has changed the way it calculates fuel economy, many consumers are saying their mileage is even better than the estimates, according to a recent survey by J. D. Power & Associates, the market research firm. 
 This has pocketbook implications because some people use the government's mileage estimates to try to calculate how much they will spend on gasoline during the time they own a vehicle. And getting more than you expected is always better than getting less.
 The E.P.A. revised its standards in 1984, but many drivers found their actual mileage fell short of those estimates. The disparity was due, in part, to the fact that the federal testing standards no longer accurately represented driving conditions in the United States. So, starting with 2008 models, the agency again changed the way it calculated fuel economy figures.
 J. D. Power looked at the new E.P.A. estimates and compared them with the mileage that consumers reported getting in the company's 2008 Initial Quality Study earlier this year. The information came from more than 81,500 people with 2008 vehicles. That information was compared with results from the 2007 Initial Quality Study. The idea was to see how close the consumer-stated mileage came to the federal estimate before and after the changes.
 In the 2007 study, the mileage drivers said they were getting was, on average, 97 percent of the E.P.A. estimate. But in the 2008 study, the stated mileage was 105 percent of the estimate.
 ''In 2007, consumers would get 3 percent less than they would have expected on average,'' Mike Marshall, J. D. Power's director of automotive emerging technologies, said in an e-mail message. ''But in 2008, they would get 5 percent more, thus going from unmet expectations to exceeded expectations.'' 
 It is difficult to know the reality, he said, because the J. D. Power survey depends on people's perceptions of their mileage over the first 120 days they owned their vehicle. The E.P.A. testing is done using strict scientific methods.
 Still, finding out you spent 5 percent less on gasoline than you thought is a more pleasant surprise than discovering you have to pay 3 percent more because you underestimated your fuel costs based on the E.P.A. estimate, Mr. Marshall said in a telephone interview.
 Before the agency adopted the new method, owners of hybrids were often among the most disappointed that they couldn't achieve the optimistic estimates on the window sticker. Now, more hybrid owners said they were getting fuel economy closer to what the E.P.A. predicted, or even more.
 The Toyota Prius is an example. In the 2007 survey, consumers reported getting only 81 percent of the E.P.A.'s estimates, which were 60 m.p.g. in the city and 51 m.p.g. on the highway.
 In the 2008 survey, drivers reported getting 94 percent of the new estimates, which are 48 m.p.g. in the city and 45 on the highway. 
 ''There is still a gap, but it's much better,'' Mr. Marshall said.

GRAPHIC: CHART: A Reality Check for Fuel Economy: In the past, estimated-mileage figures on window stickers were sometimes too optimistic, and many consumers did not take them seriously. But the Environmental Protection Agency changed its calculation methods for the 2008 model year. Now some consumers say their vehicles often get better mileage than the estimates. Here are some vehicles with notable differences. (Source: J. D. Power & Associates)

HEADLINE: Excuse Me, Where's Thanksgiving?

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

DATELINE: Frankenmuth, Mich. 

 BODY:
 IT was past the John Deere tree skirts, the reindeer-pattern Kringle Kozies slipper socks and the miniature Mexican Nativity in a nutshell that the time-space continuum began to bend and warp. Where was I? What day was this? What month, what year? How had I come to be standing in a grove of twinkling odorless fir trees colored Martian red and made from petroleum byproducts? 
 Was that Santa ornament really wearing camouflage, with a shotgun held to his torso and a dead mallard slung from his belt? 
 He was. 
 I was in Michigan someplace, in farm country 73 miles north of Detroit, to get an early start on the monster consumer metric that is the Christmas season. Roughly 93 percent of consumers surveyed observed the holidays last year, according to the National Retail Federation, beginning their shopping at about this point in late autumn. Some uncounted number purchased garlands and ornaments and tinsel and the myriad other props for the familial stage set that is the Christmas scene.
 An awful lot of them did so at one of the country's year-round Christmas stores, places like Bronner's Christmas Wonderland, where cheer is viral and the holiday a fantasy zone maintained through every seasonal turning and against the logic of weather and time. 
 In the estimated 1,500 year-round Christmas stores across the United States the scent of potpourri is always wafting, a smell as cloying and tough to forget as Aunt Sook's fruitcake. In the year-round Christmas stores, there is always a collection of spray-can icicles on the windows, a spiky vinyl garland twined around the checkout and an atmosphere of cozy aural upholstery woven from Eartha Kitt's novelty purrs and Bing Crosby's reassuring caramel baritone.
 To experience Bronner's Christmas Wonderland at the start of the selling season is to enter something like what the comedian Dennis Leary terms the Crystal Evergreen Ever-Forever Film Loop.
 Bronner's, which bills itself as the word's largest Christmas store, is a vast, largely windowless place in a town whose zoning laws have preserved it as a Teutonic theme park, replete with a covered wooden bridge and a clock-tower glockenspiel played by figures from the Pied Piper legend. It is also a place where it is clear that holiday magic is not spontaneously made so much as willed into being. 
 And yet memory failed me at Bronner's Christmas Wonderland. I entered the place at 9 one chilly morning and 90 minutes later was so lost amid a welter of tinsel and glitter and twinkling lights that I could not find my way out. 
 ''Go to the Halloween tree and turn left,'' said a salesclerk, with the open attitude that is either a civic trait or a requirement for employment on the Bronner's seasonal work force of 600. 
 But the Halloween tree was hard to locate without a highly tuned internal GPS unit, and so somehow I detoured into an area occupied by Bronner's patented life-size Nativity scene. There, at a counter wedged behind a manger, was Jason Schnell applying poinsettia stamps to pages of stick-on name tags. The stickers, he explained, were for organizing Santa's visitors into manageable groupings, three Santas in shift rotation. 
 ''The kids get a category name tag that's called out,'' Mr. Schnell said, when a place opens up on Santa's lap. 
 The men who play Santa Claus, Mr. Schnell explained, look a lot like the real thing (or would if the real thing existed) right down to their snowy beards and hair. 
 ''Two have the beard,'' he said, ''and when the kids pull on it, nothing happens, and it really freaks them out.'' 
 I could easily see why, because Bronner's Christmas Wonderland (corporate orthography renders the name with religious emphasis as CHRISTmas) is a place so generally disorienting in its scale, its distortion of time and its aesthetic of horror vacui that I kept getting off course. 
 Along the vast aisles that spread over a space the size of nearly five football fields were 150 different styles of nutcrackers; ornaments that said ''Merry Christmas'' in 70 languages; display cases filled with ranks of sinister Hummel kiddies; 1,700 Precious Moments cherubs with woeful teardrop eyes; 500 Nativity sets from 70 nations; and Christmas balls in 6,000 styles, each racked with Linnaean precision in categories like Birds or Dogs or Snowmen or Ballerinas or Miniatures or Farm Scenes (featuring pigs, and also tractors, and also pigs on tractors) or Gymnastics or Football or Hockey or Woodland Hunting and Fishing or else John Wayne or Betty Boop.
 ''Mom, did you see this pumpkin person?'' asked Teresa Yu, a homemaker from Celine, Mich., as she moved down an aisle where autumnal motifs were wedded to winter ones. The pumpkin person cost $12.99; it looked forlorn as a scarecrow, with attenuated limbs and a cloth carrot nose. 
 ''That is so darling,'' said Shirley Smith, Mrs. Yu's mother.
 ''Look at the nose,'' Ms. Yu added, but by then Mrs. Smith had moved on to a counter filled with ceramic items for the holiday table. 
 ''Mom!'' said the undeterred Ms. Yu, holding aloft a multilevel serving tray cum Christmas tree printed with holiday phrases. ''How can you pass up a Ho-Ho platter?'' 
 At this her sister, Teresa Saxton, chimed in with an exhortation that every parent dreads: ''Get it, Mom!''
 The success of Bronner's Christmas Wonderland depends, of course, on the inexplicable allure of pumpkin men and Ho-Ho platters and glitter elves and even more unaccountably strange things, like the Christmas ornament depicting a lion lying with a lamb -- manufactured, the tag maintained, in Palestine. 
 ''There is not a thing out there that anybody needs,'' explained Wayne Bronner, the president of Bronner's, when I finally found my way to a homey office suite at a southern extension of 25 Christmas Lane.
 Not much on the sales floor at Bronner's costs more than $10, he said. ''Even in times of economic turmoil, there comes a moment every fall when people look at the calendar and see that Christmas is still coming and it's still on Dec. 25,'' added the company president, who that day had chosen from among his collection of novelty neckties one patterned with Christmas bulbs.
 ''The $10 ornament that's the perfect gift for Grandpa or Uncle Rob is not going to make or break anybody's budget,'' he said.
 That few of the two million people who reportedly visit Bronner's each year seem likely to settle for purchasing a single ornament was made clear by the sight of shopping multitudes pushing laden double-decker carts around the store. This impression was further supported by Mr. Bronner's assertion that the family-held business, founded in 1945 by Mr. Bronner's late father as a holiday sign-painting business, is now a multimillion-dollar entity.
 And it was finally borne out in the most telling way when -- before finally finding the parking lot and freedom -- I got caught up in the magic and, altogether taking leave of my senses, spent almost $60 on a set of pearlescent ''I My Iguana'' Christmas bulbs.

Here it is, on yet another reinvention -- not one with particularly good financial timing, perhaps, but so it goes. Things have been worse. PAGE 32
 GRADING ON THE CURVE
 The A-through-F grading system for New York City schools, introduced last year, is billed as a public information tool. The grades act like billboards broadcasting achievements and failures. But they are more performance management review than consumer report. The fact that a school got an A is not necessarily a clear indication that parents should want to send their children to it.

 AN IMMIGRATION JOURNEY
 Leading to the N.F.L.
 While most of his friends call him Al, as a referee for the N.F.L. he wants to be known as Alberto -- Alberto Riveron. The league had its first Hispanic starting quarterback in 1960, its first Hispanic head coach in 1967. But Riveron, who came to the United States from Cuba at age 5, is the only Hispanic among its 120 officials. PAGE 1
 SUNDAY BUSINESS
 A CORPORATE BRAWL
 Takes Its Victim
 In an era when the executive suite is still dominated by men, it's tempting to attribute the downfall of Sallie L. Krawcheck at Citigroup to the vagaries of the glass ceiling. As it turns out, however, her departure was largely a result of an old-fashioned corporate bar brawl at a bank already notorious for dysfunctional management. PAGE 1

 DREAM GIRL AWAKENS
 Her Earthy Side
 Playing the hard-living, emotionally scarred singer Etta James, Beyonce Knowles -- one of the few pop stars left with a wholesome, good-girl image -- swaggers and swears her way through the new film ''Cadillac Records.'' It represents a big departure from her most significant previous role, in 2006's ''Dreamgirls.'' PAGE 1
 THE HAMSTER CO-STAR
 Walt Disney Animation Studios is heavily invested in ''Bolt,'' an effort to restore its animation division to prominence after a prolonged slump. It's about a dog who thinks he has superpowers, and John Travolta provides the voice of Bolt. So why is a no-name voicing the sidekick hamster that test audiences loved so much? PAGE 14
 STYLES
 CONSUMPTION GOES
 Less Conspicuous
 In addition to the masses, even those relatively unaffected by the widespread economic travails seem to be rethinking what is acceptable consumerism these days. ''The era of conspicuous consumption, at least for the foreseeable future, has come to a close,'' said Paco Underhill, the author of ''Why We Buy.'' ''Consumption will still happen. It's just not going to be as public.'' PAGE 1

HEADLINE: Enrollment Surges In Quick Prep Courses

BYLINE: By PAT WIEDENKELLER

 BODY:
ROBIN GRIFFIN has made razor blades for Schick in Milford, has run a five-ton overhead crane for a foundry in Fairfield and has worked as a wire inspector, a furnace operator and a quality control specialist. ''Pretty much always down on the concrete manufacturing floor,'' she said. 
 Two years ago she found an opportunity for moving up: Naugatuck Community College, in Waterbury, was offering noncredit classes on site at her job at Belimo Air Controls in Danbury. She signed up for an eight-week program on blueprint reading, followed it with a technical writing class and went on to computer courses in Basic Word and Excel. ''I was like a sponge,'' said Ms. Griffin, who had never taken college classes. ''It was learn, learn, learn.''
 But what brought her to the community college classes was not the usual quest for an associate's degree. Instead, in August Ms. Griffin, 46, was promoted to an entry-level management position overseeing three departments and nine people, boosting her salary 25 percent. ''Without the classes, I would have been held back from this job,'' she said. ''I'm a carpet dweller now.'' 
 Students across the region, and the country, are swelling the rolls of community colleges, seeking a two-year associate's degree as a bridge to a four-year university or as a way to retrain after a job loss. But in these shaky economic times, more students are skipping a degree and heading straight for the colleges' noncredit training and certification programs -- courses that end in months or weeks, designed to propel them swiftly into the job market or better their prospects at their companies. 
 Once viewed more as a way to learn flower-arranging or how to work your new computer, noncredit programs have been steadily shifting their focus to the workplace. First-time students use them as a jumping-off point for a career or an entree to higher education (some noncredit courses can be used toward a credit degree). Some take skill-boosting classes to help insulate themselves from a layoff or to chart a new career path.
 The courses are generally listed under the heading of Continuing Education or Lifelong Learning and are sometimes created in cooperation with local industry, labor departments and unions. (Belimo paid for Ms. Griffin's classes.) 
 Although the classes meet in college buildings and are administered by the college, the teachers are paid through the noncredit class tuition and the programs are not subject to the same lengthy state accreditation process required for degree programs. As a result, courses are sometimes set up in weeks.
 ''Continuing education has changed,'' said Andrea Morville, assistant dean of Continuing Education at Westchester Community College. She said career programs had gone from about 25 percent to 40 percent of the classes in her division in the last 10 years. 
 Other administrators put their numbers even higher. In Connecticut, about 50 percent of noncredit courses are aimed at job training, said Mary Anne Cox, assistant chancellor for the System of Connecticut Community Colleges. And in New Jersey, registrations for noncredit professional training increased by 20,000 between 2005 and 2007, said Jacob C. Farbman, spokesman for the New Jersey Council of County Colleges.
 Lifestyle-enhancing courses are still popular (Suffolk Community College on Long Island offers basket-weaving this fall) and predominate at some colleges. But at many others, the shift toward job training has broadened into a significant role in stocking the work force.
 Noncredit offerings increasingly read like a roster of where jobs are. Of the 30 occupations for which the Labor Department is predicting the largest national growth in the next eight years, 22 are in areas that do not require a college degree. Most are directly addressed by continuing education.
 Courses in health care, high-skills manufacturing, management, hospitality and culinary arts, and -- as always -- computers are booming, regionally and nationally. But so are many other programs tailored to the needs of the surrounding community. 
 ''Instead of designing those courses to get state aid, we design courses that will travel well in the workforce,'' said G. Jeremiah Ryan, president of Bergen Community College. 
 Program directors scan the job landscape like doctors seeking a pulse. A new industry requirement, a government regulation, a lifestyle trend or a product release, like the Microsoft Office 2007 program, can send droves of workers back to class. 
 ''I don't plug into my crystal ball and imagine what industry might be interested in, I ask them,'' said Lynn Lederer, director of professional community programs at Middlesex County College in New Jersey. ''I check with industry experts, census figures on demographics, watch the classes that have increased enrollment and maybe add a section of something similar.'' 
 A program on beginning an animal-based business was successful, for example, so she added a veterinary assistant program. Real estate licensing classes may be down, but enrollment spiked in a course on buying foreclosures, Ms. Lederer said. 
 At Westchester, ''green'' lifestyle classes are migrating to the workforce side, Ms. Morville said. Next spring her college will offer a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification program to builders and others seeking accreditation by the United States Green Building Council, she said.
 Costs vary depending on a course's length and intensity, but tuition for a noncredit program is far less than for an associate's degree. The seven-month Computerized Healthcare Billing and Coding Certificate Program at Bergen Community College in New Jersey, for example, runs $2,995, while a two-year degree program for a medical office assistant costs about $8,500.
 ''It takes much longer to get a degree, where with a noncredit course I can have them in the work force in 16 weeks making between $13 to $18 an hour,'' said David Chrzanowski, director of extended studies at Norwalk Community College in Connecticut.
 While classes are often aimed at entry-level access to the job market, students take them for all sorts of reasons.
 ''Some of them have bachelor's or master's but now they want to learn about information systems,'' said Jennifer Dudley, the continuing education director at Passaic County Community College in New Jersey.
 At Essex County College, one of the Labor Department's One-Stop Career Centers is situated at the Newark campus to match the underemployed with noncredit programs, said Mitra Choudhury, director of Training Inc. at the college. Allied health courses are particularly popular, she said.
 At Suffolk Community College on Long Island, Monica Juarez, 19, a single mother of two, recently signed up for an eight-month Pharmacy Technician/Pharmacy Technician Assistant Program, hoping to eventually land a job in a retail pharmacy or a hospital -- which could pay between $11 and $25 an hour. It is one of the fastest-growing occupations in the country, the Department of Labor says, and Ms. Juarez has decided it is her path to a solid future. ''Everyone's going to need medical care, right?'' she said.
 Among the biggest areas of growth in noncredit programs is customized training for businesses or government agencies, coordinated by the colleges and held on campus or at the business site. Connecticut's 12 community colleges provide such programs to about 600 businesses a year, said Ms. Cox, the assistant chancellor.
 Designed to help workers upgrade skills in a downsizing job market, company-subsidized classes can offer targeted training in areas like management, businesswriting and high-skill manufacturing. Programs can be started in as little as a few weeks, said James Polo, associate vice president of lifelong learning at Nassau Community College, which recently ran a medical coding program for employees of Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola. 
 Work force training programs also help prepare workers for shudders in the local job market -- for example, when a large hotel breaks ground or a major employer moves out.
 When the Peter Paul plant closed in Naugatuck last year, Naugatuck Valley Community College worked closely with the Northwest Regional Workforce Investment Board, a private, nonprofit organization constituted by the General Assembly that administers federal and state funds to dislocated workers for retraining. 
 And when Executive Greetings closed its New Hartford offices several years ago, ''we were able to take a host of those people and turn them into health care employees because they had computer graphic-type skills; you look at a CAT scan and it's a computer graphic,'' said Catherine Awwad, the board's executive director. ''Re-educated at the community college level.''

HEADLINE: Maybe the Meltdown's a Guy Thing

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI

 BODY:
Will the down market never end? For months, policy makers around the world have tried bailouts, interest rates cuts, anything they could think of, really, to bring global markets out of their deepening depression. Once in a while, the markets do move up -- only to fall again. Nothing seems to work for long. 
 Perhaps there's a reason that everyone has overlooked: hormones. 
 If a research paper published earlier this year is correct, traders have become prisoners of their endocrine systems -- testosterone, the elixir of male aggressiveness, during a bull market; cortisol, a steroid that helps the body deal with stress, when the bears take over. 
 The study suggests that raging hormones might explain why the men who rule the global markets send them rocketing up when they're on a roll, and swooping down when they get scared, exhibiting judgment that can remind you of the guys in an Adam Sandler movie.
 One investment strategist intuitively grasped the situation when he recently told The New York Times: ''Normally markets are driven by fear and greed. Now it's fear and fear.'' In other words, instead of a rhythm of testosterone alternating with cortisol, it's been cortisol and more cortisol for weeks. Actually there was a step in between -- greed and greed, the bubble period. That's when traders were making a lot of money, which made them pump out extra testosterone, grow overconfident and overcompetitive, and take on more and more risks that eventually went bust.
 Now, in their funk, the lingering presence of cortisol makes them irrationally fearful, negative and risk averse. 
 John M. Coates, a former trader who is now a senior research fellow in neuroscience and finance at the University of Cambridge, and a colleague, Joseph Herbert, laid it all out in the study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Measuring steroid levels of traders in the City of London, they demonstrated that successful traders were heavily influenced during market booms by a positive feedback loop fueled by increased levels of testosterone.
 It's akin, Dr. Coates says, to the ''winner's effect'' among male athletes, in which successive victories push testosterone levels higher and higher, giving the winner an advantage -- until he begins to misjudge risk and take stupid chances. ''Testosterone doesn't create bubbles, but it exaggerates them,'' Dr. Coates said. ''It's possible that bubbles are a male phenomenon.''
 Likewise, when markets tumble, traders are stressed out by the uncertainty and volatility and produce a lot of cortisol; they fall into a negative feedback loop that turns them into emotional fear-mongers, rather than analytical thinkers. So they're now prolonging and deepening the market plunge, and dragging down the economy.
 With markets swinging scarily from one day to the next -- up 800, down 350, down 400, up 250 and so on -- traders have become bundles of dueling hormones.
 Though Dr. Coates hasn't studied it -- yet -- he said ''it's possible'' that testosterone-fueled competitiveness may even have driven investment bankers to be ever more creative in inventing the risky, complex securities designed to deliver more leverage and better returns. They got so creative that few people understood their risks.
 Whoa, said Jonathan D. Cohen, director of the neuroscience program at Princeton. ''This is intriguing, but correlation is not causation,'' he said. ''That's the first thing we learn in science.'' 
 Still, Dr. Bruce McEwen, head of the neuroendocrinology lab of Rockefeller University, said ''it's kind of exciting.'' ''Who knows,'' he asked, ''what other hormones are doing as well? There's a lot we don't know, because people don't think about hormones in this context, but this is an aspect we have to consider. All bets are off.'' 
 Dr. McEwen said it was too early to make recommendations to policy makers. 
 Not so Dr. Coates: The question reminded him of a headline in The Financial Times: ''Icelandic Women to Clean Up Male Mess.'' The article reported that Iceland had turned to two women to lead banks nationalized during the country's brush with bankruptcy. 
 Women, Dr. Coates explained, have only about 10 percent of the testosterone men have; their judgment is not bollixed by it. He said he also suspected that women were less likely to produce excess cortisol. So he advised getting ''more women and older men on trading floors.''
 At a time like this, investment banks may be loath to hire a new crew of women overnight. O.K., Dr. Coates continued, but in the meantime firms could do other things. Instead of scrutinizing mediocre or money-losing traders, they could focus more on the big profit makers whose hormones will rage, to make sure they're not risking the bank. 
 There's a lesson in this, too, for central bankers. ''This explains why bubbles and crashes are beyond the control of central banks,'' Dr. Coates said, and they should recognize that male traders simply don't respond rationally to their pricing signals. 
 And maybe they should add more women to the mix, too.

HEADLINE: Bid for Name Change Roils West Paterson

BYLINE: By NATE SCHWEBER

DATELINE: WEST PATERSON 

 BODY:
 REGINA GIORDANO said her mother, Barbara Harriott, would ''roll over in her ashes'' if she knew that voters might have narrowly passed a ballot measure on Nov. 4 to change the town's name to ''Woodland Park.'' The votes are still being counted.
 In the late 1970s Ms. Giordano's mother, Barbara Harriott, served on the borough council, and was against the many efforts over the years to take Paterson out of the name of this borough that is next door to one of the state's most rough-and-tumble cities with a similar name. 
 Less than a week after Election Day, Ms. Giordano, and more than 200 other residents, packed the American Legion hall here to brainstorm ways to keep the name West Paterson, which the town has been called since it incorporated in 1914.
 Voters here rejected changing names to Woodland Park in 1989, and they also voted down the names West Park and Garrett Mountain in 1995 and 2001 respectively. Many say this year's measure appears to be passing because of an influx of new residents in this community that is more suburban than its urban neighbor, Paterson. 
 According to the borough Web site, the name-changing referendum passed 2,125 to 2,094, a difference of just 31 votes with 101 provisional ballots left to count. Laura B. Freytes, superintendent of elections for Passaic County, said the final tally would not be available until Nov. 21.
 Robert DeBlock, 30, who organized the meeting to keep the town's name, said that if the election results stood he would ask for a recount. Should that fail he said he would help gather the more than 1,700 signatures it would take to put a referendum on next year's ballot to change the borough's name back to West Paterson. 
 Some in the crowd even offered to raise money to come up with the $30,000 it would take to finance a special election.
 ''I'm proud of where I'm from,'' said Mr. DeBlock, who is related to Alfred Baumann, a former West Paterson mayor. ''It's worth fighting for.''
 Robert Dicker, who helped put the name change referendum on this year's ballot, said that the name West Paterson doesn't accurately reflect the character of the town, which is bordered by the Passaic River and stretches up the woody side of Garrett Mountain.
 ''Woodland Park is a beautiful name, it better describes the town, that's why we went ahead and did this,'' said Mr. Dicker, an educational administrator who has lived in West Paterson for two years. 
 To many, the renaming sounds like an attempt to distance the borough from Paterson, a one-time industrial powerhouse that today is better known for its high unemployment and crime rate. 
 ''You say you're from West Paterson, people think of Paterson's crime,'' said Joe Pryor, a 47-year resident who voted for the name change. ''You say you're from Woodland Park, it has a different ring, doesn't it?''
 Its neighbor to the west isn't the only one running from its association with Paterson. In 1972 voters in what was then known as East Paterson voted to change its name to Elmwood Park. Mayor Richard A. Mola, the mayor of Elmwood Park, with about 19,000 residents, who had also been the mayor of East Paterson, said his town and West Paterson have much in common.
 ''We wanted to disassociate ourselves from a major city and form our own identity,'' he said.
 Thomas Rooney, who was sworn in as mayor in Paterson on the day East Paterson became Elmwood Park, joked in the 1970s that Paterson should rename itself ''West Elmwood Park.'' Today he jokes that Paterson should call itself ''East Woodland Park'' because it sounds ''elegant.'' 
 All joking aside, Mr. Rooney said he was disappointed the name change might pass. 
 ''I'm sad that they want to change their name and get the name 'Paterson' out of there,'' he said. ''In Paterson we're working very hard to try and improve the city and have better things happen here. I just wish the people up there had a different opinion of Paterson.''

HEADLINE: How High Gas Prices Can Save the Car Industry

BYLINE: By DANIEL SPERLING and DEBORAH GORDON. 
Daniel Sperling, the director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis, and Deborah Gordon, a transportation policy consultant, are the authors of the forthcoming ''Two Billion Cars: Driving Toward Sustainability.''

 BODY:
FOR the American automobile industry, the years since the glory days of the 1950s and '60s have been a period of decline. Ever since the oil crises and the Japanese import invasion of the 1970s, the automakers have repeatedly flirted with financial ruin. 
 They stayed afloat, at times quite profitably, by shifting their focus to sport utility vehicles and big pickup trucks, which indulged the desires of consumers for larger and more powerful vehicles. They deluded themselves into thinking they had created a successful strategy, when what they had really created was a protected and precarious perch. 
 Bankruptcy, then, might be well deserved, were it not for the risk of the complete collapse of the companies. The industry must be bailed out by the federal government. There are hundreds of thousands of jobs at stake, and a strong domestic manufacturing sector is important for security reasons. 
 Scarce American dollars, however, must be invested in the larger public interest. The best bailout is one that weans us off oil and sets us on a path to reduced carbon emissions. Congress and President-elect Barack Obama are not qualified to protect shareholders' interests, nor can they build a better car. But they can ensure that society benefits from our investment in the automobile industry.
 One way to do that would be to establish a price floor of $3.50 per gallon on gasoline. If the price drops below that, as it recently has, the federal government would impose a variable tax to bring the price up to $3.50. If the price goes above $3.50, then the tax disappears. The money raised by the variable tax would be used, at least in the short term, to provide loan guarantees to the auto companies. (To ease the burden of higher gasoline prices on low-income taxpayers, some of the revenue would be provided to them as tax credits or vouchers.) 
 A price floor for gasoline would ease the bailout's burden on taxpayers. At current prices, a floor of $3.50 per gallon would generate more than $17 billion in one month -- a big chunk of a $25 billion bailout. If, without the floor, gasoline averaged $2.50 per gallon over the next year, revenues would amount to $140 billion. That money could pay for a sound transportation policy agenda beyond the bailout. 
 To receive some of the money raised by this tax, the car makers would be required to produce large numbers of affordable, durable, safe, fuel-efficient, low-carbon vehicles within the next five years. They would also have to relinquish their fight against California's clean car standards and accept national greenhouse gas standards for vehicles. The companies should also be required to sell a certain number of near-zero emission cars -- electric, plug-in hybrids and fuel-cell vehicles.
 The $3.50 price floor for gasoline would help sell these fuel-efficient cars. The higher the price of gas, the greater the demand for Detroit's new, improved fleet. The price floor could be indexed to inflation, so that it rises over time, and it could be applied to diesel fuel, to avoid a widespread substitution from gas to diesel. A comparable price floor for oil could be calculated, to reduce the risk of manipulation of crude pricing. 
 The declining fortunes of the domestic automakers have paralyzed energy and environmental debates and stymied oil and climate policy for more than a generation. We've been down this road before. In 1980, Chrysler was reported to be within hours of bankruptcy, and Congress bailed out the company with $1.5 billion in loan guarantees and a package of concessions -- from lenders, unions and others -- worth billions more. 
 This time, the government has to be smart, steering the country to a more sustainable future.

HEADLINE: Our Risk, Wall Street's Reward

BYLINE: By WILLIAM D. COHAN. 
William D. Cohan is the author of ''The Last Tycoons: The Secret History of Lazard Freres'' and the forthcoming ''House of Cards: A Tale of Hubris and Wretched Excess on Wall Street.''

 BODY:
AFTER nearly 18 months spent doing triage on one of the worst financial crises in our nation's history, there is now a shred of hope that those who are in a position to do something about the root cause of the problem -- Wall Street's bloated and ineffective compensation system -- just might act.
 Late last month, first Representative Henry Waxman, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and then Andrew Cuomo, New York's attorney general, demanded from the surviving Wall Street chief executives reams of data about their bankers and traders who were paid more than $250,000 in the past few years. The two politicians also asked for information on bonuses this year, which is destined to be one of the least-profitable ever on Wall Street. 
 The impetus for the requests was the $125 billion these firms just received from the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the genuine concern that part of that money would be used to pay 2008 bonuses rather than to shore up firms' capital or to begin to thaw the frozen credit markets.
 Whether Wall Street will come to its senses on its own about the way it pays and motivates its people, or will be forced to do so, remains to be seen. But there is no question that compensation reform in the securities industry is desperately overdue.
 Once upon a time on Wall Street (where I worked for nearly two decades), firms were smaller, less capital intensive partnerships. The beauty of the partnership agreement was the collective liability clause it contained. 
 For instance, at Lazard, where I spent six years when it was a privately held partnership, the partners moved forward into the marketplace like a school of fish. When the partnership as a whole made money, partners (and some non-partners like me) shared in those profits based upon a point system that our patriarch, Michel David-Weill, established at the beginning of every year. When partners messed up -- as a few did in the firm's municipal finance department in the 1990s, forcing the firm to pay $100 million in fines, restitution and legal fees -- the burden of the mistake was also shared by all, through a reduction in the pre-tax profits of the firm. 
 The punishment for that misadventure was ruthless: not only did the partners involved get fired but Mr. David-Weill quickly shuttered the whole department. This is because the status of the firm was held very important -- so much so that senior partners would often reject a particular assignment solely because of the risk that the firm's image might suffer from the deal. The formula worked magnificently, if the preponderance of satisfied clients -- and the Fifth Avenue and Hamptons addresses among the partners -- was indicative of anything.
 But this quaint system began changing a generation ago when one venerable partnership after another decided to grab the riches available by selling shares to the public. What started with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in 1969 became a Wall Street stampede that eventually included Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even 157-year-old Lazard, in May 2005. 
 The result has been calamitous. The collective liability clause honored by partners was replaced with a system where bankers and traders were encouraged to take short-term risks with shareholders' money. Gone, too was the idea of being held responsible for your actions (short of outright fraud). Managers at publicly traded banks constantly exhorted their traders to do bigger and bigger deals and to take increasing amounts of risk, and then rewarded them with millions of dollars in compensation -- money that belonged to shareholders. Reputations were made not by turning down imprudent business but by seeing how much business could be done. 
 The fallout of 25 years under this compensation system is strewn everywhere; the inevitable consequences of encouraging smart people to take risks, free of accountability, with other people's money are easy to fathom. As innovative products emerged on Wall Street, the compensation system pushed bankers and traders to sell them, to inevitable and disastrous extremes. 
 It was the gorging on high-yield bonds that led to the Crash of 1987 and to the credit crunch that followed. The feast of Internet public offerings led to the equity bubble that exploded in March 2000. Excessive issuing of debt for emerging telecommunications companies resulted in the frauds at WorldCom and Enron, among others. And, of course, the huge rewards given to bankers, traders and Wall Street executives for manufacturing mortgage-backed securities have led to our current predicament.
 There has never been a better moment to correct this deeply flawed system. For starters, where is it written in stone that bankers and traders have to be paid millions of dollars for their services? The gibberish about needing to pay that much just to keep superstars from fleeing to private-equity firms or hedge funds is just another Wall Street myth. The truth is most of them are lucky to have a job at all and they know it.
 Since compensation has historically consumed half or more of every dollar of revenue generated on Wall Street -- what other business even comes close? -- there is no better way for companies to improve their profitability than by drastically cutting this expense. And a revamped Wall Street pay structure could be further enhanced through new accountability. One idea is creating escrow accounts at each firm made up of, say, one-third of each year's allocated compensation, which would be distributed to employees over the next three years -- after the account is reduced by losses resulting from poor trades or deals and legal judgments against bankers and traders resulting from their rash behavior. The escrow accounts would reinforce the idea of prudently generating revenue.
 Instead of fretting over government intrusiveness, titans like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Ken Lewis of Bank of America, Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs and John Mack of Morgan Stanley should be dancing a jig that Mr. Waxman and Mr. Cuomo have given them cover to make the one change on Wall Street that would help their bottom lines and prevent the tragic cycle of lurching from one financial crisis to another. But if they don't, then the new secretary of the Treasury should help them see the light.

HEADLINE: Enrollment Surges in Colleges' Quick Prep Courses

BYLINE: By PAT WIEDENKELLER

DATELINE: SAYVILLE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 LIFE'S demands have so far kept college and a career out of reach for Monica Juarez. She is 19 and a single mother of two. She works two jobs -- at a Waldbaum's supermarket in Hauppauge, on Long Island, and a Teachers Federal Credit Union in Amityville -- and shares a one-room apartment in Central Islip with her boys, Alexavier, 2, and Geremiah, 3 months.
 That hasn't kept her from yearning for something better. ''It's too hard,'' she said last month, standing outside a community college classroom in Sayville. ''I need a bigger place for my kids. Everything is for my kids.'' 
 What brought her to the Sayville Downtown Center, a branch of Suffolk County Community College, is not the usual quest for an associate's degree. 
 Instead, Ms. Juarez has spent most weekday evenings since mid-September with eight other students as they hustle through the college's Pharmacy Technician/Pharmacy Technician Assistant Program. That eight-month, noncredit course will prepare them for a national certification exam. If they pass, they can make $11 to $25 an hour as a retail or hospital pharmacy assistant. 
 It is one of the fastest-growing occupations in the country, according to the Department of Labor, and Ms. Juarez has decided it is her path to a solid future. ''Everyone's going to need medical care, right?'' she said.
 Students across the region, and the country, are swelling the rolls of community colleges, seeking a two-year associate's degree as a bridge to a four-year university or as a way to retrain after a job loss. But in these shaky economic times, more students are skipping a degree and heading straight for the colleges' noncredit training and certification programs -- courses that end in months or weeks, designed to propel them swiftly into the job market. 
 Once viewed more as a way to learn flower-arranging or how to work your new computer, noncredit programs have been steadily shifting their focus to the workplace. First-time students use them as a jumping-off point for a career or an entree to higher education (some noncredit courses can be used toward a credit degree). Some take skill-boosting classes to help insulate themselves from a layoff or to chart a new career path.
 The courses are generally listed under the heading of Continuing Education or Lifelong Learning and are sometimes created in cooperation with local industry, labor departments and unions. (Local 338 of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union is paying for Ms. Juarez's program.) 
 Although the classes meet in college buildings and are administered by the college, the teachers are paid through the noncredit class tuition and the programs are not subject to the same lengthy state accreditation process required for degree programs. As a result, courses can sometimes be set up in weeks.
 ''Continuing education has changed,'' said Andrea Morville, assistant dean of Continuing Education at Westchester Community College. She said career programs had gone from about 25 percent to 40 percent of the classes in her division in the last 10 years. 
 Other administrators put their numbers even higher. In Connecticut, about 50 percent of noncredit courses are aimed at job training, said Mary Anne Cox, assistant chancellor for the System of Connecticut Community Colleges. And in New Jersey, the number of registrations for noncredit professional training increased by 20,000 between 2005 and 2007, said Jacob C. Farbman, spokesman for the New Jersey Council of County Colleges.
 Lifestyle-enhancing courses are still popular, of course (Suffolk Community offers basket-weaving this fall), and predominate at some colleges. But at many others, the shift toward job training has broadened into a significant role in stocking the work force.
 Noncredit offerings increasingly read like a roster of where jobs are. Of the 30 occupations for which the Labor Department is predicting the largest national growth in the next eight years, 22 are in areas that do not require a college degree. Most are directly addressed by continuing education.
 Courses in health care, high-skills manufacturing, management, hospitality and culinary arts, and -- as always -- computers are booming, regionally and nationally. But so are many other continuing education programs tailored to the needs of the surrounding community. 
 ''Instead of designing those courses to get state aid, we design courses that will travel well in the workforce,'' said G. Jeremiah Ryan, president of Bergen Community College. 
 Program directors scan the job landscape like doctors seeking a pulse. A new industry requirement, a government regulation, a lifestyle trend or a product release, like the Microsoft Office 2007 program, can send droves of workers back to class. 
 ''I don't plug into my crystal ball and imagine what industry might be interested in, I ask them,'' said Lynn Lederer, director of professional community programs at Middlesex County College in New Jersey. ''I check with industry experts, census figures on demographics, watch the classes that have increased enrollment and maybe add a section of something similar.'' 
 A program on beginning an animal-based business was successful, for example, so she added a veterinary assistant program. Real estate licensing classes may be down, but enrollment spiked in a course on buying foreclosures, Ms. Lederer said. 
 At Westchester, ''green'' lifestyle classes are beginning to migrate to the workforce side, Ms. Morville said. Next spring her college will offer a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification program to builders and others seeking accreditation by the United States Green Building Council, she said.
 Costs vary depending on a course's length and intensity, but tuition for a noncredit program is far less than for an associate's degree. The seven-month Computerized Healthcare Billing and Coding Certificate Program at Bergen Community College in New Jersey, for example, runs $2,995, while a two-year degree program for a medical office assistant costs about $8,500.
 ''It takes much longer to get a degree, where with a noncredit course I can have them in the work force in 16 weeks making between $13 to $18 an hour,'' said David Chrzanowski, director of extended studies at Norwalk Community College in Connecticut.
 While classes are often aimed at entry-level access to the job market, students take them for all sorts of reasons.
 ''Some of them have bachelor's or master's but now they want to learn about information systems,'' said Jennifer Dudley, the continuing education director at Passaic County Community College in New Jersey. Enrollment is up for English as a Second Language study and in a citizenship training course she runs.
 At Essex County College, one of the Labor Department's One-Stop Career Centers is situated at the Newark campus to match the underemployed with noncredit programs, said Mitra Choudhury, director of Training Inc. at the college. Allied health courses are particularly popular, she said.
 Among the biggest areas of growth is customized training for businesses or government agencies, coordinated by the colleges and held on campus or at the business site. Connecticut's 12 community colleges provide such programs to about 600 businesses a year, said Ms. Cox, the assistant chancellor.
 Designed to help workers upgrade skills in a downsizing job market, company-subsidized classes can offer targeted training in areas like management, business writing and high-skill manufacturing. 
 Programs can be started in as little as a few weeks, said James Polo, associate vice president of lifelong learning at Nassau Community College, which recently ran a medical coding program for employees of Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola. Work force training programs also help prepare workers for shudders in the local job market -- for example, when a large hotel breaks ground or a major employer moves out.
 When the Peter Paul plant closed in Naugatuck, Conn., last year, Naugatuck Valley Community College in Waterbury worked closely with the Northwest Regional Workforce Investment Board, a private, nonprofit organization constituted by the General Assembly that administers federal and state funds to dislocated workers for retraining. 
 And when Executive Greetings closed its New Hartford offices several years ago, ''we were able to take a host of those people and turn them into health care employees because they had computer graphic-type skills; you look at a CAT scan and it's a computer graphic,'' said Catherine Awwad, the board's executive director. ''Re-educated at the community college level.''

HEADLINE: A Critic's Cityscape, and Policing the Police: The Blatant Injustice of Expensive Day Care

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The End of Day Care, the Start of the Scramble'' (Nov. 9), about the impending closing of the Berkeley Carroll Child Care Center in Park Slope: 
 While the travails of our city's well-to-do always make for good copy, the article missed the real story. If such an elite institution can't shoulder the expense of opening a new facility, what organization can? New York has a shortage of full-day child care programs on which single parents and working couples of all income levels rely; the city coffers and economy depend in turn on the tax payments and spending of these working families. 
 Streamlining the delay-prone licensing for new programs would lower their startup costs, helping to foster their creation and benefit rich and poor alike. James Ulrich
 Park Slope
 To the Editor:
 Day care is not a luxury. The vast majority of women with preschool-age children work outside the home, and that is generally because of economic necessity.
 Day care like Berkeley Carroll's, provided by professional, trained, certified educators, is not available to most working parents in New York. That is a blatant injustice, and a clear mark of society's social failure to provide equality of opportunity for all children. Gur Melamede

HEADLINE: What's Good for G.M. Is Good for the Army

BYLINE: By WESLEY K. CLARK. 
Wesley K. Clark, a retired Army general and former supreme allied commander of NATO, is a senior fellow at the Burkle Center for International Relations at the University of California at Los Angeles.

DATELINE: Little Rock, Ark. 

 BODY:
 AMERICA'S automobile industry is in desperate trouble. Financial instability, the credit squeeze and closed capital markets are hurting domestic automakers, while decades of competition from foreign producers have eroded market share and consumer loyalty. Some economists question the wisdom of Washington's intervening to help the Big Three, arguing that the automakers should pay the price for their own mistakes or that the market will correct itself. But we must act: aiding the American automobile industry is not only an economic imperative, but also a national security imperative.
 When President Dwight Eisenhower observed that America's greatest strength wasn't its military, but its economy, he must have had companies like General Motors and Ford in mind. Sitting atop a vast pyramid of tool makers, steel producers, fabricators and component manufacturers, these companies not only produced the tanks and trucks that helped win World War II, but also lent their technology to aircraft and ship manufacturing. The United States truly became the arsenal of democracy. 
 During the 1950s, advances in aviation, missiles, satellites and electronics made Detroit seem a little old-fashioned in dealing with the threat of the Soviet Union. The Army's requests for new trucks and other basic transportation usually came out a loser in budget battles against missile technology and new modifications for the latest supersonic jet fighter. Not only were airplanes far sexier but they also counted as part of our military ''tooth,'' while much of the land forces' needs were ''tail.'' And in those days, ''more teeth, less tail'' had become a key concept in military spending. 
 But in 1991, the Persian Gulf war demonstrated the awesome utility of American land power, and the Humvee (and its civilian version, the Hummer) became a star. Likewise, the ubiquitous homemade bombs of the current Iraq insurgency have led to the development of innovative armor-protected wheeled vehicles for American forces, as well as improvements in our fleets of Humvees, tanks, armored fighting vehicles, trucks and cargo carriers. 
 In a little more than a year, the Army has procured and fielded in Iraq more than a thousand so-called mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles. The lives of hundreds of soldiers and marines have been saved, and their tasks made more achievable, by the efforts of the American automotive industry. And unlike in World War II, America didn't have to divert much civilian capacity to meet these military needs. Without a vigorous automotive sector, those needs could not have been quickly met.
 More challenges lie ahead for our military, and to meet them we need a strong industrial base. For years the military has sought better sources of electric power in its vehicles -- necessary to allow troops to monitor their radios with diesel engines off, to support increasingly high-powered communications technology, and eventually to support electric propulsion and innovative armaments like directed-energy weapons. In sum, this greater use of electricity will increase combat power while reducing our footprint. Much research and development spending has gone into these programs over the years, but nothing on the manufacturing scale we really need. 
 Now, though, as Detroit moves to plug-in hybrids and electric-drive technology, the scale problem can be remedied. Automakers are developing innovative electric motors, many with permanent magnet technology, that will have immediate military use. And only the auto industry, with its vast purchasing power, is able to establish a domestic advanced battery industry. Likewise, domestic fuel cell production -- which will undoubtedly have many critical military applications -- depends on a vibrant car industry.
 To be sure, the public should demand transformation and new standards in the auto industry before paying to keep it alive. And we should insist that Detroit's goals include putting America in first place in hybrid and electric automotive technology, reducing the emissions of the country's transportation fleet, and strengthening our competitiveness abroad.
 This should be no giveaway. Instead, it is a historic opportunity to get it right in Detroit for the good of the country. But Americans must bear in mind that any federal assistance plan would not be just an economic measure. This is, fundamentally, about national security.

HEADLINE: South Korea Joins Lucrative Practice of Inviting Medical Tourists to Its Hospitals

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
In this city's Apgujeong district, famous for its high-end boutiques and plastic surgeons, tourist buses unload Chinese and Japanese visitors looking for a nip and tuck as part of their packaged tour.
 On the resort island of Jeju, the government is building Health Care Town, a 370-acre complex of medical clinics and upscale apartments surrounded by 18-hole golf courses and scenic beaches, to lure foreigners in need of medical care.
 West of Seoul, on the muddy beaches of Inchon where American troops splashed ashore 58 years ago to fight in the Korean War, a new steel-and-glass town is rising to attract foreign visitors, including medical tourists.
 South Korea has joined Thailand, Singapore, India and other Asian nations in the lucrative business of medical tourism. Heart bypasses, spinal surgery, hip-joint replacements, cosmetic surgery -- procedures that may cost tens of thousands of dollars in the United States -- can often be done for one-third or even one-tenth of the cost in Asia, with much shorter waiting times and by specialists often trained in the West. 
 Americans fleeing the high cost of medicine at home have spurred the trend. Last year, 750,000 Americans sought cheaper treatment abroad, a figure projected to reach 6 million by 2010, according to a recent study by the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, a consultancy. Asian nations are also wooing wealthy Middle Eastern patients who have found it more difficult to get a visa to enter the United States since the 2001 terrorist attacks.
 The number of foreigners coming to South Korea for medical care is still a fraction of those getting treatment in India, Thailand and Singapore, industry officials said. But clinics and the South Korean government are trying hard to attract these tourists, who not only bring in money for cash-strapped hospitals but also help the economy by staying on to shop and sightsee after their procedure is over. 
 The government has revised immigration rules to allow foreign patients and their families to get long-term medical visas and altered laws to permit local hospitals to form joint ventures with foreign hospitals in some cases. 
 When Hassan and Fatima Al-Abdulla of Qatar arrived in Seoul in October, they found a car and an English-speaking nurse waiting at the airport. 
 Soon they were checking into the Wooridul Spine Hospital so Ms. Abdulla could have surgery for her chronic back and leg pain.
 Mr. Abdulla found his wife's hospital room -- furnished with a television, broadband Internet access, private bathroom, sofas and an extra bed -- so comfortable that he decided to stay with her rather than go to a hotel. 
 Ms. Abdulla had all her pre-surgical tests the day she arrived. The next day, she was on an operating table. 
 ''I feel very good,'' she said five days after her surgery. ''I can walk and shop now.''
 Mr. Abdulla said he and his wife were now eager to visit the stores and museums in Seoul, ''probably spending more on shopping than in the medical center.''
 Wooridul Spine Hospital said it expected to draw about 1,000 foreign patients and $1 million in revenue from their treatments in 2008, its third year of wooing foreigners. It said its patients hailed from 47 countries, with about a third from the United States. 
 Wooridul plans to build a hospital branch, apartments, a concert hall and an art museum on the Jeju island as part of its medical tourism offerings, in addition to the golf course it has already built, said Lee Mi-jeong, a Wooridul spokeswoman.
 ''We believe this is a major future industry for our island,'' said Kim Kyung-taeg, head of the government-run Jeju Development Center. ''The town will specialize in medical checkups, long-term convalescence and procedures Korean doctors do well and cheaply, such as plastic surgery and dentistry.''
 No government records are available on how many medical tourists come to South Korea. But a survey of 29 hospitals showed that they treated 38,822 uninsured foreign patients -- excluding certain categories like long-term Korean expatriates -- between January and August, compared with 15,680 in 2007, according to the government-financed Korea Health Industry Development Institute. 
 It said 25 percent of those patients were from the United States, and 10 percent each were from China and Japan. 
 Medical fees are strictly controlled by the government as part of a national health insurance program, but hospitals like Wooridul can negotiate fees with foreign patients without interference from insurance authorities. 
 Gregory Kellstrom, a civilian forklift operator at the American military base in Seoul, decided to go to Wooridul recently to get spinal scans and medication for his back and hip problems instead of returning to the United States. 
 ''For me personally, this is not about money,'' said Mr. Kellstrom, 42, who paid out of his own pocket but planned to apply for reimbursement from his American insurer. 
 ''In the States, it will probably take easily six months just to get the treatment I have here in one day,'' he said. 
 Baialinova Dariakul, 49, the wife of a wealthy businessman in Kyrgyzstan, said she came to Wooridul for treatment for her spinal tumor because it was unavailable at home. Fumiko Yamada, 75, a Tokyo resident who recently had a back operation at Wooridul, said she would have had to wait years to get an appointment with a leading Japanese surgeon who performs the same operation.
 Some Koreans fear that social inequality will grow if medical resources and skilled workers migrate from public health care to better-paying jobs that cater to foreigners, said Dr. Yoon Dae-hyun, a psychiatrist at the Healthcare System Gangnam Center at Seoul National University Hospital. But he added that the effort to attract foreigners could inspire more local hospitals to upgrade their services. 
 ''There isn't much of a gap anymore between the good hospitals in Asia and the United States,'' he said.
 His center plans to open a marketing office in Los Angeles, and hopes to attract medical tourists from the pool of two million Korean-Americans. Foreigners who can document Korean ancestry can qualify for the South Korean national health insurance.
 Sally Im, a Korean-American from Honolulu, recently traveled to Wooridul for back surgery. After her husband paid two months' worth of premiums -- about $90 -- on their arrival, a portion of Ms. Im's medical bill was covered by the South Korean government. The couple ended up spending $3,200, rather than the $30,000 that her operation would have cost in the United States, Wooridul said.
 Not everyone in South Korea is happy about such arrangements, fearing that ethnic Koreans from abroad could become a drag on the national insurance coffers. There is talk of limiting benefits to long-term residents. 
 The Ims, meanwhile, were happy that they had an alternative to the American medical system.
 ''We met a good doctor and had good surgery,'' said Ms. Im's husband, Stan. ''We feel very lucky.''

HEADLINE: Meeting Higher Standards

BYLINE: By DON SHERMAN

 BODY:
THERE'S more to the fuel-economy numbers on a vehicle's window sticker than guidance for new-car shoppers, which explains why automakers work hard to get the best possible results on the federal tests. 
 Under the authority of the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring automakers to comply with tailpipe emission standards. The compliance test simulates rush-hour travel in Los Angeles; a car is driven on rollers while its exhaust is collected for analysis.
 One spinoff from the emissions-certification process is the E.P.A.'s measure of fuel economy, which is a calculation based on the carbon content of the exhaust gas. City mileage test results were first published for new-car buyers in 1973, followed by highway mileage estimates in 1975.
 The Energy Policy Conservation Act of 1975 directed the agency to require that automakers post mileage estimates on the window stickers of new cars and light-duty trucks. In an attempt to improve new-car mileage to 27.5 mpg by 1985, the first Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standard was established. An automaker's CAFE number is a sales-weighted average of mileage for its light-vehicle fleet. 
 Manufacturers are penalized for each vehicle they sell that does not meet the standard. From 1983 to 2006, automakers have paid fines as high as $30 million a year, for a total of $735 million over the 24-year period. DON SHERMAN

HEADLINE: SAT Pressure Is On, and Even Online Prepsters Noodge

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP. 
E-mail: parenting@nytimes.com

DATELINE: CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 THERE are thousands of SAT prep courses, but Laura Wilson, founder of a new online company, Wilson Daily Prep, has managed to come up with a fresh angle.
 If teenagers taking her SAT course online do not do their nightly assignment, they get a warning e-mail message. And if they still don't do it, they are put on her Slacker list, and then Mrs. Wilson, or someone from her staff, picks up the phone in the office here, calls the slacker's parents and rats out their kids. ''I'm the Mother Noodge,'' Mrs. Wilson said. ''Nobody noodges like I noodge.''
 ''They're always surprised to hear there's a voice reaching out from behind the computer,'' said Melissa Slive, a staff member busy making calls to rat out 23 kids one recent morning. ''They don't think anyone is watching or paying attention.''
 While there's no scientific data yet, everyone's pretty sure what happens next. ''The kids get yelled at,'' Mrs. Wilson said. 
 This was the story of Nick Torcivia, 16, a junior at Niskayuna High, three hours north of here in suburban Albany. Nick is a well-adjusted, typically overprogrammed, all-American boy (A-/B+ grades, plays three sports, has a part-time job) who leaves for school at 6:30 each morning, doesn't get home until 7:30 most nights and then has several hours of homework. Free time? ''Not really,'' Nick said.
 Nick figured a way to buy a few measly minutes of peace by gaming the online SAT course his mother signed him up for. He realized that an automated warning e-mail message would not be generated until he missed six nights of homework. So he'd skip five, then do it.
 Alas, poor Nick. Little did he know that the Wilson SAT prep slacker squad scans nightly homework logs for just such suspicious patterns.
 Ring, ring, ring. ''When I told him we got a phone call,'' said Nick's mom, Patrice Torcivia, ''his eyes popped out.''
 ''I was kind of surprised,'' admitted Nick. ''I didn't realize they'd call, like -- your parents.''
 ''He tried to say, 'No, I've been doing it, I've been doing it,' '' Ms. Torcivia said. ''Then he said, 'Well, maybe I haven't, but I will.' '' Right. While the mother had no plans to abandon Nick in Nebraska, she knew she had to do something parental. ''I went and yelled at him,'' Ms. Torcivia said.
 Nick learned a tough lesson: SAT prep is always watching.
 The economy may be in freefall, but one industry that continues to look promising is SAT test prep. It is, after all, an industry that thrives on parental fear and misery. And the worse the economy gets, and the more families look to scholarships to offset the insane cost of college, the more important it becomes to ace the SATs.
 In Nick's case, he's a good lacrosse player with good size (6-foot-2) and has good grades at a competitive suburban high school, but as his coach made clear, it's not enough. ''He felt Nick's SATs would be really critical,'' Ms. Torcivia said. ''A really good SAT score could maybe bump him in.'' And since Nick would like to go to Duke or Johns Hopkins, he needs a LOT of bumping in.
 His mother is divorced, has two younger children, works as an instructor at Empire State College, is studying for her doctorate in education and does not have a spare $200,000 lying around. So for Nick, it's either get a scholarship or go to a state school.
 This is bliss for SAT prepsters like Mrs. Wilson, but it's misery for kids like Nick, who have the demographic misfortune of being high school juniors at this moment. For those who thought the pressure on kids was ridiculous when the Dow Jones was at 14,000, stand back; we're about to see ridiculous to the 10th power.
 When Nick was told that there was a time when high school students like himself took no SAT prep -- including his mom and Wilson Prep's Mrs. Wilson, both 41 -- he looked confused. ''No, I didn't know that,'' he said. ''I assumed everybody always did SAT prep. It's all I know.''
 At some moment between the mid-1980s and modern times, we reached the point where failing to provide SAT prep for your son or daughter constitutes child abuse. This was driven home to Mrs. Wilson about eight years ago, when she was nine months pregnant, working as an English teacher here at Horace Greeley High and tutoring a handful of students privately for the SAT. She went into labor, and leaving school, was chased by a boy she was tutoring. ''I told him I was having my baby,'' she recalled. ''He said, 'You'll be back by Friday -- can you tutor me then?' ''
 Oh, the madness.
 In 2001 Mrs. Wilson quit teaching to devote more time to SAT prep. She now has 10 tutors working for her. Besides monitoring the Internet assignments, they see 120 students in her office here; teach three SAT prep courses of 30 students each at the local high school; and serve as SAT prep consultants for another 150 students a year in the nearby Harrison district. ''It keeps growing and growing and growing, oh my God,'' she said. She already has a waiting list for next year.
 She now does less individual tutoring herself, although for those who insist (''what everybody wants is me''), she will take a few students one-on-one for $300 an hour.
 She herself did well on the SAT, though nothing astonishing (''high 600s on the verbal''). But by deconstructing the test, showing kids what to expect and pinpointing questions that keep turning up year after year -- in short, teaching them how to game the stupid thing -- she says she can typically add 200 points to a student's three-test total.
 She knows a million test prep tricks. For the essay, her students go in armed with five fabulous facts, three historical moments, familiarity with two novels and a surefire writing formula. What is the meaning of sacrifice? ''I teach them, 'Sacrifice is X, sacrifice is Y, but most of all sacrifice is XYZ.' '' 
 Last summer, she started the online business, which costs $139 for three months. Every day a student like Nick is supposed to answer six questions, which should take five minutes. ''It's very important they do it every day to internalize the patterns of the test,'' Mrs. Wilson said. ''That's why we monitor the homework. With Nick, he kept showing up on day 6. It's not what I want. I'm all about internalizing.'' There are also interactive vocabulary games and weekly news articles whose themes must be summarized in five words.
 Ms. Torcivia had been shopping online for ''something not $1,000 where he could do a little every day,'' when she found Wilson Prep. She also hired a private SAT tutor, who has come to the house a few times for $30 an hour. (This is what people mean when they say, ''You know, Chappaqua is not Albany.'') Like most parents going through it the first time, she is in a state of shock. ''The biggest difference I see,'' she said, ''is all the help the kids get along the way.''
 Students used to take the SAT for the first time at the end of their junior year, but like a lot of kids now, Nick will take it in December, ''for practice,'' his mother said. ''They say it's good to get used to it.''
 She often feels conflicted between wanting her son to feel the pressure so he'll be focused, and not wanting him to feel the pressure because she loves him, and a nervous breakdown does nobody any good. At one point during the interview at their home, Nick said there was some pressure now, but he felt there would be lots more next year, when he's a senior.
 ''By then,'' his mother said, ''it will be too late.''

HEADLINE: Mapping an Imagined Order, Page by Page

BYLINE: By DOROTHY SPEARS

 BODY:
MATT MULLICAN loves to scribble. ''This is my studio,'' he said on a recent morning, gesturing around the fluorescent-lighted space in Lower Manhattan that serves as a workshop, office, storage room and clearinghouse for his artwork. ''But I don't really work here. My studio is in my notebook, and where I travel.'' 
 As if to prove the point, he plucked a sketchbook off a metal bookshelf and opened it. 
 A Christmas gift from his parents dated Dec. 26, 1970, it was filled in a single day by Mr. Mullican, now 57, when he was still a high school senior. A miniature tour of Pop Art history, it is strikingly precocious. 
 Inside, a colored-pencil sketch of a spoon dunked in coffee uncannily channels Claes Oldenburg. Contour drawings of a fountain pen and a pencil mimic the spirit and stylish lines of Andy Warhol. A series of drawings depict both the ingredient (lighter fluid) and the tool (a spoon) used for Robert Rauschenberg's famous photo-transfer process. 
 And yet the elongated scrawl of the artist's own name and a drawing of an automobile juxtaposed with the words ''fast car'' written in the shape of a vehicle, is all Mr. Mullican. 
 ''I used to be really into Formula One race cars,'' he said. Judging from the way his drawings correspond to the words alongside them, he was also clearly interested in exploring how both pictures and words trigger human responses.
 Mr. Mullican's high school notebook foreshadows what has become for him a career-long investigation: How do we all insert ourselves into the imagery that bombards us every day? Why does the pain of another person, or even a stick figure, become our own? What is the basis of human empathy? How can thoughts and emotions be communicated visually?
 ''It's all about projection,'' Mr. Mullican said. ''I'm sitting in front of you now, and you're seeing me. But you're also seeing lots of other things, based on your own experiences.''
 This ''subject-object'' divide, as it is known in philosophical circles, is nothing new, according to Joao Ribas, a curator at the Drawing Center in SoHo. But what intrigues him about Mr. Mullican's work, he said, was ''the way Matt attempts to collapse this split through the medium of drawing.'' 
 That process is explored in ''Matt Mullican: A Drawing Translates the Way of Thinking,'' an exhibition that opens Friday at the center. Featuring more than 100 artworks made over 35 years, it includes Mr. Mullican's stick-figure sketches, videos of him drawing while under hypnosis, large-scale rubbings based on original works on paper that have since been photocopied and cut out, and vitrines displaying -- you guessed it -- notebooks. 
 ''Matt always carries a notebook around,'' said the artist John Baldessari, the master of California conceptualism and a former teacher to Mr. Mullican. ''He's always jotting things down. He has a very fertile imagination.''
 Mr. Mullican has been traveling quite a lot in recent months. In September and October, for example, a mini-retrospective of his mixed-media work at Gallery Klosterfelde in Berlin overlapped with a show of his monumental rubbings at the Karsten Schubert gallery in London. He is also one of 40 artists from 20 countries exhibiting at the Sao Paulo Biennial in Brazil through Dec. 6. 
 Mr. Mullican's mad-scientist-style musings have taken a variety of forms, from virtual tours conducted via computer and 3D goggles to color-coded charts, banners, maps and architectural models. Etched granite sculptures commissioned by, among others, the Metropolitan Transit Authority in New York, the Swiss Bank Corporation and Middlebury College in Vermont are chock full of ideas about how the universe is ordered. And in decades of performances given while under hypnosis, Mr. Mullican has consistently exposed the private realm of his unconscious to public scrutiny in the hope of tapping universal patterns of behavior.
 These performances typically begin when the hypnotized Mr. Mullican shuffles out onto the stage, dazed and squinting. But by the time they end, he has often managed to draw an array of words and symbols on an enormous sheet of paper. ''I would never say what is the basis of my work,'' Mr. Mullican said. ''That's too big a statement.'' But he will allow that, ''to a degree, drawing is at the core of my practice.'' 
 Drawing, that is, and talking.
 Mr. Mullican's fascination with both dates back to his early childhood. Born in 1951 in Santa Monica, Calif., to Luchita Hurtado, a Surrealist painter from Venezuela, and the American painter Lee Mullican, he recalls that, ''before I could even talk, I would see my father put a painting on the wall to discuss it with friends.'' Mr. Mullican's response as a toddler was to make a drawing of his own and stick it on the wall. Inevitably the drawing would fall, he said, and he would stand before an empty wall, spouting gibberish.
 In spite of his parents' artistic pedigrees -- Morris Graves, Mark Tobey and Isamu Noguchi were among their long Who's Who of artist friends -- the family was often financially strapped. In an effort to economize, they moved in 1955 to Caracas, Venezuela, where Mr. Mullican said, ''I spoke only Spanish, and forgot all of my English.'' Then in 1956 they resettled in New York City, and, he said, ''I relearned English and forgot all my Spanish.''
 To make sense of his linguistic upheaval, Mr. Mullican began piecing together the signs and symbols of distant cultures and multiple time periods in much the way that his father, a cartographer for the United States Army during World War II, had learned to translate vast bodies of land and sea into an intricate series of pattern and lines. 
 He was also influenced by his parents' collection of Oceanic and tribal art. New Guinea architectural posts, Navajo rugs and totem poles purchased cheaply during the family's extensive travels ''just filled up the house,'' he recalled.
 ''Every single object depicted some kind of cosmology,'' he said.
 In 1959, when his father won a Guggenheim fellowship, the family moved to Rome, and the young Mullican briefly dreamed of becoming an archaeologist. His parents took him to Pompeii, he said, and ''I was totally into it.'' 
 Back in Los Angeles he experienced an epiphany when he saw Mr. Oldenburg's sculptures of a giant upside-down ice cream cone and a hamburger at Virginia Dwan's gallery. Captivated by what he called ''both the color, and the Surrealist idea of blowing up a small object into this big abstract thing,'' Mr. Mullican became a devotee of Pop Art while amassing a collection of first-edition comic books.
 Yet his itinerant upbringing took a toll. ''My school record was horrible,'' he said. Between his academic struggles and his mother's insistence that he repeat 10th grade to avoid the Vietnam-era draft, he said, he was almost 20 when he graduated from high school. By that time he had already bought a Rapidograph pen and had filled notebook after notebook.
 Before graduating he won a $1,000 college scholarship through a school art competition with his notebooks and large-scale drawings. An announcement was made over the school's public-address system. 
 ''I was such a nobody,'' Mr. Mullican said. ''Almost a nonperson. I had learned how to disappear. So that was an exciting moment for me.''
 Buoyed, he entered the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, where he befriended the artists David Salle, James Welling, Troy Brauntuch and Jack Goldstein and enrolled in Mr. Baldessari's fabled ''Post-Studio Art'' course.Asked what he remembered best about the young Mr. Mullican, Mr. Baldessari said: ''His mind. I couldn't shut him off.'' 
 For a student exhibition in their windowless third-floor classroom, he recalled, Mr. Mullican tacked a dried leaf to the wall. Then, positioning five students at strategic intervals inside and outside the building, Mr. Mullican handed each of them a mirror. By tilting the mirrors, they directed sunlight from outside, up the stairs, down a corridor, and onto the classroom wall, where Mr. Mullican used a magnifying glass to burn the leaf.
 Reminded of this work, he laughed. ''Oh, right,'' he said. ''That's when I really got John's attention.'' The two remain friends, and collaborated on a project last spring at Tracy Williams, Mr. Mullican's gallery in Greenwich Village.
 Over the last three decades, Mr. Mullican said, he began exhibiting with high-profile dealers like Mary Boone and Barbara Gladstone. But because his cerebral multidisciplinary work has never been an easy sell, he said, he also began working with a large pool of dealers internationally. While commissions from schools, corporations and governments have helped him make ends meet, he said, his midcareer period has been something of a grind. ''Once you go through that,'' he said, ''you're humbled. It just tests your obsession.''
 Yet recently, Mr. Mullican said, ''people finally seem to be understanding what I'm up to.'' Having seen one of his rubbings or a flag or a series of drawings at an art fair, he said, a member of the art cognoscenti may decide to call him up. Now that interest in his work has quickened, he is preparing for shows at the Stuk Kunstencentrum in Leuven, Belgium; the Haus der Kunst in Munich; and the Nouveau Musee/Institut d'Art Contemporain in Villeurbanne, France, near Lyon. 
 Mr. Mullican is at a loss to explain the flurry of exhibitions. At the same time, he said, he is feeling more mortal these days.
 ''It's odd,'' he said, shaking his head and sighing. ''I've been doing this for what? Almost 40 years? Looking at your old work, you're also looking at your life.''
 Then his brow furrowed, and he grabbed a notebook.

HEADLINE: Skyline's Forecast: Only Partly Cloudy

BYLINE: By CAROLINE H. DWORIN

 BODY:
PRECISELY how the economic crisis will leave its imprint on the architectural development of New York has yet to be determined. It's not clear how plummeting stocks, rising unemployment and a stunted mortgage industry will mark the city's skyline.
 But one person who can offer some educated guesses is Andrew Scott Dolkart, an associate professor of historic preservation at the Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. 
 Mr. Dolkart, who lives in Upper Manhattan and who late last month was named director of the school's historic preservation program, is only 56. Yet he seems to know, with intimacy and affection, what happened on the city's streets centuries before his birth. His careful attention to how the trends, politics and finances of the times shaped urban infrastructure informs his thoughts about what the current economic troubles might mean for the years ahead. 
 Professor Dolkart, a slightly built man with glasses, curly red hair and a neat mustache, is currently teaching a class on housing in New York during the Depression. One recent afternoon, he sat among his books in his office in Morningside Heights and talked about how the mess on Wall Street might affect construction on other streets around town.CAROLINE H. DWORIN
 The myth is that the stock market crashed in the '20s, and new construction stopped. And that's pretty much true for commercial buildings -- office buildings -- with the exception of Rockefeller Center, which is a unique story.
 Major commercial skyscraper construction did pretty much stop. But residential development did not stop. There was a lot of privately funded residential construction during the 1930s, although there was certainly a major slowdown. The Depression had a huge impact on architects and construction workers; there was a huge amount of unemployment. 
 I have found in more recent downturns in the economy, in the '80s, for example, that a lot of very prominent architects who mostly designed new buildings, like James Polshek or Hugh Hardy, started doing a lot more preservation work because that was what there was to do. 
 You can't blame them. When new construction declines, preservation becomes a really important aspect of what architectural offices do. 
 When I was a student here, James Marston Fitch, who founded the preservation program here -- my chair is named for him -- he said, only half joking, that depressions were very good for preservation because there wasn't the money to demolish buildings.
 It's a little premature to know exactly what the impact will be of what's happening now. But if history is a guide, preservation does relatively well. 
 I think new construction is going to take a nose dive -- especially residential, because we've been so overbuilt in fringe areas of the city, and I think a lot of new residential buildings are going to have a lot of trouble. 
 I was doing a project recently in Clinton Hill, in Brooklyn, and I wandered east into what was always a fringe area, an industrial area between Clinton Hill and Bedford-Stuyvesant. People were building luxury apartment houses! And I was thinking, even then, a couple of years ago, why would I spend a million dollars to live on the corner of Quincy and Franklin Streets, which is basically in the middle of nowhere? It's not really in a neighborhood at all. 
 I think buildings like that are going to suffer. Their developers invested in areas where people are not going to be so likely to spend that much money. 
 It's hard to see signs of prior economic slumps now because we've gone through such a boom period. I remember the last economic downturn, in the '80s. I remember that, at the time, high-end investment (or what some people would call gentrification, which is a word I don't really like) was occurring in the East Village, and it was just beginning to move towards Tompkins Square, and it was occurring in Manhattan Valley, the area east of Broadway and south of 110th Street. 
 Then the economy went down, and, as those were the fringe areas, they really lost the most. When prices go down, people go to more stable neighborhoods, neighborhoods with more amenities, assuming they can afford it. 
 I think the same thing is probably going to happen again, although there aren't so many fringe areas anymore. These last few years of economic boom have really changed the face of the city. There are still going to be a lot of people in New York with good jobs and good salaries. If they want to buy a row house, prices may come down a bit. So I think the demand for those kinds of houses -- old buildings in stable areas, or beautiful quality housing -- will continue.
 I was on a tour in the Detroit area once, and we went to this house, this huge estate that had been built in the 1920s. And somebody said something to me, that when they said it was so obvious: one of those things you needed somebody else to say to you, and you think: ''Oh, yeah! Why didn't I think of that?'' They said, ''If you had money during the Depression, you could buy more for less.'' And I think that that's really true. Not everybody's going to be laid off by Lehman Brothers.

A Voice of Reason

 To the Editor:
 Re ''Her New York'' (Nov. 9), Phillip Lopate's interview with the architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable:
 Thank you, Ada Louise Huxtable. As a resident of West 54th Street, I am particularly sensitive to the tower planned by Hines development near the Museum of Modern Art (designed by Jean Nouvel), with which they intend to devastate our neighborhood.
 As Ms. Huxtable warns, developers hire star architects to make oversized and expensive projects palatable; yet Rockefeller made a profit on Rockefeller Center with a complex, humanistic plan. RitaSue Siegel 
 Midtown
 To the Editor:
 In his interview, Mr. Lopate tells Ms. Huxtable that she ''lambasted New York for being timid, being caught in an Art Deco time warp.'' Art Deco is an unappreciated treasure. During most of the 20th century, artists, composers and painters were burdened by the need to be original. They didn't have the originality to escape this burden. 
 Composers, for example, who wrote atonal music were free to write ugly compositions, since music exists in its own universe. Architects, on the other hand, design buildings that have to stand up and serve a practical purpose. While composers were churning out 12-tone pieces, architects designed not only the Chrysler Building but glorious, multicolored, unappreciated six-story apartment houses on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, in Midwood, Brooklyn, and in many other neighborhoods.
 Nowhere in the interview did I find anything about unity. Parisian streets are beautiful not so much because of their buildings, but because as a group they turn the street into a work of art. The same is true in New York's streets of row houses (West 11th, for example) or apartment houses (West End Avenue). Architectural critics, even those as sensitive as Ms. Huxtable, don't write about streets as unities. George Jochnowitz
 Greenwich Village
 To the Editor:
 Ada Louise Huxtable rocks! From the first time I saw her byline (and thought, with that marvelous moniker, she should be played by Margaret Dumont in a Marx Brothers movie) and read her insightful, counterintuitive articles and essays, she has been my heroine. 
 Thanks to that deft interview, and her new book, the regal and irreplaceable Ms. Huxtable is back where she deserves to be: in the spotlight on the red carpet.
 Peter Stamelman

 To the Editor:
 It is regrettable that the photographs accompanying the article were dated. As it happens, the dazzling Ms. Huxtable is no less beautiful now than she was 20 or 30 years ago. Joel Conarroe

 Mission: To Protect
 And Serve Summonses
 To the Editor:
 I instantly recognized Daniel Krieger's essay about receiving a summons for riding a bike in Central Park after 1 a.m. (''Busted in the Park,'' New York Observed, Nov. 2). The same thing happened to me one night this past summer.
 While attempting to cross the 72nd Street drive on my bicycle late one evening, I was stopped by an officer. I gave her my license when asked and then was ignored for about 15 minutes. When I asked her if I had done something wrong (I wasn't aware that the park closes at 1 a.m.), she told me to just wait. Wait I did, while she proceeded to write summonses for other unsuspecting cyclists and pedestrians.
 She never really looked directly at me, never directly told me why I was stopped. And when she finally got around to questioning me, she asked me the same questions multiple times, since she was not really listening to me.
 This is the ''protection'' my tax dollar pays for. And as with Mr. Krieger, the judge dismissed my summons without even looking at me. Why don't we all just waste as much of our limited resources as possible? Then we can all go home. Mark Reiter

 The Blatant Injustice
 Of Expensive Day Care
 To the Editor:
 Re ''The End of Day Care, the Start of the Scramble'' (Nov. 9), about the impending closing of the Berkeley Carroll Child Care Center in Park Slope:
 While the travails of our city's well-to-do always make for good copy, the article missed the real story. If such an elite institution can't shoulder the expense of opening a new facility, what organization can? New York has a shortage of full-day child care programs on which single parents and working couples of all income levels rely; the city coffers and economy depend in turn on the tax payments and spending of these working families. 
 Streamlining the delay-prone licensing for new programs would lower their startup costs, helping to foster their creation and benefit rich and poor alike. James Ulrich
 Park Slope
 To the Editor:
 Day care is not a luxury. The vast majority of women with preschool-age children work outside the home, and that is generally because of economic necessity.
 Day care like Berkeley Carroll's, provided by professional, trained, certified educators, is not available to most working parents in New York. That is a blatant injustice, and a clear mark of society's social failure to provide equality of opportunity for all children. Gur Melamede

HEADLINE: A Boardwalk Is Poised for Revival. Then the Economy Tanks.

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: ASBURY PARK, N.J. 

 BODY:
 Yes, it is something of a bummer.
 Three or four decades of stops and starts -- mostly stops -- in this legendarily faded and ill-starred stretch of the Jersey Shore and finally, finally, things seem to reach a critical mass. Revived music halls of all shapes and sizes. Cool bars, a Mexican taqueria, a surfer shop, glass blowers and a potter on the Boardwalk. The renovated Convention Hall and Paramount Theater with its ''Greetings From Asbury Park'' sign out front. And the famous Thursday evening ''doggy yappy hour'' for pets at the Wonder Bar.
 The idea is sort of Jersey Shore meets South Beach while still staying Jersey Shore, and it's not nearly as much of a stretch as it might seem. But on a miserable rainy Thursday, with the economy blowing up like a joke cigar, it feels more like Springsteen meets Fellini: The ratty old Howard Johnson is now the hip seaside Salt Water Beach Cafe; and the stalled Esperanza condominium project on Asbury Park's most famous lot of death, known for its doomed projects, is a hulking reminder of what has gone wrong in the midst of plenty that seems to be going right. 
 Still, those who've bet their future that there really is one in a place that a decade ago was about as much of a wasteland as you could find in America seem pretty philosophical about the bad timing. Let's face it, we're all feeling our way through the smoke without much of an idea of what's around the corner. So maybe Asbury Park is just like any other place, only more so, one foot just out of the crypt, the other reaching for firm ground, whistling past the graveyard into the great beyond.
 Take Marilyn Schlossbach, a Jersey Shore native and a well-known local restaurateur. Back in the false revival of the 1980s, she lost the land she'd inherited from her parents in a failed restaurant venture. This time, she and her husband are presiding over Pop's Garage, the taqueria; Lightly Salted, the surf shop; and the just-opened Langosta Lounge, billed as a ''global fusion'' restaurant. They are all part of a $60 million investment by the Madison Marquette development firm in the Boardwalk, which this weekend has all its major attractions open for the first time. Altogether, at least $160 million has been invested in an area that a decade ago was a seaside ghost town.
 You might think this is pretty cruel timing, but Ms. Schlossbach, who has seen enough over the years, figures that this is just another hand to play.
 ''There's something about this place that sucks you in,'' she said on Thursday, the ocean a dark, angry swirl outside the window of the lounge. ''You could say it's cursed or you could say it's got karmic energy or you could say it's blessed. I don't know. But there's something about Asbury Park that keeps you coming back. I'm living proof of it. I've already lost and gained and lost and gained a couple of times, but I'm here, and I still want to be here.''
 If not for Bruce Springsteen, whose 1973 debut album, ''Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.,'' turned this place from faded Jersey Shore town to national icon, maybe no one would care all that much about Asbury Park. Developed as a seaside resort in 1871, its Boardwalk became a shore monument in the 1920s. The place waxed and waned over the years, and lurched toward disaster after racial unrest that peaked with the riots of 1970. Then the waterfront slipped into total ruin and abandonment in the early 1990s.
 ''To see people on the Boardwalk in the winter, it's a miracle,'' said Leigh Grahill, who is moving her business, which sells hand-sewn couture, to the arcade in Convention Hall. ''Until last year, you would not find a soul, not a soul, there. I remember when I first started looking at Asbury Park in 1999, parking my car in the middle of the day and not wanting to get out because there was no one there, not a car, not a sound, nothing.''
 Various big residential plans came and went, but, partly because of an influx of gay men and lesbians looking for cheaper alternatives to places like Fire Island, it began coming back around 2000. The residential revival helped bring back downtown, now quite alive with shops and restaurants. Then came the beachfront development, beginning around 2005. From 2007 to 2008, the number of daily beach-access badges sold during the summer increased to 52,000 from 38,000. Live Nation, the concert promoter, signed an agreement to promote music at various locations. 
 After all those years of going nowhere, Asbury Park was clearly going somewhere. And then, boom -- the bottom fell out of the economy.
 A glass-full outlook might say that people need entertainment, that two million people live within 45 minutes of the place, that there's nothing comparable on the shore and that in bad times people might want entertainment closer to home anyway.
 Lance Larson, a veteran musician who helps run the Wonder Bar, figures that Asbury Park has a heritage of music, art and eccentricity that will attract people, tough times or no. 
 ''We have one thing that no one else does, and that's entertainment,'' he said, picking at a cheeseburger on Thursday afternoon. ''It's not just because of Bruce. It's always been that way. I've toured every place, and there's no place like playing here. It's like Parris Island, the boot camp of music. If you can play here, you can play anywhere.''
 And if the economy goes totally in the tank at the start of Asbury Park's big new moment? He shrugs. ''We've been to hell already,'' he said. ''Been there, done that. If we could handle that, we can handle this.''

HEADLINE: In the 'Nantucket of New York,' a Bridge to Agitation

BYLINE: By KATHERINE BINDLEY

 BODY:
BARBARA DOLENSEK, the vice president of the City Island Historical Society, didn't get the chance to wave her sign at the centennial celebration of the Pelham Bay Bridge nearly three weeks ago. 
 But no matter; it wasn't celebration that was on her mind. Ms. Dolensek wanted to protest the city's plans for an entirely different bridge, one a few miles away that was built in 1901 to connect City Island and the Bronx mainland. 
 While the rains foiled her plans, she and other residents will continue to oppose the city's design for the span that will replace the decaying 950-foot-long City Island Bridge. The Department of Transportation has chosen a design featuring cables and a 150-foot tower, one that residents believe is ill-suited to their small nautical community, where buildings can be no higher than about three stories. 
 ''People call it the Nantucket of New York City,'' said Barbara Hoffman, the president of the City Island Garden Club. ''Here they're going to put this monstrosity up.'' 
 Work on the project was supposed to begin in July 2006, but when that did not happen, residents began to wonder if they might be able to have more say. 
 Ms. Hoffman wanted officials to consider a design similar to that of the new Interstate 35W bridge in Minneapolis, which replaced the bridge that collapsed in August 2007. Ms. Dolensek agreed, saying the simple causeway design would be suitable for City Island. ''We prefer to be a little bit quiet,'' she said.
 The city disagrees. Craig Chin, a transportation spokesman, said the cable bridge was more economical and environmentally friendly than the other options; he added that the cable bridge was in keeping with the island's image. 
 ''The new mast-type structure with the tower and the cables -- it imitates the sailboats that are in the City Island community,'' Mr. Chin said, noting, however, that construction had been postponed until 2011 primarily because of city budget concerns.
 The Minneapolis design would not work for City Island, he added, because the approaches would be too long. 
 Over lunch at the City Island Diner the day before the centennial celebration, Ms. Dolensek and Jane Protzman, a board member of the City Island Civic Association, sat side by side, each with a folder marked ''bridge'' and filled with clippings. They discussed what to write on their signs for the protest that never was, and how events like the celebration for the Pelham Bay Bridge made them feel that the City Island Bridge has been slighted. They also discussed their chances for success. 
 ''If they've already sent out and awarded the contracts, there's probably not a lot we can do other than lie down on the bridge when they bring the bulldozers in,'' Ms. Dolensek said with a smile.

HEADLINE: Bankruptcies By Consumers Climb Sharply

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD and JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
The economy's deep troubles are pushing a growing number of already struggling consumers into bankruptcy, often with far more debt than those who filed in previous downturns.
Plummeting home values, dwindling incomes and the near disappearance of credit have proved a potent mixture. While all the usual reasons that distressed borrowers seek bankruptcy -- job loss, medical bills, divorce -- play significant roles, new economic forces are changing the calculus of who can ride out the tough times and who cannot.
The number of personal bankruptcy filings jumped nearly 8 percent in October from September, after marching steadily upward for the last two years, said Mike Bickford, president of Automated Access to Court Electronic Records, a bankruptcy data and management company.
Filings totaled 108,595, surpassing 100,000 for the first time since a law that made it more difficult -- and often twice as expensive -- to file for bankruptcy took effect in 2005. That translated to an average of 4,936 bankruptcies filed each business day last month, up nearly 34 percent from October 2007. 
Robert M. Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law, pointed to the tightening of credit by banks as a significant factor in the increase in October. As banks have pulled back on lending, he said, consumers have been finding it more difficult, and in many cases impossible, to use credit cards, refinance their home mortgages or fall back on their home equity lines to get them through a rough period.
''A credit crunch can drive people into bankruptcy today rather than later as sources of lending dry up,'' Professor Lawless said. ''With the consumer credit tightening and the economy in a nosedive, this pop could just be the beginning of a long-term rise in the bankruptcy filing rate to levels that are even higher than we had before the 2005 bankruptcy law.''
Not only are filings up, but recent filers have had much more credit card debt, often run up in an attempt to keep current on a mortgage that now exceeds the value of their home, bankruptcy lawyers said in interviews.
A recent study found that the typical family who filed for bankruptcy in 2007 was carrying about 21 percent more in secured debts, like mortgages and car loans, and about 44 percent more in unsecured debts, like credit cards and medical and utility bills, than filers in 2001.
Their incomes, meanwhile, remained static over those six years, according to the study, which used data from the 2007 Consumer Bankruptcy Project, a joint effort of law professors, sociologists and physicians. Researchers surveyed 2,500 households nationwide that filed for bankruptcy in February and March 2007.
''Earlier downturns followed strong booms, so families went into recessions with higher incomes and lower debt loads,'' said Elizabeth Warren, a professor at Harvard Law School and, along with Professor Lawless, part of the Bankruptcy Project team. ''But the fundamentals are off for families even before we hit the recession this time, so bankruptcy filings are likely to rise faster.''
Not surprisingly, filings are increasing most rapidly in states where real estate values skyrocketed and then crashed, including Nevada, California and Florida. In Nevada, bankruptcy filings in October were up 70 percent compared with last year. In California, bankruptcies jumped 80 percent in the same period, while Florida's filings rose 62 percent.
In those regions, some people are trying to rescue their homes through bankruptcy proceedings, but many are just as relieved to walk away, shedding layers of debt that otherwise would have taken decades to pay off.
Tony and Carrie Forsyth, both 30, chose not to walk away from their house in Florida. The couple said they thought their financial situation would improve in 2006, when Mr. Forsyth accepted a promotion from his employer, a Michigan food distributor, that required them to move to Florida. But they could not sell their home in Ypsilanti, Mich., so they decided to rent it out.
In June 2006, the couple headed south and bought a house for $220,000 in Tamarac, Fla., with no money down. Five months later, their tenants in Michigan stopped paying, and the family had to carry two mortgage payments, just as the adjustable-rate mortgage on their Michigan home reset to a higher interest rate. They lost the Michigan home to foreclosure in February 2007.
By that time, however, the couple, who have two young daughters, were using credit cards to pay for food, utilities and clothes. After accumulating about $20,000 in debt, they said, they realized that bankruptcy was the only way they could remain in their Florida home, whose value, meanwhile, had plunged 25 percent. They filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection this year, which permitted them to keep the house, and they agreed to repay a portion of their debts over the next three years.
A Chapter 7 bankruptcy, by contrast, provides filers with what is known as a ''fresh start'' because debts are forgiven. In this case, assets are liquidated, though the states allow for various exemptions. To qualify for a Chapter 7, filers need to pass a means test to determine whether they are unable to repay their debts.
Filers who are deemed able to repay a portion of their debts must file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Some debtors choose Chapter 13 because it permits them to save their primary homes from foreclosure, though they are required to catch up on their mortgage payments.
Mr. Forsyth said declaring bankruptcy was a difficult step. ''Because of our Christian background, it didn't feel right,'' he said. ''But there was no other way for us to live and support our family unless we went that route.''
Mrs. Forsyth added: ''We are just rolling with life. You have to eat. You have to have diapers.''
The Forsyths are emblematic of the new forces that have led to the sharp rise in bankruptcy filings. ''Historically, a person would get behind in his mortgage because of a temporarily catastrophic financial event, such as job loss, divorce, illness,'' said Chip Parker, a bankruptcy lawyer in Jacksonville, Fla. ''However, when these adjustable-rate mortgages started resetting from their teaser rate and clients couldn't refinance their way out of trouble, they were getting behind even though there was no catastrophic event.''
Bankruptcy lawyers report that they have been having more consultations with middle-class families with six-figure incomes -- including many who either bought a home during the boom or pulled out most or all of their available home equity just keep to up with the cost of living. Also caught up in the bankruptcies are real estate investors, who hoped to flip properties they had bought near the height of the market.
''There are a lot of foreclosures that haven't taken place yet because people still have available credit,'' said Jeffrey H. Tromberg, a bankruptcy lawyer in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. ''We don't see them until they've maxed out their credit cards.''
A similar pattern has emerged in Las Vegas, where more people are filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection because it makes more financial sense to walk away from their homes. Real estate values have plummeted, and now the local economy is also suffering. Car salesmen and casino dealers are being laid off. Valet parking attendants and masseuses are collecting less in tips.
''My clients are basically good people that got into a home the best way they could and can no longer meet their obligations because their income has gone down,'' said Roger P. Croteau, a lawyer in Las Vegas who concentrates on bankruptcy. ''There is no equity to pay off their credit cards, and they are maxed out. They haven't saved enough because of housing costs.''
Ellen Stoebling, a bankruptcy lawyer in Las Vegas, added: ''People are using their cards to try and hold onto their property for as long as possible in hopes they can somehow talk some sense into their lender and stay in the property.''
The problems are not limited to people with adjustable-rate mortgages and homes that are now worth less than they owe. Job losses are also playing a role. Bankruptcies are also up sharply in Delaware, Rhode Island and Indiana, where the unemployment rates have been climbing.
And, of course, some people continue to seek bankruptcy for the usual reasons.
Lisa Marquis, a 35-year-old mother of five in Indiana, has no medical insurance but has undergone 21 operations in the last nine years, some related to emphysema and other respiratory diseases, and others related to accidents and several miscarriages.
Mrs. Marquis cannot work, but her husband earns $13.50 an hour as a truck driver -- a salary that makes them ineligible for Medicaid but unable to pay their medical bills. Earlier this year, the family had to leave the mobile home they owned because the mold there was making it hard for her to breathe; they moved into a house where they paid more than $600 a month in rent. Mr. Marquis was spending three days a week in court fending off angry creditors, cutting down on the number of hours he could work.
In April, facing more than $114,000 in medical bills and less available overtime work, the Marquises filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy -- the third time in less than 10 years that Mrs. Marquis had to file for protection because of medical bills. Because the latest filing is a Chapter 13, they have agreed to pay some of their debts.
''We could have waited to do a 7,'' Mrs. Marquis said. ''I want to pay my debts. I didn't want to cheat people who helped to save my life.''
Despite the rise in bankruptcies, academics and lawyers say they believe that many others have been discouraged from filing because of the 2005 bankruptcy law.
Ms. Warren, the Harvard law professor, said many borrowers had been left with the mistaken impression that they could no longer file. And, she argued, ''the widespread perception that bankruptcy is not available to help families makes this economic crisis worse.''

HEADLINE: Union Pacific

BYLINE: By JOHN BOWE

 BODY:
I was recently invited to a barbecue on the island of Rota. My host was Senator Paul A. Manglona, the island's highest-ranking elected official. The affair was low-key, like most social events on Pacific islands. The senator's extended family and about a dozen friends sat at picnic tables along the beach, beneath a row of ironwood pines.
 Ten-foot topaz waves pounded the reef 50 yards out. The sky seemed in endless, improbable bloom: cirrus clouds here, rain showers there, patches of sunlight shafting down in between, creamy blues with mercury linings and the odd but frequent rainbow. Behind us, a plateau of outcroppings draped with lush jungle glowed with a misty, erotic, post-drizzle shimmer.
 The spread consisted of taro dishes, ribs, fish with finadene (a sort of soy sauce, onion and lemon concoction) and koko, or pickled green papaya. The grown-ups drank Bud Light and tuba, a local palm wine. A gang of children, shirtless, ragged and fearless, leapt between tidal pools, hunting baby lobsters and squealing in delight with each squirmy catch. 
 What was profound to me about the scene was the disconnect between the stunning beauty of the environment and the nearly disconsolate mood of the adults. Pacific Islanders not famous for cannibalism tend to be known for friendliness, present company included. But I couldn't help noticing that they also seemed rueful, reminiscent in a way of the bittersweet Irish or the stoic, brokenhearted singers of Portuguese fado.
 Sure, Manglona said, Rota's beautiful. But island life is isolated. The perquisites of civilization are far away, the woes of underdevelopment constant and festering. During the Japanese economic boom of the late 1980s, Rota and its sister islands in the Northern Mariana Islands, a three-and-a-half-hour flight south from Tokyo, became Japan's Florida. The islands hosted more than half a million visitors a year, people who came to fish, swim, dive and lease property at skyrocketing prices. But when the Japanese economy stalled in the '90s, so did the islands. They've never recovered.
 What was most frustrating for Manglona was that Rota is a part of the United States. Wasn't that supposed to mean progress? (Rota's median household income is 45 percent below the United States average.) Countries like Japan and Taiwan had offered economic assistance, but the United States doesn't allow Rota to accept foreign aid. Meanwhile, the senator complained, Americans don't even know how to pronounce the locals' name for the island -- not ''Rota,'' as in Nino, or ''Rhoda,'' like the old television show, but ''Luta.'' The implication was clear: it's not fun to be part of a country that has never heard of you, and possibly never will.
 With a population of some 2,000 people scattered over 33 square miles (Manhattan covers about 23), Rota and the Northern Mariana Islands are America's farthest-flung territorial possessions. (Saipan, to the north, with 50,000 or so residents, is the most populous and developed of the group.) The islands, 14 specks of land blowing north from Guam toward Japan, were claimed from the Japanese during World War II and voted in 1975 to join the United States as a commonwealth. Citizens of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands hold United States passports but lack voting representatives in Congress. They neither pay federal income tax nor vote in mainland elections.
 Like many Americans, they earn and spend dollars, eat at McDonald's, embrace each other with rapper handshakes and drive monster trucks. But a large number live much like other Pacific Islanders -- in a tribal, family-oriented society heavy on socializing, ukulele strumming, Spam, barbecuing, betel nut chewing and gracious, if shyly proffered, hospitality. For old-school islanders, conditioned by centuries of isolation, typhoons and a shortage of physical resources, life and culture quite naturally revolve around social ties, manners and relationships.
 Rota, like most of the other Marianas, is populated by locals known as Chamorros and Carolinians, as well as Filipinos, Chinese, Koreans, Bangladeshis and a smattering of American expatriates who serve as teachers, nurses and doctors. I first came to the Marianas to write a book about slavery and labor exploitation of the foreign guest workers on Saipan. During three and a half years of sporadic, long visits, a refrain I heard regularly was that Rota was a great example of what the islands and their people used to be -- friendly and unspoiled by the commonwealth's incomplete experiment with modernity.
 Perverse as it may be to mention it, Rota's forlornness is its strongest attraction. When I arrived at Rota International, I was greeted by . . . well, by no one. And what I found quickly enough was that no matter where I went, I was alone -- like, Robinson Crusoe alone. The island felt like my own private Eden. Hiking through the woods to one of Rota's several waterfalls, I didn't see a soul. I went to a huge cliffside bird sanctuary, overlooking thousands of nesting terns and boobies; one Filipino fisherman passed me, but otherwise the entire sunset was all mine. I spent days with a mile-long beach to myself, reading and loafing in the tidal pools, watching waves crash against the reef. The luxury of total isolation, of having (for once) no vendors, guides or fellow travelers, was palpable and euphoric.
 The island's premier golf course, the Rota Resort and Country Club, was built in the mid-'90s for a reported $200 million and recently sold -- for less than $6 million. An avid golfer friend told me that the links compare favorably with $200- and $300-a-game courses on the Pacific Coast Highway, with stunning ocean views from every hole. But when he plays on Rota, he's the only one there. The same elbow-room factor applies to Rota's world-class scuba sites, latte-stone quarries (pre-Christian ruins with multi-ton, hand-carved stone pillars reminiscent of Easter Island statuary) and a handful of beautiful fruit farms with stunning picnic areas overlooking the Philippine Sea. 
 News travels fast on Rota, and I found that island hospitality runs beyond the locals. The day after I arrived, I was invited to go spearfishing with an expat South African doctor and a teacher from Minnesota. I didn't know the first thing about it, but by the time we exited the harbor, vaulting over enormous swells and zipping along the shoreline in the late-afternoon sun past a reef break like a chain of exploding emeralds, I decided I liked it. We rounded a bend and were set upon by a school of dolphins, chasing us along leap by leap, fairly smiling.
 About 330 feet from a cliff -- with no anchor -- my friends ditched the boat and dived in. They wore carbon-fiber super-flippers about four feet long. As I paddled about in my piddly normal-person flippers, I watched them descend 30, 40 feet below the surface, hovering over passing schools of smaller fish. Then down they'd go, another 20, 30 feet, to surprise the predator fish inevitably trailing behind. It took a few tries, and some five-foot barrucada were narrowly missed, but finally spear hit flesh, blood inked the water, and up came the doctor with a three-pound parrotfish. Suddenly the fish kept coming: pattern fish, tataga, hangne; five pounds, eight pounds, three pounds, seven.
 After half an hour more, the doctor pulled himself up to the boat, panting and laughing. ''Did you see the sharks?'' I think I must have stuttered, ''Sh-sharks?'' ''They kept stealing my fish,'' he said, laughing. I asked him if he'd been frightened, and he snorted. ''They're just like wild dogs. You have to hold your ground and hope they don't get stupid.'' (Whatever. You know, sharks!)
 He and the teacher had brought up about 50 pounds of fish. No one had known where we'd been. We'd needed no permit, insurance or license. And this is what they do for fun on Rota, four or five afternoons a week. In a world with 46,000 visible pieces of plastic per square mile of ocean, I'd seen one piece of litter.
 Creature comforts are unevenly available in Rota. There are only a couple of decent hotels, nothing terribly fancy, and a handful of serviceable restaurants. As my fisherman-doctor friend put it, ''If you live here or even if you visit here, you have to be very self-sufficient or it just doesn't work.'' A visitor would do well to come with a supply of wine, cheese and snacks.
 But if you're the kind of traveler who makes friends easily, a world of commercially unavailable delicacies awaits -- abundant local fruit and virtually endless quantities of sashimi, coconut crabs, even venison from the islands' own deer species. And if you take the time and can afford a smile, it is inevitable that you will be invited to partake of local life.
 Last year, Manglona won another term (continuing his 20-year run), and a referendum was passed, allowing casino gambling on the island. Rota's voters hope that the casinos will bring soldier-tourists from the military base on Guam, 40 miles to the south, which is set to expand in the coming years. Perhaps the economy will reignite and the islanders will resume a trajectory toward American standards of living. But given the history and squalor of casino-driven economies elsewhere, this seems optimistic.
 The last day I spent on the island, I visited some petroglyphs, cave paintings thousands of years old. The door to the cave is locked, and to get the key, you have to ask someone who knows someone who knows someone who draws you a bad map that's hard to follow. This is, of course, part of what keeps such sites so pristine and therefore fun to visit. En route to the caves, I got lost and approached a farmhouse for directions. A shy housewife, listening to Beyonce, opened the door. When I asked her about the cave paintings, she looked dubious. ''You'll have to ask my husband.'' She called out at the top of her lungs: ''Edwin! Edwin!''
 Edwin came from feeding the pigs, a pleasant, humble man with muddy rubber boots, lathering up with antibacterial foam in order to shake my hand. He looked at the map of the petroglyph site, which was, at most, half a mile from his house. This land has undoubtedly been in his family for generations. And yet at first, when asked about how to get to the caves, he didn't seem to know anything about it.
 As I mentioned, culture -- and knowledge -- in Micronesia is socially oriented. Edwin's ancestors could navigate from one improbably tiny dot in the ocean using only the stars, wind and waves. Maps didn't make sense. The question of where a cave was didn't make sense either. It wasn't a matter of north, south, right, left, half a mile here or a quarter-mile there. Finally, he smiled. Of course he knew where the caves were. Right by his in-laws' house: ''You go that way. Past the house of Cabrera!''

 BODY:
For a cafe that is famous for its coffee, in a city that serves nothing but, Tazza d'Oro in Tel Aviv has surprisingly tasty ravioli. What gave Sigalit Landau pause, however, was the service charge tacked onto the bill for it. ''I'm surprised they still have this,'' she said, glancing toward the bored young man at the cafe's garden gate. ''It's for the security.'' 
 The young man was not a bouncer. His job was to throw himself into the path of any suicide bomber who might approach. None have appeared here for some time, at least not since the peak of the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, that plagued the first half of the decade. The metal detectors that were once ubiquitous in public places are gone. There are no tanks in the streets or any noticeable military presence anywhere. Not in Tel Aviv. 
 This Mediterranean city is in the midst of a makeover, and it's not just cosmetic. Signs of gentrification are everywhere, including tony Neve Tzedek, the century-old residential neighborhood where Tazza d'Oro is situated. A boom in technology that has given Israel's economy a lift is also driving the growth of Tel Aviv's art scene, attracting new galleries and collectors, and producing a pool of artists who are making waves both at home and abroad. 
 Landau, a 39-year-old artist with cropped red hair, is one of the bigger names among them. Last spring, she showed a beautiful but menacing installation of recent videos and barbed-wire sculptures barnacled with salt from the Dead Sea at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Another local artist, Yael Bartana, who mines a rich vein of both social and political propaganda in her videos, is currently showing work at the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in Queens. 
 And while other Israeli-born artists are seeing their work take off internationally, with some even dividing their time between Tel Aviv and more art-centric cities like Berlin and London, they find their richest source of material back home. ''When you are always at the center, you live in a valley,'' Landau said. She was talking about New York, where she studied at Cooper Union. ''When you live on the periphery, you're on a mountain. It gives you perspective.''
 But that is not the only reason Israeli art has found its feet. Once given to a certain histrionic expressionism, it has suddenly acquired something else: a sense of humor. ''We're not all about occupation and victimization,'' said Joshua Simon, a 29-year-old curator and art magazine editor. He was standing in Orna and Ella, a cafe on semi-fashionable Sheinkin Street, on the edge of the district known as the heart of Tel Aviv. ''Israel thinks the Palestinians are the problem,'' Simon said. ''Artists think it's the occupation. Humor is important.'' This underscores the live-for-today attitude that years of conflict have created in Tel Aviv, an obsessively secular city where everyone seems to know everyone else, at least within the arts community. 
 Landau works out of two studios in Florentin, a dilapidated bohemian neighborhood in south central Tel Aviv. It has an unusual mix of concrete Bauhaus apartment houses and low factory buildings on twisting streets that come alive late at night, when nightclubs like Comfort 13 -- one of the largest, with two dance floors -- open their graffiti-covered doors. To Landau's dismay, the neighborhood is losing some of its gritty character (and low rents) with development that includes a Shaker-style village going up on the area's oldest street. ''This is the Promised Land,'' she says. ''Utopia is taken seriously here, and this is cutting the soul out of downtown.''
 Although much of the larger metropolis looks just as shabby, a preservation effort spearheaded by Unesco's 2003 World Heritage Site listing of the White City -- a section with hundreds of Bauhaus-style stucco buildings -- is reviving the streets around Rothschild Boulevard, the broad Via Veneto of Tel Aviv. ''I don't want this to be a Bauhaus Disneyland,'' says Mati Broudo, an entrepreneur who owns the Brasserie M & R, a popular 24-hour restaurant opposite the plaza where Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated in 1995. 
 Six months ago, Broudo converted one 1930s Bauhaus-style mansion into the Hotel Montefiore, a sleek 12-room boutique hotel and restaurant. Broudo has earmarked another nearby Unesco-protected building for a new apartment-hotel hybrid. He's turning the ground floor and basement into a 5,000-square-foot exhibition space, Rothschild 69, which will also publish a new monthly art magazine, Programma. Still under construction, it had a trial run as an artists' lounge during the recent opening of the first Art TLV, an annual citywide festival of exhibitions created to bring more international artists, curators and collectors to Tel Aviv. 
 Miri Segal, a Tel Aviv artist who shows her video and sound pieces in Europe, would welcome that. ''Israeli artists are marginalized by virtue of where they are,'' she said. ''How well you do depends on what you do somewhere else.'' That could change next year, when Art TLV opens at around the same time as the Istanbul Biennial, now a regular stop on the international art-fair circuit. ''We have few collectors and many buyers, people who buy art because it's trendy and they like it,'' says Irit Fine-Sommer, who opened her Sommer Contemporary Art in an elegant Rothschild Boulevard town house nine years ago, when there were no others. Fine-Sommer represents a mix of established European, American and Israeli artists, including Rineke Dijkstra, Darren Almond and Yael Bartana. At least 10 other galleries, some, like Braverman and Noga, with rosters of emerging artists, have opened nearby in the last three years. 
 Until recently, Israeli art was all about war and the Palestinian conflict because that's what foreign curators were interested in, said Dalia Levin, the director of the Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art. (A suburb of high-tech specialists, Herzliya has been called Israel's Silicon Valley, the source of much of Tel Aviv's new wealth.) But younger artists, especially those who didn't experience an event like the Six Day War, are more intent on absorbing their heritage and moving on, which allows the work to cast a wider net. ''The task of an Israeli museum,'' Levin says, ''is to expose alternate points of view.''
 Deganit Berest, at 59 one of Israeli art's most admired figures, is almost unknown anywhere else. For her painstaking, generally conceptual and subtly political work in photography, drawing and painting, she relies, like most other local artists, on issues and materials specific to Israeli life that make emotional or philosophical connections everywhere.
 ''Artists who make overtly political work have been quicker to succeed because that's what people want,'' says Berest, who works out of a former diamond-cutting factory near the old central bus station, now a hangout for junkies and a gay cruising ground. ''It's like going to Bali or some other exotic place and expecting to see the natives dance. I'm frustrated by that.'' Berest did draw some fire a few years ago when she appropriated a terrorist's photograph from a daily paper for an art piece. ''Artists are supposed to challenge society,'' she said quietly, adding that a friend had been killed during a border skirmish in Sinai. ''We live at the edge of culture, not the center, like our immigrant parents.''
 Perhaps this is the reason nearly all of the artists under 40 here have ignored the more traditional media of painting and sculpture for digital video. Noam Segal, the 27-year-old directorof Rothschild 69, explained that the focus on more cutting-edge technology stemmed partly from a subconscious attempt by younger generations to suppress their Old World ''Israeliness'' and ''claim an art form for themselves.'' Irit Batsry, an artist who has lived in New York since the '80s and recently returned to her native Tel Aviv to shoot a video for a show at the Herzliya Museum, sees it in more practical terms: ''In Israel, where the situation can change very quickly, video gives you a chance to react immediately. It's the quickest way to be relevant.''

 BODY:
It used to be that the highlight of a trip to Paris or London was the Tuileries or Trafalgar Square. But as cities around the world have been reshaped by writers, artists, foodies, bons vivants and those who emulate them, the humming little enclaves they create are redrawing the travel map. Call it nostalgia for Greenwich Village in the Beat era or the Left Bank of the Jazz Age: tuned-in travelers are seeking out more local precincts. Not just New York but Williamsburg, not just Tokyo but Harajuku: the neighborhood has become the new elemental unit of cool. 
 Simon Evans of Creative Clusters, a British economic development consulting firm, chalks the trend up to a quest for realness. ''Travelers have always sought authenticity, but our definition of authenticity has changed,'' he says. ''In the past, the tourism fantasy has been to capture the historic old monuments. These days, we have a more nuanced understanding of urban settings. In the era of globalization, people travel to see where real people live and eat and work.''
 In addition to changing the way visitors experience well-trodden destinations -- think of what Condesa did for Mexico City and how Mitte shaped Berlin's image -- this new localism has had the effect of suddenly putting cities with no previous claim to coolness on the radar. The Short North district of Columbus, Ohio, for example, is giving the town some buzz with its boutiques, galleries, art festivals, gay clubs and chef-owned restaurants. In Zurich, the Langstrasse area's vintage shops, graphic design firms and thriving cafe culture have made tastemakers take note of the otherwise buttoned-up banking center. And the few dozen blocks of Casco Viejo in Panama City are giving the place its first taste of boutique hotels, jazz clubs and late-night cafes -- and bringing in the travelers who flock to them. 
 ''People are asking for more local-feeling experiences,'' says Nicholas Christopher of Turon Travel in New York, who confirms that his clients are planning trips with a more focused approach. ''They're doing their own research. They're staying in apartments over hotels. They want to understand a place before it becomes corporatized.''
 Of course, the cycle of hipsterdom is a rapidly spinning wheel, and just as the creative class is quick to move on when places lose their edge, cool-hunting globe-trotters are perpetually on the search for virgin territory. Buenos Aires aficionados, despairing of the strip-mall-ification of Palermo Viejo, now behold the charms of Barracas, an area of hundred-year-old cafes and cutting-edge galleries. Now that Rome's Trastevere has become overrun with Rick Steves acolytes, locals and travelers alike have picked up and headed for Pigneto, a blue-collar quarter where trendy restaurants are popping up among the Middle Eastern immigrants, old Italian women, documentary filmmakers and design students. As Evans puts it, ''Tourists don't like to see other tourists. Once they do, they move on to the next place.'' DANIELLE PERGAMENT

HEADLINE: Unused Frequent-Flier Seats in a Flash

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
YOU'VE signed up for fare alerts that send you an e-mail message when a flight you want to buy goes down in price. Ever wish you could get a similar message when a frequent-flier seat opens up on that plane?
Starting on Tuesday, Yapta.com will do just that. Known for alerting travelers to airfare price drops even after the ticket has been purchased, the site is testing a new service that allows travelers to receive an e-mail alert when an award seat becomes available. Travelers simply do a normal online search for airfare on Yapta.com and click ''include award tickets'' to begin tracking the flight. Yapta will automatically send alerts via e-mail if either the price drops or an award seat opens up. 
The service, which is being offered free in a test phase, comes at a time when travelers, faced with sky-high airfares in a tough economic environment, may be increasingly tempted to use miles for flights. But finding an award seat, while rarely easy, could be particularly challenging as airlines cut capacity. The domestic market is expected to lose 22.6 million seats in the fourth quarter as airlines slash capacity by nearly 9 percent compared with a year ago, according to data from OAG, the global airline-schedule data company. Globally, airlines will offer 20.4 million fewer seats, a 2.3 percent decline in overall capacity.
That said, if the falloff in travel demand turns out to be greater than the capacity cuts, travelers could find more award availability as airlines try to fill seats any way they can. That scenario, said Tim Winship, an editor for SmarterTravel.com and the publisher of FrequentFlier.com, would be ''a terrific opportunity for the airlines to reduce the liability of having the miles on their books and do so without diluting revenue'' since the award seats would most likely have gone unsold anyway.
Airlines typically release seats 11 months in advance but can release them at any time based on cancellations, changes or demand levels. ''The reality is airlines do open and close buckets of inventory around award seats,'' said Tom Romary, chief executive of Yapta.com. The new service, he said, constantly searches for those award seats so you don't have to.
Mr. Romary, formerly a marketing executive with Alaska Airlines, said if 10 percent of the carrier's seats were set aside for awards, typically only 5 percent were used. Alerting travelers to fresh award inventory, he added, can both help airlines alleviate some of their liability for unredeemed awards and encourage loyalty among travelers. ''You are more likely to continue to use your airline credit card to earn more miles,'' he said, if you're able to redeem those miles.
The site will offer award-seat alerts for five major airlines -- Alaska, Continental, Delta, United and US Airways -- when it introduces the service on Tuesday, with plans to add carriers in the future.
Yapta's award alert feature has yet to be proven. But ExpertFlyer.com, a subscription site that offers an inside look at airlines' seat inventories, already offers a similar alert service that has been getting some good reviews from those obsessed with frequent-flier miles.
''Other than monitoring AA.com on a 24/7 basis there is nothing that can be done better than using flight alerts,'' said Mike Josephson, a frequent flier from Keller, Tex., who said he has repeatedly used ExpertFlyer's alert service with success to ''game'' the system. The alerts sometimes came just under the wire. For example, one alert he set up for an award ticket from Knoxville to Dallas arrived the day before departure. As a backup, he had booked a return flight from Nashville, which would have added about three hours of driving time to the trip, in case the Knoxville departure didn't come through. ''I realize it's a chance you would have to take in waiting it out, but with ExpertFlyer doing most of the legwork, it's easier than ever to win the game,'' he said.
ExpertFlyer's alerts are part of its Premium Plan service, which costs subscribers $9.99 a month, or $99.99 for a year's subscription. For the cost, travelers get alerts for 21 airlines not just for award seats but also for coveted upgrade awards. (For details go to www.expertflyer.com/sessionlessClassList.do).
TRAVELERS can also specify the type of award they need for a given flight, be it a restricted coach award for 25,000 miles or an international upgrade, and receive alerts via e-mail or cellphone or other mobile device. Yapta nor ExpertFlyer are not booking sites, however. Both require you to book the award with the airline directly.
So far, airlines don't seem to mind that the sites tip travelers off when award seats are released. ''Most recognize that we are serving a positive function that takes away some of the pain for the flier and some of the phone calls to the airline's call center for information,'' said Chris Lopinto, the co-founder of ExpertFlyer.com.
''The technology that Yapta brings to the table, whether award tracker or flight tracker, really provides what we view as purposeful innovation,'' said Mark Guerette, director of e-commerce with Alaska Airlines. ''It helps the customer look for the proverbial needle in the haystack.''
Some airlines point out routes that tend to have good award availability at a given time of year on their Web sites. For December American recently listed Puerto Vallarta, Mexico; Belize City; and Montego Bay, Jamaica, as AAdvantage HotSpots at www.aa.com. US Airways offers its own ''best bets for award travel'' on usairways.com. For November, the list included destinations in Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.

HEADLINE: No. 2 in Japan

BYLINE: By SIMON DUMENCO

 BODY:
A few blocks east of Osaka's Statue of Liberty, a couple dozen youths are loitering around an open-air square, living some Japanese translation of the American dream. I'm at the center of Amerikamura, the so-called ''American village,'' and the improbable mash-up of fashion here -- a block away there's a bar called Ganja Acid and a boutique called Gothic & Lolita, and those names sum up half the outfits around me -- confirms this area's status as an edgy shopping and cultural district. If the original Statue of Liberty represented France's dewy hopes for the young United States, then the replica statue Inconspicuously on duty here in Osaka (she's perched rather randomly on the corner of a nondescript midrise tower) might represent this city's hopes for itself. 
 Lady Liberty is an apt mascot for Osaka. This city's M.O. is about getting away with a certain wry, rough-hewn individualism that might raise eyebrows in other more formal, traditionally minded parts of Japan. The informality starts with Osaka-ben, the local Japanese dialect that can sound more mellifluous and friendly to Western ears than the Japanese spoken in Tokyo, and is replete with droll idiomatic expressions (''Uso yan'' -- You're kidding me!). And because Osaka is hardly one of the great Japanese tourist magnets for Westerners (only about 200,000 Americans come here each year), that sense of freedom feels more authentic, more organic, than that on display in, say, a certain heavily hyped metropolis to the east.
Americans' fascination with Tokyo may have peaked after Sofia Coppola's ''Lost in Translation,'' but Osaka's most enduring cinematic moment is probably still Ridley Scott's nearly 20-year-old crime thriller ''Black Rain,'' which made the city's skyline look forbiddingly futuristic. Indeed, Osaka can sometimes seem, on the surface, hard and cold: it's choked with numbing expanses of concrete and neon. (Much of its historic architecture was destroyed in the aftermath of the U.S. bombings of March 1945.) But it's actually a much more accessible city than Tokyo. For one thing, many of its most prominent wards, or ku, are eminently walkable, and the pace of pedestrian traffic here seems more relaxed than in Tokyo. It helps, too, that Osaka thinks of itself not so much as the great city it is but as the core of Kansai, a grand metropolitan cluster that also includes nearby Nara, Kyoto and Kobe, places known for the bucolic greens that surround their centuries-old shrines and temples. 
 Even here in the thick of Amerikamura, as a giant outdoor video screen nearby blares a treacly J-pop video, I feel unexpectedly centered, calm. As I munch on some take-out battera, a type of pressed, rectangular-shaped sushi roll with mackerel that's specific to Osaka, I notice the T-shirt of the girl who's sitting across from me amid a group of her friends, half of whom are texting while talking. There's a lot of badly translated nonsense English on T-shirts (and signage) in this town, but the words on this girl's chest -- breezily style through all eternity -- seem, somehow, exactly right at this moment.
 ''SHE MY DAUGHTER. I have other daughter,'' Sammy says, ''but she my daughter too!'' At the Top30 bar in the Umeda business district, Sammy, a smiley 50-something Osakan, is attempting to introduce his lady friend to me and Trevor, a Briton who lives here and works at a technology company. Sammy (it's unclear what he does for a living) speaks some English, and Trevor speaks a decent amount of Japanese, but it still takes a few minutes for Sammy to convey the curious nature of his relationship with this attractive woman, who speaks virtually no English and is perhaps 30 years his junior. It seems he's a father figure, of sorts, with thwarted ulterior motives -- they hang out, he takes her shopping and out for dinner and drinks -- but Sammy's wife doesn't mind that they enjoy each other's company. It's O.K. because they don't have sex! -- Sammy manages to indicate this with a comical, what-are-you-gonna-do shrug. His lady friend, who's also grinning madly, makes an ick face and crosses her arms quickly, understanding just enough of the conversation to confirm their no-sex ground rules.
 ''That's unusually candid even for Osaka,'' Trevor says when we eventually get back to our conversation. Sammy's too-much-information moment was perhaps a consequence of some degree of inebriation -- he kindly shared the joy by buying us a round of sake as well -- but his cheerfully talkative nature is par for the course in Osaka. A charismatic goofball who seemed eager to make us laugh, Sammy calls to mind a saying I've heard: ''Put two Osakans together and you get manzai.''
 Osaka is famous for its manzai, comedy duos that bounce rapid-fire repartee between, most often, a straight man and his dopey sidekick. Yoshimoto Kogyo, based here, is sort of the Comedy Central of Japan, an entertainment conglomerate that employs hundreds of comedians, including plenty of manzai duos, to populate its full slate of sketch-comedy and variety TV shows. Even non-Japanese speakers can quickly get the gist of manzai. The Fuji TV network's ''Mecha-Mecha Iketeru!'' which roughly translates as ''We Are Very, Very Cool!'' (or ''What a Cool We Are!'' as the show's official Web site helpfully offers), features the manzai duo of Takashi Okamura and Hiroyuki Yabe, known as Ninety-Nine. Watching their broad, slapsticky comedy is a bit like watching Technicolor Laurel and Hardy.
 Yoshimoto Kogyo, which has its roots in theater, has been around for nearly a century, but it's particularly flourished during the recent TV comedy boom. Japan's fondness for lowbrow humor is arguably an outgrowth of the protracted nationwide recession of the '90s -- a kind of survival mechanism. Osaka, the historical merchant center of Japan, and still one of its leading economic engines, is so business-obsessed that a traditional Osaka greeting -- now used somewhat ironically, if at all -- is Mokarimakka (''How's business?''). Given that Japan's bubble economy of the late '80s didn't really bottom out until a few years ago, a healthy sense of humor came in handy. For the longest time, Osaka didn't have a lot of reasons to laugh, so it invented them, and an industry to boot -- and in the process became the comedy capital of Japan.
 I'M NOT SURE, but I may be slipping into a coma. I've made the mistake of eating six of the eight takoyaki that I just bought from a sidewalk stand in the Dotonbori area, a foodie haven just above the narrow Dotonbori River that weaves through central Osaka. A local invention, takoyaki are octopus balls, which sounds rather disturbing, but the ball part is actually just a fried, puffy dumpling with a bit of octopus tentacle buried inside, finished off with a sprinkling of dried fish flakes. They're delicious and so absurdly filling that they make you almost instantly drowsy. They should be sold with a tatami mat so you could take a nap on the spot after consuming them.
 The takoyaki remind me of a comparison that I've been resisting since I landed at Kansai International Airport -- if Tokyo is the New York of Japan, then Osaka is Chicago. It just seemed obvious: centrally located, sprawling port city, major commerce center, inhabited by unassuming heartlanders who are hardly intimidated by the big, supposedly more important metropolis to the east -- and quirky enough in their sensibilities to have created a major comedy-export business. Some even refer to Osaka as ''Japan's Second City.'' But right now, the takoyaki in my gut have me reluctantly succumbing to the comparison, because eating in Osaka reminds me of nothing so much as eating in Chicago. Osaka is all about cheap, hearty fare -- this is surely the street-food capital of Japan -- that belies the general perception of Japanese cuisine as delicate, mannered nibbling. Takoyaki, for starters, are every bit as satisfying as, say, a Chicago hot dog. And Osaka even has its own version of deep dish pizza: okonomiyaki, a fried, flat pancake made with flour, eggs and cabbage, and loaded with toppings, usually some combination of cheese, veggies and meat (pork or squid or octopus).
 There's a Japanese saying that if Tokyoites go broke shopping, then Osakans go broke eating. There's even an Osaka-ben word, kuidaore, that means, basically, eating your way into the poorhouse. But how one would do that in Osaka is beyond me, given the cost-conscious cuisine that's everywhere here. This town is even the birthplace of instant ramen noodle soup. (Nissin, the maker of the Cup Noodles beloved by cash-strapped college students worldwide, runs the Momofuku Ando Instant Ramen Museum here. It's named after the soup's inventor -- a k a Noodle Papa.) If kuidaore culture suggests a certain lack of restraint, you wouldn't know it from looking at the locals; the typical Osaka physique is remarkably slim. It might be that they work off their foodie excesses by browsing the city's countless shopping streets, which seem to stretch on forever.
 One afternoon I take a leisurely stroll through the Shinsaibashi shopping arcade -- an open-air pedestrian street that's been more or less rain-proofed with a curved roof -- and I never make my way to the end of it. Unlike Tokyo's great shopping thoroughfares, which have a certain logical through-line (if not aesthetic, at least socioeconomic), Osaka's arcades are mismatched, high-low jumbles of retail diversions. The Shinsaibashi entrance of the venerable Sogo department store building, for instance, with its elegant Bulgari and Asprey and Gucci boutiques, faces the Atariya, a pachinko and slots parlor. A few doors down, a narrow shop that appears to sell nothing but cheap socks is next to a spacious, high-end bakery-cafe. Next to that is another pachinko parlor, which beckons with English-language signage: challenge the neon genesis an impressive amusement space. Given the blinding glare and the din, this feels more like neon Armageddon. But salvation, or at least a reprieve, is near.
 The city is dotted with temples, never far from any given shopping district, which often pop up like mirages. The most strikingly incongruent is the Shitennoji Temple, in Tennoji, a rather run-down area. The main structure on the grounds, tucked behind high fences that abut the backyards of shabby apartment buildings and shops, dates back to the sixth century. Prince Shotoku is said to have commissioned members of the Korean temple-building family Kongo to build a Buddhist temple on this spot. (Osaka has Japan's largest Korean population, which is largely clustered around Tsuruhashi, a place redolent of barbecue and kimchi restaurants and street vendors.) Newly arrived in Osaka, the Kongo family formed the Kongo Gumi Company, which, rather astonishingly, was the world's oldest construction company -- 14 centuries as Japan's leading temple builder -- until, in 2006, it ''succumbed to excess debt and an unfavorable business climate,'' as BusinessWeek put it.
 At Shitennoji Temple, it's clear that the increasing secularization of Japanese society likely had something to do with the demise of Kongo Gumi. Temple building has fallen sharply nationwide, and the dozen or so people strolling the grounds don't necessarily seem to be here for spiritual reasons. (Two are walking their dogs.) At one point, as I regard the temple from a flat dirt vista near the southern gate, I see no other souls around me. It's early evening in Osaka, the sun is setting, and I have this ancient temple to myself.
 The solitude is a glorious contrast to an earlier experience at another Kongo Gumi construction project, Osaka Castle, which dates to 1583. If the main castle tower is historical simulacrum -- the structure was destroyed multiple times over the centuries by fire and war -- that hasn't stopped it from being one of the most beloved tourist attractions in Japan. The eight-story interior is jarring because it's been entirely hollowed out and replaced with a modern-looking, dimly lit museum, but the approach to the castle remains breathtakingly immersive. It takes a good half hour of walking steep paths that wind through the 15 acres of grounds, including a bridge-crossing over a canyon-esque moat, to get to the front steps. The moat walls, 100 feet tall at their highest, are lined with giant bricks carved from Honda-size granite boulders (original to the 16th century) and neatly fit together without mortar.
 Historical dioramas can be as sleep-inducing as octopus balls, but a key narrative laid out inside the castle happens to be about one of the most awesome battles over real estate ever waged. In 1614 it took days and literally hundreds of thousands of samurai to lay siege to Osaka Castle -- the start of the ruling Toyotomi clan's bitter end. The on-again, off-again war over the castle involved dueling episodes of moat filling and moat reexcavation, and plenty of gruesome warfare that left thousands dead.
 Eventually, making my way through the crowds to the castle's eighth-floor open-air observation deck, I'm jolted back to modern times, more or less, when a smiling Japanese girl wearing a Smiths ''Meat Is Murder'' T-shirt hands me her digital camera and gestures for me to take a picture of her with her boyfriend against the backdrop of Osaka's skyline.
 ON EVEN A SHORT TRIP TO OSAKA, there's really no excuse to not pay a visit to one of the city's immediate neighbors -- Kyoto, Kobe and Nara. Each are full-fledged cities with rich traditions and distinct identities, but functionally they're almost suburbs of Osaka. On one of my last days here, I decide to take a trip to Nara, mostly because it's a direct shot on the Kintetsu rail line that pulls right up to Nara's chief attraction: its ancient, temple-studded forest. I take the local train because I want to experience the space between Nara and Osaka in something less than a blur. With roughly 20 stops, it still takes only an hour, and I learn that everybody who lives in outlying Osaka apartment complexes dries their laundry on balcony clotheslines. In the day's light breeze, thousands of outfits -- perhaps including a few kimonos as well as Smiths T-shirts -- wave gently to me.
 The heart of Nara's forest is Todaiji Temple, the world's largest wooden structure and the site of one of the largest Buddhas in Japan. At 50 feet tall, the big Buddha is certainly awesome, but one of his neighbors in the temple, Tamonten, is the sleeper star of the show. Standing fiercely erect, spear in one hand, he's got one helluva wardrobe: a combination of robes and armor, and a growling gargoyle for a belt buckle. He's the God of War and Warriors, a k a Lord of the North, a k a Heavenly King, a k a one of the Seven Gods of Good Fortune -- an inveterate multitasker. This temple has been here since 743, so he must be doing something right.
 Outside, I'm approached by rather adorable panhandlers. These are Nara's famed wild deer, which roam freely through its forest. There are no gates or fences -- this is not a zoo -- so the deer sometimes walk into traffic or take naps on sidewalks, and they're certainly not shy about approaching humans. I find myself grinning like an idiot when I see a group of kids -- girls in plaid skirts, boys in white shirts and blue slacks -- squealing with delight as they feed biscuits, courtesy of sidewalk vendors, to Bambi and friends. (The deer are historically revered in the Shinto religion as messengers of the gods, but they're not above bogarting snacks.)
 Earlier in the day, in central Osaka, I'd seen a similar group of schoolkids at the Cesar Pellidesigned National Museum of Art, a mostly subterranean structure with a soaring, winglike roof of steel and glass. At the museum, crowds of Japanese mobbed a traveling exhibition of Modigliani paintings and drawings, but I was more enthralled by ''Breath of the Spirit,'' a show by the Japanese installation artist Chiharu Shiota, who was born in Osaka but now lives and works in Berlin. Her main work, filling a vast basement space, featured hundreds of old shoes scattered across the floor. A piece of red string was tied to each shoe, and all the taut strands converged near the high ceiling at a single point near the back of the room, forming a ghostly red conical canopy over the footwear. A bilingual wall placard read, ''The string seems to connect all of the wearers' lives and the time in which they lived, creating what appears to be an inescapable bond between them.''
 Standing before Shiota's eerie work, the gathered red string seemed to recede both into the past and into the heavens -- and I couldn't help but think about how a short train trip in Osaka, or even a random turn down an alley, can instantly place you in another century. Here, the bond to the past is as inescapable as the bond to the present.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 11-06-08: Party Loyalist

BYLINE: Interview by DEBORAH SOLOMON

 BODY:
Do you see the election results as a repudiation of your politics? Our new president-elect won one and a half points more than George W. Bush won in 2004, and he did so, in great respect, by adopting the methods of the Bush campaign and conducting a vast army of persuasion to identify and get out the vote.
 But what about your great dream of creating a permanent Republican governing majority in Washington? I never said permanent. Durable. 
 Do you think John McCain attacked too much or not enough? Dissecting the campaign that way is not helpful. 
 Have you met Barack Obama? Yes, I know him. He was a member of the Senate while I was at the White House and we shared a mutual friend, Ken Mehlman, his law-school classmate. When Obama came to the White House, we would talk about our mutual friend.
 Did you have lunch together? Talk in the hall? We sat in the meeting room and chatted before the meeting. He had a habit of showing up early, which is a good courtesy. 
 Are you going to send him a little note congratulating him? I already have. I sent it to his office. I sent him a handwritten note with funny stamps on the outside. 
 What kind of funny stamps? Stamps.
 Do you have any advice for him? You already criticized Rahm Emanuel, Obama's new chief of staff, as a sharply partisan choice. I raised a question as to whether this would be the best use of Rahm Emanuel's talents. If you're trying to work through a big legislative priority, it is sort of hard if you have a guy who has a reputation as a tough, hard, take-no-prisoners, head-in-your-face, scream-and-shout, send-them-a-dead-fish partisan. 
 What about you? You were always seen as very partisan. I wasn't the chief of staff. And you'd be surprised by the Democrats I actually met, got to know and worked with. 
 Do you like Joe Biden? I think he has an odd combination of longevity and long-windedness that passes for wisdom in Washington. 
 Do you regret anything that happened in the White House during your tenure? Sure. 
 You've been booed off stages recently. No, I haven't. I've been booed on stages. I'm a little bit tougher than to walk off a stage because someone says something ugly.
 Do you think the era of negative politics is over? No. 
 Do you see yourself as being associated with it in any way? Look, in 1800 the sainted Thomas Jefferson arranged to hire a notorious slanderer named James Callender, who worked as a writer at a Republican newspaper in Richmond, Va. Read some of what he wrote about John Adams. This was a personal slander.
 What did he say? He said he lacked the spine of a man and the character of a woman. Negative politics have always been around.
 Do you think you're negative? No. 
 You've never repudiated President Bush. No. And I never will. He did the right things.
 What about Iraq and the economy? The world is a better place with Saddam Hussein gone. 
 Do you have any advice for him at this point? With all due respect, I don't need you to transmit what I want to say to my friend of 35 years. 
 Remember, attack politics are out. It's a new age of civilized discourse. You're the one who hurt my feelings by saying you didn't trust me. 
 Did I say that? Yes, you did. I've got it on tape. I'm going to transcribe this and send it to you.

HEADLINE: Whose President Is He Anyway?

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
-- It did not go unnoticed among the paisans that Barack Obama loves a four-star Italian restaurant on the Magnificent Mile near the lakefront. Not some pizza joint, but ''the Ferrari of Italian cooking,'' as Spiaggia's chef and co-owner, Tony Mantuano, puts it. Appreciation for fine Italian culture, he said, has earned Mr. Obama a strong following in the community. ''He's the pride of the Italians,'' Mr. Mantuano said.
 And why not? Practically everyone wants to claim Mr. Obama these days. African-Americans, obviously, but also Hispanic-Americans, Jewish-Americans, Muslim-Americans and even white Americans purging feelings of racial guilt. The youth, the netroots, the bipartisan consensus builders, the East Coast elites, the Hollywood crowd. Liberals, centrists and even some conservatives who see Reaganesque qualities. The British, the Germans and other foreigners disaffected with Bush's America.
 ''I am like a Rorschach test,'' Mr. Obama noted at one point during the campaign. ''Even if people find me disappointing ultimately, they might gain something.'' 
 The Rorschach part may fade with the end of the campaign but the test part is here. Reconciling all those different impressions of who Mr. Obama is and what he stands for may prove as defining a challenge as fixing the economy.
 Whose president is he? The standard line from his advisers would naturally be that he's the president of all Americans. But it rarely works out that simply. Ultimately, the gauzy picture of the campaign trail sharpens in the act of governing. Ultimately, choices are made and illusions shattered. And so many of Mr. Obama's supporters invested so much passion in him that the potential for let-down seems considerable.
 The president-elect's first few actions and statements since the election have provided some initial clues that are already being scrutinized for larger meaning. His first appointment, for instance, was to make his friend Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois his White House chief of staff.
 Some critics saw that as a betrayal of Mr. Obama's campaign pledge to foster a ''new politics'' reaching across the aisle in Washington since Mr. Emanuel is such a skilled specialist in the razor-edged old politics of slicing up the opposition. But others saw ideological significance in the fact that Mr. Emanuel has been an advocate for more centrist policies when it comes to issues like trade, crime and welfare.
 The selection of Mr. Emanuel and other veterans of President Bill Clinton's administration to run the transition stood in contrast to Mr. Obama's message about finally moving beyond the Clinton era. All the more striking was his decision last week to sound out Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton herself as a possible secretary of state. The Clinton faction is pleased, but those who saw Mr. Obama as a clean break may wonder what it means.
 Similarly, many inside the Beltway sat up and paid attention when Mr. Obama, through a spokeswoman, said he did not hold any grudges against Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, who calls himself an independent Democrat but barnstormed for Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee. Mr. Obama said he would not get involved in deciding whether Mr. Lieberman should keep his committee chairmanship and would welcome his staying in the Democratic caucus.
 Republicans and some Democrats were relieved at what they viewed as an act of statesmanship, but some liberals intent on punishing Mr. Lieberman for his heresy were disappointed. Yet interestingly, even among critics of Mr. Lieberman, the statement was interpreted differently.
 Greg Sargent, writing on TPM Election Central, argued that the statement ''risks giving cover to senators who want to do nothing about Lieberman.'' Markos Moulitsas Zuniga, writing on the Daily Kos Web site, said, ''Greg Sargent seems to take this as pro-Lieberman. I see it exactly the opposite,'' because Mr. Obama did not take a position on the committee chairmanship, which Mr. Moulitsas considers the issue. Even now, Mr. Obama remains what he is in the eye of the beholder.
 ''He reminds me of John Kennedy in this respect,'' said Peter H. Wehner, a former Bush White House official now at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center. ''If you read the books on Kennedy, intellectuals who spoke to Kennedy felt like he was an intellectual; politicians who spoke with him felt like he was a politician. He had the ability to make people think he was what they wanted and what they were looking for. I get the sense that Obama is a little like that and everyone is going to lay claim to him.'' 
 Mr. Obama has an advantage that some other presidents did not, in that he has been a singular political phenomenon who probably does not owe his election primarily to any particular group. If Ronald Reagan leaned heavily on the support of the religious conservatives and Mr. Clinton tried to move his party to the center in search of independents, Mr. Obama did not define himself in strongly ideological terms, even if his record and program are largely left of center.
 But it was Mr. Obama who set the expectations so high among so many different constituency groups. His advertising during the primaries urged Democrats to vote for him because he would do nothing less than ''save the planet,'' which as campaign promises go certainly beats a chicken in every pot.
 ''There's going to be enormous pressure on him to produce, to meet these expectations,'' said Tom Andrews, a former Democratic congressman from Maine who is now national director of the activist group Win Without War. 
 And among those exerting that pressure will be Mr. Andrews's fellow opponents of the Iraq war. An early test will be whom Mr. Obama picks for secretary of defense. Advisers have said he is thinking about asking the current Pentagon chief, Robert M. Gates, to stay on, at least for a while, in a show of bipartisanship. But Mr. Andrews said that would undermine the founding ideal of Mr. Obama's campaign to end the war.
 ''Clearly when you compare Gates and Rumsfeld it's night and day; everybody recognizes that,'' Mr. Andrews said, referring to Mr. Gates's predecessor, Donald H. Rumsfeld. ''But still, we need to turn the page and have a new direction and deliver clear and strong messages including who is going to be our secretary of defense. The strongest message would be to put in a new team with a new vision.''
 Possibly in no area will this tension be more fraught than in race relations. As the first African-American president in a nation long divided over race, Mr. Obama will face crosscurrents that none of his predecessors ever did, embodying as he does the hopes of a long-disenfranchised segment of the population yet determined not to be locked into old paradigms. Many of his actions will be viewed through the lens of race, from the composition of his cabinet to the priority he places on issues historically important to black Americans.
 Mr. Obama managed to balance those pressures through nearly two years of campaigning and now will have to do it again. ''He'll still have to be a master manipulator, in a sense, and know how to navigate all those different forces,'' said Representative Bennie G. Thompson of Mississippi, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus Institute. ''He has shown himself to be a very cool-under-fire kind of guy.''
 Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the House majority whip and the highest-ranking African-American in Congress, said Mr. Obama would show that he can be bold without being radical and that most black supporters would recognize the limits the economy has placed on what he can do.
 ''He knows he has to be careful not to make any lurches left or right,'' Mr. Clyburn said. ''He plays the game inside the hash marks. Anything too far left or too far right would make it a very rocky presidency for him. Most people understand that. Not all people, and I've heard from people when I say that, but most people.''
 Perhaps, but African-Americans are not the only ones to see in him a unique champion, and the demands for action could be considerable. Two out every three Hispanic voters supported Mr. Obama, an increase of 13 percentage points from four years ago, according to exit polls, and turnout in that demographic shot up by more than 30 percent. Hispanic leaders said they provided the margin of victory in Florida, New Mexico, Colorado and Nevada.
 ''We feel like we had a big stake in the election and that's what prompted this historic turnout,'' said Janet Murguia, president of the National Council of La Raza. The advocacy group did wait long to begin publicly pushing the new president-elect to recognize this support with key White House and Cabinet positions. 
 ''At some point in the first term we would definitely expect to see an effort to move responsible immigration reform,'' Ms. Murguia said. ''It would be a big mistake not to act on this important priority.''
 Or all of the other important priorities that the president-elect's believers assume he will tackle. After all, he's got a planet to save.

BYLINE: By Ron Suskind. 
Ron Suskind is the author of ''The Way of the World'' and ''A Hope in the Unseen,'' among other books. His last article for the magazine was ''Without a Doubt: Faith, Certainty and the Presidency of , George W. Bush.''

 BODY:
George and Laura Bush poked around the George W. Bush Childhood Home, going room to room through the carefully restored bungalow on West Ohio Avenue in Midland, Tex. The 41st president bought this three-bedroom house in 1951 for $9,000. The 43rd president, a rambunctious boy -- a catcher on the Midland Cubs Little League team -- grew up in a small bedroom with walls of knotty pine.
 It was Oct. 3, 2008, the first time Bush had been in Midland since he was elected president. He didn't return here with the rest of his family, including his father, mother and wife, when the house was formally dedicated two years ago. But with his light public schedule during this year's campaign season, he made an executive decision to finally say yes to the standing invitation from Midland.
 There are many presidential birthplaces or childhood homes dotting the nation's landscape, but few have the density, the historical significance per square foot, of this little clapboard in Texas. Bush's gifted younger brother, Jeb, was born eight months before their sister, Robin, died of childhood leukemia. ''Georgie'' bonded powerfully with his grieving mother, and the Bush family dynamics -- a driving force, eventually, in national and global life -- locked into place. 
 A few reporters waited for the first couple to emerge from the house, and Bush, far away from earthshaking events, talked with them for a moment outside about how surprisingly heartwarming it was to be back and how it was here that he ''learned a lot of values that I hold dear.''
 When a reporter asked if things had changed since he left town, Bush said: ''You know, I've told my friends here, I said, 'You know, I'm not going to change as a person because of politics or Washington' -- that's what I said when I left. I think they appreciate that. I want them to know that, you know, even though I had to deal with a lot of tough issues, that I'm still the same person that they knew before and that, you know, I'm wiser, more experienced, but my heart and my values didn't change.''
 One month later, the president had all but vanished. He had only a handful of public events in the final weeks of October, none in the first days of November. His 20-percent approval rating, the lowest on record of any president, stood as testimony to how the country had rejected his prideful, intensely personal model of leadership. In fact, the longstanding -- and politically successful -- conversation about what qualities, what amorphous ''values,'' distinguish the residents of, say, Midland from those of Manhattan or Michigan was, hour by hour, being transcended by something much larger and more urgent.
 Eras end with a whisper, with reflection and the quiet drift preceding sleep.
 They start with a roar, the declaration that a particular dawn is different from all its predecessors -- a case made, day by day, over years of sunrises.
 Not every president gets an era. Bush 41 didn't. Reagan did, F.D.R. certainly did and L.B.J. did, too, by virtue of having presided during havoc. Clinton yearns for his eight years to be called an era but knows he fell short, and often says that a president needs to have governed during crisis to be considered great. Or at least consequential. Much like Lyndon Johnson's, George W. Bush's tenure was the drama of a president devoured by titanic events -- forces that overwhelmed best-laid plans and even the soundest of intentions, and magnified errors.
 Johnson was an unsympathetic character as he left the stage in 1968, giving way to Nixon and ending nearly four decades of almost entirely Democratic dominance over the world's most powerful nation. People couldn't muster much empathy for L.B.J. The events that, by default, came to define his persona -- the Vietnam War and the decade's boiling unrest -- were as raw as a just-finished divorce proceeding. Americans simply wanted him gone, clearing the way for a new start. For something different.
 Republicans ruled for most of the next 40 years, steadily moving the nation into line with many of their prized principles of conservatism. During that time, however, Republican presidents often found their greatest lasting successes when they, in essence, ''negotiated with themselves.'' Nixon sat down with Chinese leaders, whom he'd reviled for years. Even now, ''Nixon to China'' is a catchphrase for how a leader can move in an improbable direction, at least once. Reagan, who won office by championing tax cuts to stimulate the economy and halt the growth of government, saw clearly in his second term that he'd gone too far and reined them in. Then he sat convivially with Gorbachev, head of the ''evil empire,'' and tried to rid the world of nuclear weapons. Even Bush the elder managed to break his ''no new taxes'' pledge in an effort to help balance the budget at the end of his term and set the table for Clintonian budgetary successes.
 But Bush the younger, the standard-bearer of this long procession, never made a comparable imaginative leap. And on Monday, Nov. 3, 2008, by then a pariah across the land he'd governed with will and nerve, he remained forthright. He wasn't going to apologize for anything that might have gone wrong during his eight years. He wouldn't be discussing lessons learned, though that might profit some of his fellow Republicans. No, he was in hiding. He was not planning to leave the house the next day, either. He voted by absentee ballot. The president of the world's leading democracy would be staying home on Election Day.
 Across the country, a wave was gathering force.
 But it was diffuse, difficult to measure and seemed to be coming from many directions, many sources at once.
 On the afternoon of Monday, Nov. 3, events were hard to fathom even for those closest to Barack Obama. And few are closer than Valerie Jarrett, his confidante. There are two circles at work here, each of a traditional cast -- the loyal loved ones and the professionals. Jarrett has for more than a decade been the putative head of the former, a protective innermost circle around the man.
 Jarrett was exhausted, after weeks on the campaign trail, but hyperalert, watching the wider terrain, observing all comers, while always keeping an eye on Obama. She, together with Michelle Obama's brother, the Oregon State basketball coach Craig Robinson, a few old friends from Harvard Law School and assorted others, are, in a way, protectors of Obama's essence. There are so many ways to be corrupted in a public life that their wariness is an emblem of their affection. Their bond to him and to one another is that they love the man for exactly who he is, no matter what, and that frees them to be honest -- a gift for someone in the spotlight.
 Many of the loyal loved ones would be flying to Chicago over the next few hours for Election Day. Barack would be arriving very late that night. But for now, the office of the real-estate firm that Jarrett runs was silent. She could hold all calls. She's the boss, cool, precise, a confident woman in her early 50s, educated at the finest schools, who, in her professional life, has scaled many mountains. Seventeen years ago, she offered a job to a young graduate of Harvard Law School named Michelle Robinson. Soon enough, Jarrett had met the young man that Michelle was engaged to.
 From her perch, Jarrett has seen it all from the start. A confident young bride and groom. Their bright smiles. So much promise, both of them. And now crowds reaching to touch him, and her.
 But what Jarrett can see, in a way few others can, is how easily it might have turned out different. To sharpen her clarity about all that has been accomplished, she summons the darkest moment of doubt. It was in Iowa, just a year ago. Obama was way behind Hillary Clinton. The heavyweights were called in, 200 members of Obama's national finance committee. The money people. Many had given mightily. And now, it seemed, nothing was working. Obama said that before they all gathered to pass judgment, he wanted them -- all 200 -- to meet his grass-roots field team in Iowa.
 They did, then gathered in a room at an Iowa arts center. The room was tense.
 Obama explained that day that they were running a different kind of campaign, a real grass-roots campaign, one that grew from the bottom up, from the dirt, and that it takes time for those roots to take hold. And the heavy hitters nodded; yes, they understood that idea, but it wasn't working. The polls were the proof. They showed Clinton with a double-digit lead.
 And Jarrett can remember how Obama looked at them, hard-eyed, everything on the line. '' 'Did you think I was kidding when I said this was the unlikely journey?' '' Jarrett recalls him saying. '' 'You thought this would be simple? No, change is never simple. Change is hard.
 '' 'Listen, I know you're nervous,' he went on. 'But if you're nervous, I'll hold your hand. We're going to get through this together. And if we win Iowa, we'll win this country.' ''
 Jarrett said: ''He turned their emotion around. He made sense of it. He told them why we were there and what was within our grasp. And people became jubilant. You never heard cheering like that. That was the turn, where it happened.''
 Of course, the roots took hold in Iowa and spread state to state. And now, the day before Election Day, Team Obama was running though fields of tall grass, city to city, in the final day of a kind of electoral mystery tour.
 At sundown that Monday, David Axelrod was prowling the lobby of a hotel in Charlotte, N.C., checking his watch. Axelrod is the founding leader of the other circle, the professionals. A former Chicago Tribune reporter turned political consultant, he worked for various candidates -- including the former Illinois senator Paul Simon -- before he ran Obama's 2004 U.S. Senate race.
 Axelrod was not sure what to do with himself. David Plouffe, the campaign manager, had his armies moving in precise formations across the country. The polls were strong. Everything seemed to be working. Axelrod said he was not sure what to worry about -- a problem in and of itself.
 And now there was time to kill. The day, starting with an event in Jacksonville, Fla., was now half-over. At a rally nearby at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, security precautions -- 20,000 people going through metal detectors -- had caused delays.
 ''I don't have much time to reflect on what's happening -- to ask the 'why' questions -- and Barack doesn't, either,'' Axelrod said. But then, pacing the carpet, he thought back on what he called the original why question, what got all this started, back in December 2006. Barack, Michelle and eight others were in Axelrod's office in downtown Chicago. If Barack was going to run, he had to decide quickly, a point the group made by laying out primary schedules and game plans for fund-raising and building an organization. Insights were offered from around the room.
 It was Michelle, Axelrod remembers, who stopped the show. ''You need to ask yourself, Why do you want to do this?'' she said directly. ''What are hoping to uniquely accomplish, Barack?''
 Obama sat quietly for a moment, and everyone waited. ''This I know: When I raise my hand and take that oath of office, I think the world will look at us differently,'' he said. ''And millions of kids across this country will look at themselves differently.''
 Obama understood, through his own search for identity, how America's seminal struggle over race was part of a wider story, of a search for dignity and hope that defined the lives of countless people throughout the world. A battered America, he felt, was ready, even anxious, to prove the truth of its sacred oaths -- liberty, justice and equality. To show the world. If, through his own ambitions, he could offer his country a chance to step forward, it might rise to the occasion.
 And it did, with astonishing speed. You could see it so clearly that night, the last night of a historic 21-month campaign, that last rally, in Manassas, Va. By 10 p.m., there were 90,000 people gathered in the Prince William County Fairgrounds. They'd been gathering since midafternoon. And it was America. Make no mistake. This was border territory, where the edge of Washington's Northern Virginia suburbs meets the true Old Dominion. Starbucks gives way to gun shops, whole grains to grits and whatever liquid can get you drunk fast. Latinos find common ground with poor whites and African-Americans living where the houses are cheap, even if the jobs are few. And that night, the sky was dark and starless, there was a cool, misty bite in air, and the people came from every direction and walked miles from the nearest parking spot.
 They had to see him, and the crowds pressed thick along the fences. A special-education teacher and her sister (who said: ''I never felt this way. I just feel like he can save us'') stood beside an American-born Rothschild, a big contributor, who met Obama at a fund-raiser and said she has ''never been the same.'' Down the row, a Virginia farmer, thick-necked, callused and brush-scrubbed after a hard day with hogs, said, ''It's a long way from the War of Northern Aggression, which my great-greats fought in, to here.'' Not so far. The Manassas battlefield, where in 1861 troops clashed in the First Battle of Bull Run, at the start of the Civil War, was about seven miles away.
 And, 147 years later, at 10:28 p.m., a black man stepped onto the stage and the crowd lost its collective mind. An exhausted Obama stood at the lectern, looking over a vast undulating sea of screaming humanity, all races, waving American flags. ''What a scene, what a crowd,'' he said, shaking his head. ''Wow.'' And the crowd seemed to swell with recognition. That's the way social movements work, the call and response. The giver receives. The receiver gives. They are one thing. And Obama seemed to rise, in his final speech, through the hoarseness and fatigue, telling them all how, month to month, ''you have inspired me, when I'm down you lifted me up,'' and he talked through standard, elegant riffs, how he wanted to change America, and then trotted out an old story, one he used to tell back in the primaries but almost never had since. It's a riot, a spellbinder about an eccentric old lady in South Carolina, a real character in her small town, who stole his thunder at a small rally -- just a few dozen people on a miserable, forbidding day -- by chanting ''Fired up!'' and then ''Ready to go!'' And everyone in that little nowhere town followed suit, some kind of local ritual, and after licking his wounds -- ''I wasn't picking up any endorsements that day'' -- he just started chanting it. ''And I started to feel better,'' he remembered. And this part of the speech had the cadence of that of a preacher, but one who could edit The Harvard Law Review too, and the crowd was right with him, as he led them in ''Fired up'' and ''Ready to go'' . . . because it ''shows you what one voice can do,'' he testified, ''and if a voice can change a room, it can change a city, and if it can change a city, it can change a state, and if it can change a state, it can change a nation, and if it can change a nation, it can change the world.'' And then it was over. He waved and just stoodthere, calm, as the din washed over him. After a long moment, his whole body seeming to exhale, he grabbed the water bottle from the lectern and downed it. Game over.
 Twenty-four hours later, the world seemed quite different. What happened in Manassas, of course, happened in countless cities and towns. People saw it, in overwhelming numbers. What started as a story about race became a larger story, by day's end, about America. The transforming promise of the nation, after all, is the idea of welcoming the stranger, the outcast, to a place of limitless possibility -- a place where each of us might discover our best self, be comfortable in our skin and find a home.
 At 10:57 p.m., Barack Obama carried that story onto a stage in Chicago's Grant Park as the president-elect of the beleaguered United States, and the ground shook from Chicago to the coasts and across the world.
 He warmly thanked John McCain, who had just given one of the most gracious concession speeches in recent memory and seemed to be almost relieved to return to being the John McCain -- direct, self-deprecating, true blue -- who sadly vanished in the dust of partisan combat.
 McCain, like Obama, is a storyteller. All the best leaders are. Which is why he couldn't have failed to see that his story -- of the freed prisoner from a failed war who rose to greatness -- was a story with roots sunk too deeply in the past for this moment. This is even more true for the president that Obama will soon replace. Bush, locked in his Oedipal struggles -- father and son, World War II and Vietnam, a faded generation and a fading one -- again and again mistook rigidity for fortitude and never really evolved in office, as all presidents must. He rose up, using his innate trust of emotion and impulse, to meet the first challenges of 9/11, but then froze solid. At a time when the nation's challenges, so fresh, so fast-moving, so startling, demanded constant reappraisal and response, he -- the child of a president -- thought it was about him: his issues, his battles, his heart. It's not, at least not now.
 In a time of crisis, the American public took hold of its system of self-governance, broken, over many years, by compulsive divisiveness, and said, Let's try something new -- and reach for history's arc.
 That's why they, the people, sent Barack Obama onto the stage. The Bush era ended, officially, the minute he passed that top step and turned his face into the roar of the future.
 The Obama era? Well, let's see if he can manage hope. n

HEADLINE: Green Is for Sissies

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
SIX years of relentlessly rising prices have showered the oil industry with record profits even as whipsawing energy costs have left many Americans alternately furious and baffled. 
 Now that the roller coaster ride appears to be screeching to a halt, one corporate giant remains confident it can weather the slowdown and uncertainty better than its rivals. 
 ''It's not that we like lower prices, but our competitive advantage is more obvious to people in a low-price environment,'' says Rex W. Tillerson, the chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil, the world's largest, mightiest oil company. ''But in a high-price environment, our competitive advantage has been quite evident as well.'' 
 However undaunted Exxon feels, it's still facing more complicated scenarios than mere price shifts. It's straining to adjust to a host of potentially seismic issues that raise pointed questions about its long-term strategy. Oil reserves are harder to find, resource-rich governments have become more assertive, and global warming concerns have spurred forceful calls to action on environmental matters. 
 Moreover, with the election of Barack Obama, a new chapter is about to open for the nation's energy policy. Mr. Obama says he wants to move away from oil dependence, and his policies are likely to emphasize conservation, alternative energy sources and new limits on the emissions of greenhouse gases responsible for climate change. 
 The question for Exxon, which Mr. Obama repeatedly singled out as an exemplar of corporate greed during the presidential campaign, is whether the model that has served the company so well for so long will keep it competitive -- or whether it will still be producing hydrocarbons long after the world has moved away from dirty fuels.
 Last year, Exxon, which is based in Irving, Tex., celebrated its 125th anniversary, marking a straight line that connects it to John D. Rockefeller's original Standard Oil Trust before the government broke up the enterprise. While other oil companies try to paint themselves greener, Exxon's executives believe their venerable model has been battle-tested. The company's mantra is unwavering: brutal honesty about the need for oil and gas to power economies for decades to come. 
 ''Over the years, there have been many predictions that our industry was in its twilight years, only to be proven wrong,'' says Mr. Tillerson. ''As Mark Twain said, the news of our demise has been greatly exaggerated.''
 FROM a purely financial standpoint, there's no doubt that Exxon's business strategy has paid off. Despite the broader economic turmoil, Exxon is worth around $375 billion -- more than General Electric, Bank of America and Google combined -- making it the world's largest corporation. 
 Its balance sheet is pristine and its credit rating is better than that of most governments. If Exxon's revenue were stacked against the world's G.D.P.'s, it would rank between Austria and Greece as the 26th-largest economy. As oil prices peaked this summer, the company once again set a record as the most profitable American corporation, earning $14.8 billion in the third quarter. Since 2004 alone, the company has rung up profits of about $180 billion.
 Throughout its various incarnations -- the Standard Oil Trust, Standard Oil of New Jersey, the Exxon Corporation, and now Exxon Mobil -- the company has been an ambiguous fascination for many Americans. It is an enduring icon, as lasting as Coca-Cola or General Electric, but also a perennial corporate villain, one that reminds the nation of its dependence on hydrocarbons. 
 For some, the environmental impact of that earnings gusher outweighs the financial gains. 
 ''Being Exxon is never having to say you're sorry,'' says Kert Davies, the research director at Greenpeace, the environmental advocacy group that has battled with Exxon for years.
 On the financial front, however, Exxon's jaw-dropping results have continued to leave many analysts beaming.
 ''It's the world's greatest company, period,'' says Arjun N. Murti, a Goldman Sachs oil analyst. ''I would put Exxon up against any other company at any other period of time.'' 
 ''It is also the most misunderstood company in the world,'' he adds. ''For many people, the image of Exxon is the Exxon Valdez. But there is much more to Exxon than that. Somehow, Exxon has persevered over the past 100 years with the best culture and management team any company could have.''
 What might be called the Exxon Way can be summed up in three ideals: discipline, patience and long-term vision. It is a formula the company drills into its managers from the moment they join Exxon, and which it keeps repeating through their careers. It explains the company's resilience and its view that it has survived, and thrived, through countless commodity cycles. 
 ''We are all homegrown,'' Mr. Tillerson says. ''That happens through a very deliberate and very closely managed process, and it starts the day the person walks through the door with us. And we are the product of that system. If there is a DNA it is something you grow into after many years of working with your colleagues. It is clearly the defining strength of the company.''
 TAKE a room full of oil managers, and the Exxon people usually stand out, even as they try not to draw much attention to themselves. They typically band together, and often cultivate an aura of secrecy -- and sometimes superiority -- toward the outside world. 
 At Exxon, the engineers rule. From its very early days, the company has focused relentlessly on one thing: finding more ways to squeeze every penny out of each barrel of oil. 
 Mr. Rockefeller was an accountant who was obsessed with efficiency, and his fixations still run through the company's veins, says Joseph Allen Pratt, a historian and management professor at the University of Houston. Mr. Pratt is writing the fifth volume of Exxon's official corporate history, which the company is partly financing.
 ''There definitely is an Exxon way,'' Mr. Pratt says. ''This is John D. Rockefeller's company, this is Standard Oil of New Jersey, this is the one that is most closely shaped by Rockefeller's traditions. Their values are very clear. They are deeply embedded. They have roots in 100 years of corporate history.''
 But the company's DNA goes well beyond the surface. Rivals acknowledge its expertise around an oil field, even as they bristle at what they call arrogance. Exxon's own executives brag that their company outperforms its peers by sticking to their playbook. 
 ''Exxon is a very professional company,'' says Jeroen van der Veer, the chief executive of a leading competitor, Royal Dutch Shell. 
 Others say they respect the company's clarity of vision. ''People know the rules when they work with Exxon,'' said a top oil executive who asked not to be identified in order not to jeopardize his company's relationship with Exxon. ''Exxon can pick its battles. It's a pretty good strategy to have if people know that you will fight to the bitter end.''
 Examples of such grit abound. After a dispute with the Venezuelan government, during which Exxon persuaded a British court to briefly freeze $12 billion in government assets to fight what it considered an expropriation, the country's oil minister accused the company of ''legal terrorism.'' 
 Whatever its critics might say about the company's hard-headedness, it has paid off in Exxon's bottom line. Last year, Exxon's profit per barrel was $17, exceeding BP's $12 a barrel, Shell's $14 and Chevron's $16, according to Neil McMahon, a Bernstein Research analyst.
 No one is apologetic at Exxon about what it takes to get those results, especially Mr. Tillerson.
 ''The business model is based on a disciplined and rigorous approach to dealing with scientific data and facts,'' he says. ''What we do is largely invisible to the public. They see the nozzle at the pump, and that's about it. They don't see the enormous level of risk that is managed very well to get that gallon of gas.''
 Exxon has battled powerful forces in recent years, locking horns with governments and multinational rivals from Africa to Central Asia, from Eastern Europe to South America. But last spring, the challenge struck closer to home -- at the company's annual shareholder meeting in Dallas.
 As oil prices zoomed above $100 a barrel, a group of investors tried to force Exxon to lay out a new strategy for developing alternative fuels and addressing global warming. While the challenge was not unprecedented -- raucous shareholder meetings have been a staple for years -- the dissent was led by a symbolic, if slightly quixotic, constituency: descendants of Mr. Rockefeller, who founded Standard Oil in 1882.
 ''Exxon Mobil needs to reconnect with the forward-looking and entrepreneurial vision of my great-grandfather,'' said Neva Rockefeller Goodwin, a Tufts University economist, speaking for the family. The company, she added at the time, was focused ''on a narrow path that ignores the rapidly shifting energy landscape around the world.''
 Exxon's top managers easily brushed off the Rockefeller revolt, as they have so many obstacles over the years. Even so, Exxon and the other oil giants are facing a stark new landscape.
 High prices have meant stratospheric profits, of course, but they have also led to more restrictions on access to oil fields around the world, making it harder for companies to increase their production and replace reserves. 
 ''The largest oil companies are under tremendous pressure,'' said Fadel Gheit, a veteran oil analyst at Oppenheimer & Company, who worked for the Mobil Corporation before moving to Wall Street.
 In the 1960s, the so-called Seven Sisters oil companies, including Exxon and Mobil, controlled most of the world's oil reserves. Today, state-owned companies, like Saudi Aramco, hold the vast majority of these reserves, while other resource holders like Russia and Venezuela have become increasingly assertive about limiting access to their reserves. 
 ''The problem is very real,'' said Henry Lee, a lecturer in energy policy at Harvard University. ''The oil majors are looking at a very different world than 20 years ago. That has big implications for the future of these companies. They all know it and they are all trying to figure out where they are going to be in 10 and 20 years.''
 The threat from state-controlled energy companies -- and the larger question of tapping reserves -- led to the big wave of industry mergers in the late 1990s, including Exxon's $81 billion purchase of Mobil in 1999. 
 ''We were worried,'' says Lou Noto, the former chairman of Mobil. ''We expected the environment to become more volatile, and more competitive, and more difficult geographically and geologically. The easy stuff had been found and we were getting into very esoteric stuff.''
 While the combination of Exxon and Mobil created the world's most valuable oil company, the joint entity has struggled to expand production. Exxon derives its strength from its size. But its problems are also a function of size: the company has become so large that to grow it must find increasingly big projects. 
 At an analyst meeting on Wall Street in March, Mr. Tillerson acknowledged the difficulty he faces: ''The challenge we have today is continuing to have access to resources.'' 
 Since 1999, Exxon has spent about $125 billion foraging for new energy supplies around the globe. It expects to spend $25 billion to $30 billion each year through 2012 to seek and develop hydrocarbons. Yet the company is pumping about as much oil and gas today as Exxon and Mobil once did separately. In fact, Exxon's hydrocarbon production has been falling recently, dropping 8 percent, to 3.6 million barrels a day in the third quarter, compared with 3.9 million barrels a day in the period last year. 
 With about $37 billion in cash and a clean balance sheet, Exxon can afford to be picky about what prospects to explore. It has about 120 projects on its books, either in operation or in the planning stages, and it sits on up to 72 billion barrels of oil and gas reserves around the world, the most of any nonstate oil company. 
 To keep up momentum, Exxon plans to start up more than 60 fields or major projects by 2011, including dozens of offshore fields in West Africa, export terminals for liquefied natural gas in the Middle East, and scores of gas and oil developments in Australia, Indonesia, the United States and the Caspian Sea.
 Still, despite its ability to stride the energy world like a colossus, Exxon remains more cautious than its rivals. Rather than overspend, it sows its huge returns in-house through share buybacks and large dividend payments to shareholders.
 From 2003 to the third quarter of 2008, the company has paid out nearly $150 billion to shareholders -- spending over $40 billion in dividends and buying back about $110 billion worth of shares.
 Yet Exxon's shares are on track for their worst performance since the early 1980s, a result of the market sell-off and the drop in oil prices recently. Some analysts also said it reflected the questions hanging over the company's long-term strategy. ''Exxon is a cash machine, and they could be using that cash to invest in clean technologies that would expand their base,'' said Andy Stevenson, an energy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''Right now, they have no growth story. They are trapped in oil and gas.''
 IF Exxon maintained its current buyback rate of $8 billion each quarter, it would become a private corporation between 2020 and 2030, according to a report by Bernstein Research. While that's unlikely, these payouts -- $30 billion so far this year -- have been criticized by some experts, who would like to see the company invest more to increase its production or expand its reserves.
 ''If a company is not replacing reserves, and they are spending their cash to buy back their shares, and they are not growing their production, that is called liquidating the company,'' says Amy Myers Jaffe, the associate director of Rice University's energy program in Houston. 
 Ultimately, the biggest test for Exxon's long-term business model is the fact that rising energy use -- whether in the United States or in China -- will eventually have to be reconciled with reducing carbon emissions and finding low-carbon energy sources. But as its contentious shareholder meeting with the Rockefeller heirs demonstrated, few topics are as touchy as Exxon's stance on climate change. 
 During the tenure of Lee R. Raymond, who ran the company from 1993 to 2005, Exxon became the lightning rod in the debate about climate change. Throughout the 1990s, the company was vilified by environmental groups and scientists for questioning the impact of human activities -- especially the use of fossil fuels -- on global warming. 
 Gingerly, over the last three years, Exxon has moved away from its extreme position. It stopped financing climate skeptics this year, and has sought to soften its image with a $100 million advertising campaign featuring real company executives, scientists and managers. One of the ads said the company aimed to provide energy ''with dramatically lower CO2 emissions.''
 The company has acknowledged that climate change is a risk to the world. In a speech given before the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London last year, Mr. Tillerson said policy makers should consider setting a carbon tax or a plan that limits carbon emissions through a cap-and-trade system.
 But while Exxon is slowly unshacklingitself from Mr. Raymond's stance on global warming, it remains faithful to his legacy by dismissing most green alternatives and sticking with hydrocarbons. Although the company's tone has changed, its strategy has not. Despite growing pressures on oil companies to invest in alternative energy, Exxon's long-term view remains unapologetically tied to fossil fuels. 
 ''Rex looks more approachable than his predecessor,'' says a rival executive who requested anonymity because he did not want to jeopardize his relationship with Mr. Tillerson, ''but he is more inflexible.'' 
 Exxon's belief is that as populations expand and economies grow in developing countries, they will aspire to the comforts and amenities taken for granted in industrialized nations, and this will mean more cars on the roads -- and more oil to power them. 
 According to Exxon's own outlook, global oil demand is set to reach 116 million barrels a day by 2030, up sharply from 86 million barrels a day today. 
 Meanwhile, renewable fuels, like solar, wind and biofuels, will grow at a brisk pace but they will account for just 2 percent of the world's energy supplies by then, according to Exxon, while oil, gas and coal will represent 80 percent of global energy needs by 2030. 
 ''For the foreseeable future -- and in my horizon that is to the middle of the century -- the world will continue to rely dominantly on hydrocarbons to fuel its economy,'' Mr. Tillerson says. 
 For the moment, Exxon does not see much business sense in investing in solar, as BP has, or wind, like Shell, or geothermal, like Chevron. Like many oil executives, Mr. Tillerson also has little sympathy for corn-based ethanol, which he once derisively referred to as ''moonshine.'' 
 Exxon does not entirely close the door to alternative investments someday. But its previous forays into renewable fuels -- it was a big investor in nuclear power, synthetic fuels and solar energy in the 1970s -- are seen as a costly lesson.
 ''Being first in something is not necessarily the best position to be in,'' Mr. Tillerson says. ''You can be more profitable for your shareholders by coming at a later stage.'' 
 Still, Exxon sees itself as a technology-based company. Its labs are developing a thin-film battery separator and an onboard hydrogen system that could increase the range of electric cars or make the current internal combustion engines much more efficient.
 The company points out that it has invested more than $1.5 billion to improve its own energy use and cut carbon emissions since 2004. And it boasts that it is spending $100 million to finance a long-term research program at Stanford University, along with General Electric, Toyota and the oilfield-services company Schlumberger, to find ways to increase energy supplies while reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. 
 But to many of the company's critics, these measures look like a convenient smoke screens. 
 ''That's kind of laughable,'' says Mr. Davies of Greenpeace. ''What Exxon is clearly saying is that we are addicted to oil.'' 
 THE biggest area where Exxon may have an impact in tackling climate change is in what the industry calls carbon capture and sequestration. Most climate experts say that combating global warming will involve preventing heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide from being spewed into the atmosphere by capturing them and pumping them underground. 
 In May, Exxon said it would invest $100 million in a demonstration plant in Wyoming to test a new cryogenic technology to capture carbon dioxide by freezing it. Managing these flows, and reducing the costs of this prohibitively expensive technology, may ultimately create a new business for Exxon if it can apply it to large emission sources, like coal-fired power plants.
 But for the company to see this as a large-scale opportunity would require a ''cultural leap,'' Ms. Jaffe says. 
 ''Exxon may wind up being the carbon sequestration king, by accident,'' she says.
 Whatever shape Exxon's business model takes, analysts say it is unlikely that the company will get there quietly. 
 ''They are tough, and they have the reputation of being an unyielding company,'' says Michelle Michot Foss, who heads the Center for Energy Economics at the University of Texas at Austin. ''But it's a tough business. They are criticized for being too conservative. But they are very patient, and probably in the long term that pays off.''

HEADLINE: Have You Driven a Bus or a Train Lately?

BYLINE: By ROBERT GOODMAN. 
Robert Goodman, a professor of environmental design at Hampshire College, is the author, most recently, of ''The Luck Business.''

DATELINE: Amherst, Mass. 

 BODY:
 THE federal government is giving General Motors, Ford and Chrysler $25 billion in low-interest loans, and the companies are asking for up to $25 billion more. These same companies have spent millions of dollars lobbying against federal fuel-economy standards and are suing to overturn the emissions standards imposed by California and other states. In exchange for the loans, Congress should first insist that the automakers stop fighting these standards. But it should also make sure that better outcomes will result from these billions than just fuel-efficient cars. 
 The Obama administration should ask the companies, as a condition of financial assistance, to begin shifting from being just automakers to becoming innovative ''transportmakers.'' As Barack Obama's new chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, recently said: ''You don't ever want a crisis to go to waste. It's an opportunity to do important things you would otherwise avoid.'' 
 As transportmakers, the companies could produce vehicles for high-speed train and bus systems that would improve our travel options, reduce global warming, conserve energy, minimize accidents and generally improve the way we live. 
 This better way forward has been kicking around Washington for more than 35 years. In a prescient 1972 article in The Atlantic, Stewart Udall, an interior secretary under John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, warned of America's excessive dependence on cars and called for this approach. 
 At a time when almost no politicians and industry leaders were paying attention to this problem, Mr. Udall made a bleak but accurate prediction. He wrote that ''the oil needs of the other industrialized countries are growing faster than ours'' and that this ''surge of demand will soon begin to send shock waves through the American economy and transportation system.'' 
 ''Unless we exercise foresight and devise growth-limits policies for the auto industry, events will thrust us into a crisis that will lead to a substantial erosion of our domestic oil supply as well as the independence it provides us with,'' Mr. Udall wrote. He predicted that the cost of petroleum imports would ''give the Middle Eastern suppliers a dangerous leverage over our transportation system as well.'' 
 But Mr. Udall recognized that the country could not afford the economic consequences of losing all of the automobile industry's jobs and profits. He proposed that the auto companies branch out into ''exciting new variants of ground transportation'' to produce minibuses, ''people movers,'' urban mass transit and high-speed intercity trains. Instead of expanding the Interstate highway system, he suggested that the road construction industry take on ''huge new programs to construct mass transit systems.'' And he called for building ''more compact, sensitively planned communities'' rather than continuing urban sprawl.
 As we now know, warnings like these went unheeded, and Americans became ever more car-dependent. And now, the auto industry is asking for government money that promises, even with more fuel-efficient cars, to give us more of the same. Instead of supporting companies that want to put as many cars on the road as possible, we need a transformational strategy. 
 As part of its loan package, the government should insist on the development of ''transportmaker business plans'' from the car companies, with specific timelines for developing more fuel-efficient cars. The companies should also provide detailed plans to transform some of their factories into research and manufacturing centers for the development of light-rail cars and high-speed trains and buses. (In some cases, these could run on existing tracks and on the median strips of Interstate highways; in others, entirely new lanes and tracks would be built.) 
 Even before Mr. Udall, there was ample precedent for these ideas. In the early 1930s, G.M. joined with other companies to develop the Burlington Zephyr, a radically innovative train that broke world speed records and cut train travel times in half. During World War II, the auto companies converted their factories to build not only military trucks and jeeps, but also airplanes, weapons, tanks and other vehicles. Ford's Willow Run plant built thousands of B-24 bombers, becoming the world's biggest bomber plant. 
 The research and production capacity that the car companies built during the 20th century could be adapted for the needs of the 21st. But other companies should be able to bid for the same opportunities. 
 Stewart Udall rejected the view that American prosperity depended on Detroit producing ever more cars. The financial crisis gives us a second chance to make his vision happen.

HEADLINE: The March of the Resumes

BYLINE: By JAKE MOONEY

 BODY:
MAURICE PINZON had his moment in politics. But Mr. Pinzon, a native of Flushing, Queens, who worked for former City Councilwoman Ronnie Eldridge, always assumed that moment had passed. Since 2001, when Ms. Eldridge's term ended, he has worked as a photographer, a software developer, a reporter on a news Web site he founded and a college administrator.
 ''I always told people that I would never work for a politician again after Ronnie,'' he said the other day. It was too hard, he believed, for a local leader to get things done. Then he started paying closer attention to Barack Obama. Mr. Pinzon observed an unusual grace, something in the way the president-elect moved. It was something, he thought, that he'd like to photograph. 
 Like a lot of people in deep ''blue'' New York in the election's buoyant aftermath, Mr. Pinzon began dreaming of a change of his own -- a job in Washington, in his case as a White House photographer. He called Ms. Eldridge, an early Obama supporter, to explore the possibilities, though he said he was not sure whether he would follow up.
 ''I've become a little bit jaded, and reported enough on the issues to know that you always have to keep a critical eye,'' Mr. Pinzon said in a free moment from his job at La Guardia Community College. ''But it is sort of like a seduction.''
 If anecdotal evidence is to be trusted, the same fantasy has occurred to lots of people. The federal Plum Book, a directory of about 7,000 available jobs in the incoming administration, was released online on Wednesday, and the natural reaction -- among the unemployed, the happily employed and the restless alike -- was familiar: Why not me?
 Turning dream into reality is another story. 
 ''I get calls from people, but I haven't got the faintest idea what to do,'' Ms. Eldridge said. ''So I tell them to fill out the form on the Internet.''
 She was referring to Change.gov, the Web site of the Obama transition team, where people can submit resumes. Doing so draws this response: 
 ''As you can imagine, we are receiving thousands of applications during the transition process,'' it reads, noting that the top positions will be filled first, and adding, ''If you do not hear from us for several weeks or months, please do not think we have lost your information.''
 Even for the better-connected, the process is no less daunting. A former aide for a Democratic primary candidate, who now works in Manhattan, said he figured the pecking order among low-level job applicants was as follows: longtime Obama campaign workers, followed by short-time workers, other primary workers and the general public.
 However, an Obama transition spokesman, Nick Shapiro, said, ''First and most important, they're looking for the best and brightest, no matter where they came from.''
 Then, the former aide said, there are Democrats who have worked as Congressional staff members or elsewhere in government during the eight years the party has been out of power. Put together, their sweep into Washington after years in exile could rival that of Franklin Roosevelt's young New Dealers or the John Kennedy administration. But first there is the scramble for position.
 ''It's a total free-for-all,'' said the former aide, who has already been getting calls from acquaintances seeking contacts but spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to hurt his own job prospects. ''At the end of the day, it's still trying to get a handle on who you know that's there.''
 Still, the dream remains for people like Awilda Cordero, a community organizer raised in the South Bronx who swayed her family to Mr. Obama's side during the primaries, served as an Obama delegate at the convention and volunteered for his campaign in Texas, where she met the candidate. 
 Ms. Cordero, 46, said last week that she was happy where she was, working at a law firm and at a nonprofit group she founded called Emergency Rights. Still, she acknowledged, a job in the administration would be hard to turn down, because she identifies with Mr. Obama -- like her, he was raised by a single mother -- and because of the chance to be part of history. Or rather, she corrected herself, ''I am part of history, and I'd like to continue it.''

HEADLINE: Financial Expressionism

BYLINE: JOSE R. LOPEZ

 BODY:
The painter Geoffrey Raymond recalls standing outside the offices of Bear Stearns in the spring, offering a marker to a laid-off employee. He watched as she took the marker and scrawled some words on an image of James E. Cayne, the company's chairman. Bear Stearns's situation had become so dire that it was being forced to sell itself to JPMorgan Chase. 
 ''My blood is boiling,'' the former employee wrote.
 In a style he describes as ''Jackson Pollock-Chuck Close fusion,'' Mr. Raymond has been painting portraits of the key players in the nation's financial turmoil. He has also appeared outside places like Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and the New York Stock Exchange, where he has offered pens to dismissed employees, exchange workers and the general public, allowing them to scrawl their sentiments on the artwork.
 ''What I am doing is multifold,'' Mr. Raymond said in an e-mail message. ''When I paint a portrait then watch the annotations build up, the first thing I notice is that the painting itself changes visually. Once densely packed, the annotations come to look like brushstrokes. As a painter I like how the comments transform the appearance
 of the work in a painterly way. But the painting is transformed in a different way as well: it stops being just a painting and starts being a historical document.''
 ''It's the healing power of art,'' Mr. Raymond said.

HEADLINE: As Leaders Wrestle With Downturn, Developing Nations Get Ringside Seats

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Mark Landler and David D. Kirkpatrick contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
When President Bush welcomed leaders from around the world to the White House on Friday night, for what may well be one of the last formal dinners of his administration, the topic was the fragile world economy and the lush menu, belying the financial crisis, featured thyme-roasted rack of lamb. But the real story was in the seating chart.
 There, in the State Dining Room beneath a massive portrait of Abraham Lincoln, to Mr. Bush's right was President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil, who has complained loudly that developing nations like his were being ''infected with problems'' not of their making. To Mr. Bush's left sat a leader with a fat checkbook and the power that comes with it, President Hu Jintao of China. 
 It was a startling illustration of the way the financial crisis, which originated on Wall Street and has spread around the globe, has remade the international economic world order. By insisting that developing nations be included in the summit meeting, President Bush gave fresh clout to their leaders, each of whom arrived in Washington with his or her own agenda.
 But it will be up to a new United States president, Barack Obama, to figure out how to juggle those competing interests -- and quickly. The declaration adopted by the leaders on Saturday calls for a second summit just 101 days after Mr. Obama is sworn in. All around Washington this weekend, as black motorcades sped about town and fancy hotels were marked off with the tell-tale police barricades, a sure sign a world leader was in residence, was evidence of Mr. Obama's challenge.
 At the elegant Willard InterContinental Hotel, one of the city's finest, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France held court after the conference was over. Hours earlier, Mr. Sarkozy was looking chummy with Mr. Bush, giving the president an Obama-style fist bump as the leaders lined up for their official summit ''family photo.'' 
 It was Mr. Sarkozy who had pressed a reluctant President Bush into having the summit in the first place, and at the Willard, he was not shy about claiming credit for it -- or proclaiming that the era of American hegemony in world finance was over.
 ''America is the No. 1 power in the world,'' he declared. ''Is it the only power? No, it isn't. We are in a new world.''
 Over at the Washington Club, an exclusive private club on Dupont Circle, the president of Russia, Dmitri A. Medvedev, addressed an overflow crowd at the Council on Foreign Relations. Mr. Medvedev has been especially combative toward the United States over the economy.
 But on Saturday, his talk had little to do with the economy; he spoke at length about the fragile state of United States-Russian relations, and expressed hope that the current chill would thaw under Mr. Obama.
 Earlier, at the summit meeting at the National Building Museum, there was lively luncheon talk among the leaders about free trade and the international trade negotiations known as the Doha Round, which have been all but given up for dead. President da Silva of Brazil, who had arrived determined to push for a revival of the trade talks, gave an impassioned speech about what the developing world wants the developed world to do, according to one person who attended.
 ''We are not asking for assistance; we are not asking for you to give us funds,'' Mr. da Silva said, according to this person, who spoke anonymously so he could give a free account of the remarks. ''What we want you to do is to fix your own economies. The best thing you can do for us is to return to growth.''
 Twenty nations were invited to participate in the meeting, and only two were led by women, neither of whom brought a very strong hand. One of them, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, has become a close ally of Mr. Bush's, but the German economy has just slipped into recession, and its banks are suffering from having purchased a raft of toxic mortgage-related assets from the United States.
 The other, President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of Argentina, is in the economic doghouse with foreign investors, who are pulling their money out of her country after Argentina decided to nationalize $26 billion of private pension funds, raising fears the government was short on cash. 
 Mrs. Kirchner did little to enhance her reputation for competence when she showed up late for the official photograph on Saturday. She missed the first picture, but the leaders regrouped and took another after she arrived. Mr. Bush, who prides himself on punctuality, just shrugged.
 Photographs were the least of his worries; he arrived with an agenda of his own, determined to use the session to lay down a few markers on his way out of office. His first message, aimed at Democrats who are blocking a free trade agreement with Colombia, was that world leaders favor liberal trade rules. Second, he wanted to push back against the notion that free-market capitalism was the root cause of the global meltdown.
 On both counts, Mr. Bush seems to have succeeded; the communique issued at the meeting's conclusion said the leaders ''underscore the critical importance of rejecting protectionism,'' and it was laden with language about the importance of free markets. When the session was over, Mr. Bush emerged to greet reporters and offer a handoff to his successor.
 ''Some of you may not have heard yet,'' he said wryly, ''but I am retiring.''

OUTPOSTS Between big servings of moose chili and self-servings of blather, Gov. Sarah Palin has yet to explain the disturbing message that our 49th state sent to the Outside with the results of the Nov. 4 election.
 Nearly half the voters want to send a felon back to the United States Senate -- you go, crook! And a clear majority is backing one of the most ethically tainted congressmen in the land -- power to the porkster! 
 Oh, and all that stuff about wealth redistribution: Only one state relies on a truly socialistic model for its welfare, and with falling oil prices, Palin's People's Republic of Alaska is facing an enormous fiscal crisis.
 This tax-free state, where every man, woman and baby gets an annual check as part of their share of redistributed oil wealth, may have to actually start paying for itself.
 But none of this has crossed the glossy lips of the governor. As Palin was spreading a cartoon narrative of herself as a caribou-huntin' gal on the lookout for creeping Marxism while slaying the bad boys of the Far North, the state that she governs was stepping all over her message.

 Reader Comments:
 The myth of self-reliance that permeates the American West is woefully at odds with reality. The rural economy there is maintained by federally funded irrigation projects, 19th-century fees for grazing and mining, subsidies for unwanted crops and bargain-priced water rights. But Alaska, in the guise of Governor Palin, seems to take this delusional self-identity to an entirely new level.

 DOMESTIC DISTURBANCES There's nothing worse than being told you have a major blind spot. That your self-assured joyousness is built upon exclusion. 
 Particularly when the person telling you this is right.
 Now, I hadn't exactly ignored the spate of anti-gay ballot initiatives that had passed in California, Arkansas, Florida and Arizona on Nov. 4. I'd read about the success of Arizona's long-attempted gay marriage ban and California's Proposition 8, which prohibited gay marriage just six months after the state's Supreme Court ruled that the right to marry was fundamental and constitutionally protected for all. 
 I'd read about how voters in Florida had decided to target not only same-sex marriage but all relationships that were the ''substantial equivalent'' of marriage, like domestic partnerships and civil unions, and how in Arkansas, where gay marriage was already banned, voters had decided to deny anyone ''cohabitating outside a valid marriage'' the right to adopt or be a foster parent.
 How strange, I'd thought, reading about how, on the day of progressive victories -- Obama's historic win, South Dakota voters' rejection of a wide-ranging abortion ban, Californians voting down a ballot initiative that would have required parental notification for abortion -- these states had passed such uniquely reactionary and discriminatory measures. How ugly. That's really too bad.
 And then I'd moved on. As most people who were not directly affected by the anti-gay-rights measures did. There was just too much else to feel good about.

 Reader Comments:
 My fellow South Africans and I rejoiced when Barack Obama was elected president of the United States. This has given us hope that the world is getting closer to entering a new age of tolerance and cooperation. What is being done to American gays and lesbians has tainted that hope.

 I can understand the disappointment and anger expressed by those who support the constitutional right of gay couples to marry. However, it would be interesting if the same people reflected on why voters voted the way they did. Barack Obama's position, which apparently springs from his religious faith, is not unusual, and presumably nobody would accuse him of blind prejudice. It would be helpful if the reluctance of large numbers of people to accept gay marriage were addressed, rather than merely dismissed.

 TALK SHOW Electronic devices dislike me. There is never a day when something isn't ailing. Now something has gone wrong with all three television sets. They will get only Sarah Palin.
 I can play a kind of Alaskan roulette. Any random channel clicked on by the remote brings up that eager face, with its continuing assaults on the English Lang. What have we done to deserve this, this media blitz that the astute Andrea Mitchell has labeled ''The Victory Tour''? What will ambitious politicos learn from this? That frayed syntax, bungled grammar and run-on sentences that ramble on long after thought has given out completely are a candidate's valuable traits? 
 And how much more of all that lies in our future if God points her to those open-a-crack doors she refers to? The ones she resolves to splinter and bulldoze her way through upon glimpsing the opportunities, revealed from on high.

 HEADING HOME During the season, you barely have time for everyday life, then, in a flash, you have too much time, you start to overthink everything. And your epiphanies are absolute: you don't just find an answer to a problem, you find the answer. That is probably why you break up with your girlfriend, or get back together with that ex-girlfriend, or discover, while engrossed in a late-night game of Texas Hold 'Em, the precise problem with your swing. You figure everything out in the blink of an eye. And that is not a good thing.
 As time went on, I got more creative with that extra time. One temptation for many players, after a few years in the big leagues, is to buy something absurd and frivolous. Some turn up each spring training with a new car, then proceed to upgrade it as if it had worn out like a pair of sneakers. 
 At the New York Yankees camp, I got teased about what I considered to be an expensive Range Rover S.U.V. Why? Because after 14 years of pro baseball, I apparently hadn't splurged enough. On top of that, I'd brought only one vehicle to camp. I simply hadn't realized the scale by which I was being measured. One teammate changed his spring training apartment just to have an extra parking space for his second vehicle. The bar is high.

HEADLINE: World Leaders Vow Joint Push To Aid Economy

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Steven Lee Myers, David D. Kirkpatrick and Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Facing the gravest economic crisis in decades, the leaders of 20 countries agreed Saturday to work together to revive their economies, but they put off thornier decisions about how to overhaul financial regulations until next year, providing a serious early challenge for the Obama administration.
Though the countries' stimulus packages were cast as ambitious steps, they mainly reflected measures that the countries were already undertaking to respond to the crisis. What remains to be seen is whether, working with a new White House, the leaders will cast aside their political and economic differences to embrace more radical changes, including far-reaching but fiercely debated proposals to overhaul regulation.
The group planned its next meeting for April 30, 101 days after President-elect Barack Obama is sworn into office.
Mr. Obama, who sent emissaries but did not attend at the meeting, will find common ground with the leaders in his support of a further stimulus program in the United States -- something President Bush opposes. The group called for more fiscal measures to cushion the blow of a downturn that is hitting rich and poor countries. 
Two senior advisers for Mr. Obama, Madeleine K. Albright and James A. Leach, met privately with leaders on the sidelines. And Mr. Obama addressed the meeting only obliquely on Saturday in his first radio address as president-elect, in which he expressed appreciation that Mr. Bush ''has initiated this process, because our global economic crisis requires a coordinated global response.''
Meeting here, in the capital of the country where the crisis began, the extraordinary gathering of leaders from the Group of 20, representing wealthy countries and major emerging economies, began what participants said would be a broad reform of the institutions that have governed global markets since World War II.
In a five-page communique that mixed general principles with specific steps, the G-20 pledged a new effort to bolster supervision of banks and credit-rating agencies, scrutinize executive pay and tighten controls on complex derivatives, which deepened the recent market turmoil.
''Our nations agree that we must make the financial markets more transparent and accountable,'' President Bush said. He warned that ''a meeting is not going to solve the world's problems,'' and described the talks as the beginning of a process that would carry over to the next administration.
With dueling press briefings and statements through the weekend, it was clear that bridging ideological gaps among nations afflicted with different versions of the economic contagion would provide the new president and other world leaders with a daunting challenge.
There is also a more basic philosophical divide across the Atlantic: Europeans in general favor more state control over markets, even to the point of granting regulators cross-border authority, while the United States stresses the primacy of national regulators. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who called on Mr. Bush to organize the meeting, alluded to those differences, saying the negotiations, even on general principles, had been challenging.
Mr. Sarkozy said: ''I am a friend of the United States of America, but if you ask, was it easy? No, it wasn't easy.'' He added that he did not fly to Washington ''simply for the pleasure of traveling.''
He said the Americans had made concessions even by agreeing to discuss issues like regulatory coordination and executive pay. The communique, however, suggested there were concessions on both sides.
Prodded by Mr. Bush, who earlier in the week gave an impassioned defense of capitalism, the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to free markets and trade. But they also clearly laid blame for the crisis at the doorstep of the United States, saying ''some advanced countries'' had taken inadequate steps to prevent a buildup of dangerous risks.
The meeting set out a road map for overhauling regulations in a wide range of areas, and assigned the work to groups of experts. At the next meeting, which Mr. Sarkozy proposed to hold in London, the leaders will debate specific proposals developed by those groups.
Among those measures is a European proposal to set up so-called colleges of supervisors, which would meet regularly to share information about global banks with operations in many countries.
Another idea is to expand the membership of the Financial Stability Forum, an influential group of finance ministers and central bankers from industrialized countries, to include emerging markets like Brazil and China.
Still, for all the talk of action and history-making change, some experts said the outcome was disappointing.
''This is plain-vanilla stuff they could have agreed on without holding a meeting,'' said Simon Johnson, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund. ''What's new, except that this is the G-20 instead of the G-7?''
Despite broad support for economic stimulus, the leaders were not able to agree on a coordinated global effort. The Bush administration, which does not favor a further stimulus, resisted that idea. And the proposal for colleges of supervisors fell short of an international regulatory agency favored by the French. The Bush administration opposes any regulatory agency with cross-border authority.
The statement did not single out hedge funds as needing regulation, which Germany has long advocated. German diplomats said they were satisfied that the issue would be addressed later. ''There shall be no blind spots,'' said the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.
Despite playing up the role of the International Monetary Fund as a vehicle for helping developing countries in crisis, the leaders did not call for an expansion in the fund's lending resources.
Collectively, the leaders here represented countries that account for 85 percent of the world's economy. But the guest list was more remarkable for what it said about the shifting landscape of power. With the United States and Europe struggling economically and consumed by efforts to stabilize their banks, China, Japan and Saudi Arabia emerged as the likeliest candidates to help distressed countries.
In one of the few concrete commitments, the Japanese prime minister, Taro Aso, pledged to increase lending to the I.M.F. by up to $100 billion, and he encouraged other cash-rich countries to do the same. On Saturday, the fund added Pakistan to its list of countries receiving emergency funds. Pakistan said it had agreed to a loan of $7.6 billion to prevent a default by its government.
Some leaders were simply eager to be heard. ''Emerging market countries were not the cause of this crisis, but they are amongst its most affected victims,'' the prime minister of India, Manmohan Singh, said.
The leaders convened in the colonnaded great hall of the National Building Museum, a 19th-century building that served as headquarters for the United States Pension Fund after the Civil War. It was also the place Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton used to end her presidential campaign last June.
Mr. Bush, accompanied by his Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., sat between Brazil's president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who chairs the Group of 20, and Prime Minister Aso.
Afterward, Mr. Bush acknowledged that expanding the group from the customary seven or eight industrialized powers to 20 nations raised the risk that nothing substantive would get done.
But Mr. Bush said the meeting had been surprisingly substantive, and he seemed enthusiastic about one of the more arcane proposals: a clearinghouse for the $33 trillion market in credit default swaps.
These derivatives, which act as a form of insurance against the failure of an underlying asset, have been blamed for exacerbating the recent market upheaval. A clearinghouse would back trades in credit default swaps and absorb losses if a dealer in these securities failed.
Mr. Bush said he felt compelled to act because ''if you don't take decisive measures, then it's conceivable that our country could go into a depression greater than the Great Depressions.''
When Mr. Sarkozy first proposed the meeting, some predicted it would be dominated by finger-pointing. Now, some critics said the communique did not go far enough in assigning blame for the crisis.
''Anyone looking for the G-20 to issue a mea culpa on the global financial crisis will be sadly disappointed,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard. The leaders ''curiously downplay the huge culpability of the political leadership in the U.S. and Europe.''
With Mr. Bush's imminent departure, however, there seemed to be little appetite to pile on the United States.
With Congress likely to consider a stimulus package in the coming weeks or in January, Mr. Johnson of M.I.T. said Mr. Obama might be able to go to the next summit meeting with strong evidence of American action.
''The U.S., despite having broken all the china, may end up playing a decisive role in fixing this situation,'' he said.

 BODY:
It is curious that after denouncing economists for failing to predict the credit crisis, James Galbraith perpetuates the myth that Alan Greenspan oversaw a ''deregulated'' economy (Questions for, Nov. 2). Sarbanes-Oxley introduced a maze of restrictions on the financial industry, and dozens of government departments, agencies and commissions issued more than 51,000 regulatory rules between 1995 and 2007 alone (most of these while Republicans controlled Congress). Regulation has contributed enormously to strangling our financial and economic system, and neither effective solutions nor better forecasting can be expected until we face this.

HEADLINE: When It Really Counts, Qualifications Trump Race

BYLINE: By ROBERT H. FRANK. 
Robert H. Frank, an economist at Cornell, is a visiting faculty member at the Stern School of Business at New York University.

 BODY:
WHILE campaigning in western Pennsylvania last month, Barack Obama was asked whether racial bias might hurt his campaign. ''What I've found is that people here, they don't care what color you are,'' Mr. Obama told a Pittsburgh television reporter. ''What they're trying to figure out is, who can deliver? It's just like the Pittsburgh Steelers. They don't care what color you are, they want to make sure you can make the plays.''
 Mr. Obama's comments didn't cite Milton Friedman directly, but they could be read as an implicit endorsement of the late Nobel laureate's claim that competitive markets are the surest way to eliminate job discrimination. Mr. Friedman, the conservative thinker who taught at the University of Chicago years before Mr. Obama's arrival there, advanced this position forcefully in his 1962 book, ''Capitalism and Freedom.'' 
 The Friedman argument rests on the observation that when business owners don't hire the most qualified candidate, they pay a price. Some owners might be happy to discriminate if they could do so without penalty, Mr. Friedman conceded. But discrimination in a free market is always costly, he said. If owners hire a white candidate who is less able than a black candidate they could have hired, profits suffer. Mr. Friedman argued that most owners would conclude that discrimination simply isn't worth it. (Mr. Friedman, of course, had no illusions that competition would eliminate the disadvantages that stem from growing up in poverty or attending substandard schools.)
 The notion that employer discrimination will be eliminated by competition is appealing, but it's not consistent with field experiments suggesting that such bias in labor markets remains widespread. In a 2004 paper published in the American Economic Review, for example, Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan, professors of economics at the University of Chicago and Harvard, respectively, found that applicants named Lakisha or Jamal were less likely to be considered for jobs, even when they had qualifications on paper that were similar to those of applicants named Emily or Greg. In response to job advertisements in Boston and Chicago newspapers, the economists submitted fictitious resumes and cover letters under the two sets of names. Candidates with the Anglo names, they reported, were significantly more likely to be invited for interviews.
 Many economists concede the validity of Milton Friedman's argument when all participants in a labor market are well-informed, particularly employers, who would need precise measures of applicants' abilities to estimate how costly discrimination would be. In reality, though, hiring decisions are often made under time pressure with imperfect information about candidates. In a 2005 paper jointly written with Dolly Chugh, an N.Y.U. management professor, Ms. Bertrand and Mr. Mullainathan argued that under these circumstances, labor market discrimination may persist -- albeit often outside the conscious awareness of those who make hiring decisions. 
 In any event, Mr. Friedman's argument is clearly most persuasive when labor market conditions come closest to the full-information competitive ideal described in textbooks. So Mr. Obama's invocation of the Pittsburgh Steelers was well chosen for the point he was making. Professional sports markets may not match the textbook ideal, but they are at least as competitive as other labor markets and have no shortage of data on candidates. 
 For example, teams hire high-priced scouts who spend thousands of hours gathering detailed data about individual prospects before deciding whom to draft or hire as free agents. Won-lost records provide a conspicuous measure of success. And while corporations often retain employees who are well past their productive prime, professional athletes who have lost a step are usually cut pretty quickly. In short, professional sports provides as forceful an example as we are likely to find of a market in which the color of a person's skin is irrelevant. 
 By contrast, the job market for presidents -- the election campaign, culminating in the actual vote on Election Day -- may be the best method we've come up with for choosing a national leader, but as I'll explain, it bears little resemblance to the textbook ideal of a perfectly competitive job market.
 In 2008, however, an unusual confluence of circumstances made the resemblance much closer than usual. With the economy in the midst of its most serious downward spiral since the Great Depression, voters were forcefully reminded that the quality of the person they elected could have enormous implications for their own well-being. The campaign also began earlier and confronted voters with a tremendous amount of information, on the Internet as well as through traditional media, about the candidates' positions and achievements. 
 In typical campaigns, candidates stick to carefully prepared scripts that many voters find difficult to distinguish. But this year's volatile climate forced candidates to react to events on the fly, often in full public view. And in addition to whatever impressions they were forming on their own, many voters were undoubtedly influenced by trusted figures like Warren E. Buffett, Paul A. Volcker and Colin L. Powell, who were telling them that Obama was the better choice. 
 All told, the 2008 campaign made it hard to deny the importance of choosing a candidate who could ''make the plays.'' Under these circumstances, even some strongly prejudiced voters might have found the price of indulging their bias too steep. If the stakes had been lower, race might well have been a bigger issue. 
 Even so, Mr. Obama's election could mean that race will henceforth always matter less. Such, at any rate, is what the experience of the world of professional sports suggests.
 There were no black major league baseball players before Branch Rickey, the Brooklyn Dodgers team president, added Jackie Robinson to his roster in 1947. During Mr. Robinson's 10-year career with the team, the Dodgers went to six World Series and he was voted to the National League All-Star team six times. In retirement, he was elected to Baseball's Hall of Fame on the first ballot. Shortly after Mr. Robinson's arrival in the major leagues, it became clear to all that failure to field the best possible team, irrespective of color, was a sure recipe for failure. 
 As events unfold, it will be interesting to see whether Mr. Obama changes voting practices as much as Mr. Robinson changed hiring practices in baseball.

HEADLINE: 11-16-08: The Other Winner

BYLINE: By Matt Bai. 
Matt Bai writes on politics for the magazine.

 BODY:
There was a moment last summer when Howard Dean's tenure as chairman of the Democratic Party seemed on the verge of a colossal failure. The party's nomination process, which was supposed to have been settled by March, was devolving into a rolling civil war without end, and Democrats grumbled that Dean -- who might have stepped in and sorted out the mess before it got to the convention floor -- seemed reluctant to intervene. Of all the various party entities that raise money, only Dean's national committee was getting clobbered by Republicans. For years, Democratic Congressional leaders had been mocking Dean's ''50-state strategy'' -- his plan to rebuild local parties in every state, especially in rural areas of the South and West, by hiring organizers rather than saving that money for television ads in perennial battlegrounds like Florida and Ohio. Now they whispered that his incompetence might cost them the White House. 
 When I spoke to him on the day after Barack Obama swept into the White House with the largest Congressional Democratic majorities since the 1970s, Dean, characteristically defiant, refused to admit to feeling vindicated. ''Everyone asks me that,'' he said. ''Vindication is not an emotion that ever touches me, because I don't have any doubts when I'm doing it.'' But if election night stamped Obama indelibly into the pages of American history, then Dean's place in that history, too, should probably be revisited. Very nearly discarded by his contemporaries as a spectacularly flawed presidential candidate and a bumbling chairman, Dean may well be remembered instead as the flinty figure who bridged the distance between one generation of Democrats and the next, the man who first gave voice to liberal fury and tapped transformative technologies at the dawn of the century -- and then channeled all of it into rebuilding the party's grass-roots apparatus. Just as Ronald Reagan and the conservatives learned from Barry Goldwater, just as Franklin Roosevelt and the New Dealers took inspiration from reformers like Robert La Follette, so, too, did Obama and the new progressives in America evolve from Howard Dean.
 Skeptics will argue, of course, that Dean's stewardship of the party had little to do with the Democratic rout. After all, conservative states like Virginia, Indiana and North Carolina were in play principally because Republicans had so badly mismanaged the government and because of an economic collapse that was, to be a little crass, remarkably fortunate. And in Obama, the party fielded a nominee this time who was, for all his lack of experience, vastly more compelling than his most recent predecessors on the ticket. 
 And yet, it was Dean, back when Obama was still serving in the Illinois State Senate, who first introduced his party to the idea that, in the Internet age, a campaign could be built from the ground up, that door-to-door organizing could matter more than TV ads. And it was Dean who argued forcefully, as chairman, that Democrats in this new era could compete in the reddest of states and build a truly national party at a time when others in the party were belittling rural voters and agitating for a complete withdrawal from the South. Now the Republicans are the ones who find themselves reduced to regional influence, their shrinking Congressional delegations confined mostly to the South and West. (Remarkably, not a single New England Republican now remains in the House.) Dean didn't create the conditions that made that reversal possible, but he always said that if you wanted to be in a position to take advantage of favorable circumstances, then you had to at least have basic party infrastructures in place. ''Chance favors the prepared mind,'' Dean told me, not for the first time. ''You show up, you keep working and hopefully you catch a break.''
 That he did. Dean inherited a party so dispirited after its defeat in 2004 that few other Democrats of note expressed the least interest in running it; the party he relinquishes this January, making way for whomever Obama chooses to succeed him, will firmly control all three power centers in Washington, brandishing a decisive governing mandate for the first time since 1992. (Obama's 53 percent of the popular vote hardly qualifies as the ''landslide'' that some commentators said it was but, as Andrei Cherny noted on Huffington Post, Obama is only the fourth Democrat in American history to win at least 51 percent of the vote.) The important question for Democrats to consider now is what that mandate actually means.
 Even before the country voted, as the contours of a Democratic wave began to come into focus, a story line of the election was taking hold among Democrats in Washington: repulsed by the incompetence of the Bush administration, American voters had at last renounced the conservative ethos of the Reagan-Bush era and had moved, en masse, to embrace the Democratic Party and its agenda. Polls showed, after all, that the number of people identifying themselves as Republicans had fallen sharply, while the ranks of those calling themselves Democrats had swelled. Surveys indicated that voters, in the wake of the credit crisis, had warmed to the idea of activist government. In fact, the election results, and especially the pivotal Democratic victories in Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada, seemed to validate the influential theory of the ''emerging Democratic majority,'' advanced by the liberal political analysts Ruy Teixeira and John B. Judis in 2002. Combing through demographic trends, Teixeira and Judis hypothesized then that increasing numbers of nonwhite and new-economy voters would soon transform the country's electoral landscape and create new opportunities for Democrats, most notably in the West.
 The cautionary note here, for jubilant Democrats, is that there is little reason to believe that the electoral trend in their favor actually reflects any widespread ideological shift. If you only look at numerical majorities, it might well seem that the story of the last 20 years in American politics is one in which voters have swerved erratically from one ideological pole to the next, embracing a harsh kind of conservatism in 1994 and then a resurgent liberalism in 2006. In reality, though, the American public doesn't seem to move very much in its basic attitudes about government, which have remained mostly pragmatic and predictable; simply put, people tend to want a little more government when times are tough and a little less when things are going well. The number of voters who identified themselves in exit polls as conservative, liberal or moderate remained virtually unchanged between 2004 and 2008 -- and in fact, those numbers have been more or less steady for decades.
 The real trend line in our politics -- from Ross Perot and Bill Clinton in 1992 to Obama this year -- speaks not to any change in governing philosophy but to a growing frustration with incumbency and dogma, a sense that both parties are more concerned with perpetuating their own power than they are with adapting government to a fast-changing world. Voters aren't really identifying more closely with one party or another when they periodically revolt; they are simply defining themselves against whoever happens to be in charge at the moment.
 Perhaps because he is too young to have lived in a world where party affiliations were as unshakable as religious beliefs, or perhaps because he has spent so little of his life in Washington, Obama seems intuitively to understand this dynamic. (His chief strategist, David Axelrod, has long understood it, too.) Obama's entire campaign was based on the rather amorphous idea of ''change'' and postpartisan ideals, on an indictment of the two-party status quo, more than on any ideological argument about the role of government. It now falls to Obama, as it did to Bill Clinton in 1993, to pursue a realist's agenda while somehow restraining the forces in his own party -- powerful liberal committee chairmen, sprawling interest groups -- who would overreach, attempting to make of the party's mandate something that it is not. 
 One significant difference between then and now, however, lies in the nature of the tensions in the Democratic coalition. Clinton's party was riven, predictably enough, by geography and ideology; like Jimmy Carter before him, Clinton tried to straddle an ever-widening gap between Northern and coastal liberals whose ideal of government remained expansive and those Southern and Western Democrats who embraced a more centrist or even conservative philosophy. This was, of course, the same basic divide that underlaid the Democrats' governing coalition since Franklin Roosevelt.
 Obama's landscape is less familiar. Surely there will be some residual clashes between left and center in Obama's party, but his real challenge isn't so much ideological as it is generational, a reconciling of worldviews forged in contrasting American moments. Obama's candidacy was propelled chiefly by groups that are emerging in American politics. He represents the new and ascendant service-industry unions, for instance, as opposed to the industrial-age unions that supported Hillary Clinton. He speaks more to younger voters -- the 40-and-under crowd -- than to their boomer parents, more to African-American families than to their leaders in churches and in Congress, who came to him only grudgingly. Obama ignites more passion among the millions of lesser-engaged, text-messaging Americans who signed up for accounts on his site (and who, in many cases, volunteered for their first political campaign) than he does among the party's older, stalwart activists. 
 This younger Democratic base stands less on loyalty to institutions generally, and that includes the Democratic Party itself. These voters represent a generation of Americans reared in the cynical, detached environment after Watergate rather than in the idealist, more doctrinaire atmosphere of the '60s. To keep his party unified, Obama will have to embody this modern, less-partisan ethos while at the same time respecting the power and conviction of an older set of Democrats who nurture a less-flexible liberal ideal and who aren't yet ready to step aside. Obama's task is to somehow move away from reflexively partisan solutions -- no trade deals, no charter schools, no entitlement reform -- even as he defers to a generation of leaders for whom ideology and partisanship are the guiding paradigms of political thought.
 Voters will be watching to see how Obama achieves this balancing act within his own party -- and none more so, perhaps, than those conservative voters who are waiting to see whether this young Democrat will really deliver the systemic change he promised. In a conversation not long before the end of the campaign, Obama told me he understood that these voters didn't yet feel they knew him and that, even if they voted for him because of their economic jitters, their support would represent little more than an opportunity for him to prove, as president, that he could move beyond the partisan divisions of the last generation. Howard Dean was right to insist that a Democrat in the online age could redraw the political map, and for that he deserves more than passing mention in subsequent histories of the time. But the job of creating a more lasting realignment always falls -- as it did in the eras of the New Dealers and the conservative movement -- to a president with the vision and temperament to pull the country forcibly into the future. For Obama and his party, the only 50-state strategy now is to govern as if they mean it.

HEADLINE: As the Economy Worsens, Is There Money for Play?

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS; Larry Dorman and Richard Sandomir contributed reporting.

 BODY:
From the ''Buick'' emblazoned on Tiger Woods's golf bag to the Chevrolet Camaro that Cole Hamels drove home last month for being named the most valuable player of the World Series, it is hard to be a sports fan without stumbling across some type of advertisement for General Motors. The company consistently ranks first among advertisers of televised sporting events, outspending other automakers by more than two to one.
 But as G.M. faces a financial crisis that has executives pleading with Congress for a federal bailout, many are wondering how far the company's troubles will extend into the sports industry, which is already struggling to attract advertisers and sponsors in a weakened economy. 
 ''It's one of those trickle-down effects that people don't look at,'' said David E. Cole, the chairman of the Center for Automotive Research, a nonprofit research organization. ''It has already hit hard.'' 
 G.M. has been scaling back its sports presence for at least a year. Cadillac, a G.M. brand, withdrew its sponsorship of the Masters golf tournament in January, and this summer, G.M. ended its relationships with two Nascar racetracks: Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee and New Hampshire Motor Speedway. The company is not renewing its longstanding partnership with the United States Olympic Committee when their contract expires at the end of this year. In one of the most dramatic examples of the company's diminishing sports profile, G.M. said recently that it would not buy television commercials in this season's Super Bowl broadcast.
 As G.M. argues its case before Congress, some firms whose contracts with the company are up for renewal are anxiously monitoring developments. 
 ''We're actually in negotiations as we speak,'' said Mitch Huberman, the senior vice president of Fox Sports Enterprises, which owns Pac-10 Properties and handles marketing for the Pacific-10 conference. Its contract with Pontiac, also produced by G.M., ends this year. ''There are a lot of question marks in terms of where budgets are going,'' Huberman said. ''It's kind of wait and see.''
 G.M., hit hard by plummeting consumer spending and tight credit markets, has reported that it is running out of cash and faces bankruptcy if it does not receive emergency federal assistance. In its third-quarter report, released earlier this month, the company said it planned to trim advertising by 20 percent and promotional spending by 25 percent. 
 ''We're looking at literally everything,'' said Peter Ternes, G.M.'s director of communications for sales, service and marketing. He said the cuts would be applied evenly but did not provide details about proposed changes to the company's sports budget. Still, he said G.M. would not withdraw from sports entirely.
 ''I think we'll still be there,'' he said. ''It may not be at the volume that people have seen before, but we'll still be a presence.''
 G.M.'s troubles come at a time when sports organizations are struggling to attract sponsors in a weak economy. The Nascar teams Chip Ganassi Racing and Dale Earnhardt Inc., citing a difficult economic climate, announced a merger last week. On Friday, the Tour de Georgia, one of the nation's premier cycling events, said it was canceling its 2009 race because it could not find a sponsor. Also on Friday, Nascar said it was suspending all testing at its tracks next season as a cost-cutting measure.
 Like beer and razors, automobiles have long been a staple of commercials during major sporting events, and for good reason, marketing experts said. At a time when digital video recorders and an array of cable channels have splintered television audiences, sporting events attract a large and passionate audience who often watch events as they happen. 
 G.M. has historically taken advantage of this audience by investing heavily in television advertising. The company has been the top TV sports advertiser for at least the last five years, vastly outspending its nearest competitors. For example, in 2007, G.M. spent close to $578 million on TV sports advertising. The No. 2 advertiser, Toyota, spent less than half that, or nearly $287 million, according to Nielsen Media Research.
 Earlier this year, General Motors aired 11 advertisements during the Super Bowl, according to TNS Media Intelligence, a research firm. The decision not to buy a Super Bowl ad in 2009 may have more to do with public perception than with the company's cash-strapped predicament. This year's spots are each selling for $3 million, a fraction of G.M.'s total sports spending. However, if the company were to receive a federal bailout, airing a Super Bowl commercial could anger taxpayers who see the purchase as extravagant, said Kenneth L. Shropshire, the director of the Wharton Sports Business Initiative at the University of Pennsylvania. ''Then people are saying, was that the right use of money for a one-day sporting event?'' he said.
 Although executives for several television outlets would not speak publicly, several said their sales representatives had detected a shift in G.M.'s ad purchases -- what some called a ''flight to quality'' -- toward programs that have proved successful in the past. And although G.M. recently scaled back its presence on networks in prime time, one network television executive said sports remained a ''stable destination.''
 There are signs that G.M. is continuing to invest in some sports. About a year ago, Chevrolet extended its sponsorship of Major League Baseball through the 2010 season. Ternes, the G.M. spokesman, pointed to plans by the company to invest heavily in next year's N.C.A.A. men's Final Four in Detroit, the nation's automobile capital.
 On the surface, organizations with existing agreements with G.M. may consider a bailout a preferable outcome, because under a bankruptcy, the company could ask a court to void contracts. But because a federal bailout would also very likely lead to significant restructuring, some said G.M. could be compelled to try to renegotiate active contracts anyway. 
 ''With the bailout probably comes strings attached, and what those strings are, who knows?'' said Greg Brown, the president of Learfield Sports, which handles marketing for 50 university athletic programs. Rather than seek to cancel existing contracts, several sports executives said G.M. and other companies were more likely to scale back promotions and focus on initiatives that led directly to a sale.
 ''If you're on the verge of bankruptcy, then you want to find out how to get the money now, rather than how do I get the 15-year-old to start thinking about the car they want to buy in the future?'' Shropshire said.
 Sponsors may focus on promotions that draw fans to dealerships, like T-shirt giveaways or ticket sweepstakes, said Jim Andrews, the editorial director of IEG Sponsorship Report, a trade publication. Sponsorships, he added, can also create a ''warm, fuzzy'' perception that a company is supporting a customer's favorite team. 
 ''That's why you're not seeing any of the automakers, even though they are in dire straits, saying we've got to pull out wholesale,'' Andrews said. ''Because I think they know there is a return on investment.''
 In some cases, foreign automakers have stepped in when American companies have pulled out. Chevrolet, for example, decided not to renew its sponsorship of the United States Ski Team last year, but Audi took its place. Honda recently replaced Dodge as the official automobile of the N.H.L. Although the troubles in Detroit played a role in that outcome, Honda fit better within the N.H.L.'s goal of becoming a more international brand, according to Keith Wachtel, the league's senior vice president for corporate sales and marketing.
 But for now, marketers at a variety of sports organizations say they are in for some tough times. 
 ''In this environment, autos are going to be off across the board,'' said Tim Finchem, the commissioner of the PGA Tour. Two of its tournaments are sponsored by Buick through 2010, and others are sponsored by Chrysler, BMW, Honda and Mercedes. ''They're doing, in varying degrees, terrible,'' he said. ''The U.S. automakers are really struggling. Now, who knows?''
 Finchem, however, said he was confident the companies would remain in business, which meant ''they're still going to be selling cars and, again, we have a good platform from which they can promote.''

A picture on Sunday with an article about the impact of major financial trouble at General Motors on sports marketing amid an already weak economy was published in error. It showed Dale Earnhardt Jr. and his crew competing in a Nascar event -- not Dale Earnhardt Inc., a separate racing team that, as the article noted, cited economic conditions in announcing that it planned to merge with Chip Ganassi Racing.

 BODY:
THE NEWS Backing away from proposals to have the government assist a broad swath of homeowners facing foreclosure, the Bush administration instead announced a limited plan to help people who are behind in their payments on mortgages held by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS The plan would do nothing for borrowers at the heart of the credit crisis, those with subprime mortgages, which are generally not on the books of those agencies. The head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation denounced it as inadequate. The administration said it might also ease rules for a mortgage relief program to induce more lenders to join. 
 THE NEWS Democrats in Congress pushed for federal financial aid to the beleaguered Detroit automakers, whose sales have been hammered this year, first by high gasoline prices, then by the credit crisis and the souring economy. General Motors has warned that it could run out of cash by mid-2009 without government help.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Though President-elect Barack Obama pressed the idea at a White House meeting, President Bush and Congressional Republicans adamantly oppose direct aid to the automakers, and it was doubtful whether an aid measure could advance in the Senate over their objections during the lame-duck session later this month.
 THE NEWS The Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., announced that the administration was abandoning the original strategy behind its $700 billion effort to rescue the financial system, and would not buy troubled assets from banks after all.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Noting that the bailout plan had already shifted gears to injecting capital directly into troubled banks and the giant insurer American International Group to stabilize the financial markets, Mr. Paulson said the focus would now be on unlocking the frozen consumer credit market by supplying capital to issuers of credit cards, car loans and student loans. Stocks fell sharply in response.
 THE NEWS New figures showed that the economies of Germany and several other European nations shrank for a second consecutive quarter, sending them into a recession.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The United States economy isn't quite there yet: though it shrank in the third quarter, it grew in the second. Still, forecasters say a recession is nonetheless taking hold, and that the next few quarters will be painful, with falling output and rising unemployment. Countries like Germany that depend on exports to the United States are being hit hardest; even China, the success story of the last decade, felt obliged to announce a major plan to stimulate its once-booming economy. 
 THE NEWS President Bush delivered an impassioned defense of unfettered capitalism in a speech at Federal Hall on Wall Street, saying the credit crisis ''was not a failure of the free market system, and the answer is not to try to reinvent that system.'' 
 BEHIND THE NEWS The president's speech came on the eve of an emergency summit in Washington called by Mr. Bush to discuss responses to the crisis. His administration was expected to come in for sharp criticism at the summit from leaders like President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who have called for coordinated intervention and new regulation to correct the problems in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: Welcome to My World, Barack

BYLINE: Interviews by HELENE COOPER and SCOTT L. MALCOMSON. 
Helene Cooper is diplomatic correspondent for The Times and author of ''The House on Sugar Beach.'' Scott L. Malcomson is an editor of the magazine and author, most recently, of ''One Drop of Blood: The American Misadventure of Race.'' Interviews with Christopher Hill and Daniel Fried were done by Helene Cooper; the interviews with , Condoleezza Rice and James L. Jones were done by Cooper and Malcomson. All the interviews took place in late October in Washington.

 BODY:
On Jan. 20, Barack Obamawill inherit a world very different from the one his predecessor found in January 2001. Over the past eight years, the Bush administration has faced great challenges and nurtured grand ambitions; it has tried hard to remake the world. Condoleezza Rice has been a central player in that effort since becoming the candidate Bush's chief foreign-policy adviser in 2000, so we arranged to interview her at the State Department late last month. The interview turned into a wide-ranging discussion of where this government has taken the United States and what sort of world it will leave for the next president. The editors have culled the highlights of her remarks in the text that follows. We also spoke with other administration foreign-policy makers -- Christopher Hill and Daniel Fried of the State Department and Gen. James L. Jones, former supreme allied commander, Europe -- whose remarks supplement and illuminate those of Rice. 
 I. OUR ELECTION, AND THEIRS
 WHAT THE ELECTION THAT HE WON MEANS. Electing a black president says around the world that you can overcome old wounds. I've said in our case, We have a birth defect, but it can be overcome. 
 WHAT THE ELECTION THAT HE WON MEANS. I've heard people commenting on how in this election, in far places, people talk about what is a caucus and how does that differ from a primary. I think that links up with the fact that the United States under this president has been more active and more insistent that democracy is not just something for a few. People are watching, and I think they're trying to learn from democratic experience. 
 WHAT ALL THOSE ELECTIONS IN IRAQ AND UKRAINE AND LEBANON MEANT. It's not that you deliver on it tomorrow. Maybe 2005 was a bit deceptive in that way because you had the Iraqi elections, the Cedar Revolution, the Orange Revolution, the Rose Revolution and the Palestinian election. (1) So maybe people came to expect too much too soon. 
 WHAT ELECTIONS COULD MEAN FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T TEND TO HAVE THEM. I've seen too many peoples dismissed as not ready for self-government. First it was Asians, and then Latin Americans and Africans were there for a while. I know for a while black Americans were, too. 
 I've seen it said, well, you know: They're illiterate; how could they vote? And then you see in Afghanistan people line up for long, long lines. Because somehow they know that making a choice matters. 
 WHAT AMERICAN PROMOTION OF DEMOCRACY CAN DO. I think that over the last several years, because of a more assertive American voice on this, there have been some real gains -- like women in Kuwait voting or like Iraq, which is an imperfect and fragile and still-emerging democracy but one that is multiconfessional, multiethnic and in the center of the Arab world. 
 AND WHY AMERICA SHOULD NOT STOP PROMOTING IT. If the U.S. doesn't remain that lodestar, then I think democracy moves off the international agenda at a time when you're beginning to see, for instance, the Europeans unafraid to give their award to a Chinese dissident,(2) despite the blowback from Beijing. The Egyptians know that their next election is going to be an important transitional election. I think they're going to insist on a different kind of election. 
 WHAT AMERICA DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT DEMOCRACY. It's not easy for a country to embrace the chaos of democracy. It's especially not easy because people who try to introduce democratic reforms are often people who have to bear the responsibilities but also the consequences when sometimes things don't go well. So one should be careful about giving advice and not having to deal with the consequences of that advice. . . . I have no doubt that democracy is the best form of government. I'm very optimistic that it is one whose reach is increasing throughout the world. I would just urge all Americans to understand how our advice is taken. And to be careful how we offer advice. For many people in the world, they look at America, and they see an enormous country with an extraordinary amount of power. Pure power. And so they feel that asymmetry immediately as soon as they meet us. So we have to understand how people look at us sometimes. So advice coming from a country with enormous power can be taken wrongly. CHRISTOPHER HILL Christopher Hill is the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. Since February 2005, he has been lead negotiator on talks with North Korea aimed at ending its nuclear program.
 II. SUPERPOWERS PAST, SUPERPOWERS FUTURE
 THE PROBLEM RUSSIA HAS. They've got problems, and the basis of this is that the legitimacy of the Russian government is not ideology; it is not a pretension to a different route for human development as Communism was. It is the ability of Russians to, if they can't afford those Cartier shops near Tverskaya, to be able instead to go to the Ikea store that now completely dominates the Tank Trap Monument that celebrates the repulsion of the final push of the Germans into Moscow.(3)
 THE BIGGER PROBLEM RUSSIA HAS. Russia has an aging population that's not being replaced and unfortunately a sickly population, and an economy that did not take advantage of higher oil prices to diversify. It's still an infrastructural nightmare if you get outside of major cities and certainly if you start going toward the Far East. So I think we should be calm. 
 RUSSIA AND US -- THE MORAL DIFFERENCE. The West does not go out and conquer countries by using force, try to deprive countries of a choice. It didn't insist that Poland join NATO. Poland wanted to join NATO. It didn't impose NATO membership or E.U. membership on Estonia; Estonia chose it. That's a difference, and it's a moral difference as well. . . . If you validate the assumptions of Russians who believe that the only proper relationship between Russia and its neighbors is one of subordination and intimidation, then how do you expect a more cooperative Russia to emerge in the future? The United States has learned that it is in our interest that our neighbors, Mexico for example, be prosperous, successful and free. And Russia needs to develop a normal set of relations with its neighbors. The notions of privileged relations or its sphere of influence . . . which the Russians demand is not the formula for greater stability; it's the formula for greater tension. I'm not stating these things as a fiat; I'm suggesting that the next administration will have to think this through. DANIEL FRIED Daniel Fried is the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs. 
 SOMETIMES EUROPEANS ALSO COME FROM MARS. I remember telling my European colleagues that I know they always think that America is going to be more aggressive on fighting extremism than they. But you know, we could never, within our context, have passed the law like the basic incitement laws that the British have passed.(4)
 The first amendment would have prohibited it.
 HOW WE CAN HOLD THE WEST TOGETHER. I remember when I went to Europe, I said -- you know, this is in the wake of 2003-4, which was tough on the alliance -- and I said: ''Can we take the trans-Atlantic relationship off the sofa? And stop analyzing it and analyzing whether it's healthy, and actually put it to work in common causes?'' Because we all share the same interests and, by that time, we even shared an interest in a stable Iraq. There is only one process in the Middle East; it's the Annapolis process, (5)and it's got Arab support and international support from all of our European friends.
 HOW BUSH DID HOLD THE WEST TOGETHER. It's a myth that we have poor relations with the Europeans. We have excellent relations with all European states at this point. Now, it may be that we still have some disagreements, but even on something like how to fight terrorists, I think there's a growing recognition that this isn't just law enforcement and that it puts difficult questions on the agenda about the relationship of gathering information to civil liberties and so forth.
 WHY THE EUROPEANS WILL MISS BUSH. An Obama presidency will be greeted in Europe with enthusiasm, but as some Europeans have put it to me, ''We realize that we won't have the excuse of George Bush.'' Obama made it clear during his trip to Europe that he wants to work with Europe, but any American president is going to think globally, and Obama, from what I know of his team, is a freedom Democrat. He believes in a values-based foreign policy. He's going to want Europe to stand up and do more. . . . And Europeans will have a problem, in that they will embrace him, and they will not be able to say: ''Well, this is the Bush administration. We have to resist.'' DANIEL FRIED
 III. HOW WE USE POWER
 WHERE ''NEVER AGAIN'' NEVER QUITE GOT DONE. I have regrets about Darfur, real regrets. I don't know that there were other answers. The president considered trying to do something unilaterally -- very difficult to do.
 THERE WILL ALWAYS BE DICTATORS. The United States is not an N.G.O., so it's not as if we throw out every other interest or every other concern with a country because it's authoritarian. And sometimes we aren't able to effect change as completely as we like. It has to be indigenous change. 
 TO WARD OFF NEW DICTATORS, YOU NEED TO WORK. We've gone a long way to make foreign assistance a partnership. We've gone a long way to make foreign assistance have accountability on both sides. Developed countries deliver, but developing countries have to deliver for their people, and you can't ask new democratic states or fragile democratic states to be democratic and to be accountable to their people and not help them have the resources to do it. 
 WHAT WE ASK OF OTHER STATES. The innovation in Latin America that I think has gone largely unnoticed is when the president went to Brazil and he said: We have no litmus test for our friendship. The only question is, Do you govern democratically, do you invest in your people, do you fight corruption? And so our best friends in Latin America include Colombia from the right and Brazil from the left. Chile from the left; Uruguay from the left. 
 WHY WE MAY BE LOSING IN AFGHANISTAN. I think the first thing the next president will have to do is understand that Afghanistan is now part of a regional problem. Maybe four or five years ago it was about Afghanistan, but now it's about Afghanistan and Pakistan, and you can't deal with one without dealing with the other. So there is a regional aspect to this that I think we have to deal with. Secondly, I think it's important for people to understand that Afghanistan is an international problem. It's not a U.S. problem alone, as opposed to Iraq. . . . The U.N. is there; NATO is there; the E.U. is there; the World Bank is there; all the N.G.O.'s in the world; around 50 countries. So the question is with all of this capability there, why do we have the sense that we're backsliding? The top of my list is the drugs and narcotics, which are, without question, the economic engine that fuels the resurgent Taliban, and the crime and corruption in the country. . . . We couldn't even talk about that in 2006 when I was there. That was not a topic that anybody wanted to talk about, including the U.S. JAMES L. JONES Gen. James L. Jones has served as commandant of the Marine Corps, supreme allied commander in Europe and head of the U.S. military's European Command. He was named a special envoy for Middle East security last year by Condoleezza Rice.
 WHY FREE TRADE WILL COME UNDER ATTACK. Mexico has benefited from Nafta. In the current global financial crisis, of course, a lot of people are going to be questioning free trade and international integration and all of those things. . . . Yes, the financial system clearly got out of kilter, and Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and the president and Congress are dealing with that. But it shouldn't go to the core principles of markets, the importance of open trade, the fact of globalization -- which is not going to go backwards. 
 IV. THE MIDDLE EAST AND BEYOND
 HOW WE CHANGED THE CONVERSATION. There have been some real gains, but there also has been a complete change in the conversation, particularly in the Middle East, where some form of popular legitimacy is being sought in almost every country. The American voice has got to stay strong in that conversation. 
 HOW TO MOVE THE CONVERSATION FORWARD. I really think we have the best atmosphere between Palestinians and Israelis since the mid-'90s, so I'm very gratified that that has come into place. The Palestinian leadership is avowedly in favor of negotiations, renounces violence, recognizes the right of Israel to exist. There is a robust negotiating process, and they have made a lot of progress on how to get to a two-state solution. There is now broad Israeli acceptance of the need for a Palestinian state. After all, Kadima came out of Likud (6) with that in mind. And we have a process on the ground that is beginning to make some progress in terms of making life better for people who live on the West Bank. Palestinian security forces are becoming competent enough that they're now about to move into Nablus, one of the toughest areas, with Israeli consent.
 WHY SPEED IS ESSENTIAL TO DEALING WITH HAMAS. The Hamas takeover of Gaza is a problem, but thanks to good Egyptian work, at least there is calm for now. One reason to try and get an agreement done pretty quickly is that I think Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas needs to be able to take an agreement to the Palestinian people through either referendum or elections in order to sideline Hamas politically or to have Hamas buy in, which I think is unlikely, or to sideline Hamas by demonstrating that they don't have a solution for the Palestinian problem. So that's another reason to do it quickly. But I think the structure is there, I think the Annapolis structure is a very powerful structure . . . On the Palestinian-Israeli issue, we will leave this in a much, much better place, agreement or no.
 HOW TO CHANGE A REGIME -- SLOWLY. We have said to Iran that this is about changing your regime's behavior, not changing your regime. That has been the message all along. Would we hope that the Iranian people . . . do they deserve to have a different regime than they've got? Absolutely. But the way that we have tried to help with democracy in Iran is to help indigenous forces there -- to bring everyone from people who do disaster relief to artists to sending our wrestlers there. You know, it's why the question of an interests section continues to be important to us.(7)
 FINDING PRO-AMERICANISM IN IRAN. There's a very pro-American feeling among most Iranians not because of our policies but because of who we are and because we have stood for democracy. Iranians are sophisticated people -- that's a sophisticated and great culture -- and we need to be able to reach out to them. But in terms of dealing with the regime, I think we've made it very, very clear that we're prepared to deal with the regime; we just don't want them to use negotiations as a cover while they improve their nuclear-weapons capability. 
 V. TWILIGHT OF THE INSTITUTIONS?
 DISCOVERING WHETHER THE ''RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT'' MEANS ANYTHING. I think we thought the Responsibility to Protect meant something.(8) I remember when the responsibility-to-protect language came up at the 2006 United Nations General Assembly, and I remember thinking at the time: If this turns out to be nothing but words, the Security Council is going to have a real black eye, and in the Darfur case it has turned out to be nothing but words. I think it has been an enormous embarrassment for the Security Council and for multilateral diplomacy.
 DON'T PREACH TO THE CHINESE. I think if we do find a solution to the problem of Darfur, it will be because we worked with China. If we find a solution to the problem of Iran, it will be because we worked well with China. Similarly, if we close this deal with North Korea, it will be because of our efforts with China. So I think China has emerged as a country with whom we have to work globally on security challenges. There are increasing signs that we can do that. China suffers at times to an extent, I think, from a caricature of what it is. It's a really complex society. I don't think it should be defined by one dimension, its economics, or security, or human rights. We need to look at all the issues. CHRISTOPHER HILL
 WHY THE SECURITY COUNCIL NEGLECTED DARFUR. We worked day in and day out. Almost not a day passes in this office that we're not trying to find some way to get more forces into Darfur. To make the Sudanese government live up to the multiple agreements that it has made and then walked away from. We go to the Security Council, and nobody wants there to be consequences, well, not nobody, sorry, some don't wish there to be consequences. And so we end up sanctioning again, unilaterally. The Europeans do some things but other interests seem to then trump the responsibility to protect.
 HOW NATO REALLY WORKS. First of all, the NATO alliance took on this mission in Afghanistan by consensus. It only operates by consensus. And I think what you see is steadily increasing alliance participation. The French have increased their numbers; most of the small states have increased their numbers over time.
 AN ALLIANCE OF DEMOCRACIES IS NEVER SIMPLE. There's this past image of NATO as in total, complete unity with exactly the same views during the cold war. Simply fiction. Fiction. Do you remember that in 1989 the big NATO 40th-anniversary summit was going to see a breakdown around short-range nuclear forces being deployed? So, NATO has always been an alliance of democracies. . . . Yes, I'd like to see NATO do more. Yes, we push hard for NATO to do more. Yes, we don't like the caveats,(9) and some of them have come off in time. But you look at what this alliance is doing; it's impressive.
 WHAT NATO IS STILL GOOD FOR. I think if NATO members draw the conclusion that they shouldn't have been here in Afghanistan, and we're not going to do this again, then I think the purpose of NATO in the 21st century will very quickly be called into question. I think that most of them do understand that for NATO to survive as an institution in the 21st century, they need to start thinking about a new strategic concept. . . . Unfortunately NATO's mission is still rooted in the 20th-century, cold-war model of a defensive, static, reactive alliance instead of agile, flexible and proactive 21st-century reality. JAMES L. JONES
 HOW NATO MIGHT HAVE WORKED AFTER 9/11, BUT DIDN'T. If there is one thing that was unfortunate about 9/11, about the aftermath, I remember when the alliance invoked Article 5, first time it had ever happened, and we simply couldn't wait for the alliance to mobilize.(10) And, had you had the ability to mobilize the alliance the way we have now, there probably would have been more buy-in. But that's one of those -- it was impossible to do. Capabilities just weren't there. Later on we got the rapid reaction force and all the things that we needed. 
 VI. THE PAST AND FUTURE OF THE BUSH AGENDA
 WHY BUSH SET THE FREEDOM AGENDA. George W. Bush deserves credit for recognizing that the terms were now going to be set for the next big historical evolution. The president recognized that freedom was something that was not just desirable but essential for the United States; that it meant not just freedom from tyranny but also freedom from disease, from poverty. And that if you were going to have democratic leaders, they had to be able to deliver for their people. Thus the president supported the millennium challenge and the H.I.V. AIDS and Malaria project.(11) And linking up the great compassion of the United States with our security interests. Making it about democracy, defense and development. We're at the beginning of that historical transformation, and yes, sometimes it's lonelier at the beginning than at the end. 
 It's really recognizing that this is about a single answer to what is the right form of government, and that's democracy. It takes different forms: there is Japanese democracy, and there's American democracy, and there are fragile democracies, and there are emerging democracies, and there are states that are trying to find some form of popular legitimacy.
 IMMIGRATION POLICY IS FOREIGN POLICY. We didn't get comprehensive immigration reform. . . . I think everybody knows that this president tried. I remember the first foreign-policy meeting that I went to with the then-governor, before he was inaugurated, was with the then-governor, soon to be president of Mexico, Vicente Fox, and they talked about the need to fix this problem. I am a firm believer in defending our laws and defending our borders. . . . But it's also true that there are a lot of hardworking people in this country who live in the shadows.
 IMMIGRANTS ARE CENTRAL TO AMERICAN IDENTITY. I was a major proponent of the temporary-worker program and finding some way to normalize the status for these people. I think that it goes to the core of who we are. I hear some people talking about, well, maybe there should be a timeout on legal immigration, check your last name and see whether or not it came over on the Mayflower.
 WHY SOME IMMIGRANTS SHOULD STAY -- AND SOME SHOULD STAY HOME. Improving the economic conditions that would allow people who are clearly ambitious -- if they're going to walk across the desert to get here, they're ambitious people -- improving the capability of those people to stay home and contribute is the last piece of that puzzle. Comprehensive immigration reform is the one thing I wish we'd been able to do, and it's going to have to be done, and I hope it's done soon.
 WHAT SHOULD NOT BE ABANDONED. The other thing that I'm worried about out of this current global financial crisis and whatever economic fallout there may be is, I really hope we don't sacrifice foreign assistance. The Millennium Challenge and programs like it say: invest in your people, fight corruption, be democratic, and we'll help you. If you can't fulfill that promise, then good governments around the world that have staked their futures on that argument are going to be in very deep trouble. And so I hope that foreign assistance, if anything, continues to increase. We found it flat. The president doubled it in Latin America, quadrupled it in Africa, tripled it worldwide. The president authorized 300 new U.S. AID officers and 1,100 new Foreign Service officers, because we believe that transformational diplomacy is a word for not thinking that your job as a diplomat is to sit in the capital and talk to other governments. It's to get out and help those governments. Without the tools of foreign assistance, we won't be able to do it. 
 WHAT THE MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE WORLD CAN'T ACCOMPLISH. Do you think Bush expected 9/11? No. Did Clinton expect Bosnia? No. Man makes his plans; God has his own. . . . Remember Bush's second debate with Gore where he campaigned against nation building? Oh, well. . . . The tension between the modesty of knowing what's possible and what isn't, and the desire and ability to do good because you're president of the United States, that challenge is one of the most profound things. . . . Don't shortchange the opportunity to make a difference, but understand how hard it is. . . . You've got to keep both notions in your head at the same time. And that's hard. That's the description for the man in the Oval Office. DANIEL FRIED

HEADLINE: Gonna Need A Bigger Boat

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Barack Obama surely has one of the toughest leadership challenges any incoming president has ever faced. We're in the midst of a terrible economic meltdown, the current administration has lost all credibility, the House of Representatives is full of knuckle-dragging Neanderthals, and the public is being whipsawed between free-market fundamentalists preaching the virtues of just letting the market rip and left-wingers who think we can punish Wall Street while protecting Main Street. It feels like a mess with no one in charge. 
 Now is when we need a president who has the skill, the vision and the courage to cut through this cacophony, pull us together as one nation and inspire and enable us to do the one thing we can and must do right now: 
 Go shopping.
 Obama can't wait until Jan. 20 to weigh in on this. If we don't stimulate the global economy fast enough and big enough, some of Obama's inaugural balls might be held in soup kitchens.
 When President Bush told us to go shopping after 9/11, he was right. We needed to stimulate the economy then. The problem was that the Bush economic team never turned off the green light and told people to ''go saving.'' So with easy credit seemingly endlessly available, American consumers saved virtually nothing and bid up housing prices to record levels. Retailers expanded stores and China expanded factories to accommodate all the shopping. It was quite a party. We had banks in America giving mortgages to people whose only qualification ''was that they could fog up a knife,'' one mortgage broker told me.
 But when something seems too good to be true, it usually is. When these reckless mortgages eventually blew up, it led to a credit crisis. Banks stopped lending. That soon morphed into an equity crisis, as worried investors liquidated stock portfolios. The equity crisis made people feel poor and metastasized into a consumption crisis, which is why purchases of cars, appliances, electronics, homes and clothing have just fallen off a cliff. This, in turn, has sparked more company defaults, exacerbated the credit crisis and metastasized into an unemployment crisis, as companies rush to shed workers.
 Governments are having a problem arresting this deflationary downward spiral -- maybe because this financial crisis combines four chemicals we have never seen combined to this degree before, and we don't fully grasp how damaging their interactions have been, and may still be.
 Those chemicals are: 1) massive leverage -- by everyone from consumers who bought houses for nothing down to hedge funds that were betting $30 for every $1 they had in cash; 2) a world economy that is so much more intertwined than people realized, which is exemplified by British police departments that are financially strapped today because they put their savings in online Icelandic banks -- to get a little better yield -- that have gone bust; 3) globally intertwined financial instruments that are so complex that most of the C.E.O.'s dealing with them did not and do not understand how they work -- especially on the downside; 4) a financial crisis that started in America with our toxic mortgages. When a crisis starts in Mexico or Thailand, we can protect ourselves; when it starts in America, no one can.
 You put this much leverage together with this much global integration with this much complexity and start the crisis in America and you have a very explosive situation.
 If you are going to fight a global financial panic like this, you have to go at it with overwhelming force -- an overwhelming stimulus that gets people shopping again and an overwhelming recapitalization of the banking system that gets it lending again. I just hope the U.S. Treasury has enough money to do it. When you look at the way A.I.G. and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are eating money, you start to wonder.
 And that brings me back to Obama. We need a leader who can look the country in the eye and say clearly: ''We have not seen this before. There are only two choices now, folks: doing everything we can to shore up banks and homeowners or risk a systemic meltdown.''
 Yes, that may mean rescuing some bankers who don't deserve rescuing, while also helping prudent bankers who were doing the right things. And, yes, that may mean rescuing reckless home buyers who never should have taken out mortgages and now can't pay them back, while not aiding people who saved prudently and are still meeting their mortgage payments.
 No, it's not fair. But fairness is not on the menu anymore. We will deal with that later. Right now we need to throw everything we can at this problem to make sure this recession doesn't spiral down into a depression. This is no time for half-measures. 
 If you want to know where we are right now, rent the movie ''Jaws.'' We're at that moment when Roy Scheider first sets eyes on the Great White Shark and comes back and says to the skipper, with eyes wide with fear: ''You're gonna need a bigger boat.''

HEADLINE: Russia's President Hopes For Warmer Relations With U.S. Under Obama

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia expressed hope Saturday that President-elect Barack Obama's election would improve relations that have soured under President Bush, but he remained unwavering on the issues that have most starkly divided the countries in recent years. 
Mr. Medvedev, in Washington for the first time since his election last spring, reiterated Russia's opposition to the expansion of NATO and vowed that Russia would not reverse its recognition of two separatist regions in Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, after the war there in August.
He also repeated his threat, first made the day after Mr. Obama was elected, to deploy missiles in Kaliningrad if the United States moved ahead with plans to build missile defense systems in Poland and the Czech Republic. As he did in France on Friday, however, he said he was prepared to hold talks on the issue.
''There is no trust in the Russia-U.S. relations, the trust we need,'' Mr. Medvedev said, speaking before the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington after participating in the summit meeting on the financial crisis Saturday that brought together the leaders of 20 countries. ''Therefore we have great aspirations for the new administration.''
Mr. Medvedev's remarks, while conciliatory, could put Mr. Obama in a difficult position politically, presenting him with an explicit quid pro quo in the case of missile defense.
Mr. Obama has expressed more tepid support for missile defenses than Mr. Bush, suggesting he would deploy only a proven system rather than proceeding with the construction of radars and other facilities while testing continues. But reversing the program now, after agreements had been negotiated with Poland and the Czech Republic, both NATO allies, could be seen as backing down in the face of Russian threats.
Mr. Medvedev's state of the nation address on Nov. 5 was widely viewed as defiant and sharply anti-American. He criticized the United States for dragging down the global economy and linked it to what the Kremlin views as anti-Russian hostility in all matters of international affairs.
On Saturday evening, during a session moderated by Madeleine K. Albright, the former secretary of state, Mr. Medvedev denied having anti-American sentiments, though he said ''problems have piled up'' under Mr. Bush.
Asked about his threat to deploy missiles in Kaliningrad, he replied jokingly: ''Do you think this is blackmail?''
He went on to say that the timing of his address -- on a day when world leaders were congratulating Mr. Obama -- was a simple oversight. ''With all my respect for the United States, I absolutely forgot about the important political event that had to take place that day,'' he said. ''There's nothing personal here.''
He expressed hope that he and Mr. Obama would meet soon after Inauguration Day.

HEADLINE: Presidents' Pay Rises Faster at Public Universities Than Private Ones, Survey Finds

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
David J. Sargent, the 77-year-old president of Suffolk University in Boston, received a $2.8 million pay package in 2006-7 -- including a $436,000 longevity bonus and more than $1 million in deferred compensation -- after the board of trustees, eager to delay his retirement, decided he had long been underpaid. 
 Mr. Sargent was the nation's highest-compensated university president in the annual survey by The Chronicle of Higher Education, being released Monday. 
 Others also received more than $2 million. David P. Roselle, who resigned as president of the University of Delaware in June 2007, had a package of $2.4 million, including deferred compensation. 
 And E. Gordon Gee, who forfeited more than half of his $2 million compensation package when he resigned from Vanderbilt University in 2007 to become president of Ohio State University, is the highest-paid public university president, the survey found. Mr. Gee's Ohio State package was raised just this month to more than $1.3 million. 
 While seven-figure pay packages had been limited mostly to prominent private research universities, some presidents of public institutions like Ohio State and Delaware, or private universities like Suffolk that offer few doctoral degrees, are also topping $1 million in pay and benefits. 
 In fact, compensation for public research university presidents is growing faster than for those who head private institutions, the survey found. 
 ''The public universities are still behind, but only by about $100,000,'' said Jeffrey Selingo, the editor of The Chronicle.
 Median pay and benefits for presidents of public institutions rose 7.6 percent in 2007-8, to $427,400, The Chronicle said. Over a five-year period, the public universities' median compensation rose 36 percent, compared with 19 percent at private institutions. 
 The Chronicle's most recent compensation data on public universities came from 2007-8; for private colleges and universities, the most recent data available, from tax filings, is from 2006-7. 
 ''It's surprising that many public universities are raising their presidents' salaries,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, who has been prodding universities for more accountability in spending and greater commitment to affordability. ''In these hard economic times, apparently belt-tightening is for families and students, not university presidents.'' 
 Among the public university presidents, The Chronicle found, 59 received more than $500,000 in 2007-8, compared with 43 the previous year. At the private institutions, 89 received at least $500,000, compared with 81 the previous year. 
 The highest-earning presidents at private research universities, the survey found, were Henry S. Bienen of Northwestern, $1,742,560 in total compensation; Lee C. Bollinger of Columbia, $1,411,894; Shirley Ann Jackson of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, $1,326,774; and John Sexton of New York University, $1,324,874.
 They were followed by Amy Gutmann of the University of Pennsylvania, $1,088,786; William R. Brody of Johns Hopkins, $1,060,772; James W. Wagner of Emory, $1,040,420; and Constantine N. Papadakis of Drexel, $1,021,537. 
 Mr. Selingo pointed out that these compensation packages were negotiated long before the current economic downturn. And despite the clamor over rising tuition rates, he said, it would be incorrect to suggest that even the highest presidential pay would have much effect on tuition. 
 ''The more interesting comparison is faculty salaries, because that's where there's more tension,'' he said. 
 The gap in faculty salaries between private and public institutions is growing. Median faculty pay at a public doctoral institution is about $109,000, compared with about $149,000 at a private research university, he said. 
 Recently, with the economic downturn, a few university presidents have waived or declined their bonuses or raises. For example, The Chronicle reported, in late September, Michael J. Hogan, president of the University of Connecticut, declined what would most likely have been a $100,000 performance bonus. 
 Mr. Sargent, the Suffolk president, has pledged $700,000 to financial aid there. 
 The circumstances that led to Mr. Sargent's compensation package were unusual. He has been at Suffolk for 52 years, and was mulling retirement in 2006. The board hired a compensation expert and determined that their president, who had earned less than $400,000 a year until 2004, was ''woefully underpaid.'' The board unanimously approved the $2.8 million compensation package for 2006-7. 
 ''The package was designed with the understanding that President Sargent's value to the university has been, and is, extraordinary,'' Nicholas A. Macaronis, chairman of the board, said in a written statement. ''Under his leadership as professor, dean of the law school and president, Suffolk has grown into a world-class institution, with campuses on three continents.'' 
 Mr. Sargent's 2007-8 compensation has not been disclosed, and Greg Gatlin, a university spokesman, said Mr. Sargent was not available to comment. 
 The economic downturn could pose problems for Suffolk, a university with more than 9,200 students, including 1,625 at the law school. Last month, Moody's Investors Service, citing Suffolk's aggressive debt structure, said the university had a negative longterm credit outlook.
 While Mr. Sargent is in the spotlight now, the longstanding symbol of high pay in academia has been Mr. Gee, the Ohio State president, who in addition to serving at Vanderbilt has served as president of Brown University, the University of Colorado and West Virginia University. He also had a stint at Ohio State. 
 If he had stayed at Vanderbilt, and not had to forfeit his deferred compensation, Mr. Gee would have been the highest-paid president at a private research university, according to the survey. Instead, he cemented his position as the highest-paid public university president last week, when the trustees approved a bonus structure that would bump up his compensation for his first year.
 The trustees raised Mr. Gee's base pay by 3.5 percent, to $802,125. He is also receiving a 40 percent, or $310,000, performance bonus for his first full year, with further bonuses in future years. His total compensation since being hired in October 2007, including deferred pay and retirement benefits, comes to almost $1.4 million, and could approach $2 million this year.

HEADLINE: Study Abroad Flourishes, With China a New Hot Spot

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Record numbers of American students are studying abroad, with especially strong growth in educational exchanges with China, the annual report by the Institute on International Education found. 
 The number of Americans studying in China increased by 25 percent, and the number of Chinese students studying at American universities increased by 20 percent last year, according to the report, ''Open Doors 2008.'' 
 ''Interest in China is growing dramatically, and I think we'll see even sharper increases in next year's report,'' said Allan E. Goodman, president of the institute. ''People used to go to China to study the history and language, and many still do, but with China looming so large in all our futures, there's been a real shift, and more students go for an understanding of what's happening economically and politically.'' 
 While the traditional study-abroad sites for Americans -- Britain, Italy, Spain and France -- still attract more students from the United States, the report found that China is now the fifth-most-popular destination. 
 In the 2006-7 academic year, the latest for which figures are available, 11,064 Americans studied in China, a large jump from 1995-96, when only 1,396 Americans studied there. 
 After the summer Olympics, interest in China is still growing rapidly. This year, 218 students applied for money to study in China from Gilman International Scholarships offered by the State Department, compared with 114 applications for the 2006-7 academic year. 
 And applications to programs like the Inter-University Program for Chinese Language Studies, a consortium of 13 American universities, have skyrocketed. 
 ''When I took over as executive director in 2000, we accepted about 97 percent of the students who applied, but now we can only take about one in three,'' said Tom Gold, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who runs the program. 
 Many universities are hard-pressed to keep up with the interest in China. Syracuse, for example, usually has a limit of 60 students a semester in its Hong Kong program, but because of strong demand expanded to 65 for the spring semester. 
 At Syracuse, one China program was not enough: in 2006 it started a Beijing program, taught in English, in collaboration with Tsinghua University, which will have about 15 students this spring. SUNY Oswego, meanwhile, has gone from one small exchange program in Beijing to seven partner destinations throughout China, including Hangzhou and Shanghai -- and two faculty-led short-term programs in China, one on business and the other on Chinese culture. 
 ''These days, nobody questions why you take Chinese and go to China,'' said Vanessa Folkerts, a junior at Princeton who began studying Chinese as a freshman, and has spent two summers in intensive language study in Beijing. ''It has its obvious uses. I know a lot of people get interested because China's a rising economic power, but for me, it was mainly a linguistic interest.'' 
 There are now hundreds of study-abroad programs in China. While most include some language study, some focus on martial arts, herbal medicine, culture, history or business. 
 Over all, 241,791 Americans studied abroad in 2006-7, the report said, with sharp increases in the numbers going to Argentina, South Africa, Ecuador and India, and declining numbers going to Australia and Costa Rica. 
 Last year, the report said, 623,805 students from around the world studied in the United States, 61 percent of them from Asia. Business and management and engineering remain the most popular fields of study. 
 As in previous years, the University of Southern California had the most international students, 7,189, followed by New York University and Columbia. 
 In a separate report on graduate school enrollment, released last week, the Council of Graduate Schools found that total international graduate enrollment increased 3 percent this fall, after rising 7 percent last year. The number of new international graduate students rose 3 percent as well, less than the 4 percent growth last year, or the 12 percent in 2006. 
 The number of new graduate students from India declined this year, after an 8 percent increase last year, the report found, but Chinese enrollment stayed strong, with first-year enrollments up 14 percent.

HEADLINE: A Computing Pioneer Has a New Idea

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Steven J. Wallach is completing the soul of his newest machine.
Thirty years ago, Mr. Wallach was one of a small team of computer designers profiled by Tracy Kidder in his Pulitzer Prize winning best seller, ''The Soul of a New Machine.''
It was Mr. Wallach, then 33, who served as the architect and baby sitter for his ''microkids,'' the young team that designed the Data General MV 8000, the underdog minicomputer that kept the company alive in its brutal competition with the Digital Equipment Corporation. 
At 63, he is still at it. He plans to introduce his new company, Convey Computer, and to describe the technical details of a new supercomputer intended for scientific and engineering applications at a supercomputing conference in Austin, Tex., this week.
Mr. Wallach thinks he has come upon a new idea in computer design in an era when it has become fashionable to say that there are no new ideas. So far, he has persuaded some of the leading thinkers in the high performance computing world that he might be right. Both Intel and a second chip maker, Xilinx, have joined as early investors.
''Steve comes from a long history of building successful machines,'' said Jack Dongarra, a computer scientist at the University of Tennessee who helps maintain the list of the world's fastest 500 computers. ''He understands where the bottlenecks are.''
After leaving Data General, Mr. Wallach helped found Convex in 1982 to build a low-cost supercomputer.
Mr. Wallach may be one of the few people remaining to recall a bold generation of computer designers once defined by Seymour Cray, the engineer who created the world's first commercial supercomputers during the 1960s.
His newest effort in computing design is intended to tackle one of the principal limitations in the world of supercomputing. Typically supercomputers are intended to excel in solving a single class of problems. They may simulate the explosion of a nuclear weapon or model global climate change at blinding speed, but for other problems they will prove sluggish and inefficient.
Today's supercomputers are assembled from thousands or even tens of thousands of microprocessors, and they often consume as much electricity as a small city. Moreover, they can prove to be frightfully difficult to program. Many new supercomputers try to deal with the challenge of solving different classes of problems by connecting different kinds of processors together Lego-style. This can give programmers fits.
For decades, computer designers have struggled with different ways to sidestep the complexity of programming multiple chips, in order to break up problems into pieces to be computed simultaneously so that they can be solved more quickly.
Mr. Wallach came up with his new design idea in 2006 after he found himself rejecting many of the start-up companies who were coming to the venture capital companies he was advising.
''I would say, 'No, no, no, they're clueless,' '' he said. ''I find it difficult to think of myself as the old man of the industry, but it feels the same as it was in the early 1980s.''
One of the venture capitalists grew frustrated with Mr. Wallach's repeated criticisms and said to him, ''All right Mr. Bigshot, what would you do?''
Two weeks later, Mr. Wallach had a new idea. He had long been fascinated with a chip technology called Field Programmable Gate Arrays. These chips are widely used to make prototype computer systems because they can be easily reprogrammed and yet offer the pure speed of computer hardware. There have been a number of start-ups and large supercomputer companies that have already tried to design systems based on the chips, but Mr. Wallach thought that he could do a better job.
The right way to use them, he decided, was to couple them so tightly to the microprocessor chip that it would appear they were simply a small set of additional instructions to give a programmer an easy way to turbocharge a program. Everything had to look exactly like the standard programming environment. In contrast, many supercomputers today require programmers to be ''heroic.''
''The past 40 years has taught us that ultimately the system that is easiest to program will always win,'' he said.
Mr. Wallach approached Advanced Micro Devices about partnering, but it was skeptical. So he went to Intel, where he knew Justin Rattner, the company's chief technology officer and a veteran supercomputer designer.
''We've had enough debates over the years that Justin has some respect for me,'' he said.
The Convey computer will be based around Intel's microprocessors. It will perform like a shape-shifter, reconfiguring with different hardware ''personalities'' to compute problems for different industries, initially aiming at bioinformatics, computer-aided design, financial services and oil and gas exploration.
Mr. Wallach acknowledges that starting a company going into a recession in the face of stiff competition from Cray, I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and more than a dozen smaller companies is daunting. However, Convey was put together in just two years on a shoestring. It has raised just $15.1 million.
''In a lot of ways, it's easier than it was in 1982,'' he said. ''You need less money and I don't think a lot of people have grasped this.''
One who does get the idea and who is enthusiastic about it is Larry Smarr, an astrophysicist who is director of the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology at the University of California, San Diego. He believes that the most important quality of the Convey computer is that it will be a green supercomputer.
''The I.T. industry is going to become the boogeyman for global warming,'' he worries.
Three decades after designing the computer that brought the idea of computing into the public consciousness, Mr. Wallach gives no hint that he is slowing down.
He still wears the earring that he began wearing 15 years ago when his daughter suggested that he was getting old.
''Isn't that required to be a computer architect?'' he asked recently.
Correction: November 19, 2008, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article and a picture caption on Monday about Steven J. Wallach, a computer developer, misidentified the location of a supercomputing conference this week in Texas. It is in Austin, not Dallas.

HEADLINE: Russia's High-Tech Sector Reels

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
After the first round of layoffs, the staff members of MeshNetics filtered in as usual, taking their positions inside powder-blue cubicles and making the ritual run to the cafeteria for coffee. On one level, they felt relief: The cuts had been made, and they were all still here. It made them especially glad to see one another.
 But there were thoughts they kept to themselves. It was hard not to stare at the vacant desks, the stray objects one programmer described as the ''signs of lost people.'' On the wall, a flat-screen monitor with the caption ''MeshNetics Confidential'' flashed snapshots from the summer, when this start-up company seemed to have harnessed the best ambitions of a new Russia. Now, anxiety was disturbing the employees' sleep. The smokers were smoking more often. 
 The tale of this young company, which produces innovative wireless networking systems, offers a glimpse of how the financial crisis has swept through Russia's budding entrepreneurial culture and crashed like cold water onto young workers who had come to see the boom times as normal. 
 Last month, as Russia's stock market swooned and the credit crunch took hold around the world, Russian companies spooked by memories of previous bank collapses scrambled to protect what cash they had. Venture capital dried up virtually overnight, including at MeshNetics' parent company. 
 At MeshNetics, a gingerly layoff was followed by a second cut, and a third. By late October, the options had dwindled: it had to find a new source of capital or suspend operations. ''It's going to be tough letting go of this period of growth,'' Ilya Bagrak, the company's software product manager, said last month. He was still in shock from the experience of firing one of his employees hours after they had shared their morning coffee. 
 ''You try to rationalize, you think of the good that might come out of it,'' he said. ''You say to yourself, either they go or you go. You say the decision is not yours, I'm just following orders. But I know they're going to be in a world of pain when they enter the job market now.''
 Anyone who walked into MeshNetics this summer would have seen a workplace that had purged every remnant of Soviet office life. Posters congratulated ''Miss Congeniality'' and ''Mr. Positive Attitude'' -- in English, the language that had been officially chosen for office purposes, part of a plan to integrate seamlessly with Western markets. 
 Among the staff members were cherry-picked talent like Mr. Bagrak, 27, back in Russia from Silicon Valley to be part of the excitement; Aleksander Luzhetsky, a talented 26-year-old programmer attracted to Moscow from a provincial city; and 57-year-old Efim Grinkrug, who trained with the pioneers of Soviet supercomputing, putting finishing touches on the company's breakthrough research and development project, known as the Golden Box.
 They had been winners of a historical sweepstakes: eight years of stability and economic growth under Vladimir V. Putin had produced a wave of start-ups and spinoffs in Moscow's high-tech sector. Here they had found the kind of opportunity that Russian scientists once could pursue only overseas. 
 The workers were young and compulsive; it was not unusual for them to chat online about their projects on Saturday afternoons. There were dartboards on their cubicles, and pictures of their heads Photoshopped onto chicken legs, but what they liked most was technology. Vladimir Marchenko, 25, coined the motto, ''No wires, no cry,'' a variation of Bob Marley's reggae anthem ''No Woman No Cry'' and a tribute to their main product, the ZigBit, a chip capable of setting up wireless networks almost automatically. 
 Vasily Suvorov, the chief executive, seemed to have picked the perfect moment. This spring, President Dmitri A. Medvedev came to power vowing to wean Russia's economy off fossil fuels and invest in innovation. Technology was on everyone's lips. Russia committed 130 billion rubles, or about $5 billion, to a state corporation for nanotechnology whose head at the time, Leonid Melamed, promised that Russia would ''soon be able to give the world more than just military technology, vodka, satellites and perestroika.''
 In March, Mr. Suvorov, 36, met with his shareholders and planned ''full-throttle movement.'' The ZigBit has an 18-month sales cycle, so it requires heavy upfront investment, and the company was not yet profitable. But sales were growing by 50 to 80 percent per quarter. 
 Better still, Mr. Suvorov had found a ''killer application'' in efficient energy systems: the technology could allow utility companies two-way communication with meters and thermostats in buildings. Mr. Suvorov persuaded his investors to back a major expansion, adding 25 percent to his workforce and enlarging his overseas offices.
 The business environment was dazzling. When Mr. Bagrak moved back to Russia from Berkeley, Calif., he worried about the fabled lassitude of Russian office life. But what he found at MeshNetics reminded him of Sun Microsystems and Google, where he had done internships. His peers worked long hours and were buzzing with start-up ideas. 
 ''There's this idea of 'You can make something happen,' '' Mr. Bagrak said.
 There was a thrill, too, in seeing Russian science rise up and compete. Mr. Luzhetsky grew up in Obninsk, a city built by the Soviets for nuclear and military scientists. From Obninsk, the story of post-Soviet Russia was a slide into decay and poverty. In the 1990s, enriched uranium smuggled from Obninsk turned up in Vilnius, Lithuania, in Prague and in Munich. 
 So success meant something to Mr. Luzhetsky. His Moscow was not the gilded city of the oil barons; at his first programming job, he was embarrassed to discover that he earned less than some document couriers. The payoff came when MeshNetics teamed up with a Western semiconductor company where he had once dreamed of working. Now he wanted to do something else: to stay in Russia and compete. 
 ''I was educated in the Soviet Union,'' he said. ''There is a national idea. It does exist.''
 In the midst of yuppies in blue jeans, Mr. Grinkrug was a walking reminder of the past. At 57, he was a chain smoker in a loose black suit, from a generation that saw science as a religion. He calls himself ''the last of the Mohicans,'' but it is not quite a joke. When the Soviet Union collapsed, Russian scientists his age left Russia, or left science. He considers it a success that, as he put it, ''I didn't end up selling cars.'' 
 When Mr. Suvorov announced that layoffs were coming, alarm bells went off in Mr. Grinkrug's brain. He headed a team of 12 programmers developing the Golden Box, cutting-edge software that would allow companies to model and view networks in action. The project, three years in the making, was scheduled for release early next year. 
 Mr. Grinkrug knew what could happen: His last major project, a three-dimensional Web browser he had developed for another company, was abruptly frozen during the Russian banking crisis of 2004, and it was still frozen. He told his team to work harder, hoping to condense months of work into a few weeks. 
 But no one in the place could concentrate.
 Anatoly Karachinsky hated to pull the plug on MeshNetics. Mr. Karachinsky, president of the Russian Internet technology giant IBS Group, had spun off MeshNetics using the brightest talent from his software development team and financed it through his venture fund, Oradell Capital. Well into this fall, Mr. Karachinsky took an optimistic view of the crisis, saying it would wake up the worst of Russia's workers, but predicting that ''the best will not suffer.'' 
 By October, he knew that the best would suffer, too. He gave Mr. Suvorov the news: he would support MeshNetics while the team looked for a new investor. Otherwise, ''the technology will be bought by our Western partners,'' he said. ''Naturally,'' Mr. Karachinsky said, ''these are painful decisions.''
 The first round of cuts at MeshNetics was less than 10 percent. Nine days later, about a dozen more people were fired, and the company consolidated its personnel onto one floor, said Alex Leonov, director of marketing and communications. The dynamo Mr. Suvorov had constructed was beginning to come apart: The graphic designer had to move back to Tbilisi, Georgia, because she lost her work visa along with her job; Mr. Leonov thought he might look for opportunities in Europe; Mr. Bagrak and his wife discussed returning to the United States.
 On Oct. 29, Mr. Suvorov looked stricken. He said the company was in a ''shutdown phase.'' 
 Alexei Rybakov, 33, managing director of the division that makes the ZigBit, simply would not accept it. Hyperkinetic and angry, he was calling about 50 people a day looking for a new investor, his brain working at ''6,000 r.p.m.'' He had the feeling that his child was being held hostage. He blamed the business environment in Russia, where, he said, ''People have socialist instincts. Something happens, you just grab the money and shoot at anyone who tries to take it.''
 He made a practical argument for MeshNetics, and a global one, and a patriotic one.
 ''This is what it means for Russia,'' he said. ''There will be minus one of the companies that create a real adoption of Russia in the world.''
 Within a few days, there seemed to be reason for optimism: Mr. Suvorov said he was close to reaching an agreement with a Western company that would save the core of the business. Investors were trolling Moscow, looking for the start-ups that, like Google, might outlast lean times to lead the market. Mr. Rybakov's mood lifted; he believed the company would survive.
 That was little comfort to Mr. Grinkrug, who was informed Oct. 30 that his division would be eliminated. After four and a half years with the company, he still could fit all of his possessions in two bags. What he cared about were codes -- 40 years' worth of codes -- which he transferred to CD, one by one, ''as a kind of memorial.'' 
 The thought of finding a new job at his age scared him. 
 MeshNetics was retaining four of his programmers, so that the Golden Box project might go forward if the new leadership chose. ''All the rest, probably, will die in my head,'' Mr. Grinkrug predicted sadly in an e-mail message. ''This head is not needed anymore.''
 He and his colleagues left together that afternoon, and sat at a bar for a while, talking about the place where they had spent the past few years. One thing no one mentioned was the Golden Box, which Mr. Grinkrug said stood to reason. 
 In Russia, he explained, ''we don't speak ill of the dead.''

HEADLINE: Nearly Evicted in Error, and Left With Nothing

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
Look around Joann Ritter's apartment in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn and you will see an entire room of hand-me-downs. Her sister gave her the bed and the portable closet; her nephew gave her the television set; the microwave oven came from a neighbor who was about to throw it out; the kitchen chairs, she found on the street. 
 ''Everybody tried to help us,'' Ms. Ritter, 52, said the other day. ''We had nothing -- or less than nothing. We were sleeping on the floor.'' 
 That's because in March there was a mix-up with the city's Housing Stability Plus program, which pays her $925 monthly rent. Her landlord did not receive the check that month and took all of her belongings from the home, crated them and put them on the street, Ms. Ritter said. 
 Ms. Ritter, who is unemployed, said that she came home to find the apartment emptied of its furniture. All of her clothes were gone, as were her three children's clothes and all of their personal effects. The only things remaining were the air-conditioner and the washing machine, she said.
 For help, Ms. Ritter turned to the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The Brooklyn Bureau gave the Ritters $399, which they spent on a daybed for Ms. Ritter's son, Alvin Deas Jr., 11, and $250 for clothing for Alvin and his sisters, Al-Laysha Deas, 9, and Alicia Ritter, 24.
 ''We were wiped out at that point,'' Ms. Ritter recalled, adding that the rent mix-up was quickly resolved but that the belongings were lost for good. ''We didn't know what we were going to do.''
 It had been a painful year. A month before, in February, Ms. Ritter's mother, Francis Ritter, had died of heart failure. And Ms. Ritter, who has chronic arthritis, was still recovering from hip-replacement surgery and had lost her job at the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, she said.
 In 2005, after losing her apartment in the Van Dyke Houses near Mother Gaston Boulevard in Brooklyn, she had to go with her children to a homeless shelter for a while. 
 But she eventually managed, with the city's help, to rent the small apartment on Jefferson Street where they now live, in two sections separated by a dingy public hallway. Ms. Ritter lives in the first section with Al-Laysha, a student at Public School 145 and an avid reader of the Judy Moody books, and Alvin, a math whiz and a fan of professional wrestling who attends Intermediate School 349. Alicia, who has a job, lives down the hall in the other section, in a little nook behind a curtain near the kitchen.
 Everything now in the apartment, Ms. Ritter said, came from somewhere else. Al-Laysha's favorite books, including ''The Cat Ate My Gymsuit'' and ''Amber Brown Is Not a Crayon,'' came from a teacher at her school. Alvin's cellphone was given to him by a relative. Only the apartment's decorations -- the pennant hanging from the ceiling in honor of Al-Laysha's ninth birthday and the Hannah Montana stickers on the wall -- were purchased by the family. Ms. Ritter picked them up at a 99-cent store. 
 Still, the Ritters manage, sometimes by ignoring or imagining away their surroundings. For Al-Laysha, reading is the best way to escape.
 ''Books are funny, and some are really interesting,'' she said. ''When I'm reading, I think I'm in the story with the characters.''
 And, of course, the members of the family have each other.
 ''They didn't take our lives,'' Ms. Ritter said, ''and they didn't take our spirits. As long as we're together, it doesn't matter that we don't have much.''
 One day, she hopes for a house of her own and, with that, the permanence it will bring.
 ''That's my dream,'' Ms. Ritter said, ''a place where nobody, under no circumstances, can ever, never, ever put us out.''

HEADLINE: If Detroit Falls, Foreign Makers Could Be Buffer

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE; Bill Vlasic contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The failure of one or more of Detroit's Big Three automakers would put a huge initial dent in American manufacturing, but in time foreign car companies would pick up the slack by stepping up production in their plants here, many industry experts and economists say.
 Whether Washington should let that play out -- risking hundreds of thousands of jobs -- is a central question Congress will weigh this week as it hears testimony from Detroit leaders who are pushing for immediate federal intervention, before the next administration takes over in January. 
 ''Barack Obama has made it clear he understands the importance of the industry. The question is, do we get that far?'' Ron Gettelfinger, head of the United Auto Workers, said in an interview Friday, raising the prospect of a General Motors bankruptcy. ''At this juncture, we are in a crisis that could have a major negative impact on this country.''
 But many industry experts say the big foreign makers are established enough to take control of the industry and its vast supplier network more quickly than is widely understood. 
 ''You would have an auto industry in the United States more like that of Mexico and Canada: foreign-owned,'' said Sean McAlinden, chief economist at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich., which describes itself as a nonprofit organization that has ''strong relationships with industry, government agencies, universities, research institutes, labor organizations'' and other groups with an interest in the auto business.
 The transition to that new equilibrium would surely be painful. The big American companies employ about 240,000 workers, and their suppliers an additional 2.3 million, amounting to nearly 2 percent of the nation's work force. 
 The outright failure of General Motors would eliminate the biggest auto employer and more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs. That is roughly the number of jobs already lost this year at the nation's automakers and their suppliers.
 G.M. is rapidly running out of cash and appealing to Washington for a multibillion-dollar bailout to keep operating and continue the costly conversion to a leaner company producing efficient vehicles that people will buy.
 G.M.'s collapse would probably bring down some of its suppliers as well. Since many of them ship parts and subassemblies to the other auto makers -- domestic and foreign -- auto production could be crippled until the supply system was reorganized around the newly dominant foreign car makers. 
 ''The transplants, deprived of enough suppliers, would have to rely on imported vehicles while they scramble to reorganize the supply system,'' Mr. McAlinden said, speaking of the foreign companies with manufacturing plants in the United States. ''That would take them about a year.''
 Given Chrysler's weakness, the new kings of the auto industry would presumably be Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Volkswagen, Ford, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Hyundai-Kia. (Volkswagen has not yet opened a plant in the United States, and BMW and Hyundai each have one plant.) 
 Like the Big Three, they would together dominate manufacturing in the United States, becoming big customers for steel, aluminum, plastics, glass, machine tools, computer chips and rubber. 
 Even in this year of plunging car sales, the automakers and their vast supplier network still account for 2.3 percent of the nation's economic output, down from 3.1 percent in 2006 and as much as 5 percent in the 1990s, according to government data. More significant, economists say, 20 percent of the shrinking manufacturing sector is still tied to the automobile industry. 
 ''I don't think people appreciate the importance of this backward linkage to the rest of manufacturing,'' said Sanford Jacoby, an economic historian at the University of California, Los Angeles. ''The automakers play a big role in sustaining other manufacturers.'' 
 Gradually, the auto industry has already become less American. The smallest of the Big Three, Chrysler, was owned for a while by the German company, Daimler, before it was returned to American ownership in the form of a privately held company in a much slimmer state than its once starring role in Detroit. 
 The American automakers, of course, have bought more and more parts from overseas. But 85 percent of their products are made in North America, compared with 60 percent for the foreign-owned automakers, said Dan Luria, research director at the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center.
 Vehicles built entirely abroad drive down the percentage at the foreign-owned automakers. The popular Toyota Prius, for example, is not yet manufactured in the United States. That will come soon, Toyota says. But given worldwide demand for the car, Toyota achieves economies of scale by centering production in Japan rather than using multiple sites. 
 Such an inclination on the part of foreign companies to keep their production out of the United States helps to explain the push by the Democrats in Congress to provide aid to keep the American automakers alive. The federal help would probably go first to G.M., which says it will run out of cash by early next year and be forced out of business without federal help. 
 Rather than collapse outright, a carmaker could file for bankruptcy protection. If it obtained financing, the company could then continue operating and slim down to a more manageable size, with cuts occurring over a period of months or years. But some of its operations could be taken over by another automaker or it could even be forced to liquidate. 
 ''If the Big Three go down, a bunch of the suppliers go down, and the transplants share a number of the suppliers,'' said Alan Reuther, director of the United Automobile Workers' Washington office -- trying in effect to enlist the foreign-owned makers in the effort to save the Big Three.
 So far those manufacturers have stayed on the sidelines, avoiding any suggestion that they would like to see any of the American automakers disappear. ''Toyota strongly believes that a strong market with vigorous competition is in everyone's interest,'' said Tina Ewald, a Toyota spokeswoman. 
 The Japanese automakers broke into the American market in the 1970s by exporting small, high-quality, fuel-efficient vehicles during an energy crisis. They began putting factories here in the 1980s, when import quotas and anti-Japanese sentiment threatened to restrict their American sales.
 Fuel-efficient vehicles are still the strength of the Japanese and other foreign automakers at a time when such vehicles dominate what auto sales there still are in a rapidly sinking economy. The Big Three have not yet developed fuel-efficient cars as the mainstays of their fleets, and some in Congress are insisting they do that in exchange for any bailout.
 But if the current downturn is prolonged, it might be too late. In an industry capable of making 17 million cars a year, sales have dropped to an annual rate of only 10 million vehicles made here. 
 ''None of the Big Three -- and perhaps not the transplants -- can make money at 10 million,'' Mr. Luria said. ''The transplants are O.K. at 12 million and the Big Three at 15 million or so.'' 
 Annual sales of autos and light trucks have been at least 15 million through most of the last decade.
 The downsizing in response to the slump has been harsh. More than 100,000 jobs have disappeared since January at the automakers and their suppliers, one in every 10 jobs lost in the United States this year. The three American-owned companies were responsible for most of the loss. They employ 75 percent of the nation's 333,000 total auto workers when foreign-owned companies are included. 
 The elimination of many more workers, most of them union members and earning upwards of $20 an hour, would be devastating in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, where the American automakers and many of their suppliers are concentrated. In fact, many of those jobs may disappear even if the companies win government assistance.
 But other employers would take their place over time. As the foreign companies stepped up production to replace what would be lost by an American company's collapse, the transplants would add to their existing work force of 78,000, replacing many of the lost jobs, although at lower wages, with fewer benefits and at nonunion factories in other parts of the country. 
 The auto industry's share of the gross domestic product would probably also revive, if the transplants were to build in the United States the vast majority of the cars they sold here, holding down imports.
 Still, there would be one irreplaceable loss, Mr. McAlinden argued. ''Right now, we do $18.5 billion of automotive research and development in a year,'' he said, referring to innovative projects like the development of new types of batteries. 
 G.M. in particular is involved in the development of lithium ion batteries to power the next generation of cars. If G.M. disappeared, ''the foreign companies would develop the batteries, but not here,'' Mr. McAlinden predicted. ''We would lose all the additional development connected to that technology. It would be a technology opportunity lost.''

HEADLINE: Rescue the Automakers, or Allow Them to Fail?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Bailout to Nowhere'' (column, Nov. 14): 
 David Brooks suggests that the proposed infusion of cash to the automobile industry is unwise and would serve only to delay the eventual bankruptcy of the companies. 
 In the long run, he contends, their disappearance would be a positive thing because the Big Three would be replaced by better, more innovative industries, creating an era of growth and prosperity. 
 But what must be factored into the discussion is the disastrous impact of adding millions to the ranks of the unemployed right now, while the country is in a huge economic downturn. 
 Would it not be much better, and probably far less expensive, to prolong the life of the carmakers until the effects of recession are mitigated, and then phase out these corporate dinosaurs? 
 Arthur L. Yeager Edison, N.J., Nov. 14, 2008
 To the Editor:
 One could argue that the economist Joseph Alois Schumpeter's doctrine of ''creative destruction,'' which David Brooks cites, was violated just as much with governmental intercession to save the American International Group as it would be with a bailout of General Motors. 
 With the passage of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, pure market forces have already been alloyed and the Rubicon has been crossed. 
 Mr. Brooks's opinion is therefore a value judgment, colored by his perception of which companies are, and which are not, too big to fail. 
 Consider Mr. Brooks's comment that the auto companies ''are not innocent victims of this crisis.'' Should we infer from this that Fannie Mae, Goldman Sachs, Wachovia and the rest were innocent victims?
 Michael Kalman Tenafly, N.J., Nov. 14, 2008
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks asks: ''Is this country going to slide into progressive corporatism, a merger of corporate and federal power that will inevitably stifle competition, empower corporate and federal bureaucrats and protected entrenched interests? Or is the U.S. going to stick with its historic model: Helping workers weather the storms of a dynamic economy, but preserving the dynamism that is the core of the country's success.''
 But the ''historic model'' is actually the merging of corporate and federal power, and that is what caused the problem. 
 Almost all of the Michigan members of the House and the Senate have voted the way the Detroit automakers directed them to vote, with vigorous lobbying to block Congress from raising the miles per gallon requirements. 
 Perhaps it's time to change the ''historic model.''
 Roy V. Jackson Wilmington, Del., Nov.14, 2008
 To the Editor:
 What should be added to David Brooks's discussion of a possible bailout for automobile companies is their role in national defense, particularly during World War II.
 Many analysts argue that the country should let the Big Three fail and work out their problems in bankruptcy. They further argue that we have many foreign companies that are succeeding in this country, as well as new start-ups that are beginning to build cars with new technologies.
 But the three companies played a critical role in World War II, moving their production from cars to military vehicles. Should we find ourselves in a similar situation, there is no way that the country can count on foreign manufacturers or new start-ups to carry out such a transformation.
 It is in our national interest to preserve the core competencies and facilities of these companies until America develops comparable capacity in other companies.
 Allan Collins Lexington, Mass., Nov. 14, 2008
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks makes sense. I have been the happy owner of a Honda Civic since 1975, when I traded in my late husband's Pontiac Bonneville for a reasonable mode of transportation. Those Hondas are now built right here in Ohio.
 Let General Motors or Chrysler sell to Honda or Toyota or to one of the other efficient carmakers. They could retool and use the plants and rehire and retrain the workers. We'd all be better off.

HEADLINE: Japan's Economy, World's Second Largest, Is in Recession

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Japan, the world's second-largest economy, has officially slipped into recession, hurt by weak export growth and steep cuts in corporate spending amid the worsening global slowdown.
 Japan's gross domestic product shrank at an annual rate of 0.4 percent from July to September after declining a revised 3.7 percent in the previous quarter, the government said Monday. It was the first time since 2001 that Japan's economy has contracted for two consecutive quarters, the definition of a recession.
 The decline adds to the grim outlook for the global economy, after Hong Kong and the European Union released data on Friday that showed they were in recession. Europe's largest economy, Germany, also announced last week that it was in recession. 
 The United States may follow, after Washington said last month that the American economy contracted in the third quarter.
 The figure was worse than expected by economists, who had predicted Japan's $5 trillion economy would narrowly avert a recession by posting slight growth. 
 ''Downside risks to the economy are growing further,'' Kaoru Yosano, the economic minister, told reporters. ''Japan is in a very serious situation.''
 Until now, Japan has stood apart from most other developed nations because its banks were relatively unscathed by the financial crisis. But Monday's data showed that America's woes reached Japan via its exports, as Americans spend less on Japanese cars, televisions and machine tools. 
 Japan is particularly affected by these swings in the United States, the world's largest economy, because it has been largely dependent on sales abroad for growth. Domestic consumption has remained weak in this rapidly aging society, keeping Japan's overall growth rates anemic even during its long growth cycle that extended from 2002 until this year. 
 Faltering demand overseas combined with higher imported energy prices reduced growth in Japan from 0.4 percent in the previous quarter to 0.2 percent in the July-September quarter, according to Monday's figures. Spending by Japanese companies fell by 1.7 percent from the previous quarter, its third straight decline. Household consumption rose 0.3 percent from the previous quarter.
 Economists say the worst is yet to come, both in Japan and abroad. The figures do not include most of the financial panic since September, which has sent Tokyo stock markets to 26-year lows.
 Economists say they expect Japan to have an even more severe contraction in the current quarter, ending in December, as spooked American consumers and businesses cut back even further on spending.
 Economists said the weakness was also expected to feed into the Japan's domestic economy, as declining exports hurt corporate profits, pushing many smaller companies into bankruptcy. This could lead to declining wages and rising unemployment.
 ''The really dark period hasn't even reached us yet,'' said Hideo Kumano, chief economist for Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute, based in Tokyo. ''The stock declines are going to have a freezing effect. The end-of-year retail sales season will be miserable.''
 Mr. Kumano and other economists predicted Japan's downturn would worsen until about the middle of next year. That is when economists expect the benefits from government spending packages in Japan and its biggest export markets, China and the United States, to revive activity. 
 Economists said the decline would probably increase calls for Tokyo to take more steps to stimulate growth, beyond the $70 billion in stimulus already pledged. But few economists said they expected more action as politicians prepared for national elections that must be held before next September. The Bank of Japan, the central bank, also moved last month by cutting overnight lending rates to 0.3 percent.
 Some economists said a true recovery would take another year at least, as the United States combats deep structural problems in its housing market and banking system. Takahide Kiuchi, senior economist at Nomura Securities in Tokyo, said he expected the downturn to last until late 2010, with some respite next year from stimulus measures.
 Economists say they expect Japan's current recession to be milder than in the United States. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has forecast the Japanese economy will shrink by 0.1 percent next year, versus declines of 0.9 percent in the United States and 0.5 percent in the European Union.

HEADLINE: For More of Mexico's Wealthy, Cost of Living Includes Guards

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY 

 BODY:
When Jose hops into his Ferrari, presses his Ferragamo loafer to the floor and fills the night air with a deep roar, his bodyguards hustle into a black sport utility vehicle with their weapons at the ready, tailing their fast-moving boss through the streets.
 Jose, a business magnate in his 30s who said he was afraid to have his full name published, makes sure his two children get the same protection. Bodyguards pick them up from school and escort them even to friends' birthday parties -- where the bodyguards meet other bodyguards, because many of the children's classmates have similar protection. 
 With drug-related violence spinning out of control and kidnappings a proven money-maker for criminal gangs, members of Mexico's upper class find themselves juggling the spoils of their status with the fear of being killed. 
 Dinner party chatter these days focuses on two things that are making their lives, still the envy of the country's masses, far less enviable: the financial crisis, which is chipping away at their wealth, and the wave of insecurity, which is making it more perilous for them to enjoy what remains. 
 Mexico's violence afflicts both rich and poor, but the nation's income gap is so pronounced that criminals scour the society pages for potential kidnapping victims, for whom they demand, and often receive, huge sums in ransom. A recent report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found that Mexico had the largest divide between rich and poor of the group's 30 member nations, virtually assuring that wealthy targets stand out.
 Wealthy Mexicans have long hired bodyguards, but experts say the numbers of those seeking protection have jumped since President Felipe Calderon challenged the drug cartels, bringing unprecedented levels of related violence -- which had been mainly confined to the areas bordering the United States -- into the major cities. 
 High-profile and sometimes gruesome crimes have stoked people's fears. 
 In one of the worst cases, a 5-year-old boy from a poor family was plucked from a gritty market this month and killed by kidnappers, who injected acid into his heart. 
 Early this month, white-coated doctors in Tijuana protested after one of their own, a prominent kidney specialist, was plucked from outside his office by heavily armed men. He has since been released. 
 ''It's out of control,'' said Dr. Hector Rico, the leader of the local medical association.
 Confronted by the irate doctors at a public meeting, Jose Guadalupe Osuna Millan, the governor of Baja California State, said the answer to the rising insecurity was to come together and fight. 
 ''We're not going to cede one millimeter of territory to these criminals,'' he said of the federal government's war on drug traffickers. 
 But hundreds of well-off families along the border have become so consumed by their fears that they have moved out of Mexico, at least temporarily, often using business visas granted because of their work in the United States. 
 ''It's a bad feeling to have to leave your country behind,'' said Javier, a prosperous Tijuana businessman, who moved his family across the border to San Diego last year after a group of armed men tried to kidnap him. ''But I didn't really have a choice.'' He insisted that his last name not be used, out of fear that criminals might track him. 
 ''There's an exodus, and it's all about insecurity,'' said Guillermo Alonso Meneses, an anthropologist at the Colegio de la Frontera Norte in Tijuana. ''A psychosis has developed. There's fear of getting kidnapped or killed. 
 ''People don't want to live that way,'' he continued, ''and those who can afford it move north.''
 Still, most of the wealthy have chosen to stay put, hiring armies of protectors to continue enjoying their gilded lives. 
 Although there are few firm figures for the number of Mexicans employed to guard their fellow citizens -- most security companies ignore requirements to register with the government -- experts say business is booming for the estimated 10,000 security companies operating in the country.
 In the border state of Chihuahua, the Mexican Employers' Association recently reported a 300 percent increase in the number of bodyguards. In that violence-torn state, some luxury hotels now offer their guests bodyguards and bulletproof vehicles. 
 For many affluent families, the guards and bulletproof cars, homes and even clothing have become a way of life. Some Mexicans say the protection has even become a status symbol. 
 In Mexico City, some people being protected by men wearing earpieces strut along in designer clothes, using their armed guards to clear a path. 
 A stylish woman at a Starbucks in the well-off Coyoacan neighborhood held out her cappuccino the other day while chatting with friends. A member of her two-man security detail discreetly slipped a cardboard sleeve on the cup so that the woman's fingertips were protected, along with the rest of her.
 ''It's a different life,'' said Jose, the well-protected Ferrari driver, who agreed to provide a glimpse of that life. ''I've gotten used to it.''
 Indeed, Jose hands out designer clothing and other expensive gifts to his family's two dozen or so bodyguards and invites them to his mother's house weekly for a meal. He is being benevolent but also practical, given that many crimes in Mexico are inside jobs. 
 ''I want them to feel like they're part of the family,'' he said. ''And if something happens to me, I want them to react. They won't risk their life for a paycheck. They will risk their life for a friend, for family.''
 Some security consultants and academics point out that at least the upper crust has options, while other Mexicans must rely on law enforcement agencies, known for their corruption and ineffectiveness, to protect them from the violence. Many families who struggle to make ends meet find their loved ones grabbed for ransom. And shootouts between traffickers and the police and soldiers pursuing them erupt with no regard for the income level of bystanders. 
 ''There's reason for everyone to be fearful,'' said Dr. Alonso, the Tijuana anthropologist, who hears gunfire at night in his middle-class neighborhood and, like many others, rarely ventures out after dark.
 Despite Jose's expensive clothing, eye-catching jewelry and luxury home in the hills, he insists that his family is different from many others in their income bracket. 
 ''We're not nouveau riche,'' he said with a huff. ''Those people want guards to show how important they are.''
 As for the Ferrari, which he acknowledged is the opposite of discreet, Jose said it was the car's engine that attracted him to it. ''It's not to sit back and have everyone look at me,'' he said. ''It's to drive.''
 But people do gawk. And Jose's bodyguards worry about the attention his rare sports car attracts on the roads of Mexico. 
 ''Of course, he shouldn't be driving himself,'' one of Jose's bodyguards said. ''But he's like a presidential candidate who likes to go into crowds. Our function is to provide the security around the life he's living.''
 That life includes late-night stops at exclusive nightclubs and humble taco shops. Jose understands what he puts his guards through, because he completed bodyguard training in Guatemala to learn what his employees should be doing.
 Jose also conducts background checks before hiring his bodyguards and sends them for regular refresher courses, meaning they are a cut above the run-of-the-mill Mexican bodyguard, who might be a washout police officer or soldier with modest training and little discipline for the job.
 Javier, the businessman who now lives north of the border, said he did not believe bodyguards were the answer. 
 ''One bodyguard, two bodyguards, even three of them can't do anything with these criminals, who come in groups of 20 with high-powered arms,'' he said. ''If they want to hunt you down, they will get you.''
 Even Jose is taking a break from Mexico. He recently headed to Canada with his family, for what he insisted was a respite rather than an abandonment of his country. 
 ''I'm not running away,'' he said. ''I have an opportunity, and I'll be back. But I'm not going to miss the insecurity. Not at all.''
 Especially appealing, he said, was that his 6-year-old son would be able to ride his bike to school instead of being escorted in a bulletproof vehicle driven by a private paramilitary force. 
 ''For my children, they don't understand,'' Jose said. ''They're happy to have these guys around. When they get out of school, there's someone to take their backpack. There's always someone around to play. I try to teach them that this isn't normal. It shouldn't be this way.''

HEADLINE: Recession Is a Relative Term in Baseball

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In his foreword to the ''Illustrated History of the New York Giants,'' the longtime co-owner Wellington Mara recalled his father's view of sports in economic hard times. Mara wrote: ''Money was very tight in the thirties. However according to my father, compared to other areas of the entertainment business, sports somewhat prospered during the Depression because they really offered the best entertainment for the money.''
 What was true for pro football more than 70 years ago is true for professional basketball, baseball and football in 2008. 
 With much of the nation reeling, with banks failing, workers being laid off and homes being foreclosed, sports owners continue to build castles and pay players by the millions. At least one team, the Knicks, is paying a player millions not to play. 
 Recession? What recession?
 Friday was the first day major league baseball teams could have contract discussions with free agents who were with other clubs last season. For teams like the Yankees, it was the opening of hunting season. 
 The Yankees, who had a major-league-high $209.1 million payroll this year, offered pitcher C. C. Sabathia a six-year deal worth at least $140 million, which would make him the highest-paid pitcher in baseball history. 
 How can this be? Global markets stagger, but baseball rolls on.
 In baseball, salaries tend to reflect the income of the previous year, and baseball has enjoyed several good years. 
 ''Historically, baseball has been recession resistant,'' Don Fehr, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, said Sunday during a telephone interview. ''If you look at baseball's income numbers beginning with the late 1970s, even though we went through bad recessions in the early '80s, in the late '80s and in the early '90s, you didn't see all that much effect. That doesn't necessarily tell you what will happen this time.''
 At a news conference last week, the Yankees co-chairman Hal Steinbrenner told reporters -- somewhat remarkably given the economic climate -- that ''everything has a price.'' 
 ''We understand free agency,'' Steinbrenner said. ''We're going to go after what we need. If what we're willing to do is not enough, then it won't be enough. But we're going to pursue the market aggressively.''
 The Boston Red Sox' president, Larry Lucchino, made a number of interesting remarks last week about his sport, his team and free agency. 
 Lucchino told reporters that despite the global economic crisis he expected ''crazy competition'' for the elite free agents. He said that spending on high-end free agents would be largely unaffected by the downturn. 
 ''I think it's a little too soon to feel the likely effects of this deep recession that the country is veering into,'' said Lucchino, whose Red Sox announced last week that they were freezing ticket prices. ''There may still be some crazy competition going on for this year's free agents.'' 
 Economy or not, bidding on free agents is expected to be ferocious. Manny Ramirez was reportedly offered a two-year deal worth about $55 million to stay with the Dodgers. The Nationals, the Angels and the Red Sox are seemingly prepared to go after first baseman Mark Teixeira, and reliever Francisco Rodriguez may be the biggest free-agent prize outside of Sabathia. 
 Will the precarious state of the economy have an impact on how teams pursue free agents?
 ''That's the question I ask other G.M.'s,'' Mets General Manager Omar Minaya said Sunday. ''You have to be prepared before you spend. You have to ask yourself, What's going on around us?''
 He added: ''The industry as a whole has to be a little bit on hold. Historically, sports has been immune from some factors in the economy. But this one is to be something like a perfect storm.''
 Sports leagues like the N.B.A., the N.F.L. and Major League Baseball are fairy-tale lands, an otherworld of packed stadiums, charter flights, multimillion-dollar training facilities, multimillion-dollar player contracts paid by multibillionaire owners. 
 Yet in a time of severe economic crisis, the leagues, at least for now, are holding forth, if not completely thriving. 
 Several theories explain why these sports leagues -- especially baseball -- thrive when money is tight. Baseball, to a greater extent than the N.F.L. and the N.B.A., is dependent on gate receipts. When families begin to feel the economic pinch and stay home rather than take a long trip, many choose to attend baseball games. 
 And there is simply the attraction of sport as an escape hatch, a two- to three-hour refuge. 
 ''It does serve as a community rallying point in the sense of identification people have that is very meaningful,'' Fehr said. ''I think that's true of most sports, whether it's your professional team, your college teams or your high school team.''
 Richard Lapchick, president and chief executive of the National Consortium for Academics and Sports, said: ''I think that the public in general does not care that much about the athlete's salary. They want that escape. When people are depressed about life or the economy or whatever it happens to be, they gain solace from being able to escape at a sports event.''
 Baseball is in the midst of its free-agent hunting season. Multimillion-dollar contracts are being thrown at strong-armed pitchers and hard-hitting sluggers. 
 Recession? What recession?

HEADLINE: Gramm and the 'Enron Loophole'

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON

 BODY:
In 2000, Senator Phil Gramm played a central role in writing the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, a law that would open the door to unregulated trading of credit default swaps, the financial instruments blamed, in part, for the current economic meltdown.
 But there was another aspect of this legislation that, earlier this decade, helped produce another financial meltdown: the collapse of Enron, the Texas energy company. 
 The commodity futures act, in addition to allowing unregulated trading of financial derivatives, included language advocated by Enron that largely exempted the company from regulation of its energy trading on electronic commodity markets, like its once-popular Enron Online. The provision came to be known as the Enron Loophole.
 E-mail written by Enron executives and lobbyists -- which became public as part of a federal investigation after Enron collapsed -- shows how top Enron officials closely monitored negotiations on the bill. They paid particular attention to Mr. Gramm, who before a final agreement in late 2000 was trying to press other key figures on Capitol Hill and at the White House to agree to concessions that would further curtail regulation of trading. 
 Enron's primary concern was that Mr. Gramm's insistence at getting these additional free-market concessions -- most of which were unrelated to Enron's business -- might scuttle the whole deal, killing Enron's chance of getting the loophole it sought.
 Enron was a major contributor to Mr. Gramm's political campaigns, and Mr. Gramm's wife, Wendy, served on the Enron board, which she joined after stepping down as chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
 Although not directly related to the current economic crisis, the Enron e-mail provides a window into how much clout Mr. Gramm had as chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, and the ways lobbyists intervened to advance and defend their interests during negotiations on the bill. 
 The Commodity Futures Modernization Act was approved in December 2000, just before Bill Clinton's term as president ended. Mr. Gramm, in a recent interview, said he was not responsible for inserting the language into the bill that established the Enron Loophole. But once the Commodity Futures Modernization measure -- with this provision included -- reached the Senate floor, Mr. Gramm led the debate, urging his fellow senators to pass it into law.
 Following are excerpts from some of the e-mail pulled from the Enron files that discuss Mr. Gramm and this legislation. All of the e-mail is available at Enron Explorer, a site that has put the Enron e-mail into a searchable format. More information on the Enron Loophole is available here. 
 Aug. 10, 2000: 'We Need Senator Gramm'
 Christopher M. Long, an Enron lobbyist, writes to other Enron executives, updating the status of the negotiations over the Commodity Futures Modernization Act and urging Enron's chief executive, Kenneth Lay, to call Senator Gramm to nudge him on the topic. As an Enron board member, Wendy Gramm is playing a part in the debate as well. Two Enron executives write Mr. Long back, endorsing the idea of having Mr. Lay call Mr. Gramm.

 Subject: CFTC Reauthorization 
 At his request, I met Lee Sachs, Assistant Treasury Secretary, who had requested the meeting after a brief conversation recently. Lee said that senior-level negotiations led by Secretary Summers were initiated last week between the CFTC and SEC and that progress was being made on the single stock futures issue (the major issue postponing movement of the legislation).
 The Senate Agriculture Committee passed out the Senate version in July. However, the bill is not moving quickly in the Senate due to Senator Phil Gramm's desire to see significant changes made to the legislation (not directly related to our energy language). Last week at the Republican Convention, I asked the Senator about the bill and he said they were working on it, but much needs to be changed for his support. More telling perhaps, were Wendy Gramm's comments that she would rather the current bill die if a better bill can be passed next year. What this means is that we must, at the least, remove Senator Gramm's opposition to the bill to move the process and more importantly seek to gain his support of the legislation.
 However, with less than 20 or so legislative days left, we need Senator Gramm to engage. A call from Ken Lay in the next two weeks to Senator Gramm could be an impetus for Gramm to move his staff to resolve the differences. Gramm needs to fully understand how helpful the bill is to Enron. Let me know your thoughts on this approach. I am prepared to assist in coordinating the call and drafting the talking points for a Ken Lay/Sen. Gramm call.
 Oct. 13, 2000: Talking Points
 Mr. Long again writes Enron executives providing ''talking points'' that Mr. Lay should bring up in his conversation with Senator Gramm. Senator Gramm, in a recent interview, said he did not remember ever having the conversation with Mr. Lay.Earlier e-mail shows that Mr. Lay and Mr. Gramm had previously spoken about the legislation.

 Subject: Commodity Futures Act - Talking Points 
 Tori: We have contacted Senator Gramm and Majority Leader Armey about the calls from Ken on Monday. Because of the uncertainty of the Congressional schedule, both offices told us to call on Monday morning to schedule the call. If Ken wants to make the calls unscheduled, we expect Armey and Gramm to both be in DC by Monday morning.
 ** CONFIDENTIAL **
 Talking Points on Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 Background:
 We have hit an impasse on the CFTC Reauthorization legislation. On legal certainty, nearly all interested parties agree. However, Senator Gramm continues to raise objections unrelated to legal certainty for our business. There are two issues (which we understand have primarily been advanced by Senator Gramm, one on bank products and one on SEC jurisdiction). Majority Leader Dick Armey is trying to gain consensus with the interested parties which include Senator Gramm, the Chairmen of the House Agriculture, Commerce, and Banking Committees, as well as the Department of Treasury, CFTC, and SEC. Meetings are occurring on a daily basis, but little concrete progress has been made since draft legislation was released on October 9. 
 Talking Points:
 We need your help to resolve outstanding differences so that the Commodities Futures Modernization Act of 2000 can pass this year. There are very few legislative days left and movement now on this legislation is essential. Do not let the Congressional calendar be the enemy of gaining legal certainty for this dynamic and growing industry.
 The current version of the legislation provides important legal certainty for all physical commodity transactions (not including agricultural commodities) entered into on a counterparty-to-counterparty basis or on an electronic trading facility. We strongly support these provisions.
 The legislation eliminates concerns that our derivatives transactions may be illegal or that our online platforms may be unregulated futures exchanges. These provisions allow our businesses to grow and innovate. Without this legislation the industry will be crippled with legal uncertainty and these platforms will develop overseas. 
 Virtually all of the issues in this very complex legislative package have been resolved. We are indifferent to outstanding provisions, except to the extent that they impede passage of the legislation. We cannot allow the great progress made to date, fail in the end.
 If asked, about a possible solution to the logjam. Answer: Encourage Majority Leader Armey, Senator Gramm, and Secretary Summers to meet immediately to finalize the remaining issues. Given time constraints, if such a meeting does not occur in the next few days, there may not be enough time to pass this important legislation.
 Note: Congress will be going out on either October 20 or October 27.
 Oct. 25, 2000: Signs of a Bottleneck
 Kenneth M. Raisler, a lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell, a law firm advising Enron, sends an e-mail message to Tom Briggs, then Enron's vice president for governmental affairs, explaining how Senator Gramm is holding up the legislation. Senator Gramm, he said, is trying to broaden the regulatory exemptions for derivatives trading provided in the Commodity Exchange Act (C.E.A.) beyond what the other parties in the negotiations had agreed to, including officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission (S.E.C.), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (C.F.T.C.) and mercantile exchanges in Chicago and New York.

 Subject: Fwd: CEA Update Bad News 
 Senator Gramm's staff presented to the Senate Ag Committee Republican and Democratic staff and the Democratic staff of the Senate Banking Committee, Gramm's proposed changes to the CEA bill. This proposal is quite lengthy, and includes many amendments most of which were previously discussed with the House Agriculture Committee, some of which were included in House Agriculture Committee Saturday Night Draft of 10/8/00. Because of the length of the document we have only attached the summary that the Gramm staff provided. In separate e-mails to follow we will send only the pages of the House-passed bill that were changed by the Gramm proposal. As you know some of these provisions include matters objectionable to Treasury, SEC, CFTC, Chicago and New York Exchanges. As you also know the view of the Agencies and the Ag Comm is that some of these exclusions create loopholes which can allow some market participants to avoid the new Single Stock Futures regulatory design, the CFTC oversight of the energy market, and go far beyond the recommendations of the President's Working Group. 
 The staffs of the Banking and Agriculture Committees have agreed to meet tomorrow late morning. We believe at that time the Agriculture Committee will propose a counter-offer which while addressing the Gramm major concerns will not adopt his proposal but instead rely on the Treasury proposals. If Senator Gramm is willing to work off this alternative a negotiation may result, otherwise it is unlikely that any agreement with Gramm will be reached. The Agriculture Committee is disinclined to repeat the debates held in the House Agriculture Comm. consideration of the bill. We welcome your reaction to the proposal.
 Oct. 27, 2000: An Optimistic Note
 Mr. Raisler again writes Enron executives, explaining that the negotiations are now moving ahead, after being contacted by energy industry players.

 Subject: New Optimism 
 A number of new positive developments last night. Senator Gramm is actively engaged and his issues are being aggressively negotiated. There remain a number of outstanding points but there is good cooperation with the Administration to get this done. Senator Gramm has been contacted by a number of people including members of our Energy Group and Alan Greenspan urging passage of the bill. This clearly has had an impact. Senator Gramm appears committed, and he and his Staff are very focused.
 With respect to physical commodities, our issues remain essentially untouched from the House bill. I expect that this is where we will be if the legislation gets passed. It looks now like Congress will be in next week, perhaps until Thursday. While this is painful, it does give them more time to work out unresolved issues.
 I will continue to keep you apprised.
 Dec. 12, 2000: Pressure on Gramm
 Stacy Carey, an executive at the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, sends the organization's members, including Enron, an update on the negotiations over the Commodity Future Modernization Act in the final days before Congress adjourns. Mr. Gramm is being pressured to give in and sign off on the legislation, but he is still pushing for certain changes, and getting agreement on them. Representative Thomas Ewing, Republican of Illinois, is pressing Mr. Gramm to sign off on the deal, saying that as agreed upon by the House speaker, Dennis Hastert, they will bring a House version to the floor even if Mr. Gramm refuses to accept the plan.

 Additionally, Chairman Ewing spoke to Senator Gramm this morning urging completion of negotiations. Ewing also advised Gramm that he would be forwarding a final legislative package to Speaker Hastert.
 Dec. 12, 2000: A Deal Is Reached
 Mr. Long, the Enron lobbyist, writes to Enron executives announcing that a deal has nearly been reached, after Mr. Gramm was able to persuade the players to accept some modest amendments to the legislation, including a change that will further protect swaps from regulation, as he had long sought -- a change that would benefit Enron.

 Mark - Treasury just minutes ago sent this compromise language to the CEA bill to Gramm's staff. It is my understanding from Treasury that the swap exemption is expanded slightly to say that if you are a trading on a facility (MTF) and you are trading on principle-to-principle basis among eligible contract participants you are no longer subject anti-fraud and anti-manipulation as contained in Sec. 107 of the House passed legislation. This would be good for us. Ken is in London, so can you take a quick look at the attached language and tell me if you concur.
 Also, we need to take a look at the new Sec. 4 to see if it causes any problems. 
 They may cut a deal as early as this afternoon! 
 Thanks - Chris 
 Dec. 16, 2000: Celebrating a Victory

 Congress Passes the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 
 Late Friday afternoon, December 15, Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. The purpose of the Act is to eliminate unnecessary regulation of commodity futures exchanges and other entities falling within the coverage of the Commodities Exchange Act (''CEA'') and the provide legal certainty with regard to certain futures and derivatives transactions. By enacting such changes, Congress intends to promote product innovation and to enhance the competitive position of US financial markets. Certain provisions of the Act open the door for Enron's further product innovation and growth. Specifically, the Act provides important legal certainty for energy and other transactions occuring both on an over-the-counter (OTC) bilateral basis and on multilateral electronic trading platforms. Enron was a leading advocate of passage of this legislation.
 Bilateral Transactions 
 Under the Act, bilateral transactions in all commodities (other than agriculture commodities) that do not occur on trading facility (i.e. not on a multi-party exchange) are exempt from most provisions of the CEA as long as the transactions are entered solely between ''eligible contract participants''(i.e. persons and certain legal entities satisfying capital thresholds and other requirements under the Act). This provision essentially codifies and expands existing CFTC exemptions for swaps and forward contracts, thereby eliminating a degree of legal ambiguity that has frustrated product innovation and growth. 
 Multilateral Transactions 
 In addition, the Act creates a broad exemption for any agreement, contract or transaction in commodities (other than agriculture commodities) so long as they the transactions are between ''eligible commercial participants'', are entered into on a ''principle-to-principle basis'' and that take place on a multi-party ''electronic facility''. This exemption could facilitate expansion of EnronOnline to allow for multi-party transactions, however certain legal requirements will have to be met.
 Other Transactions 
 The Act also creates a broad exclusion for a number of commodities that are of interest to Enron, including ''credit risk measure'' commodities and weather derivatives . Again, the derivative transaction exclusion will have to meet certain legal thresholds.
 This legislation has been over six years in the making and the collective support of many Enron employees has been crucial. Thank you to all that have contributed to the passage on this important legislation. We will have a more through legal summary of this legislation in the near future.
 Jan. 8, 2001: Looking Ahead
 With the Clinton administration almost over, and George W. Bush preparing to take office, Enron -- with the help of Mr. Gramm and his wife, an Enron board member -- seeks to continue to influence the regulatory process, including helping to select the new chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. (Ultimately, James E. Newsome held the post through 2004.)

 As the Bush transition moves forward, we need to monitor (or perhaps try to influence) the selection of the new CFTC Chair/Commissioners. 
 As noted below, Jim Newsome has been selected as Acting Chair. I mentioned this to Ken Raisler and Stacy Carey. Everyone agrees that Newsome is a known quantity, though he may not be a superstar in the mold of Bill Ranier. Ken said Newsome knows our issues and is favorable to a ''free market'' approach to energy and metals. However, there is some concern about his ability to reign in the CFTC staff. Newsome is the favorite currently for the position with boosters in Senators Lott and Cochran and his college roommate Rep. Jerry Moran (R-KS). However, it is still early in the game and unknown Chair candidates could still be out there (including officials passed over for more high profile positions).
 If Newsome is nominated as the Chair, an additional Commissioner (a Republican) position opens and will be named by Speaker Denny Hastert. Hastert is from the suburbs and the assumption is that he the Chicago exchanges may influence the appointment. Stacy Carey is poking around to determine what Chicago exchanges are thinking. One name that has been mentioned often is retired Congressman Tom Ewing who has expressed interest in a Commission seat, but not the Chair (Ewing is supportive of our issues).
 David Spears is also likely to leave, but no date has been announced. This is also a Republican seat. The Democrats Barbara Holum and Tom Erickson are likely to stick around until their terms expire.
 We can try to float names of persons we would like to see either Chair or join the Commission. Also, we have learned that Wendy Gramm has list of names she may be shopping around for CFTC and SEC -- it would be good the see who Gramm is proposing.
 Please advise how you want to proceed in either reviewing or suggesting the appointees.
 Thanks - Chris 
 Feb. 14, 2001: Seeking a 'Free-Market Person'
 Wendy Gramm, while on the Enron board, seeks to help officials at Enron, including Steven J. Kean, the company's chief of staff, influence the process of restructuring the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which she ran in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when George H. W. Bush was president. Enron proves unable to get Mr. Newsome, the acting chairman, replaced. But in later e-mail messages, once it becomes clear Mr. Newsome will stay in his post, they invite him to visit Enron's headquarters. The exchange shows how both Mr. Gramm and his wife continued to be involved in C.F.T.C. business until Mr. Gramm left office.

 Folks love Newsome, and I think he's very nice and appears to be very free market. Spears, the other Republican appointee is not at all free market, in my view. I would not like this to mentioned anywhere else, but I have found that the farm reps on the Commission may sound deregulatory but are not, and have been really troublesome without a good free market person on board. And there are no truly free market persons on board at the Commission (every single other agricultural rep that I worked with on the Commission were trouble, even though they claimed to be deregulatory -- and they were far worse before I got there and after I left.)
 I visited with Newsome a day before Inauguration, and I was appalled at what they were planning to do concerning agency structure -- that would have elevated the regulatory lawyers and diminished the role of the economists at the agency. Misguided and showed to me a lack of understanding of how organizational structures can affect what comes out of an agency. 
 I am often at odds with ''the industry view'' regarding CFTC issues. I don't think the futures exchanges, who have a lot of power, necessarily are pro-competition; and many of the non-exchange folks who lobby on CFTC issues are Washington or New York (Democrat - which is why they want to involve Ken at this level) lawyers who do not understand markets and who are more interested in being able to claim influence or impact. The CFTC is in awful shape -- the quality of staff is horrendous, and the Commission is relying on some of the worst people for their policy work (same folks that Brooksley Born used, same folks who have advocated more regulation of the OTC market for years). Many quality folks do not want the job as Chairman because it's been such a backwater. I am looking for some good folks. Have at least one person who would be good at that job. And it's not Newsome. Please do not share this information with the usual folks, as they hate me anyway (I'm too free market and have argued against their ''fixes''). Sorry for this scathing review, but this is an important appointment. 
 Wendy

HEADLINE: Seeking Aid, Automakers Have a Friend in the U.A.W.

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC and NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
When Ron Gettelfinger, president of the United Automobile Workers union, appears this week at Congressional hearings to help make the case for the Detroit automakers getting emergency federal aid, he wants lawmakers to know what he believes is at stake.
 ''It wouldn't be just one company failing here,'' Mr. Gettelfinger said in an interview. ''It would be all three going down.'' 
 He might as well add the U.A.W.
 The union's membership at General Motors, Ford Motor Company and Chrysler has been nearly halved to 139,000 workers in the past three years, and it continues to shrink with every new plant closing.
 When he and the leaders of Detroit's Big Three speak at their scheduled hearing, Mr. Gettelfinger is likely to deliver the bleakest warning. A bankruptcy by any of the three companies in Detroit, Mr. Gettelfinger fears, would wipe out the rest of them.
 ''It's not just G.M. going bankrupt,'' he said. ''It's all the rest of the industry that goes with it. Two of the three companies would go under, and there's a high probability all three would go.''
 Perhaps it is no surprise that Mr. Gettelfinger would be a passionate advocate for saving union jobs and funneling $25 billion in federal loans to the beleaguered automakers.
 But Mr. Gettelfinger was briefed on G.M.'s dismal financial condition before its earnings were announced on Nov. 7, according to two people familiar with the meeting, part of a presentation to win his support for a potential merger of G.M. and Chrysler.
 He saw first-hand that G.M., as well as Chrysler, cannot last long at the rate they are losing sales and revenue in a market that is down 14.6 percent from 2007. 
 Robert L. Nardelli, the chairman of Chrysler, and Rick Wagoner, chairman of G.M., have said they need federal help. (They broke off talks of a merger because of the rapidly deteriorating state of the industry.)
 ''At this juncture, we are in a crisis,'' Mr. Gettelfinger said. ''It's not a matter of how we got here. When you have sales this low, this industry cannot survive.'' 
 A carmaker's bankruptcy would abrogate workers' contracts, and probably lead to sharply reduced wages and benefits for any jobs that remain. 
 ''The future of the U.A.W. will be determined over the next two weeks,'' said Gary N. Chaison, a professor of labor relations at Clark University. ''If G.M. goes bankrupt or doesn't get a bailout, it's just going to be a shadow of what it was 50 years ago.''
 Mr. Gettelfinger, who is 64, wields new political clout in the debate this week in Congress over how to help Detroit survive the worst vehicle market in 15 years.
 The U.A.W. was instrumental in the pivotal victories in Michigan and Ohio by Barack Obama in the presidential election, and two union loyalists in Michigan, Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm and former Representative David E. Bonior, are members of Mr. Obama's economic advisory team.
 For all its political heft, however, Detroit's labor costs and union contracts will more than likely come under attack in House and Senate hearings.
 Mr. Gettelfinger expects the union to be labeled part of Detroit's problems, and to defend its $27-an-hour wages and top-of-the-line health care benefits and pensions.
 But he won't back down on his prediction of what failure of the Detroit auto industry will mean to the rest of America.
 ''For every 2,500 cars that the Big Three sells in this country, they employ 78 American workers,'' he said. ''There is a reason here for us to keep this industry in this country.''
 The profound financial problems at G.M. and Ford were laid bare in their huge third-quarter losses and disclosure that their cash cushions were shrinking by more than $2 billion a month at each company. Chrysler, a private company, does not disclose its financial performances.
 Mr. Gettelfinger rejects talk that the U.A.W. will need to make major concessions for Detroit to win aid. The union, he said, has already agreed to job reductions of more than 100,000 workers since 2006, taking over its retiree health care through company-funded trusts, and opening the door to lower wages for new workers at G.M., Ford and Chrysler.
 Still, the U.A.W. could be pressured to bend on union rules that provide workers with 95 percent of their wages while on layoff and other job-security provisions.
 ''The union would have a difficult time justifying benefits for retirees and guaranteed pay during layoffs when those aren't enjoyed by many workers in the present recession,'' said Mr. Chaison.
 Auto workers acknowledge fear that the industry might walk away empty-handed from Congress. G.M., for one, has said that it will run out of sufficient cash to run its business by the end of the year without government assistance.
 ''That would be catastrophic for a lot of families,'' said Scott Owens, a second-generation G.M. worker at the company's car plant in Orion Township, Mich. ''This is pretty scary.''
 Mr. Gettelfinger had been largely silent on the Big Three's troubles until blitzing the national cable shows and other news media this past weekend. But he has been meeting nonstop with Michigan Democrats and other legislators sympathetic to the union's interests, according to associates.
 He deflects questions about what conditions should be placed on any federal loans, or whether management at G.M., Ford and Chrysler should be replaced.
 ''I recognize that Congress should put stipulations on this and they should,'' he said. ''But there's a big difference between a low-interest loan and a bailout.''
 Mr. Gettelfinger, who started in the auto industry in 1964 on a Ford assembly line in Louisville, Ky., will need a thick skin at the hearings, said financier Wilbur Ross, who has interests in auto-parts firms dependent on Detroit.
 ''I think for a lot of the Republican senators, this gives them a chance to give the union payback for the election,'' he said.
 President of the union since 2002, Mr. Gettelfinger is determined to put the debate above politics and focus on the broader economic crisis.
 ''We have great respect for our government, we believe in our government, and we need our government,'' he said. ''We've got the case. The question is, can we make it?''

HEADLINE: You Know We All Love You, Professor. Now Get Out of Here.

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN

 BODY:
GONE TOMORROW
 By P. F. Kluge
 286 pp. The Overlook Press. $25.95. 
 ''You're an inspiration to all of us, really!'' These words are addressed to Prof. George Canaris in a letter from the provost at the small Ohio college where Canaris, a novelist, has long been a fixture in the English department. Since Canaris has been keenly observing college manners during his long tenure (the platitudes have as much backbone as ''jellyfish in an X-ray machine'') he knows the dangers of chirpy euphemisms. The young provost intends to show him the door.
 Sure enough, the college has come to a decision: Its faculty would be greatly enhanced by hiring a writer regarded as ''the king of the door-stoppers, a generational icon, a rock-star.'' (''Oh, God, not David Eggers or David Foster Wallace!'' Canaris silently pleads.) And the way to give this newcomer the English department's prestigious Stribling chair is to kick Canaris out of it. Once this is announced, Canaris will be free to spend his lame-duck year both teaching and traveling, being blandly honored on an involuntary farewell tour. 
 ''I've read your books,'' the celebrity author says when he arrives on campus. ''Great.'' 
 ''I've lifted yours,'' Canaris replies. ''Heavy.''
 What a comeuppance. Canaris was himself a hot commodity when the college recruited him in 1970, installing him at some other professor's expense. ''You wrote a couple good books that people still read of their own free will,'' a faculty friend marvels. One was supposedly the Hollywood novel. Another, called ''Here, Today,'' gives ''Gone Tomorrow'' its name.
 But in ''Gone Tomorrow,'' a sharply observed yet tender novel of academic life and its many sand traps, P. F. Kluge (himself a writer in residence at Kenyon College, which is the subject of his nonfiction book ''Alma Mater'') uses the persona of Canaris to describe the dangers that a writer-teacher faces. Even that job description defies reason. Why is it that ''in the same way that people assume an opera singer can handle folk music or a four-star chef can preside over a short-order grill, it is assumed that a writer can teach writing''? The first and perhaps greatest danger about which ''Gone Tomorrow'' warns is that of getting too comfortable inside a college's cozy microcosm. ''You may like it,'' an older teacher warns the newly arrived Canaris about life in a rural liberal-arts cocoon. ''You may love it. But the world won't know you and you won't recognize yourself. And you will not have done whatever you came here to do.'' 
 As a man with a reputation for unfulfilled potential, Canaris has a bad case of ''the college ate my masterpiece.'' For decades he has been putatively at work on a great book. Had he written a page a day during each 250-day work year, he would have 7,500 pages, according to someone who does him no favor by doing the math. But what has he actually produced? 
 ''Gone Tomorrow'' is introduced by one of Canaris's colleagues and structured as a posthumous inquiry into what ''The Beast,'' as Canaris called his functionally invisible book, actually was. More broadly, it contrasts transience and permanence in life, love and literature. And Mr. Kluge does not allow his book's many references to famous fiction to overpower Canaris's quirky, tart yet unexpectedly generous story. 
 Sure, he yearned for literary greatness and tried to attain it. But at 68 he also found himself revisiting his life's other milestones, including marriage to a woman who appeared quite unexpectedly in mid-nowhere. ''That chair of mine -- an old, soft thing I'd bought at a yard sale -- had been waiting all its life for her,'' he recalls.
 As for the Beast, Canaris knows that the world of letters is littered with ''works of a lifetime with the span of a mayfly.'' (Ralph Ellison's ''Juneteenth'' and Harold Brodkey's ''Party of Animals'' come to his mind.) And besides, the Beast is like one of Hitchcock's MacGuffins. 
 ''Gone Tomorrow'' ostensibly revolves around this magnum opus, but it hardly matters what Canaris has been squirreling away; that appears to be Mr. Kluge's point. Canaris also left behind a much more casual manuscript about his wistful, contentious final year as a professor. That's what ''Gone Tomorrow'' turns out to be. 
 As any good English professor would, Canaris loathes bad grammar. The student who writes ''walking to the fields, it started raining'' drives him wild, and Canaris reserves particular scorn for those who can't keep their apostrophes straight. He also takes a shot at the grade inflation meant to keep students happy, so that nowadays a B-minus is indeed faint praise. 
 On that basis the copy editing of ''Gone Tomorrow'' rates a B-minus at best, and it's messy in ways that must be particularly galling to a teacher. This book includes a sentence that has three quotation marks -- not three sets, just three. The phrase ''sound's good'' does not refer to acoustics. And this cannot be Mr. Kluge's fault, because the list of his other works cites ''Final Evan'' instead of ''Final Exam.'' Nobody misspells the titles of his own books.
 Finally, in a turn that might have tickled Canaris had he lived to see it, ''Gone Tomorrow'' is a good title. Too good. Mr. Kluge's ''Gone Tomorrow'' is already being outsold on Amazon.com by Lee Child's ''Gone Tomorrow,'' a Jack Reacher thriller that doesn't come out until May. Should any of Mr. Child's devotees order the wrong novel by mistake, they'll still get a book about a sharp-eyed, solitary troublemaker. They probably won't be sorry.

From the Valley
 Comes a Warning
 Maybe it was the tombstone that did it. Even as Wall Street burned, Silicon Valley seemed strangely sanguine. Then a PowerPoint presentation from Sequoia Capital prophesying Armageddon -- featuring an ''R.I.P. Good Times'' headstone -- made the rounds. A month later, venture capital firms are slashing investments and counseling portfolio companies to cut jobs. Sequoia's warning may reflect the technology industry's woes, but it's more notable for what it says about venture capital. 
 Maybe it's because venture capital's traditional gravy train -- initial public offerings of fast-growing start-ups -- had slowed. That, coupled with the severity of the 2000 dot-com crash, gave the industry a false sense of immunity to financial hard times. 
 Then came the Sequoia document. The firm -- which had financed Apple, Google and Yahoo -- showed its portfolio companies a presentation on why this financial crisis could be the worst yet and advised survival tactics like layoffs. 
 The presentation burned across Silicon Valley like wildfire. When one of the most successful firms moves in a club known for herdlike behavior, everyone takes notice. Other investors, like Benchmark Capital, advised their companies to conserve cash. Layoffs began en masse. 
 Sequoia-backed LinkedIn and Zappos both chopped their staffs, as have big public companies like Yahoo and Sun Microsystems. Since the Sequoia presentation in October, there have been nearly 50,000 layoffs in the technology sector, according to a running counter on the blog TechCrunch.
 Sequoia's viral hit underscores the precariousness of the venture capital business. Venture-backed exits have fallen 54 percent so far this year. And with the I.P.O. market shut, that has left mergers and acquisitions as the primary value driver. Yet with financing near impossible, even the historical safety of being swallowed by a Cisco or Google has disappeared.
 Like Wall Street banks, hedge funds and private equity, the venture capital industry got too fat. Firms currently manage $260 billion, according to the National Venture Capital Association, 14 percent more than during the bubble, and the industry now raises more money than it creates. A shakeout was inevitable. It's just odd that it took Sequoia's PowerPoint to get it under way.
 A Pension Portfolio 
 No wonder private equity, hedge fund and venture capital fund managers are biting their fingernails. As the stock market holdings of some of their big pension fund investors have plunged, the proportion that these so-called alternative investments comprise as a portion of their overall portfolios has ballooned. That's a problem.
 Take the California Public Employees' Retirement System -- the biggest pension fund. Calpers, which will discuss its asset allocation at an investment meeting on Monday, had its portfolio thrown out of whack by the global equity mess. The fund aims to have about 56 percent of its $200 billion in equities, and 9.5 percent in alternative investments. The rest goes to bonds, real estate, inflation-linked assets and cash. 
 But because equities slid so drastically in the past month, Calpers is now overinvested in these riskier and less liquid alternative assets. Today they account for 14 percent of the portfolio. Since private equity and venture capital firms typically collect money over several years from pension funds -- which make commitments upfront to various funds -- the weighting is likely to increase even further. 
 Calpers can hope that equity markets will rebound before it is asked to follow its capital commitments. That's no sure thing. Calpers could try to turn down future fund raisings -- but it would surely be penalized by the fund managers for doing so. It could sell other assets to cough up the cash, but that might force it to take big losses. 
 Barring any of these options, for Calpers to follow its money and realign its allocation model, it will need to pass the hat back around to the teachers and other state workers it serves -- and ask for more money. This puts the pressure further down the chain, particularly if it forces pensioners to raise their contributions. 
 In theory, asset allocation models are meant to mitigate risk through diversification. If one bucket, say equities, falls, then the fixed-income or private equity investments should offset the decline. But when markets fall more or less in tandem, the model not only fails but also puts other assets at risk of the capital needs of others. So much for theory.

HEADLINE: From the Valley Comes a Warning

BYLINE: By BREAKINGVIEWS.COM

 BODY:
 From the Valley Comes a Warning
 Maybe it was the tombstone that did it. Even as Wall Street burned, Silicon Valley seemed strangely sanguine. Then a PowerPoint presentation from Sequoia Capital prophesying Armageddon -- featuring an ''R.I.P. Good Times'' headstone -- made the rounds. A month later, venture capital firms are slashing investments and counseling portfolio companies to cut jobs. Sequoia's warning may reflect the technology industry's woes, but it's more notable for what it says about venture capital. 
 Maybe it's because venture capital's traditional gravy train -- initial public offerings of fast-growing start-ups -- had slowed. That, coupled with the severity of the 2000 dot-com crash, gave the industry a false sense of immunity to financial hard times. 
 Then came the Sequoia document. The firm -- which had financed Apple, Google and Yahoo -- showed its portfolio companies a presentation on why this financial crisis could be the worst yet and advised survival tactics like layoffs. 
 The presentation burned across Silicon Valley like wildfire. When one of the most successful firms moves in a club known for herdlike behavior, everyone takes notice. Other investors, like Benchmark Capital, advised their companies to conserve cash. Layoffs began en masse. 
 Sequoia-backed LinkedIn and Zappos both chopped their staffs, as have big public companies like Yahoo and Sun Microsystems. Since the Sequoia presentation in October, there have been nearly 50,000 layoffs in the technology sector, according to a running counter on the blog TechCrunch.
 Sequoia's viral hit underscores the precariousness of the venture capital business. Venture-backed exits have fallen 54 percent so far this year. And with the I.P.O. market shut, that has left mergers and acquisitions as the primary value driver. Yet with financing near impossible, even the historical safety of being swallowed by a Cisco or Google has disappeared.
 Like Wall Street banks, hedge funds and private equity, the venture capital industry got too fat. Firms currently manage $260 billion, according to the National Venture Capital Association, 14 percent more than during the bubble, and the industry now raises more money than it creates. A shakeout was inevitable. It's just odd that it took Sequoia's PowerPoint to get it under way.
 A Pension Portfolio 
 No wonder private equity, hedge fund and venture capital fund managers are biting their fingernails. As the stock market holdings of some of their big pension fund investors have plunged, the proportion that these so-called alternative investments comprise as a portion of their overall portfolios has ballooned. That's a problem.
 Take the California Public Employees' Retirement System -- the biggest pension fund. Calpers, which will discuss its asset allocation at an investment meeting on Monday, had its portfolio thrown out of whack by the global equity mess. The fund aims to have about 56 percent of its $200 billion in equities, and 9.5 percent in alternative investments. The rest goes to bonds, real estate, inflation-linked assets and cash. 
 But because equities slid so drastically in the past month, Calpers is now overinvested in these riskier and less liquid alternative assets. Today they account for 14 percent of the portfolio. Since private equity and venture capital firms typically collect money over several years from pension funds -- which make commitments upfront to various funds -- the weighting is likely to increase even further. 
 Calpers can hope that equity markets will rebound before it is asked to follow its capital commitments. That's no sure thing. Calpers could try to turn down future fund raisings -- but it would surely be penalized by the fund managers for doing so. It could sell other assets to cough up the cash, but that might force it to take big losses. 
 Barring any of these options, for Calpers to follow its money and realign its allocation model, it will need to pass the hat back around to the state workers it serves -- and ask for more money. This puts the pressure further down the chain, particularly if it forces pensioners to raise their contributions. 
 In theory, asset allocation models are meant to mitigate risk through diversification. If one bucket, say equities, falls, then the fixed-income or private equity investments should offset the decline. But when markets fall more or less in tandem, the model not only fails but also puts other assets at risk of the capital needs of others. So much for theory.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 4, 2008

 CORRECTION:
A brief report in the breakingviews.com column on Monday about pension portfolios erroneously included one group of employees in the California Public Employees Retirement System. The pension fund covers employees of state agencies, including the education department, but it does not include teachers.
The Breakingviews.com column on Nov. 17, about the effect of falling stock prices on the California Public Employees' Retirement System, misstated the group that might be forced to increase its contributions should the fund fall short of its capital obligations to private equity and venture capital firms. The fund's working members might have to contribute more. Its pensioners -- retirees who are collecting a pension -- do not make contributions.

HEADLINE: Use the Muscles Between Your Ears, Gym Urges

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
One of the strongest words in advertising is, well, strength. The Army, which for the last two years has proclaimed it can make you ''Army strong,'' is adding a second theme to its campaign, ''Strength like no other.'' The American International Group has ''the strength to be there'' -- or had, anyway, until the financial crisis hit. And from the hall of fame comes ''Stronger than dirt,'' for Ajax detergent.
 Making the ranks of strength marketers even stronger is Gold's Gym International, with a campaign that carries the theme ''Know your own strength.'' The idea behind the campaign -- the first from its new agency, McKinney in Durham, N.C. -- is that strength goes beyond the physical.
 The concept is intended to resonate at a time when consumers are seeking strength, internal and external, as a result of the sudden weakness displayed by once-powerful institutions like A.I.G., Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae and Washington Mutual. 
 The campaign, which began last month, is wide-ranging, including television and radio commercials, print advertisements, direct mail, outdoor ads, public relations, social media like Facebook and signs inside Gold's gyms. The budget is estimated at $35 million to $40 million, to be spent by the company and franchisees.
 The work is meant to be ''more than just an advertising campaign,'' says Lisa Zoellner, chief marketing officer at Gold's, in Dallas. ''We really see it as a new brand platform, a long-term position for us.''
 The campaign is also designed to be ''a little more contemporary,'' she adds, than the typical pitches from fitness centers that are always ''showing the gym, showing the equipment, showing the trainers.''
 The theme was developed through ''a lot of research,'' Ms. Zoellner says, which involved ''key franchisees'' as well as the corporate marketing department.
 It is ''not targeted to a specific demographic,'' she adds, but rather ''a psychographic, a mindset,'' through ''a focus on individual moments of achievement.''
 The intended audience is what Ms. Zoellner calls ''the committed,'' who are ''a little more committed in all aspects of life: family, career, community.''
 ''We see the work as being somewhat challenging,'' she adds, ''challenging people to know their strengths, find their strengths.''
 The timing of the campaign is good, Ms. Zoellner says, given what is going on the world, ''because it's good for people to be strong, not only physically but emotionally, mentally.''
 That is true ''whether it's the strength to persevere in difficult times like we're in right now,'' she adds, ''or the strength to keep up with your kids.''
 The campaign was kicked off with a newspaper ad that carried the assertive headline, ''Know this.''
 ''Your strength is different than everyone else's strength,'' the text begins, then continues: ''You don't have their strength and they don't have yours. But we are all strong in our own way. It's just that sometimes we let our strength off the hook. We let our strength sleep in or slink off to the bar.''
 ''But our strength waits for us,'' the text goes on to say. ''And prods us. That voice in your head saying, 'I know who you really are.' That is your strength. That voice says, 'Yeah, I know you. Do you know me?' ''
 Another ad carries this assertive headline: ''Know that commitment is a muscle.''
 ''Just like any muscle, it has to be worked out,'' the text begins. ''It has to be developed.''
 ''Only one gym has 43 years helping people achieve their goals,'' the text continues. ''Of coaxing what's in us, out. Do you know how strong your commitment could be?''
 That tone is echoed in the television commercials, which are scheduled to start running next month, according to Ms. Zoellner. In one spot, a woman does sit-ups as the words ''Lean, mean, bad, tight'' appear onscreen.
 As she continues exercising, the words ''Leaner, meaner, badder, tighter'' appear. The commercial ends with her still working out and the words ''Leanest, meanest, baddest, tightest'' are displayed.
 In another commercial, a man is sweating on a rowing machine as what seems to be Italian music plays on the soundtrack. On the screen, with each repetition, appear words like ''fettuccini,'' ''linguine'' and ''cannoli.''
 The radio commercials take the form of an advice columnist offering ''Tough love from Gold's Gym.'' In one spot, a woman's voice complains: ''What am I doing wrong? I've counted carbs. I've counted calories. I've counted points. Nothing works.''
 A man's voice, representing Gold's Gym, replies by asking, ''How about counting a few squats, sister?'' He counts off some and adds, ''Then you can count on looking h-o-t, hot.''
 In a second radio commercial, a man is upset because, he says, ''I've fallen off the exercise wagon.'' The voice of Gold's Gym replies, ''There's only resting between sets'' and encourages the man to ''put on your big-boy pants and let's go.'' 
 The approach of the campaign, says Jonathan Cude, partner and chief creative officer at McKinney, taps into what he describes as ''the core'' of the Gold's Gym brand.
 ''It's always been about strength,'' Mr. Cude says, ''which can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people -- and that's good.''
 ''The people we're trying to connect with tend to be a little more committed,'' he adds, ''but that doesn't mean they're all two-hour-a-day gym-goers.''
 The campaign seeks to make the brand ''more accessible and open,'' Mr. Cude says, ''by expanding the definition of strength.''
 The hope is that potential members will think of Gold's Gym as a place ''that can help you reach any goal,'' he adds, not only a place for ''serious, hard-core'' workouts to build muscles.
 The humorous tone of some elements of the campaign -- like the radio commercials with the make-believe advice columnist -- is also designed to demonstrate that Gold's Gym does not take its mission too seriously.
 ''It's a fun category,'' Mr. Cude says of the fitness-center field, so the agency and Gold's Gym plan on ''having fun'' with the campaign.
 For instance, in addition to the radio spots there are signs in the gyms written to elicit a smile or two.
 ''Know you can wipe off the machine when you're done,'' one sign declares, then adds: ''(No really, you can.)'' 
 It certainly beats ''Be kind, rewind.''

 UPDATE: The Advertising column in The New York Times on Sept. 26 reported on a contest being sponsored by the California Milk Processor Board in which classes at three high schools in the state developed ideas for the ''Got milk?'' campaign.
 The winning class was selected last week by judges from the board and the board's advertising agency, Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, part of the Omnicom Group.
 The winning class is from the Center for Advanced Research and Technology in Clovis, whose members received $2,000 for a campaign that presented milk as exciting and unattainable -- even somewhat taboo. The runners-up each won $1,000; they are Amador Valley High School in Pleasanton and Orange High School in Orange.

HEADLINE: Nearly Evicted in Error, and Left With Nothing

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
Look around Joann Ritter's apartment in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn and you will see an entire room of hand-me-downs. Her sister gave her the bed and the portable closet; her nephew gave her the television set; the microwave oven came from a neighbor who was about to throw it out; the kitchen chairs, she found on the street. 
 ''Everybody tried to help us,'' Ms. Ritter, 52, said the other day. ''We had nothing -- or less than nothing. We were sleeping on the floor.'' 
That's because in March there was a mix-up with the city's Housing Stability Plus program, which pays her $925 monthly rent. Her landlord did not receive the check that month and took all of her belongings from the home, crated them and put them on the street, Ms. Ritter said. 
 Ms. Ritter, who is unemployed, said that she came home to find the apartment emptied of its furniture. All of her clothes were gone, as were her three children's clothes and all of their personal effects. The only things remaining were the air-conditioner and the washing machine, she said.
 For help, Ms. Ritter turned to the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The Brooklyn Bureau gave the Ritters $399, which they spent on a daybed for Ms. Ritter's son, Alvin Deas Jr., 11, and $250 for clothing for Alvin and his sisters, Al-Laysha Deas, 9, and Alicia Ritter, 24.
 ''We were wiped out at that point,'' Ms. Ritter recalled, adding that the rent mix-up was quickly resolved but that the belongings were lost for good. ''We didn't know what we were going to do.''
 It had been a painful year. A month before, in February, Ms. Ritter's mother, Francis Ritter, had died of heart failure. And Ms. Ritter, who has chronic arthritis, was still recovering from hip-replacement surgery and had lost her job at the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, she said.
 In 2005, after losing her apartment in the Van Dyke Houses near Mother Gaston Boulevard in Brooklyn, she had to go with her children to a homeless shelter for a while. 
 But she eventually managed, with the city's help, to rent the small apartment on Jefferson Street where they now live, in two sections separated by a dingy public hallway. Ms. Ritter lives in the first section with Al-Laysha, a student at Public School 145 and an avid reader of the Judy Moody books, and Alvin, a math whiz and a fan of professional wrestling who attends Intermediate School 349. Alicia, who has a job, lives down the hall in the other section, in a little nook behind a curtain near the kitchen.
 Everything now in the apartment, Ms. Ritter said, came from somewhere else. Al-Laysha's favorite books, including ''The Cat Ate My Gymsuit'' and ''Amber Brown Is Not a Crayon,'' came from a teacher at her school. Alvin's cellphone was given to him by a relative. Only the apartment's decorations -- the pennant hanging from the ceiling in honor of Al-Laysha's ninth birthday and the Hannah Montana stickers on the wall -- were purchased by the family. Ms. Ritter picked them up at a 99-cent store. 
 Still, the Ritters manage, sometimes by ignoring or imagining away their surroundings. For Al-Laysha, reading is the best way to escape.
 ''Books are funny, and some are really interesting,'' she said. ''When I'm reading, I think I'm in the story with the characters.''
 And, of course, the members of the family have each other.
 ''They didn't take our lives,'' Ms. Ritter said, ''and they didn't take our spirits. As long as we're together, it doesn't matter that we don't have much.''
 One day, she hopes for a house of her own and, with that, the permanence it will bring.
 ''That's my dream,'' Ms. Ritter said, ''a place where nobody, under no circumstances, can ever, never, ever put us out.''

HEADLINE: Facing deficits, states get out sharper knives

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Two short months ago lawmakers in California struggled to close a $15 billion hole in the state budget. It was among the biggest deficits in state history. Now the state faces an additional $11 billion shortfall and may be unable to pay its bills this spring.
 The astonishing decline in revenues is without modern precedent here, but California is hardly alone. A majority of states -- many with budgets already full of deep cuts and dependent on raiding rainy-day funds or tax increases -- are scrambling to find ways to get through the rest of the year without hacking apart vital services or raising taxes.
 Some governors, including Arnold Schwarzenegger in California and David A. Paterson in New York, have called special legislative sessions to deal with the crisis. 
 Others are demanding hiring freezes and across-the-board cuts. A few states are finding their unemployment insurance funds running dry, just as the ranks of out-of-work residents spike. 
 The plunging revenues -- the result of an unusual assemblage of personal, sales, capital gains and corporate taxes falling significantly -- have poked holes in budgets that are just weeks and months old and that came about only after difficult legislative sessions.
 ''The fiscal landscape,'' said H. D. Palmer, a spokesman for the California Department of Finance, ''is fundamentally altered from where it was six weeks ago.''
 In Michigan, to reduce overtime costs, fewer streets will be salted this winter. In Ohio, where the unemployment rate is above 7 percent, the state may need a federal loan for the first time in 26 years to cover unemployment costs. In Nevada, which is almost totally dependent on sales taxes and gambling revenues, a health administrator said the state may be unable to pay claims in a few months. 
 In California, Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, and state legislators are preparing to do battle over a proposed 1.5-cent sales tax increase, while in New York, Mr. Paterson, a Democrat, has proposed $5.2 billion worth of savings, principally cuts to Medicaid and education.
 Even states where until recent months natural resource production has provided a buffer -- and fat surpluses -- are experiencing a sudden reversal of fortunes as oil prices have declined.
 ''Frankly, I thought 2001 was really awful,'' said Scott D. Pattison, the executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers, referring to the last big economic downturn. ''It is even worse now.''
 He added, ''This fiscal year will be really bad, and what is unfortunate is that I can't see how 2010 won't be bad too.''
 In keeping with recent economic trends, the states with the worst problems are those where housing booms morphed into a large-scale mortgage crisis over the last two years. 
 The current-year budget gap in Rhode Island represents over 11 percent of the state's entire general fund, in large part because of the high number of subprime loans. The story is similar in Arizona, California, Florida and Nevada. 
 In addition, the crisis in the financial markets had immediate and widespread impact on state budgets. States have lost revenues from capital gains taxes and bonuses that have evaporated, and growing job losses have reduced state income taxes while draining unemployment funds. 
 ''What we are seeing is when fewer people are working there is less income tax and less spending,'' said Keith Dailey, a spokesman for Gov. Ted Strickland of Ohio, a Democrat.
 Americans have also stopped shopping, which has hurt states that are heavily reliant on sales taxes, like Florida and Arizona. States that rely on tourism, like Nevada and Hawaii, have also been hurt by less consumer spending.
 Further, the national credit crunch makes it harder for businesses to get loans, which trickles back into losses to states. When California was temporarily unable to gain access to the credit markets in the days leading up to the federal bailout package, state budget directors across the country noted the moment with horror. 
 The state's brief inability to pay bills because it could not get credit -- California, like many states, regularly borrows money when it is short of cash in anticipation of revenue flowing in later -- has since been largely interpreted as an outgrowth of the much larger national and international credit crisis. Still, some budget experts said the problem could be a harbinger: cities and counties with poor credit ratings could be cut off in the coming year, and there could be higher costs for issuing bonds. 
 ''Just the fact that this was an issue at all is a big concern for every state,'' Mr. Pattison said. ''Long-term bonds may be at risk. And I think states are going to have to accept that cost of debt is going to be higher.''
 In most states, budget directors and legislators have said that tax increases are not likely. A notable exception is California, where Mr. Schwarzenegger is seeking a 1.5-point increase to the state's 6.25-percent sales tax, although he is unlikely to get the necessary approval of Republican legislators. 
 In Oregon, moreover, Gov. Ted Kulongoski, a Democrat, has proposed a $1 billion economic stimulus plan centered on infrastructure improvements, which he envisions would be paid for by raising the state's gas tax by 2 cents per gallon and increasing a host of vehicle fees.
 When regular legislative sessions resume in many states in January, other states will be more likely to look to rainy-day funds, when they are available, and deeper cuts to services, most notably to K-12 education, which is generally a last-resort option among lawmakers.
 ''Most states have tried to protect K-12 and even higher ed,'' said Raymond Scheppach, the executive director of the National Governors Association, ''but I think they are both going to be on the block.''
 Many states are expected to go to a second round of earlier cuts.
 ''We've cut universities, we've cut our infrastructure spending, we've prorated schools and asked employees for concessions twice,'' said Leslee Fritz, the spokeswoman for the Michigan State Budget Office. ''All the different options out there we have already done more than once.''
 States are also looking to create large-scale infrastructure projects and other construction works as a means of stimulating the local economy. 
 The Washington governor, Christine Gregoire, a Democrat, is asking the federal government for hundreds of millions of dollars more for state and federal construction projects. 
 Ohio officials have already passed a stimulus package of $1.5 billion in bonds, to be used largely for public works, advanced and renewable energy projects, and the biomedical industry.
 ''States don't have a lot of economic stimulus tools,'' said Mr. Pattison of the budget officers' association, ''but they have infrastructure.''
 Fewer than a dozen states have remained in the black this fiscal year, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning economic research group in Washington that tracks state budgets, and they are largely those in the West with oil and mineral resources at the ready.
 ''The oil-producing states were doing very well with oil at $120 a barrel,'' said Iris Lav, the deputy director of the center. ''They may not do as well now.''
 More generally, Ms. Lav said, state budgets are ''moving from the damaged to the devastated.'' 

GRAPHIC: CHART: A STRAIN ON STATE BUDGETS: With tax revenues plummeting, at least 37 states and the District of Columbia have faced or are facing budget gaps totaling $66 billion in the 2009 fiscal year. Most states, which rely on sales, income and property taxes, are seeing a significant drop in such revenues or increases that are below the inflation rate, compared with the same period last year. Unlike the federal government, states are generally required to balance their budgets each year. (Sources: Center on Budget and Policy Priorities

HEADLINE: The Bailout's Next 60 Days

 BODY:
A month into the Bush administration's $700 billion bank bailout, the effort has become as fractured as the ad hoc rescues that it was supposed to replace. As a result, the modest easing the bailout initially brought about in the credit markets is now being reversed over doubts about the Treasury's stewardship of the plan. 
 The rates for loans between banks have begun edging up again, and consumer borrowing costs are also up -- that is, assuming consumers can find a bank willing to lend. 
 President-elect Barack Obama's transition team is reportedly planning how the new administration will better manage the bailout. But two months is a long time to wait while the Bush Treasury burns through the bailout billions, with little to show in terms of enhanced stability and even less in terms of enhanced confidence. 
 Last week Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson outlined a complex new bailout strategy intended to promote consumer borrowing. Mr. Paulson defended this latest iteration, saying he would never apologize for changing his approach as the facts change. But it is not surprising that everyone else is feeling whiplashed.
 Before the bailout even got under way in October, Mr. Paulson had to sideline his original strategy -- to buy up banks' bad assets -- because, he soon came to realize, it was too complex and indirect to deliver the swift jolt the financial markets needed. 
 He indicated that he would return to that strategy later, but to get the bailout started, he opted instead to directly invest $250 billion in the nation's banks. The about face was necessary, but it raised uncertainty about whether the Treasury really had a firm grasp of the problem -- exactly what spooked markets don't need. 
 Since then, the doubts have grown, among investors and the public. Mr. Paulson invested the taxpayers' money on terms so lenient that banks have felt free to hoard it, or to buy other banks -- while refusing to bolster lending to consumers and small businesses.
 He has diverted another $40 billion of the fund to American International Group, the reckless insurance company that had already received $85 billion in federal assistance. If government officials know where all that money is going, they haven't shared their knowledge with the public. 
 Last week Mr. Paulson disappointed investors by ditching the plan to buy up banks' bad assets. Instead, he expanded the bailout to include investing money in nonbank financial companies, like GMAC, the lending arm of General Motors, and the other carmakers' lending units. He also announced that the Treasury and the Federal Reserve were considering a plan to use taxpayer money to jump-start consumer lending via credit cards, car loans and student loans. The Fed quickly said the plan was still in early development. 
 The one approach Mr. Paulson stubbornly refuses to consider is using bailout money to help homeowners avoid foreclosure. His reasoning -- that the money is to be used to stabilize the financial system -- inexplicably ignores the fact that the instability he is seeking to quell is rooted in the housing bust. 
 Over the next two months, Mr. Paulson must impose some coherence and clarity on the bailout. Otherwise he will only fan anxieties and mistrust, which will undermine the effectiveness of his good decisions and amplify the fallout of his bad ones. With markets gyrating wildly, and the economy deteriorating rapidly, the nation needs clear leadership and a sound plan.

HEADLINE: Congress Meets for One Last Fight and to Look Ahead

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A proposed bailout of imperiled American automakers is coming under even more criticism as the departing Congress returns on Monday for a final partisan fight over the issue, while incoming lawmakers assemble for internal power struggles, leadership elections and a taste of life to come on Capitol Hill.
 Although dozens of new representatives and at least eight new senators will gather for orientation and to take part in the selection of top Democrats and Republicans for the 111th Congress, which convenes Jan. 6, members of the 110th Congress -- many of them defeated or retiring -- still have work to do this year. 
 Democrats are pushing a plan to provide $25 billion to auto manufacturers over the objections of many Republicans and President Bush, who say they favor easing some restrictions on federally subsidized loans already approved by Congress. 
 ''With the very first vote after the election, Democratic leaders in Congress want to pass a $25 billion handout to Detroit with no promises of reform, accountability or transparency by the automakers and their union base,'' said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who is in line to lead Senate Republican campaign operations.
 But Democrats say Congress must act now to protect millions of well-paying jobs spread throughout the economy that depend on a stable auto industry. They promise to impose a series of tough conditions on the money and to create an oversight board. 
 ''I would certainly hope,'' Brendan Daly, a spokesman for Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said Sunday, ''that Republicans join Democrats in recognizing the severe challenges facing the auto industry and not let any of these companies fail, which would jeopardize millions of jobs here at home and have a devastating impact on our economy.'' 
 The impasse, a fitting end for the 110th Congress given the stalemates that marked the past two years, makes it quite likely that any separate bailout for the auto industry will have to wait until after President-elect Barack Obama is sworn in on Jan. 20. The odds are also against a broader measure sought by Democrats in an effort to help the economy. The legislation with the best chance of clearing Congress this week is a 13-week extension of unemployment benefits for those who have exhausted their aid in states with high unemployment.
 In an interview on ''60 Minutes'' on CBS, Mr. Obama said that a collapse of the auto industry ''would be a disaster in this kind of environment, not just for individual families, but the repercussions across the economy would be dire.'' While Mr. Obama said he thought it was necessary to help the auto industry, he added, ''I think that it can't be a blank check.''
 ''So my hope,'' he went on, ''is that over the course of the next week, between the White House and Congress, the discussions are shaped around providing assistance, but making sure that that assistance is conditioned on labor, management, suppliers, lenders -- all the stakeholders coming together with a plan.''
 The bailout is not the only difficult question facing lawmakers after elections that expanded Democratic control of Congress. 
 Senate Democrats are set to consider whether to punish Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut independent who aligns with Democrats, for his ardent support of the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, in the presidential election. Senate Republicans are being urged from within to expel Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska from their caucus and strip him of committee posts because of his conviction on federal ethics violations.
 In the House, two senior Democrats, Representatives John D. Dingell of Michigan and Henry A. Waxman of California, are vying for the chairmanship of a health and energy committee expected to be at the crossroads of major legislation next year. Republicans, reeling from the combined loss of more than 50 seats in the last two elections, must decide whether to keep Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio in the top spot. He has drawn a challenge from Representative Dan Lundgren of California.
 The result of the election will also leave Democrats operating shorthanded. Mr. Obama, of Illinois, resigned his Senate seat as of Sunday, and Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the vice president-elect, is not expected to be voting. Those absences and others will complicate Democratic efforts to get 60 votes for the auto bailout in a vote expected on Wednesday. In the House, Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, the No. 4 Democrat, is also tending to his new duties as Mr. Obama's chief of staff. 
 Top leaders of both parties in the House and Senate are poised to retain their positions in elections set for Tuesday. Only Mr. Boehner has drawn a challenge, with Mr. Lundgren suggesting that House Republicans cannot afford to stand pat after a second debilitating round of losses.
 ''I think our party is in trouble,'' Mr. Lundgren wrote to colleagues last week. ''If we don't admit our difficulties and address them aggressively, we not only run the risk of becoming a permanent Congressional minority but we will do a disservice to our nation.'' 
 In the aftermath of stinging election losses, Republicans appear ready to take a harder line on spending, stifling the Democratic call for the aid to the automakers, which has the support of the industry as well as the United Auto Workers. 
 Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, senior Republican on the banking committee, on Sunday referred to the domestic automakers as dinosaurs that had failed to adapt. ''I don't believe the $25 billion they're talking about will make them survive,'' Mr. Shelby said on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC. ''It's just postponing the inevitable.''

CORRECTION-DATE: November 19, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about the lame-duck session of Congress misspelled the surname of a Republican congressman from California who is challenging Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio as minority leader. He is Representative Dan Lungren, not Lundgren. (His surname was also misspelled on Nov. 6 in a listing of election results, and in numerous articles dating back to 1982.)

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Senators Oppose Auto Bailout

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Top Republican senators said Sunday they will oppose a Democratic plan to bail out Detroit automakers, calling the U.S. industry a ''dinosaur'' whose ''day of reckoning'' is coming. Their opposition raises serious doubts about whether the plan will pass in this week's postelection session.
 Democratic leaders want to use $25 billion of the $700 billion financial industry bailout to help General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler. 
 Senators Richard Shelby of Alabama and Jon Kyl of Arizona said it would be a mistake to use any of the Wall Street rescue money to prop up the automakers. They said an auto bailout would only postpone the industry's demise.
 ''Companies fail every day and others take their place. I think this is a road we should not go down,'' said Mr. Shelby, the senior Republican on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.
 ''They're not building the right products,'' he said. ''They've got good workers, but I don't believe they've got good management. They don't innovate. They're a dinosaur in a sense.''
 Mr. Kyl, the Senate's second-ranking Republican, added, ''Just giving them $25 billion doesn't change anything. It just puts off for six months or so the day of reckoning.''
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, said over the weekend that the House would provide aid to the ailing industry, though she did not put a price on her plan.
 ''The House is ready to do it,'' said Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who chairs the House Financial Services Committee. ''There's no downside to trying.''
 But Democrats have only a narrow majority in the Senate, and President Bush opposes the idea. That raises the possibility that any help for automakers will have to wait until 2009, when President-elect Barack Obama takes office and the Democrats increase their majority in the Senate.
 At least two Republican senators support an automaker bailout -- George Voinovich of Ohio and Kit Bond of Missouri. 
 If the Republicans are seen as neglecting an industry that inevitably collapses, they risk lasting political problems in Midwestern industrial states that can swing for either political party. Mr. Obama won most of the manufacturing states in the presidential race, including Ohio, a perennial battleground, and Indiana, which had not voted for a Democrat for president since 1964. Mr. Obama easily won Michigan after the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain, publicly pulled out weeks before Election Day.
 Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, said automakers are working to adapt to a changing consumer market, but they need immediate help to survive the nation's current economic crisis.
 ''This is not a Big Three problem alone,'' Mr. Levin said. ''This current crisis is a crisis in the economy where there is no credit available to purchase, and where people are not buying cars because they are afraid.''
 The companies are lobbying lawmakers furiously for an emergency infusion of cash. GM has warned it might not survive through year's end without a government lifeline.
 ''It's not the General Motors we grew up with. It's a General Motors that is headed down this road to oblivion,'' said Mr. Shelby. ''Should we intervene to slow it down, knowing it's going to happen? I say no, not for the American taxpayer.''
 Mr. Obama said he believes that aid is needed but that it should be provided as part of a long-term plan for a ''sustainable U.S. auto industry,'' not simply as a blank check.
 ''For the auto industry to completely collapse would be a disaster in this kind of environment,'' Obama said in an interview on CBS's ''60 Minutes'' that is set to air Sunday night. ''So my hope is that over the course of the next week, between the White House and Congress, the discussions are shaped around providing assistance but making sure that that assistance is conditioned on labor, management, suppliers, lenders, all of the stakeholders coming together with a plan -- what does a sustainable U.S. auto industry look like?''
 Automakers say bankruptcy protection is not an option because people would be reluctant to make long-term car and truck purchases from companies that might not last the life of their vehicles. But lawmakers opposed to the bailout say Chapter 11 might be a better option than government loans, and they cite the experience of airlines that have gone through the process of reorganization.
 Messrs. Shelby and Levin were interviewed on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' and Mr. Shelby also appeared with Mr. Frank on CBS's ''Face the Nation.'' Mr. Kyl spoke on ''Fox News Sunday.''

HEADLINE: For One Production Company, It's All About the Power of Storytelling

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
''TELL to sell,'' once a mantra on Madison Avenue, is making a comeback as marketers seek to engage consumers with compelling stories rather than peddle products in hit-and-run fashion with interruptive advertising like 30-second commercials.
 A newcomer to the ranks of what are called brand storytellers, which include agencies like 42 Entertainment and Story Worldwide, is being formed by Epoch Films, a company that produces commercials for advertisers like Apple, Nike and Procter & Gamble as well as films like the quirky 2005 comedy ''Junebug.'' 
 The new company, named Dandelion, is scheduled to be introduced on Monday, when plans call for its Web site (dandelion.com) to go live. 
 Epoch is starting Dandelion by acquiring Kirt Gunn & Associates, a boutique interactive agency specializing in nontraditional campaigns for advertisers like Ford Motor, L'Oreal and P.& G. that are replete with webisodes, offbeat Web sites and viral video clips.
 In fact, the name Dandelion is intended as a better way to describe the dispersive nature of viral videos, which are so named because marketers want consumers to spread them around.
 ''None of us were fans of the notion of content or ideas being 'viral,' '' said Kirt Gunn, who has been president at Gunn and will be a managing partner at Dandelion, because ''the metaphor of a virus is inherently unpleasant.''
 ''We did, however, want to capture the notion that powerful ideas do self-propagate when the audience is connected by digital technology,'' he added. Another benefit of Dandelion, Mr. Gunn said, is that it conveys ''the constant reinvention'' inherent in interactivity in that ''whether it's blogging, content creation or social media, there will always be new dandelions on the lawn.''
 Dandelion will be half owned by Epoch and half by Mr. Gunn; the financial terms are not being disclosed. Dandelion will start with 14 employees in New York and Los Angeles and plans are being made for a presence in London.
 Epoch, founded in 1989, has about 25 employees in offices in New York, Los Angeles and London along with a roster of directors who work with the company to make commercials and movies.
 Among them are Matt Aselton, who directed ''Gigantic,'' a film to be released in 2009, and a series of spots for the Old Spice line of grooming products sold by Procter & Gamble; Phil Morrison, who directed ''Junebug'' and the popular series of ''Get a Mac'' spots for Apple; and Jeff Preiss, a partner at Epoch who directed commercials for Monster.com and Nike. 
 Epoch's directors can ''get the selling points across in a fun, interesting way,'' said Mark Fitzloff, executive creative director at Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore., who worked with Mr. Aselton on Old Spice.
 The directors are ''super-collaborative,'' he added, ''and you wouldn't flinch about bringing them into the 'pre-pro' meetings with your client, which is worth its weight in gold.'' The reference was to the preproduction process that takes place after a commercial is approved and before filming.
 Dandelion will let Epoch ''go much deeper than what we offer as a production company,'' said Mindy Goldberg, president and co-owner at Epoch, who will be a managing partner at Dandelion. ''We were seeing the market in the last few years moving more and more toward branded-content creation,'' she said, ''a model very different from representing a roster of directors and selling them to agencies to execute ideas.'' 
 By contrast, Dandelion will follow ''an A-to-Z model,'' Ms. Goldberg said, ''collaborating with the ad agencies to come up with ideas, create the Web sites, the social networking, and tracking it all.''
 To help accomplish that, Dandelion is signing writers for projects that will integrate brands into the plot lines of stories. Ed Herbstman, who has written for Sacha Baron Cohen's ''Da Ali G Show,'' will be the head writer.
 Among the other writers are Eric Gilliland, of sitcoms like ''My Boys,'' ''Roseanne'' and ''That '70s Show''; Scott Sherman of The Onion and the parody ''The Dangerous Book for Dogs''; and Charlie Todd, the creator of a roving band of pranksters, Improv Everywhere, perhaps best known for the annual ''No Pants'' ride on the New York City subway.
 Some projects from Mr. Gunn and his company have been just as unconventional. For a line of ThermaCare products from Procter, which treat women with menstrual pain, Gunn developed two Web sites, video clips and a fake documentary. They all pretend to be the life's work of an imaginary institute that studies the make-believe problem of ''cyclical nonuterine dysmenorrhea'' -- i.e., men with cramps.
 ''Kirt got my attention because he was one of the pioneers of storytelling on the Web,'' said Ty Montague, co-president and chief creative officer at JWT North America in New York, part of the JWT unit of the WPP Group.
 ''Storytelling is more important than mere entertainment,'' said Mr. Montague, who is collaborating with Mr. Gunn on a project to be announced later. ''It's fundamental to what we do.''
 Selling by telling also has benefits in an economic downturn, to hear the executives of Dandelion tell it.
 ''We're in a time when brands have to be more efficient with money,'' Mr. Gunn said, ''and more considerate of people's time.''
 That means marketers telling sponsored stories must be more careful not to breach the fine line between content and commercialism, he added, because ''if we just stick products into content, that has the same feeling to consumers as driving down the road and seeing a billboard.''
 Other Dandelion executives will include Jerry Solomon, managing director, who is also a partner at Epoch with Ms. Goldberg and Mr. Preiss; Tara Averill and Mal Ward, who will share the sales and development duties; Greg Lofaro, director for design and technology; and Greg Schultz, executive producer.

HEADLINE: A Studio, a Star, A Fateful Bet

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES and MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: SANTA MONICA, Calif. 

 BODY:
If there was a nervous moment at Friday night's showing here of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's new James Bond movie, ''Quantum of Solace,'' it came with a trailer for the studio's next big bet: ''Valkyrie,'' in which Tom Cruise plays a German officer who tried to kill Hitler.
 The audience watched. Mr. Cruise loomed in all his uniformed glory as Col. Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg. 
 And the appearance passed without a single hoot or holler. 
 It was not a bad start for a movie that has become unusually tangled in the fortunes of both its star and the company that made it.
 ''Valkyrie,'' directed by Bryan Singer, with an original script by Christopher McQuarrie, was conceived about 20 months ago as a dramatic showcase for Mr. Cruise. It was also a high-profile effort to kick-start United Artists, the MGM unit of which he and his producing partner, Paula Wagner, had become part owners. 
 But Ms. Wagner has since resigned under pressure as United Artists' chief executive, while Mr. Cruise has cut back his involvement in the studio, which was never as day-to-day as Ms. Wagner's, and turned his attention to rebuilding his acting career. 
 The movie, meanwhile, bounced from one intended release date to another, finally landing on Dec. 26, among a clutch of Oscar contenders and expensive Christmastime competitors, including ''Yes Man,'' with Jim Carrey, and ''The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,'' with Brad Pitt.
 Along the way, ''Valkyrie'' has turned into a test not only of Mr. Cruise's career durability, but of MGM's determination -- with new ownership, and under the chairmanship of Harry E. Sloan since 2005 -- to be taken seriously as a producer and distributor of the kind of risky event films that define a major studio. 
 If ''Valkyrie'' succeeds, even moderately, MGM wins a modicum of credibility in image-is-everything Hollywood. A failure brings fresh sniping that the studio does not know what it is doing, making the job of attracting top-notch talent even harder. 
 Financially speaking, the stakes are considerable. With a stated production budget of $75 million -- competitors insist it is closer to $90 million -- ''Valkyrie'' is the most expensive film made for distribution by MGM under Mr. Sloan's watch. The studio will now spend about $60 million to market the movie -- if nothing else, to make the point that it can play in the big leagues. 
 (''Quantum of Solace'' was much more costly. But it was co-financed and co-distributed by Sony Pictures Entertainment. The movie sold $70.4 million worth of tickets in North America in its first three days of release, the biggest opening ever for a James Bond film.)
 ''Valkyrie'' will also test the mettle of a 46-year-old Mr. Cruise: If it fails, his status as a superstar, damaged by a rough parting with Paramount Pictures in 2006, slips another notch. And this time United Artists -- clipped by a Cruise flop last year in ''Lions for Lambs'' -- slips with it.
 Mr. Cruise has become one of Hollywood's more puzzling assets. He is still pursued for projects and has enormous cachet: Few stars have reliably drawn the kind of audience he attracted even to ''Mission: Impossible III,'' which took in nearly $400 million in theaters worldwide in 2006. 
 Yet he has been a magnet for negativity, fed in part by hostility to his association with Scientology, and in Hollywood perhaps more by the delay in ''Valkyrie's'' release and his two-year absence from the screen, other than relatively modest roles in ''Lions for Lambs'' and last summer's ''Tropic Thunder.''
 And just as Hollywood will scrutinize the outcome of ''Valkyrie,'' so will the potential investors MGM has been aggressively courting, to no avail. After Ms. Wagner's ouster five months ago, Mr. Sloan stepped up his hunt for a new $650 million production fund to bankroll his new motion picture team's ambitious slate of films, including two installments of ''The Hobbit'' and the next James Bond film, of which MGM has sole custody. ''There's no doubt that we're going to get the money,'' he said at the time.
 But that hunt is over, according to two bankers with knowledge of the matter, in part because of the global economic crisis, but also because of MGM's already staggering $3.7 billion debt load. Options remain -- taking out loans against expected revenue from ''Quantum of Solace'' and ''Pink Panther 2,'' due next year, or dipping into its own cash reserves -- but those are unfavorable.
 Mr. Sloan and other MGM executives declined to be interviewed, as did Mr. Cruise.
 Jeff Pryor, the company's chief spokesman, sent a 1,000-word e-mail message proclaiming the studio's finances as robust. ''MGM is not having financial problems,'' Mr. Pryor wrote. Among his phrases: ''MGM is not planning any large-scale financial cutbacks or employee layoffs''; ''the studio has no short or midterm liquidity issues''; ''MGM is not for sale''; ''MGM has extremely solvent shareholders.''
 By various accounts, Mr. Cruise has scaled down his involvement with United Artists since Ms. Wagner resigned in August -- perhaps signaling that stardom and studio management do not mix.
 Both continue to own a stake in the company, and Mr. Cruise maintains an office in MGM's Century City high-rise. But Ms. Wagner now produces films on her own. Mr. Cruise meanwhile has focused on plans to star in a movie for another company. Mary Parent, chairwoman of MGM's motion picture group, has largely taken charge of United Artists, although the unit continues to employ its own marketers and chief operating officer.
 A leading candidate for Mr. Cruise's next film is ''The Tourist,'' an action-thriller financed by Spyglass Entertainment Holdings. Tentatively set for production in the spring, its script is being rewritten by Mr. McQuarrie -- who originated the ''Valkyrie'' project -- at the insistence of Mr. Cruise.
 If that points to Mr. Cruise's continued faith in ''Valkyrie,'' he is not alone. Speaking on condition of anonymity to minimize conflict, more than a dozen people involved with ''Valkyrie'' and MGM described a campaign in which the studio and its allies for months have been quietly fighting to change the public perception of a film they believe was unfairly tainted by knee-jerk hostility toward the casting of Mr. Cruise as a German war hero. 
 Insiders believe the company has corrected early blunders, successfully repositioning the film as a character-driven suspense thriller. The mood inside MGM is not exactly euphoric on the release, but is hardly foreboding. ''Let's face it, there was a time when the movie wasn't on track; it is now,'' said one person with knowledge of the situation, but who asked for anonymity for fear of angering Mr. Cruise.
 To some extent, saving the movie has meant soft-pedaling the star. Billboards that blossomed around Los Angeles last week flank a barely recognizable figure of Mr. Cruise with five fellow actors and three slogans. The last of them, notably group-oriented, reads: ''The conspiracy begins this December.''
 Online promotions now feature Mr. Singer, who directed ''The Usual Suspects'' and ''X-Men.'' Images of Mr. Cruise with an eye patch -- widely ridiculed when they surfaced as the movie was being shot -- have yielded to battle scenes in new trailers. The shift, in fact, had long been planned, but was delayed until Mr. Singer, who filmed most of the movie in Germany, finished action sequences in the Southern California desert in June.
 This month, Mr. Cruise put in a surprise appearance at an Amazon.com employees' town hall meeting in Seattle. After a 10-minute onstage interview, he announced a free screening of ''Valkyrie'' for employees: The star is clearly still using his muscle for United Artists, particularly where the film is involved. 
 In an especially delicate maneuver, ''Valkyrie'' will open with no Oscar campaign, though it arrives at the height of Hollywood's awards season, and is not without credentials: Mr. McQuarrie is a past winner (for writing ''The Usual Suspects''), and Mr. Cruise has been nominated three times as an actor (for ''Magnolia,'' ''Jerry Maguire'' and ''Born on the Fourth of July'').
 MGM instead is banking on audience appeal. Yet it will have to scrape for prime theaters in a holiday week in which Mr. Pitt, Mr. Carrey, Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston, Clint Eastwood and Will Smith will compete for attention among at least a dozen major films set for late December. 
 MGM raised eyebrows in August when it plunked ''Valkyrie'' into such a competitive slot. Insiders say the decision was made mostly because of the large adult audience available to see films in the two-week holiday period.
 While Hollywood and the media obsess over ''Valkyrie,'' the studio's production executives have shifted their focus to the pipeline. A remake of ''Fame'' is in preparation along with ''Cabin in the Woods,'' billed as a twist on the horror thriller. The studio is also keen on a talking animal picture titled ''Zookeeper'' and has remakes of ''Robocop'' and ''Poltergeist'' in the works.

HEADLINE: George W. Hoover?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM KRISTOL. 
Paul Krugman is off today.

 BODY:
Last week, assembled at Miami's InterContinental Hotel for a meeting of the Republican Governors Association, the governors seemed cheerful. The G.O.P. had lost only one statehouse on Election Day. The prospects for a Republican pickup in Virginia in 2009 were decent, and good candidates were plotting runs in states like California, Pennsylvania and Ohio in 2010.
There was even a sense of liberation in the air. For the last 14 years, there has been either a Republican Congress or a Republican White House, or sometimes both. Now the Republican governors are free of those heavy taps on the shoulder from their ''betters'' in Washington. So for these governors, this seems a moment of opportunity, in which their policies, their examples and their successes can help shape the future of the G.O.P. 
The governors will be important. But there was an almost-never-mentioned elephant in the Versailles Ballroom (yes, that's its name) full of Republicans: George W. Bush. For the hard fact is this: The worst financial crisis in almost 80 years has happened on his watch. The Bush administration will leave behind probably the most severe recession in at least a quarter-century. Fairly or unfairly, this will be viewed as George Bush's economic meltdown.
If Republicans and conservatives don't come to grips with what's happened -- and can't develop an economic agenda moving forward that seems to incorporate lessons learned from what's happened -- then they could be back, politically, in 1933.
From 1933 to 1980, Republicans repeatedly failed to convince the country they were no longer the party of Herbert Hoover -- the party, as it was perceived, of economic incompetence, austerity and recession (if not depression).
Only two Republicans won presidential elections in that half-century, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard M. Nixon. Both were able to take the White House only because we were mired down in difficult wars, in Korea and Vietnam. And Ike and Nixon were unable -- they didn't really try -- to change the generally liberal course of domestic and economic policy. The G.O.P.'s fate on Capitol Hill was worse. The party controlled Congress for only 4 of those 47 years.
That's what happens when a depression begins on your watch and when you can't offer a coherent explanation of how and why it occurred and what you are going to do differently. That's what happens when instead of having such an explanation, you spend decades in quarrels between pragmatic but unimaginative moderates who seek to be better tax collectors for the liberal welfare state, and principled but fanciful conservatives who hope for a wholesale rejection of that welfare state. And the fact that there were many successful Republican governors in those years didn't much change the party's status nationally.
Then there was a real moment of economic rethinking in the 1970s. Supply-side economics challenged demand-side Keynesians and austerity-minded conservatives by putting growth, entrepreneurship and incentives at the center of economic policy. Supply-side economics gave Ronald Reagan's G.O.P. a new and different economic agenda in 1980, and Republicans were able to become a governing party.
Republicans and conservatives today face a similar challenge to that of 1976. A hawkish foreign policy, social conservatism and middle-American populism aren't the problems. Those elements, as embodied on the Republican ticket by John McCain and Sarah Palin, produced a respectable 46 percent of the national vote -- in the midst of an economic meltdown, with the Bush administration flailing and House Republicans rebelling and the Republican ticket lacking any coherent economic message.
I don't pretend to know just what has to be done. But I suspect that free-marketers need to be less doctrinaire and less simple-mindedly utility-maximizing, and that they should depend less on abstract econometric models. I think they'll have to take much more seriously the task of thinking through what are the right rules of the road for both the private and public sectors. They'll have to figure out what institutional barriers and what monetary, fiscal and legal guardrails are needed for the accountability, transparency and responsibility that allow free markets to work.
And I don't see why conservatives ought to defend a system that permits securitizing mortgages (or car loans) in a way that seems to make the lenders almost unaccountable for the risk while spreading it, toxically, everywhere else. I don't see why a commitment to free markets requires permitting banks or bank-like institutions to leverage their assets at 30 to 1. There's nothing conservative about letting free markets degenerate into something close to Karl Marx's vision of an atomizing, irresponsible and self-devouring capitalism.
If conservatives do some difficult re-thinking in the field of political economy, they can come back. If they don't -- well, there were a lot of admirable conservative thinkers and writers, professors and novelists, from 1933 to 1980. But conservatives didn't govern.

HEADLINE: Those Lazy, Hazy Days Of Presidential Transition

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
As President-elect Barack Obama rushes from secret job interviews with onetime rivals in the Democratic primary season to briefings on the financial crisis, to discussions of saving the American auto industry, the postelection period may feel frenetic.
 But soon he and his transition team may look back on this phase as luxuriantly languid, a fleeting chance for ''deliberate haste,'' as Mr. Obama has characterized the pace of his cabinet selection process. Later it will be all haste. 
 This fall his running mate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., warned that the incoming president would be tested within six months by an international crisis. But history shows the rush of trouble does not wait for months, or sometimes even hours. 
 Time for a Message
 Day 1 largely permits new presidents to set the tone of their choosing. That was when Franklin D. Roosevelt declared, ''The only thing we have to fear is fear itself;'' John F. Kennedy exhorted Americans to ''ask not what your country can do for you;'' and Ronald Reagan declared ''government is not the solution to our problem.'' 
 Immediately upon taking office, Jimmy Carter heartened part of the country by pardoning Vietnam draft resisters. Mr. Reagan basked in an external event that heartened the entire country when Iran released American hostages.
 But Bill Clinton fought controversy even before his inauguration. In a mid-January confirmation hearing for Donna E. Shalala, his nominee for health and human services secretary, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, ripped the president-elect as giving welfare reform a lower priority than health care, a decision Mr. Clinton would come to regret because of its political consequences.
 On Mr. Clinton's first full day in office, his secretary of defense, Les Aspin, was excoriated by members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff over the new president's effort to fulfill his campaign pledge to permit gay men and lesbians to serve openly in the military. On his second full day, he accepted the withdrawal of his choice for attorney general, Zoe Baird, over revelations that she had employed an illegal immigrant. 
 Those first-inning dramas played out publicly. Behind closed doors, other presidents faced early tests that shadowed their tenures. 
 Within a month of being sworn in for his only full term, Lyndon B. Johnson complained privately about a speech on Vietnam by his vice president, Hubert H. Humphrey. In turn, Mr. Humphrey worried that Mr. Johnson was marginalizing him. 
 Within two months, Richard Nixon had begun the secret bombing of Cambodia. Just as quickly, Mr. Carter soured his relations with a Democrat-controlled Congress by taking aim at water projects cherished by senior figures in his own party. 
 Within three months of inauguration, Mr. Reagan was shot in an assassination attempt. Mr. Kennedy ordered the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba. The current President Bush faced a showdown with Beijing over a collision between an American spy plane and a Chinese fighter jet. 
 Within four months, Mr. Clinton faced a new furor over the firing of officials in the White House travel office. 
 Within five months, Mr. Bush saw the Senate slip from Republican control when Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont switched to become an independent. 
 And within eight months, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks thrust Mr. Bush's presidency in directions he never anticipated while seeking office. 
 Long List of Problems
 The list of known problems facing Mr. Obama at least matches that of any predecessor since Roosevelt. While conditions have improved in an Iraq war he promises to end, they have deteriorated in the war in Afghanistan that he promises to step up. 
 Consumer spending is falling, unemployment is rising, and American auto companies say they may not have enough cash to stay afloat until Mr. Obama's inauguration. The Group of 20 industrial and developing nations, which in the absence of the new American leader left important regulatory questions unresolved this past weekend in Washington, plans another session for April 2009, after Mr. Obama has assumed power. 
 The lame-duck Congress returns to Washington on Monday to pursue the Democrats' dwindling hopes for new economic stimulus and aid for Detroit. But Mr. Obama, having resigned his Senate seat, plans to remain in Chicago. 
 Aides say the president-elect might name a secretary of state or Treasury this week. But probably not, since they believe he still has time to think things through.

 IN A RUSSIAN TECHNOLOGY FIRM,
 A Story of Short-Lived Prosperity
 Eight years of economic growth and prosperity under President Vladimir V. Putin created a flurry of start-ups and spin-offs in Moscow's technology industry. As Russia slides down the other side of that rise, a company called MeshNetics offers a view of both slopes. Once a hive of optimism and activity, the company building has been largely emptied by layoffs, and now sits another victim of a seizing world economy. Page A6 
 EGYPT IN THE SHADOW OF ITS HISTORY
 Scientists have found evidence of another pyramid deep beneath the surface of Egypt's desert, built about 4,300 years ago. Egyptians probably won't care much, unless they work in tourism. For a thriving modern city, living in the shadow of an ancient greatness can be tiresome. But even those who don't care about the monuments cannot deny their significance to the country. Page A8 
 MIDEAST OPEN TO RESTORING TRUCE
 It has been two weeks since violence erupted anew between Israel and Hamas, breaking an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire between the sides. In that time, 15 militants have been killed, 4 on Sunday by an Israeli airstrike. But despite harsh words from Israel, which blames Hamas for breaking the truce, and about 20 rockets fired from Gaza, both sides left the door open to restoring the pact. Page A7 
 A FIRST FOR GERMAN POLITICS
 An ethnic Turk has bee elected to the top political post in the Green Party. It is the first time in German history that any party has chosen a leader with an ethnic Turkish background. Though it is home to more than 2.6 million Turks, Germany has yet to see more than a few join the higher ranks of many professions, including politics and civil service. Page A9 
 FRANCE'S SOCIALISTS IN DIVISION
 France's Socialists failed to assemble any credible threat to President Nicolas Sarkozy's administration at a closely watched party congress. They had hoped to revive the main opposition party behind a serious contender, but constant squabbling hamstrung the effort. At the center of the infighting is their failure to unite behind one candidate, Segolene Royal, a former presidential candidate. Page A9 
 EX-LEADER OF TAIWAN HOSPITALIZED
 Five days into a hunger strike, former President Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan, who was being held in jail on allegations of graft, was hospitalized after a doctor found he had an irregular heartbeat. Despite repeated pleas to end the strike, Mr. Chen continued to protest what he called his politically motivated imprisonment. Page A9

 PUBLIC TOPS PRIVATE IN GROWTH OF PAY FOR COLLEGE PRESIDENTS
 While seven-figure pay packages had been limited mostly to prominent private research universities, some presidents of public institutions, like Ohio State University, or private universities that offer few doctoral degrees, like Suffolk University in Boston, are also topping $1 million in pay and benefits. In fact, compensation for public research university presidents is growing faster than for those who head private institutions, according to the annual survey by The Chronicle of Higher Education.

 STUDY ABROAD PROGRAMS FLOURISH
 Record numbers of American students are studying abroad, with especially strong growth in educational exchanges with China, the annual report by the Institute on International Education found. The number of Americans studying in China increased by 25 percent, and the number of Chinese students studying at American universities increased by 20 percent last year, according to the report, ''Open Doors 2008.'' PAGE A19 
 A MAJOR CONSERVATIVE REGROUPING
 In small gatherings at the homes of conservative activists and bigger meetings at research groups, in conference calls and on blogs, and at events like the Republican governors' conference which just ended in Miami, the questions have been the same: How should the conservative movement re-energize itself? And how can conservatives chart a path back to power after this month's Republican defeats? PAGE A24 TIME OF HOPE, ACT OF HORROR
 On Nov. 5, all that was left of the Macedonia Church of God in Christ, the future home of a mostly black congregation in Springfield, Mass., was its burned shell. The structure, 75 percent finished, was destroyed by arsonists in the early morning hours after the election. The church's pastor, Bryant Robinson Jr., above, cannot shake the timing of it -- timing that will now forever link two events, one of joy and pride, another of loss and horror.

 GIANTS STEAMROLL RAVENS, 30-10,
 For Fifth Consecutive Win
 The Giants already had a 10-point lead when the Ravens attempted to charge hard against the Giant's defensive line. That all came to a screeching halt when the rookie quarterback Joe Flacco threw a pass that was the final nail in the coffin. The ball bounced off a Ravens wide receiver's helmet and right into the arms of Aaron Ross, above, netting him his second interception of the game and the touchdown that put the Giants ahead by 17 points.

 OBAMA JOINS THE WORLD'S ROSTER
 President-elect Barack Obama will bring a lot of things to his eventual desk in the Oval Office: eloquence, a calm demeanor, patience and a decent crossover dribble. He joins the ranks of other world leaders who have athletic pursuits of their own, including President Vladimir V. Putin and his judo expertise; President Evo Morales of Bolivia, a regular on the soccer field, and President Hu Jintao of China, who is more than comfortable with a paddle and Ping-Pong ball.

 RED BULLS GAIN FIRST CUP BERTH
 Floating on cloud nine as they were, the Red Bulls almost could have done without the charter flight that brought them back from their recent win in Utah over Real Salt Lake. It was the first Major League Soccer cup berth in the team's history, a checkered and often erratic one, but the team's defense withstood Real Salt Lake's 24 shots on goal and rode its first-half goal to victory.

 PATERSON AND LEGISLATURE 
 Fail to Agree on Budget Cuts
 Gov. David A. Paterson and legislative leaders met but failed to reach an agreement on a way to confront New York's worsening financial crisis. The lack of a resolution cast doubt over the chances of reaching an agreement before an emergency legislative session on Tuesday. In a statement after the meeting, Mr. Paterson blamed the impasse on Senate Majority Leader Dean G. Skelos, who called the plan a nonstarter because of its cuts for schools and hospitals. Page A21 
 BREAKFAST IN CLASS SCORES HIGH
 A pilot program to serve breakfast in the classrooms of New York City schools was declared a success by nobody so much as the pupils talking business over their morning cereal. While the city has offered free breakfast to all students since 2003, many students do not partake. The city began testing the program at schools with high numbers of poor students, and after a positive response will expand the program to 299 school campuses over the next two months. Page A21

 RATHER'S SUIT SHOWS ROLE OF G.O.P.
 When Dan Rather filed suit against CBS 14 months ago, the network predicted a quick and favorable dismissal. Mr. Rather has spent more than $2 million on the lawsuit, and according to court documents, he may be getting something for his money: evidence that would seem to support his assertion that CBS intended its investigation of his work on a ''60 Minutes'' segment about President Bush's National Guard service, at least in part, to quell Republican criticism of the network.

 JAPAN OFFICIALLY IN RECESSION
 Japan, the world's second-largest economy, has slipped into recession, hurt by weak export growth and steep cuts in corporate spending amid the global slowdown. Japan's gross domestic product shrank at an annual rate of 0.4 percent from July to September after declining 3.7 percent in the previous quarter. It was the first time since 2001 that Japan's economy contracted for two consecutive quarters, the definition of a recession. PAGE B2
 STUDENT INSURANCE INVESTIGATED
 The New York State attorney general has sent subpoenas and document requests to universities including Columbia, Cornell, Georgetown and several State University of New York campuses as part of an investigation of relationships between the schools and health insurance companies that cover students. The investigation by the attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, appears to be focused on the adequacy of disclosure of policy terms and costs to students. PAGE B3 
 CHANGE IN TONE AT NATIONAL REVIEW
 In a span of 252 days, The National Review lost two Buckleys (one to death, another to resignation) and an election.

 In movies he has kidnapped princesses, taught math to vapid high school students, and on television he's led aliens.

 BOND DEFIES CRITICS WITH A RECORD
 In ''Quantum of Solace,'' James Bond possesses an extreme distaste for obeying authority.

That number is a relief to the two studios that produced it, because they have a $400 million investment to recoup. Page C2

HEADLINE: No Bonuses For 7 Senior Executives At Goldman

BYLINE: By BEN WHITE; Louise Story contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As public scrutiny of Wall Street pay intensifies, one bank has already decided what it will award in bonuses to its top seven executives this year: nothing.
 Top executives at Goldman Sachs sent a request to the company's directors on Sunday asking that they receive no bonus pay for their work in 2008, and the directors agreed, a company spokesman said.
 The decision is likely to put heavy pressure on Goldman Sachs's competitors, including Morgan Stanley, to take similar action as they decide on year-end bonus figures in the coming weeks. 
 The move could also ease political pressure on Goldman Sachs and reduce negative reaction to what is expected to be a bleak fourth-quarter earnings report from the bank in December, including perhaps its first loss of the credit crisis. 
 It comes after the nation's largest banks, buckling under bad mortgage debts and sinking share prices, won approval for a $700 billion bailout from the federal government, including $300 billion in direct equity investments. Goldman and Morgan each received $10 billion. The bailout package includes some strictures on executive pay, but the industry does not view them as especially strong. 
 Public officials including the New York attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, and Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, have been warning banks not to use any taxpayer money to award bonuses to executives. Industry lobbyists and interest groups have also warned executives at the banks that any big pay numbers this year could generate a significant public backlash. 
 Both Mr. Waxman and Mr. Cuomo have requested detailed information from the nation's largest banks on what they intend to pay this year and how they structured pay in previous years. 
 There is a widespread belief that the way Wall Street awarded bonuses in recent years helped feed the risky behavior that eventually created big losses on exotic debt securities and helped create the current crisis. 
 In a statement Sunday, Mr. Cuomo said, ''This gesture by Goldman Sachs is appropriate and prudent and hopefully will help bring Wall Street to its senses. We strongly encourage other banks to follow Goldman Sachs's step.''
 Morgan Stanley and other banks are still formulating bonus figures. Morgan Stanley's chief executive, John J. Mack, took no bonus last year. Morgan Stanley, which took a loss in the fourth quarter last year but has been profitable all of this year, declined to comment Sunday. Morgan Stanley posted better results in the third quarter than Goldman Sachs. 
 In September, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley transformed themselves into bank holding companies that take deposits, take less risk and are subject to more government oversight. That new structure may limit their ability to generate big profits, because they cannot use as much borrowed money to make big investment bets.
 In the last several years, Goldman Sachs has posted some of the biggest profits and paid out some of the biggest bonuses in Wall Street history. The company's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, received a salary and bonus package last year worth $68.5 million. Goldman Sachs paid its two co-presidents, Gary D. Cohn and Jon Winkelried, around $67.5 million each last year, more than most chief executives. All three will receive no bonuses this year. 
 Others forgoing bonuses at Goldman Sachs will include the chief financial officer, David A. Viniar, and the vice chairmen, J. Michael Evans, Michael S. Sherwood and John S. Weinberg.
 All seven executives told the bank's compensation committee on Sunday that they did not want to receive bonuses this year. The committee accepted their request, said Lucas van Praag, a Goldman Sachs spokesman. 
 ''They believe it's the right thing to do,'' Mr. van Praag said. ''We can't ignore the fact that we are part of an industry that's associated with ongoing economic distress.''
 While Goldman Sachs has not posted a loss, its shares have been in free fall all year. They rallied slightly in September after the investor Warren E. Buffett helped shore up fading confidence in the bank with a $5 billion investment.
 But the shares quickly resumed their decline. They are off 69 percent this year, at $66.73.

HEADLINE: Clinton Vetting Includes Look At Mr. Clinton

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and HELENE COOPER; Don Van Natta Jr. and Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President-elect Barack Obama's advisers have begun reviewing former President Bill Clinton's finances and activities to see whether they would preclude the appointment of his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, as secretary of state, Democrats close to the situation said Sunday.
The examination of the former president suggests how seriously Mr. Obama is considering bringing his onetime rival for the Democratic presidential nomination into his cabinet. He met with Mrs. Clinton in Chicago on Thursday to talk about the prospect and word quickly filtered out. Many Democrats close to both camps said Sunday that it seemed likely that Mr. Obama would ask her to take the job, assuming they could work something out regarding Mr. Clinton's role.
A team of lawyers trying to facilitate the potential nomination spent the weekend looking into Mr. Clinton's philanthropic organization, interactions with foreign governments and ties to pharmaceutical companies, a Democrat close to both camps said. While Mr. Clinton has used his foundation to champion efforts to fight AIDS, poverty and climate change around the world, he has also taken millions in speaking fees and contributions from foreign officials and businesses with interests in American governmental policies. 
Obama advisers are discussing what Mr. Clinton would need to do to avoid a conflict of interest with the duties of his wife, who is said to be interested in the post. ''That's the first and most important hurdle,'' said a senior adviser to Mr. Obama. ''He does good work. No one wants it to stop, but a structure to avoid conflicts must be thought of.''
More than a dozen advisers to both sides said Sunday that although they did not have firm information, they considered it improbable that Mr. Obama would have opened the door to Mrs. Clinton's appointment without having decided, at least in principle, that he would like to make it happen. Rejecting her after letting the possibility become so public would risk a new rupture in a party that spent much of the year divided between Mr. Obama and the Clintons.
The possibility of Mrs. Clinton's nomination generated positive response on Sunday, even from across the aisle. ''She is a lady of great intelligence, demonstrated enormous determination and would be an outstanding appointment,'' former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger told a forum in New Delhi, according to news services.
Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said on ''Fox News Sunday'': ''It seems to me she's got the experience. She's got the temperament for it. I think she would be well received around the world. So my own initial reaction is it would be a very good selection.''
Speaking at an economic conference in Kuwait, Mr. Clinton openly acknowledged the possibility. ''If he decided to ask her and they did it together, I think she'll be really great as a secretary of state,'' he said. ''She worked very hard for his election after the primary fight with him, and so did I, and we were very glad that he won.''
One sign that many said pointed to Mrs. Clinton's possible selection was the news that Gregory B. Craig would be White House counsel instead of national security adviser or deputy secretary of state, as some had expected. A law school friend of the Clintons who represented Mr. Clinton during impeachment, Mr. Craig backed Mr. Obama from the start of the campaign and was a scathing critic of Mrs. Clinton's claims to foreign policy experience. Although some advisers saw no connection, others said putting him in a foreign policy job would be untenable if Mrs. Clinton were secretary of state.
Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton have kept their conversations tightly held, but that silence has only convinced some associates that the prospect is serious. ''No one has called to say, 'Don't get too far on this,' '' said James Carville, a longtime Clinton friend and adviser. ''A silent phone's sometimes as much of an indication as a ringing phone.''
A former adviser to Mrs. Clinton who spoke on condition of anonymity said, ''If it's a trial balloon, it certainly seems to be floating.'' Another said, ''I can't believe they would have her schlep out there with all this publicity unless they were real about it.''
Over the last week at his transition offices in Chicago, Mr. Obama has interviewed at least a half-dozen prospective cabinet members, focusing on secretary of state and Treasury secretary. His team initially planned to name the first cabinet officer this week, but advisers said Sunday that no decisions had been made.
In an interview broadcast Sunday on ''60 Minutes,'' Mr. Obama said that the first members of his cabinet would be announced soon but declined to expound on his conversation with Mrs. Clinton. ''She is somebody who I needed advice and counsel from,'' he said.
Democrats said he was also considering Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico and at least one other candidate, perhaps Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts.
Mrs. Clinton largely shares Mr. Obama's approach to foreign policy, but they quarreled sharply at times in the primaries. She accused him of being unprepared for the complexities of the world and characterized him as naive for saying he would talk with Iran without preconditions and authorize strikes against terrorists in Pakistan even without permission. He attacked her initial support for the Iraq war and accused her of overstating her foreign policy credentials.
While Mrs. Clinton would bring exceptional political wattage to the Obama cabinet, it would be an open question how her role would intersect that of Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has a strong interest in foreign policy. It may also scramble the choices for other positions, like national security adviser or defense secretary, as Mr. Obama tries to find a mix of personalities that makes sense, advisers said.
But with Mr. Clinton apparently the most important stumbling block, lawyers are trying to scour all aspects of his postpresidency as quickly as possible, one Democratic adviser said. The adviser said the examination was being overseen by the Obama team's personnel counsel, Christine A. Varney, a former Clinton White House aide who is now on leave from Hogan & Hartson.
It was unclear whether the review extended beyond publicly available records or whether Mr. Clinton had opened his private records. But he has powerful incentive to do so. ''For the first time in 16 years,'' one Democratic adviser said, ''he has to cooperate with someone else since it has become clear she wants the job.''
While looking for potential problems, Obama advisers also said that Mr. Clinton would bring enormous assets as a popular figure around the world who would effectively serve as an unpaid ambassador for Obama policies. They expressed cautious optimism that the two sides could develop guidelines for what would be appropriate for him to do.
Since leaving the White House, Mr. Clinton has amassed a personal fortune through speeches, book writing and business dealings while also building a philanthropic organization that helps to expand global education, health care and nutrition. He travels the world as an elder statesman rallying world leaders to support his goals.
At the same time, he has also accepted millions of dollars from foreign officials and businesses without disclosing many details. Since its formation in 1998, Mr. Clinton's foundation has raised more than $500 million, allowing him to build a state-of-the-art presidential library while burnishing an image as a philanthropic giant. He is not required by law to identify the donors and has steadfastly refused to do so.
Among the known Clinton Foundation donors are the Saudi royal family, the king of Morocco, a foundation linked to the United Arab Emirates, the governments of Kuwait and Qatar, and a tycoon who was the son-in-law of Ukraine's ousted authoritarian president.
No donor to the Clinton foundation has raised more persistent questions than Frank Giustra, a Canadian mining executive. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Giustra shared a midnight banquet in September 2005 with Kazakhstan's authoritarian president, Nursultan A. Nazarbayev. Mr. Clinton praised Mr. Nazarbayev's bid to head an international election-monitoring organization, undercutting American foreign policy and his wife's sharp criticism of Kazakhstan's human rights record.
Two days after the trip, Mr. Giustra's company signed preliminary agreements giving it the right to buy into three uranium projects controlled by Kazakhstan. Spokesmen for both men said there was no connection between the trip and the deal. Months later, a foundation controlled by Mr. Giustra gave $31.3 million to the Clinton foundation, its largest known donation.
Correction: November 20, 2008, Thursday
A grouping of thumbnail sketches on Monday with the continuation of an article about the vetting of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton to be secretary of state in an Obama administration misidentified the job that Valerie Jarrett, a senior Obama adviser, held under Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago. Ms. Jarrett was Mr. Daley's deputy chief of staff, not his chief of staff.

HEADLINE: Among Republicans, a Debate Over the Party's Roadmap Back to Power

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
In small meetings at the homes of conservative activists and bigger ones at research groups, in conference calls and on blogs, and at gatherings like the Republican governors' conference that just ended here, the questions have been the same:
 Nearly 30 years after Ronald Reagan ushered in a period of conservative ascendancy in American politics, how should the movement re-energize itself? And how can conservatives chart a path back to power after this month's Republican defeats?
 Some conservatives want a return to basics, arguing that President Bush abandoned conservative principles by expanding government and driving up spending. Others draw just the opposite conclusion, warning that Republicans have tried to appeal to too narrow a base and that the party must update the focus of conservatism, especially at a time when voters are thinking more about issues like jobs and health care than about abortion and gay rights. 
 The debate has been simmering among veteran conservative leaders, a younger crop of conservative writers and thinkers who want to modernize the movement and the Republican officials vying to become forces in a party that suddenly has no leader now that the Bush administration is at an end. 
 ''Everybody's discouraged and disillusioned but also energized,'' said Richard A. Viguerie, a conservative direct-mail pioneer who wants conservatives to stop supporting a party that he says has betrayed them, and to start forming grass-roots groups instead. 
 Lee Edwards, a historian of the conservative movement at the Heritage Foundation, said that in meetings with conservative leaders since the election there was an emerging consensus that the Republicans had been hurt by drifting away from conservative principles and that religious conservatives, economic conservatives and strong-military conservatives had seemed to realize the need to unite to regain power.
 ''It isn't a question of stressing economic issues or stressing social issues,'' Mr. Edwards said. ''What we have to do is to go back to what Ronald Reagan did and put together a coalition.''
 Other Republicans are not so sure. They point to the party's losses this month -- which spanned the entire Northeast and West Coast, the Great Lakes states, several Western states and traditionally Republican states like Virginia, North Carolina and Indiana -- and said the party urgently needed to broaden its appeal.
 John Weaver, who was the original chief strategist of Senator John McCain's presidential campaign before he left during an upheaval in July 2007, warned that given the demographic changes sweeping the country, the Republicans could no longer afford to be seen as what he called an ''angry white men's party.'' 
 He strongly questioned the premise that Republicans lost this year because they were not conservative enough. ''We still are a center-right country, but the gauge is closer to the center than it is to the far right,'' Mr. Weaver said. ''And we have got to communicate to the people who ultimately decide these elections.'' 
 The chairman of the FloridaRepublican Party, James Greer, one of several likely candidates to lead the national party, called for putting less emphasis on some social issues and more on economic issues that he said could have broader appeal. 
 ''I think we need to answer the questions that are asked by the conservatives: 'Is it still my party for family values? Is it still my party for faith?' '' Mr. Greer said. ''Answer those questions, answer them firmly, 'Yes it is.' But then move on. And start talking about the issues that are important to Americans: the economy, job opportunity and education.'' 
 Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, scoffed at calls for the Republicans to move left, which he said had followed Republican defeats in 1964, 1976 and 1992. And he suggested that some calls to update conservatism -- by taking global warming more seriously, for instance -- were essentially disguised calls to move the party to the left.
 ''They will be cheerfully ignored,'' Mr. Norquist said. 
 Several conservative leaders said in interviews that they were heartened to have a bench of conservative politicians that they could look to in the coming years, mentioning names like Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina, Representative Mike Pence of Indiana and Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina -- as well as Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, whose selection as Mr. McCain's running mate was greeted with tremendous enthusiasm among many social conservatives at the leadership and grass-roots levels. 
 And while there have been strong disagreements among talk-radio populists and veterans of the movement and conservative writers like David Brooks, Ross Douthat, David Frum and Reihan Salam, some conservatives said the disagreements helped keep the movement vital. Ms. Palin, in particular, has proved to be a polarizing figure within the movement, with some hailing her as a potential standard-bearer in four years, and others seeing her as appealing too narrowly to social conservatives. 
 Some emerging fault lines were evident at the Republican Governors Association conference, which wrapped up here Friday.
 Some called for keeping focused on social issues. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who praised Ms. Palin's ''unashamed embrace of bedrock conservative principles'' and said she was ''just getting started,'' pointed to the success of ballot measures opposing same-sex marriage to show the continued potency of the such issues. ''The defense-of-marriage initiative that voters supported in California, Arizona and here in Florida ought to be proof enough that conservative values still matter to the American people and are worthy of our party's attention,'' he said.
 Others called for moving beyond them. Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida argued that the party might extend its reach if it spoke more about the economy than about social issues. ''Those issues are very important, but there's a lot of issues that people care deeply about, that affect their lives in a real way, every single day,'' Mr. Crist said. ''If you're going to be successful in this business, you have to win a majority. It's not just a majority of Republicans, it's not just a majority of Democrats, it's a majority of the people.''
 There was particular worry among some conservatives that the party had wounded itself by scaring off Hispanic voters, a growing force, with the divisive rhetoric that accompanied the debate over the nation's immigration laws. And there was even the suggestion, made gingerly and reverently, that Republicans could not continue to make ''Ronald Reagan'' the answer to every question at a time when they are overwhelmingly losing the young voters who were children, or were not yet born, when he was president. 
 That was the implication of Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, who told the group of fellow Republican governors that Reagan was one of his heroes, and recalled being spat at by a hippie while volunteering for one of his campaigns. ''But Ronald Reagan was president a long time ago,'' Mr. Pawlenty said. ''A lot has happened since then. So the challenge for us is how do you take the principles from the late '70s and '80s and apply them to the circumstances and issues and opportunities of our time.''

HEADLINE: A Deregulator Looks Back, Unswayed

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON and STEPHEN LABATON; Griff Palmer contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Back in 1950 in Columbus, Ga., a young nurse working double shifts to support her three children and disabled husband managed to buy a modest bungalow on a street called Dogwood Avenue.
 Phil Gramm, the former United States senator, often told that story of how his mother acquired his childhood home. Considered something of a risk, she took out a mortgage with relatively high interest rates that he likened to today's subprime loans.
 A fierce opponent of government intervention in the marketplace, Mr. Gramm, a Republican from Texas, recalled the episode during a 2001 Senate debate over a measure to curb predatory lending. What some view as exploitive, he argued, others see as a gift. 
 ''Some people look at subprime lending and see evil. I look at subprime lending and I see the American dream in action,'' he said. ''My mother lived it as a result of a finance company making a mortgage loan that a bank would not make.'' 
 On Capitol Hill, Mr. Gramm became the most effective proponent of deregulation in a generation, by dint of his expertise (a Ph.D in economics), free-market ideology, perch on the Senate banking committee and force of personality (a writer in Texas once called him ''a snapping turtle''). And in one remarkable stretch from 1999 to 2001, he pushed laws and promoted policies that he says unshackled businesses from needless restraints but his critics charge significantly contributed to the financial crisis that has rattled the nation.
 He led the effort to block measures curtailing deceptive or predatory lending, which was just beginning to result in a jump in home foreclosures that would undermine the financial markets. He advanced legislation that fractured oversight of Wall Street while knocking down Depression-era barriers that restricted the rise and reach of financial conglomerates.
 And he pushed through a provision that ensured virtually no regulation of the complex financial instruments known as derivatives, including credit swaps, contracts that would encourage risky investment practices at Wall Street's most venerable institutions and spread the risks, like a virus, around the world.
 Many of his deregulation efforts were backed by the Clinton administration. Other members of Congress -- who collectively received hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign contributions from financial industry donors over the last decade -- also played roles.
 Many lawmakers, for example, insisted that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the nation's largest mortgage finance companies, take on riskier mortgages in an effort to aid poor families. Several Republicans resisted efforts to address lending abuses. And Congressional committees failed to address early symptoms of the coming illness. 
 But, until he left Capitol Hill in 2002 to work as an investment banker and lobbyist for UBS, a Swiss bank that has been hard hit by the market downturn, it was Mr. Gramm who most effectively took up the fight against more government intervention in the markets.
 ''Phil Gramm was the great spokesman and leader of the view that market forces should drive the economy without regulation,'' said James D. Cox, a corporate law scholar at Duke University. ''The movement he helped to lead contributed mightily to our problems.''
 In two recent interviews, Mr. Gramm described the current turmoil as ''an incredible trauma,'' but said he was proud of his record. 
 He blamed others for the crisis: Democrats who dropped barriers to borrowing in order to promote homeownership; what he once termed ''predatory borrowers'' who took out mortgages they could not afford; banks that took on too much risk; and large financial institutions that did not set aside enough capital to cover their bad bets. 
 But looser regulation played virtually no role, he argued, saying that is simply an emerging myth. 
 ''There is this idea afloat that if you had more regulation you would have fewer mistakes,'' he said. ''I don't see any evidence in our history or anybody else's to substantiate it.'' He added, ''The markets have worked better than you might have thought.''
 Rejecting Common Wisdom
 Mr. Gramm sees himself as a myth buster, and has long argued that economic events are misunderstood.
 Before entering politics in the 1970s, he taught at Texas A & M University. He studied the Great Depression, producing research rejecting the conventional wisdom that suicides surged after the market crashed. He examined financial panics of the 19th century, concluding that policy makers and economists had repeatedly misread events to justify burdensome regulation.
 ''There is always a revisionist history that tries to claim that the system has failed and what we need to do is have government run things,'' he said.
 From the start of his career in Washington, Mr. Gramm aggressively promoted his conservative ideology and free-market beliefs. (He was so insistent about having his way that one House speaker joked that if Mr. Gramm had been around when Moses brought the Ten Commandments down from Mount Sinai, the Texan would have substituted his own.) 
 He could be impolitic. Over the years, he has urged that food stamps be cut because ''all our poor people are fat,'' said it was hard for him ''to feel sorry'' for Social Security recipients and, as the economy soured last summer, called America ''a nation of whiners.''
 His economic views -- and seat on the Senate banking committee -- quickly won him support from the nation's major financial institutions. From 1989 to 2002, federal records show, he was the top recipient of campaign contributions from commercial banks and in the top five for donations from Wall Street. He and his staff often appeared at industry-sponsored speaking events around the country.
 From 1999 to 2001, Congress first considered steps to curb predatory loans -- those that typically had high fees, significant prepayment penalties and ballooning monthly payments and were often issued to low-income borrowers. Foreclosures on such loans were on the rise, setting off a wave of personal bankruptcies.
 But Mr. Gramm did everything he could to block the measures. In 2000, he refused to have his banking committee consider the proposals, an intervention hailed by the National Association of Mortgage Brokers as a ''huge, huge step for us.''
 A year later, he objected again when Democrats tried to stop lenders from being able to pursue claims in bankruptcy court against borrowers who had defaulted on predatory loans.
 While acknowledging some abuses, Mr. Gramm argued that the measure would drive thousands of reputable lenders out of the housing market. And he told fellow senators the story of his mother and her mortgage.
 ''What incredible exploitation,'' he said sarcastically. ''As a result of that loan, at a 50 percent premium, so far as I am aware, she was the first person in her family, from Adam and Eve, ever to own her own home.'' 
 Once again, he succeeded in putting off consideration of lending restrictions. His opposition infuriated consumer advocates. ''He wouldn't listen to reason,'' said Margot Saunders of the National Consumer Law Center. ''He would not allow himself to be persuaded that the free market would not be working.''
 Speaking at a bankers' conference that month, Mr. Gramm said the problem of predatory loans was not of the banks' making. Instead, he faulted ''predatory borrowers.'' The American Banker, a trade publication, later reported that he was greeted ''like a conquering hero.''
 At the Altar of Wall Street
 Mr. Gramm would sometimes speak with reverence about the nation's financial markets, the trading and deal making that churn out wealth.
 ''When I am on Wall Street and I realize that that's the very nerve center of American capitalism and I realize what capitalism has done for the working people of America, to me that's a holy place,'' he said at an April 2000 Senate hearing after a visit to New York.
 That viewpoint -- and concerns that Wall Street's dominance was threatened by global competition and outdated regulations -- shaped his agenda. 
 In late 1999, Mr. Gramm played a central role in what would be the most significant financial services legislation since the Depression. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, as the measure was called, removed barriers between commercial and investment banks that had been instituted to reduce the risk of economic catastrophes. Long sought by the industry, the law would let commercial banks, securities firms and insurers become financial supermarkets offering an array of services.
 The measure, which Mr. Gramm helped write and move through the Senate, also split up oversight of conglomerates among government agencies. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, would oversee the brokerage arm of a company. Bank regulators would supervise its banking operation. State insurance commissioners would examine the insurance business. But no single agency would have authority over the entire company. 
 ''There was no attention given to how these regulators would interact with one another,'' said Professor Cox of Duke. ''Nobody was looking at the holes of the regulatory structure.''
 The arrangement was a compromise required to get the law adopted. When the law was signed in November 1999, he proudly declared it ''a deregulatory bill,'' and added, ''We have learned government is not the answer.'' 
 In the final days of the Clinton administration a year later, Mr. Gramm celebrated another triumph. Determined to close the door on any future regulation of the emerging market of derivatives and swaps, he helped pushed through legislation that accomplished that goal.
 Created to help companies and investors limit risk, swaps are contracts that typically work like a form of insurance. A bank concerned about rises in interest rates, for instance, can buy a derivatives instrument that would protect it from rate swings. Credit-default swaps, one type of derivative, could protect the holder of a mortgage security against a possible default.
 Earlier laws had left the regulation issue sufficiently ambiguous, worrying Wall Street, the Clinton administration and lawmakers of both parties, who argued that too many restrictions would hurt financial activity and spur traders to take their business overseas. And while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission -- under the leadership of Mr. Gramm's wife, Wendy -- had approved rules in 1989 and 1993 exempting some swaps and derivatives from regulation, there was still concern that step was not enough.
 After Mrs. Gramm left the commission in 1993, several lawmakers proposed regulating derivatives. By spreading risks, they and other critics believed, such contracts made the system prone to cascading failures. Their proposals, though, went nowhere. 
 But late in the Clinton administration, Brooksley E. Born, who took over the agency Mrs. Gramm once led, raised the issue anew. Her suggestion for government regulations alarmed the markets and drew fierce opposition. 
 In November 1999, senior Clinton administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, joined by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and Arthur Levitt Jr., the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, issued a report that instead recommended legislation exempting many kinds of derivatives from federal oversight.
 Mr. Gramm helped lead the charge in Congress. Demanding even more freedom from regulators than the financial industry had sought, he persuaded colleagues and negotiated with senior administration officials, pushing so hard that he nearly scuttled the deal. ''When I get in the red zone, I like to score,'' Mr. Gramm told reporters at the time. 
 Finally, he had extracted enough. In December 2000, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act was passed as part of a larger bill by unanimous consent after Mr. Gramm dominated the Senate debate. 
 ''This legislation is important to every American investor,'' he said at the time. ''It will keep our markets modern, efficient and innovative, and it guarantees that the United States will maintain its global dominance of financial markets.''
 But some critics worried that the lack of oversight would allow abuses that could threaten the economy. 
 Frank Partnoy, a law professor at the University of San Diego and an expert on derivatives, said, ''No one, including regulators, could get an accurate picture of this market. The consequences of that is that it left us in the dark for the last eight years.'' And, he added, ''Bad things happen when it's dark.''
 In 2002, Mr. Gramm left Congress, joining UBS as a senior investment banker and head of the company's lobbying operation.
 But he would not be abandoning Washington. 
 Lobbying From the Outside
 Soon, he was helping persuade lawmakers to block Congressional Democrats' efforts to combat predatory lending. He arranged meetings with executives and top Washington officials. He turned over his $1 million political action committee to a former aide to make donations to like-minded lawmakers.
 Mr. Gramm, now 66, who declined to discuss his compensation at UBS, picked an opportune moment to move to Wall Street. Major financial institutions, including UBS, were growing, partly as a result of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. 
 Increasingly, institutions were trading the derivatives instruments that Mr. Gramm had helped escape the scrutiny of regulators. UBS was collecting hundreds of millions of dollars from credit-default swaps. (Mr. Gramm said he was not involved in that activity at the bank.) In 2001, a year after passage of the commodities law, the derivatives market insured about $900 billion worth of credit; by last year, the number hadswelled to $62 trillion. 
 But as housing prices began to fall last year, foreclosure rates began to rise, particularly in regions where there had been heavy use of subprime loans. That set off a calamitous chain of events. The weak housing markets would create strains that eventually would have financial institutions around the world on the edge of collapse. 
 UBS was among them. The bank has declared nearly $50 billion in credit losses and write-downs since the start of last year, prompting a bailout of up to $60 billion by the Swiss government.
 As Mr. Gramm's record in Congress has come under attack amid all the turmoil, some former colleagues have come to his defense.
 ''He is a true dyed-in-the-wool free-market guy. He is very much a purist, an idealist, as he has a set of principles and he has never abandoned them,'' said Peter G. Fitzgerald, a Republican and former senator from Illinois. ''This notion of blaming the economic collapse on Phil Gramm is absurd to me.''
 But Michael D. Donovan, a former S.E.C. lawyer, faulted Mr. Gramm for his insistence on deregulating the derivatives market. 
 ''He was the architect, advocate and the most knowledgeable person in Congress on these topics,'' Mr. Donovan said. ''To me, Phil Gramm is the single most important reason for the current financial crisis.''
 Mr. Gramm, ever the economics professor, disputes his critics' analysis of the causes of the upheaval. He asserts that swaps, by enabling companies to insure themselves against defaults, have diminished, not increased, the effects of the declining housing markets.
 ''This is part of this myth of deregulation,'' he said in the interview. ''By and large, credit-default swaps have distributed the risks. They didn't create it. The only reason people have focused on them is that some politicians don't know a credit-default swap from a turnip.''
 But many experts disagree, including some of Mr. Gramm's former allies in Congress. They say the lack of oversight left the system vulnerable.
 ''The virtually unregulated over-the-counter market in credit-default swaps has played a significant role in the credit crisis, including the now $167 billion taxpayer rescue of A.I.G.,'' Christopher Cox, the chairman of the S.E.C. and a former congressman, said Friday.
 Mr. Gramm says that, given what has happened, there are modest regulatory changes he would favor, including requiring issuers of credit-default swaps to demonstrate that they have enough capital to back up their pledges. But his belief that government should intervene only minimally in markets is unshaken.
 ''They are saying there was 15 years of massive deregulation and that's what caused the problem,'' Mr. Gramm said of his critics. ''I just don't see any evidence of it.''

HEADLINE: Socialist Party In France Fails To Pick Leader

BYLINE: By KATRIN BENNHOLD

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
France's squabbling Socialist Party failed to agree on a leader or a platform over the weekend at a closely watched party congress that was supposed to revive the country's main opposition force as a serious challenger to President Nicolas Sarkozy's administration. 
 The three-day congress in the northern city of Reims had been described as a first step to position the left to win back the Elysee Palace after suffering three consecutive presidential defeats.
 Instead, as Mr. Sarkozy was in the spotlight with fellow world leaders gathered in Washington to deal with the global economic crisis, senior Socialists wondered publicly whether their party could even survive until the next election, which is in 2012.
 ''If we are not able to get our act together,'' remarked Martine Aubry, one of the three would-be leaders, ''it is perhaps the end of the Socialist Party.''
 At the heart of the latest episode of infighting is a familiar face: Segolene Royal, the glamorous but deeply polarizing former presidential candidate, who has been making a comeback in recent weeks.
 Ms. Royal, 55, stunned her rivals when her platform unexpectedly won more support than theirs in a vote among party members last week. She then irked them by joining the race for the party leadership in the 11th hour over the weekend.
 Despite their mission to forge a compromise among rivaling policy platforms and unite behind a consensus candidate for leader, senior Socialists refused to back Ms. Royal.
 Only one of four candidates withdrew from the weekend race: Bertrand Delanoe, the mayor of Paris. Mr. Aubry, who is best known as the architect of the 35-hour workweek, and Benoit Hamon, a leader of one of the party's left-wing factions, will face off against Ms. Royal in a vote among party members on Thursday.
 The vote will settle the leadership issue, but it will most likely leave the party deeply divided.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 19, 2008

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about the failure of France's opposition Socialists to pick a new leader at their party congress over the weekend referred incorrectly to one of the three candidates, who is best known as the architect of the 35-hour workweek. The candidate, Martine Aubry, is a woman.

HEADLINE: A Tale of Two Leaders

BYLINE: SARAH KAVANAGH


HIGHLIGHT: In this lesson, students will compare the economic challenges that faced the United States in 1933 with those the nation is facing today. They then compare the actions and strategies of past presidents with strategies of leaders today. 

 BODY:
Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students will compare the economic challenges that faced the United States in 1933 with those the nation is facing today. They then compare the actions and strategies of past presidents with strategies of leaders today.
Author(s):
Sarah Kavanagh, The New York Times Learning Network
Suggested Time Allowance: 1-2 class periods
Activities / Procedures:
1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW:
Have students respond to the following prompt: " 'We have always known that heedless self-interest was bad morals; we know now that it is bad economics.' What do you think this quotation means? Do you agree or disagree with it? Why?" Have students share their responses.
-Is there agreement in the class? If so, what is informing students' opinions about this quotation? Current events, history, values or a combination of sources?
-Do they think this quotation could be applied to contemporary America? How?
-To what other moments in history could this quotation be applied? When and how?
-Do students have any guesses about who said this quote and/or when it was said?
After a brief discussion, let students know that this is an excerpt from Franklin Delano Roosevelt's second inauguration speech in 1937. To what do students think he was referring in this quotation?
2. ARTICLE QUESTIONS:
As a class, read and discuss the article "75 Years Later, A Nation Hopes for Another F.D.R.," (http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20081117monday.html), focusing on the following questions:
a. What are the parallels between the economic challenges facing the United States today and those that existed when F.D.R. took office?
b. In what ways are the economic challenges facing the United States today different from those that existed when F.D.R. took office?
c. What parallels does Joe Nocera, the author of the article, draw between President Herbert Hoover and President George W. Bush? Do you think these comparisons are fair? Why or why not?
d. What parallels does Joe Nocera draw between F.D.R. and President Barack Obama? Do you think these comparisons are fair? Why or why not?
e. What could President Obama learn by studying how F.D.R. stepped into his role as president?
3. ACTIVITY:
Have students complete the handout "Action, and Action Now!" found online at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/studentactivity/20081117.pdf, which asks them to compare the challenges that faced the United States in 1933 with those being faced today. To complete this assignment, students should primarily use information from the article they have just read, but can supplement with classroom resources and/or Internet resources such as:
http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761584403/Great_Depression_in_the_United_States.html, http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/dustbowl/peopleevents/pandeAMEX05.html, and/or http://www.usnews.com/articles/opinion/2008/10/02/wall-street-the-great-depression-hoover-roosevelt-and-the-unintended-consequences-of-presidential-action.html. When students have completed the assignment, have them share their responses with the class. Instruct students to listen to their classmates' responses and to record new ideas onto the handout to make it more complete. Ask students if they think that President-elect Obama could be "another F.D.R." Why or why not? If so, what will he have to do in office?
4. FOR HOMEWORK OR FUTURE CLASSES:
Have students read the 1933 Times article "100,000 at Inauguration," found online at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/archival/19330305inauguration.pdf. Have students write a newspaper article dated January 20, 2009, the day of President Obama's inauguration. Their articles should have the same title and headings as the historical Times article (with the exception of "Al Smith, Hit of Parade" -- you could suggest that students change "Al Smith" to "Al Gore" if they would like). Each section should be modeled after the section with the same name from the 1933 Times article, but should discuss how President-elect Obama will face the challenges of the time, as opposed to how Franklin Delano Roosevelt faced the challenges of his time. You may also choose to put students into groups and assign each member of the group a different section to write. Or you might opt to have students create the front page of their newspaper including art, captions, a nameplate and other newspaper staples. You can use the New York Times Front Page Poster, found online at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/issues_in_depth/NYTimes_Page1_poster_2008.pdf as a guide.

HEADLINE: Drip Irrigation May Not Be Efficient, Analysis Finds

BYLINE: By HENRY FOUNTAIN

 BODY:
In an effort to make irrigation more efficient -- to obtain more ''crop per drop'' -- farmers have adopted alternatives to flooding and other conventional methods. Among these is drip irrigation, shown above, in which water flows only to the roots. Drip systems are costly, but they save much water. 
 Or do they? A hydrologic and economic analysis of the Upper Rio Grande basin in the Southwest, published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that subsidies and other policies that encourage conservation methods like drip irrigation can actually increase water consumption. 
 ''The take-home message is that you'd better take a pretty careful look at drip irrigation before you spend a bunch of money on subsidizing it,'' said Frank A. Ward, a resource economist at New Mexico State University and author of the study with Manuel Pulido-Velazquez of the Polytechnic University of Valencia in Spain.
 With flood irrigation, much of the water is not used by the plants and seeps back to the source, an aquifer or a river. Drip irrigation draws less water, but almost all of it is taken up by the plants, so very little is returned. ''Those aquifers are not going to get recharged,'' Dr. Ward said.
 Drip irrigation also generally increases crop yields, which encourages farmers to expand acreage and request the right to take even more water, thus depleting even more of it. ''The indirect effect is very possibly to undermine policy attempts to reduce water consumption,'' Dr. Ward said.
 Policymakers, he added, must balance the need for more food and for farmers to make a living with water needs. ''It's fair to say that subsidies are very good for food security and very good for farmer income,'' Dr. Ward said. ''But they may be taking water away from other people.''

HEADLINE: Head of Teachers' Union Offers To Talk on Tenure and Merit Pay

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said Monday that given the economic crisis, her union would be willing to discuss new approaches to issues like teacher tenure and merit pay.
 ''Faced with declining tax revenues, state and local governments are cutting'' education budgets nationwide, Ms. Weingarten said in a speech to education policy makers in Washington.
 ''In the spirit of this extraordinary moment, and as a pledge of shared responsibility, I'll take the first step,'' she said. ''With the exception of vouchers, which siphon scarce resources from public schools, no issue should be off the table, provided it is good for children and fair to teachers.'' 
 It is unclear how much practical effect Ms. Weingarten's speech will have on the stance her 1.4-million-member union and its locals take in negotiations with school districts or in lobbying state legislatures.
 ''Randi said she was willing to talk about these things,'' said Kate Walsh, president of the National Council on Teacher Quality, a nonprofit group that seeks to increase the number of effective teachers. ''But from my experience, the A.F.T. and its locals have always been willing to talk about tough issues. The problem is that they're not often willing to give in on them.''
 Ms. Weingarten, who was elected president of the national union in July and continues as president of its New York City local, the United Federation of Teachers, spoke in detail about three issues that have often led critics to portray teachers' unions as obstacles to the improvement of student achievement: seniority and other contract provisions that have tended to assign rookie teachers to poor schools with the neediest students, many union locals' opposition to merit pay, and tenure rules that have made it hard to remove incompetent teachers,
 On teacher assignments, she pointed to new contract rules the union negotiated with New York City that no longer require principals to accept teachers, or teachers to take jobs, in schools that are not a good fit for them. Ms. Weingarten said she was working with civil rights and other groups to develop similar approaches that could work elsewhere in the nation.
 On merit pay, she pointed to a system she negotiated in New York that allows all teachers in a participating school to receive extra pay when that school excels. She said her union was willing to discuss adopting similar plans elsewhere.
 On tenure, Ms. Weingarten recommended increased use of peer review, in which veteran teachers mentor less effective colleagues and even, she said, ''counsel unsuccessful colleagues out of the profession.'' Peer review has been used in Toledo, Ohio, and other communities for many years, and she said she hoped to ''put it to work in many more.''
 But Ms. Walsh, who was among those in the audience Monday, pointed to a law passed by the New York Legislature this year, after lobbying by some teachers' unions, that bars school districts from considering students' test scores when deciding whether to grant teachers tenure after their probationary period. (At the time, Ms. Weingarten said she had not pressed for the law though she supported it.)
 ''In terms of tenure,'' Ms. Walsh said, ''that was a setback rather than progress.''
 Still, another listener, Representative George Miller, the California Democrat who heads the House Education and Labor Committee, described Ms Weingarten's offer as ''an encouraging development.''

HEADLINE: Seeing a Pitched Battle Over Plastic Bags

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Steven Thrasher usually carries two reusable cloth bags for any impromptu shopping. At the Ikea store in Brooklyn the other day, he gladly forked over $1.18 for two of the store's big blue bags, made of durable plastic for repeated use.
 But even an environmentally aware New Yorker like Mr. Thrasher cannot shake himself loose of the everyday disposable plastic bag. Friends visit him with food and drink wrapped in plastic. Sometimes, caught without his cloth bags when running into a store for an unplanned purchase, he accepts a plastic bag. For all his good intentions, he has a balled-up pile of them under his kitchen sink, like the rest of us. 
 ''I'd pick up 50 bags a week instead of 2 or 3 if I wasn't conscious of it,'' said Mr. Thrasher, 31, a freelance writer from Fort Greene, Brooklyn. ''You're always having a plastic bag put in your hand.''
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced this month that he would push for a 6-cent fee on each plastic bag, both to raise as much as $16 million a year for the city in its economic slump and to steer New Yorkers toward greener practices -- switching to bags they can use over and over. 
 Yet even those who agree with the idea say the weaning from such a symbol of waste could be particularly difficult, if not painful, in a city with New York's quirks. 
 In interviews over the past week, many shoppers said the city's largely carless, minimalist style did not easily lend itself to toting canvas or heavier plastic bags around like another accessory. Many also pointed out that the plastic bag is hardly a throwaway -- indispensable, they said, for cleaning up after pets, camouflaging the smell of a dirty diaper, hiding an open can of beer or simply holding other trash. 
 ''I'd have to buy garbage bags, which is more plastic again,'' said Ellen Goldstein, 56, a painter and animator who lives in Park Slope, Brooklyn.
 Ms. Goldstein agrees that plastic must ultimately go, and she has plenty of cloth bags in her car. But that is where they remained when she caught a ride with a friend to Fairway Market in Red Hook last week.
 So while her friend, Sarah Goldman, 42, a baker from Long Island, filled one side of the trunk with reusable bags reading, ''There is only one earth,'' Ms. Goldstein self-consciously filled the other with more than a dozen plastic bags fresh from the store.
 ''I do feel guilty,'' she said.
 Plastic bags, particularly the flimsy ones that float over windy streets, are widely considered an environmental nuisance that use up petroleum, litter the landscape, clog storm drains and recycling equipment and linger for centuries in landfills. 
 City officials are still fine-tuning the details of the surcharge: Which kinds of plastic bags would require one? Is 6 cents -- 5 for the city and one for the merchant -- enough? While Mayor Bloomberg has called the charge a fee that could be approved by the City Council, the city's top budget official said on Monday that it was a tax and would require approval from the State Legislature.
 Several European countries already impose hefty taxes of as much as 33 cents on standard plastic bags. San Francisco has banned them altogether at large grocery stores and pharmacies unless they are biodegradable bags, which are more expensive than regular ones. The news that New York was about to grapple with the issue drew hundreds of comments last week to The New York Times Web site, many of them welcoming the city out of the dark ages.
 ''How do I clean out my litter box every day?'' one New Yorker asked. ''What do we use in place of plastic bags? I am serious!''
 John of Phoenix replied: ''Simply keep the bag the litter came in and pour the used litter back into it. Problem solved.''
 Lydia of New Jersey said she solved a similar problem by sliding a folded newspaper under her dog ''when she squats to do her business.''
 ''Then I simply refold the paper around her droppings and discard the whole thing,'' she wrote.
 But some New Yorkers are not buying the mayor's proposal. Eddie Collins, 57, an unemployed truck driver from Brooklyn, said that if the city were serious about protecting the environment, it would allow residents to recycle plastic bags just as it does paper and glass. The city passed a law this year requiring stores that provide plastic bags to accept them back from customers for recycling into new bags, but there is no such program for homes. 
 Robert Lange, director of the city's recycling program, said the bags posed a challenge for such large-scale recycling because many are not clean enough to enter the recycling stream and, once there, tend to wrap themselves around other recyclables.
 Count Mr. Collins among those willing to pay a tax for plastic. ''If I need seven or eight bags, I'm not going to take eight canvas bags with me,'' he said flatly.
 There are, indeed, logistical issues that may make it impractical for many New Yorkers to bring their own reusable bags along when they shop. Most people walk or take the bus and subway, so they have no car trunk in which to carry a number of them. Because so many purchases are spur of the moment -- as easy as spotting a storefront and remembering you need candles or toothpaste -- sometimes the backpack, briefcase or humongous handbag that can store them are not handy.
 And many people have found at least a second use for the single-use plastic bags. Janice Thomas, 47, a nanny in Brooklyn, said she used them to wrap items for her care packages to relatives in Granada. ''You fold the stuff up and put them in the bag for shipping,'' she said.
 Mr. Thrasher, the Brooklyn man battling the wad of bags under his sink, finds plastic bags ideal for, of all things, composting. He uses them to store food scraps in the freezer, then takes them once a week to his farmers' market. With a paper bag, he said, ''I'd worry it'd rot through.''
 On rainy days at Luna Deli, a bodega in East Harlem, some customers demand plastic bags even without a purchase.
 ''They ask for bags to cover their shoes,'' said David Cortes, a store clerk who said he sometimes charges 5 cents per bag in such cases because ''the store pays for those bags -- they're not a gift.''
 Mr. Cortes said he had a front-row seat to the waste: Customers ask for bags even for cigarettes, and to wrap beer cans ''so the police don't see them drinking.''
 ''It just creates more trash,'' said the clerk, who said he agreed with the proposal.
 But customers like Bernadette Ojeda, 37, a mother of six, said charging 6 cents was ''not right.''
 ''It doesn't make sense to have to carry an empty bag around,'' she said of the idea of bringing her own bag. ''That's what the plastic bag is for.''
 Environmental groups like Natural Resources Defense Council support the idea of a surcharge, saying the goal is to make people switch to reusable bags and to conserve resources. ''If you end up reusing a plastic bag 5 times or 10 times, that could replace 5 or 10 of the flimsy bags that are now used,'' said Eric A. Goldstein, a senior lawyer with the council in New York. Whether durable plastic or cotton, the reusable bags are a greener alternative as long as they are, in fact, used and not forgotten in a closet, he said. 
 But many grocers and retailers oppose the tax, fearing an increased demand for the paper bag, which they point out is more expensive and, because it is bulkier than plastic, requires more space and trucks to deliver. While easily recyclable, paper bags also require killing trees.
 Patricia Brodhagen, a spokeswoman for the Food Industry Alliance of New York State, a group that represents grocery store chains like ShopRite and A & P, said the city should give the stores incentive programs -- like the nickel that customers get back at some chains if they use their own bags -- and the city-mandated recycling program for plastic bags a chance to work. She said it was too early to tell how well that program was doing but ''what we've seen as a rule in New York State is that the use of reusables has gone up.'' 
 City shoppers already face bans on disposable plastic at stores like Ikea and neighborhood co-op markets.
 Ikea started phasing out plastic bags in March 2007 with a 5-cent surcharge per bag. The manager of the Brooklyn store, Mike Baker, said that by the time the bags were eliminated last month, more than 90 percent of customers had either switched to the big blue bags the store sells for 59 cents or decided to load up bag-less, ''like Costco.'' 
 ''There's been no riots,'' Mr. Baker said.
 But the world may have to wait for New York to adjust. Mr. Thrasher, who grew up in California, said the New York mindset is such that he gets looks whenever he goes out to the corner deli for a pint of ice cream and refuses a plastic bag for it. 
 ''People always think it's weird, but it's a 40-second walk from the deli to my house. 
 ''If you can carry it to the cash register,'' he said, ''you can carry it home.''

HEADLINE: A British Lesson on Auto Bailouts

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
A faltering auto giant whose brands are synonymous with the open road. Hundreds of thousands of unionized workers with powerful political backers. An urgent plea for the government to write a virtual blank check.
 This is not the story of Ford and General Motors, but British Leyland, a car company that went through $:11 billion of inflation-adjusted British taxpayer money, or $16.5 billion, in the '70s and '80s before going out of business. All that is left of the company now are memories of cars like the Triumph, and a painful lesson in the limited effectiveness of bailouts.
 ''It's all too evocative,'' said Leon Brittan, a top official in the government of Margaret Thatcher, the free-market-minded prime minister who nevertheless backed the rescue. ''I'm not telling the U.S. what to do, but the lessons of the British experience is don't throw good money after bad. British Leyland carried on for a few more years, but they're not there now, are they?'' 
 Other experts are sounding the same alarm. ''The British Leyland experience is a relevant and cautionary one,'' said John Casesa, a principal in the automotive consulting firm Casesa Shapiro Group in New York. ''The government got in the business of trying to make a winner out of a structurally flawed company. That's the risk in the U.S. as well.''
 Though Continental automakers have fared better than British ones, Mr. Casesa argues that the long history of government support in Europe made companies like Renault and Fiat strong players in their home markets, but not worldwide. 
 ''With the exception of BMW and Mercedes, European automakers haven't been globally successful,'' he said. ''Nor have they been hugely profitable.''
 That comparative history is receiving new attention as Congress turns its attention this week to the fate of Detroit. 
 The British Leyland bailout remains the classic example of a futile government intervention. The tight cooperation between governments and automakers on the Continent has produced happier results.
 For half a century after World War II, the French government was the majority stakeholder in Renault, and Paris still holds a 15 percent stake in the company. In the 1980s, the company received a bailout equal to nearly 4 billion euros, or $5.1 billion in today's money. Now it is highly profitable -- at least compared with its American counterparts. 
 Today, G.M.'s German subsidiary, Opel, is appealing to Berlin for help, seeking more than 1 billion euros in credit guarantees, according to Carl-Peter Forster, G.M.'s European chief. 
 Monday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said her government would make a decision before Christmas. 
 ''It's not decided yet whether these loan guarantees will become necessary,'' Mrs. Merkel told reporters in Berlin after meeting with Mr. Forster and other management and labor officials. 
 ''If these guarantees become necessary, those funds should remain within Opel'' in Germany, she added, echoing a concern some Americans have expressed that any United States bailout money go only to American automakers. 
 So far, Asian companies have not complained that such a bailout would amount to an anticompetitive subsidy. But Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, said last week that he thought an aid package for Detroit could be ''illegal'' under World Trade Organization rules.
 That has not stopped European automakers from seeking 40 billion euros in loans from the European Investment Bank, ostensibly to help develop cleaner cars.
 For Garel Rhys, head of the Center for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff University in Wales, the trajectory of General Motors is reminiscent of British Leyland not only because of the former's decision to seek aid to avert bankruptcy, but also for its slow, seemingly inexorable loss of market share. ''Both had a history of being the biggest in their market but couldn't adapt as they lost sales,'' he said. ''They couldn't get customers back.''
 Historically, British Leyland's roots stretched back further than Henry Ford's Model T. The company controlled 36 percent of the British market well into the 1970s, with mass-market brands like Austin and Morris and premium lines like MG and Jaguar. But rising competition from Japanese and German automakers, shoddy workmanship and a breakdown in labor relations brought the company to near bankruptcy by 1975, Mr. Rhys said.
 Michael Edwardes, who took over as British Leyland's chief executive in November 1977, recalled that when he joined, no one even knew whether individual brands were profitable. ''It was a farce -- no one knew what the costs were,'' he said. 
 As it turned out, every MG the company sold in the United States resulted in a loss of $2,000 for British Leyland.
 Wildcat strikes consumed more than 32 million worker-hours in 1977, and the company became a symbol of labor strife, with some employees walking out the door with spark plugs in their coat pockets and engines in the trunks of their cars, Mr. Edwardes said. 
 Mr. Edwardes immediately began reducing the company's work force of roughly 200,000 -- to 104,000 within five years -- and closing 19 factories. He appealed to the Thatcher government for aid, arguing the money was needed if British Leyland was going to be able to afford to lay off workers while investing in new models.
 Eventually, the government put up $:3.6 billion, equal to $:11 billion in today's money. But the rescue did not do much to preserve British Leyland's labor force or market share in the long term. 
 By the time it received its last government infusion of cash in 1988, Mr. Rhys said, British Leyland's market share had slumped to 15 percent. British Leyland evolved into MG Rover, which was eventually acquired by BMW, then spun off, finally going bankrupt in 2005.
 According to Mr. Rhys, just 22,000 workers remain at British Leyland's successor companies, about 10 percent of its work force in the mid-1970s.
 ''It was a very poor return,'' he said. ''We felt collectively and nationally that we got our fingers burnt, and this was always used as a reason to avoid bailouts, both by Labor and Conservative governments in Britain.''
 Mr. Edwardes still defends the government aid, arguing it preserved parts of the company that remain in business now -- like Jaguar and Land Rover, which were bought by Ford. 
 Jaguar never made a profit for Ford, however, and was sold with Land Rover to Tata Motors of India earlier this year. Ford recouped only about half of what it paid to acquire the two brands, and is estimated to have poured $10 billion into Jaguar.
 Despite the British experience, the case of Renault, which combined fresh money and new management in the 1980s, showed that government bailouts can be beneficial.
 The French government help for Renault also came amid increasing losses for the company. But Mr. Rhys said that unlike British Leyland, Renault was able to use the financing to create new car models that were ultimately successful. That, along with tough cost-cutting by a newly installed chairman, cleared the road to profitability by the time the government began privatizing Renault in the 1990s.
 If Washington does go ahead and help Detroit, Mr. Edwardes said, it is crucial that the government overhaul the management of the Big Three. ''Throwing money at them isn't enough,'' he said. ''They need money and they need new management. They need both, not one or the other.''

HEADLINE: Hotels Struggle, But Guests Less So

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY

 BODY:
FOR the hotel industry, recently riding high on years of record profits, the good times have ended suddenly, and no one knows when they may resume.
 Both domestically and internationally, many properties managed by major hotel companies are reeling from an unanticipated drop in demand that began in late summer and abruptly accelerated with the economic crisis on Wall Street.
 A top executive with an international luxury hotel chain, who did not want his name used for fear of losing his job, told me recently that the dominoes are falling among full-service hotels frequented by business travelers in London, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Paris and even New York. Until recently, hotel rates in New York were buoyed by robust demand by financial services executives and by foreigners lured by a favorable exchange rate. 
 The good news, at least for corporate travel managers, is that for the first time in many years, they have negotiating power as they put together contracts for next year.
 ''Very tough negotiations are going on,'' said Jan D. Freitag, a vice president at Smith Travel Research. Some tough corporate managers have even insisted on reopening rate negotiations that were completed in late summer, given the rapid recent deterioration in pricing power at hotels.
 Until recently, most industry projections were that hotel revenues would continue growing, despite a softening worldwide economy, although at a slower rate than since the most recent boom began in 2004.
 Those projections are rapidly being challenged. 
 PKF Hospitality Research recently revised rosy earlier projections and predicted that revenue per available room, the standard measure of hotel performance, would decline 4.3 percent, and profits would decline 7.9 percent for domestic hotels next year.
 Smith Travel Research projected a slight increase in revenue per room this year and a decline of 2.5 percent next year. That is a major turnaround in revenues, which rose annually by an average of 7.5 percent from 2004 to 2006. 
 Meanwhile, new properties, planned during the early stages of the boom years, continue to open, suggesting further hotel rate cuts as fewer people travel. Currently, ''supply growth is exceeding demand growth,'' Mr. Freitag said.
 The effects are not evenly felt. Egencia, the corporate travel arm of Expedia.com, recently reported that many business travel markets will remain strong as companies scramble to hold onto existing clients and attract new ones. But, it said, hotels in certain major markets would be hurt because of excess capacity and, in some cases, sharp reductions in airline service.
 The biggest losers among hotels, with projected average room rates declining 10 percent or more next year, are in Chicago, Phoenix, New York and San Diego. Egencia did not include in its assessment major leisure travel markets that have been the most severely affected by the weak economy and a decline in air service like Hawaii, Las Vegas, the Caribbean and Orlando, Fla. 
 Nobody rejoices in this kind of news for hotels, which are important local employers and economic drivers. But any glance at the copious recent promotions for leisure travel to the Caribbean, Hawaii and elsewhere -- including Europe and Asia -- shows that bargains can be had for those with the inclination and money to travel.
 Even the haughtiest hotels, which are famously loath to cut prices in bad times for fear they will not be able to raise them in good times, are in a deal-making mood, said Peter Greenberg, the travel editor of ''Today'' on NBC.
 Online travel booking sites are now filled with promotions that offer packages with airfare and rooms from all levels of hotels. But Mr. Greenberg said he liked to book a full-service hotel by phone.
 ''And ask to speak directly to the general manager who, frankly, will be very happy to hear from you,'' he said. ''You say, 'Hey, can you offer me any incentives?' Right now -- and remember, this won't last forever -- they are going to throw in some things that will make a real difference in the amount you actually pay, even if they don't technically reduce the published room rate.''

HEADLINE: Town Seeks a Library Benefactor to Ward Off Taxes

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: GILMANTON, N.H. 

 BODY:
This town's new library has thousands of books, a handsome circulation desk and plenty of chairs for quiet lounging. Now it needs a final, crucial component: a budget so it can open.
 A dogged group of volunteers raised enough money over a decade to build and furnish the library, an 18th-century barn that they took down, moved across the state in pieces and reassembled. But so far, they have avoided asking for a local tax increase to cover the library's annual operating budget. This is New Hampshire, after all, where taxes are reviled and frugality is prized. 
 Instead, the group is scouring New England, even placing advertisements in the alumni magazines of Harvard and other Ivy League universities, looking for someone who will provide at least $1 million for a private endowment. That is enough, they say, to pay a part-time librarian and other basic costs for years to come. But, so far, there have been no takers. 
 If no benefactor turns up, Gilmanton -- the model for the town in the soap-operatic novel ''Peyton Place'' in the 1950s -- could have another drama on its hands. But the prospect of a library in limbo, completed but indefinitely closed, is not panicking supporters.
 ''We can see the finish line,'' said Elizabeth Bedard, president of the Gilmanton Year-Round Library Association. ''Everyone is just really excited that we've gotten this far.''
 Ms. Bedard and her fellow volunteers banded together in 1998 after realizing that Gilmanton, a rural town of stone walls, old farms and about 3,500 residents, was one of only two in New Hampshire without a full-time public library.
 The group has raised $675,000, mostly in donations and grants ranging from $1 to $75,000. Another part came from selling T-shirts and mugs, holding ice cream socials and walkathons and publishing a cookbook of local recipes like hot cranberry casserole. 
 The money bought five acres in a field across from the town school and the post-and-beam barn, which the group discovered in North Hampton, N.H., about 70 miles away.
 ''We had hired an architect who designed us a brick building,'' Ms. Bedard said, ''but it just didn't fit in the field. We wanted a building that respected our rural landscape, because that's kind of important here in New England.''
 Equally important are public libraries themselves, which started here -- the first in the nation supported by tax dollars was founded in Peterborough, N.H., in 1833 -- and remain treasured anchors of many New England communities. Dozens of the nation's so-called Carnegie libraries -- financed by the steel baron Andrew Carnegie and built in the early 1900s -- are in New England, and many of the region's other old libraries have landmark status.
 New Hampshire was also the first state to enact a law allowing local taxes to support public libraries, in 1849.
 Gilmanton does have three small, seasonal libraries that operate on shoestring budgets, mostly in the summer. But they lack restrooms, computers and the capacity to expand, Ms. Bedard said. Some residents use the libraries in nearby cities like Laconia and Concord, but doing so requires annual fees and hours of driving. 
 ''They're nice libraries,'' said Carolyn Dickey, who started a book club with Ms. Bedard in the 1970s, ''but they're not my own community library. That's very important to me.''
 In addition to cash, the library association has received in-kind donations ranging from well-drilling and landscaping to six computer terminals and about 8,000 books. They are already stacked by subject, from carpentry to sea stories, and the cedar-shingled building recently got its occupancy permit. 
 ''To be able to walk into our library and look up and see this structure that was hand hewn 200 years ago by our forefathers,'' Ms. Bedard said, ''not to get all emotional on you, but it's pretty great stuff.''
 Other members of her group said the project was important for building a sense of community. Gilmanton is divided into three distinct sections, they said, and the library will help bring people together.
 ''It's a central location in town where everyone can see each other and catch up,'' said Alice Beam, the association's secretary. 
 The group is still hoping to find someone with money and a passion for books to supply an endowment, getting naming rights in return.
 ''Maybe someone out there has had a dear loved one that's passed away, or a child or parent they've given everything possible to, and this would be a special new gift,'' Ms. Bedard said.
 If that someone does not turn up soon, though, the association will seek tax dollars -- about $75,000 a year -- at town meeting in March. (The town spends only about $3,100 a year on its three minilibraries, and some residents think that is plenty.)
 Ms. Bedard estimated that annual tax bills would increase $30, on average. But she acknowledged that with the economy in tatters, the timing was bad. Property taxes here are already high, because New Hampshire has no income or sales tax and Gilmanton has no commercial tax base.
 ''These are tight times,'' Ms. Bedard said. ''But people really, in their heart of hearts, see next spring as the opening. If that doesn't happen, I know a lot of people will just be crushed.''

HEADLINE: Nature Calls a Child, and the Flight Crew Listens

 BODY:
BEFORE I opened my bakery, I was an investment banker.
It's a big career switch, but I've never been happier. When the economy is shaky, people still want a cupcake.
When I was a banker, I used to travel all the time, usually with my boss. Most of the time, the flights were uneventful and I didn't embarrass myself.
Except once. 
In July 2002, I was hosting a friend's ''bachelorette weekend'' at my parents' home in Martha's Vineyard.
I was planning to go to the Vineyard on a Friday morning to take care of last-minute party details. But I also had a meeting in Atlanta that same day. My boss was going to the meeting, too.
She was planning to take a 6 a.m. flight to Atlanta and a return flight to New York that afternoon. I could take the same 6 a.m. flight to Atlanta, and then fly to Boston that afternoon, which would still give me plenty of time to prepare for my guests.
I packed my carry-on bag with everything that I needed for the weekend. And then I thought it would be a good idea to grab an almost-full bottle of vodka from my apartment to bring to my parents' house, just in case there wasn't enough liquor on hand.
I got through security with no problem. Back then, there weren't the liquid or gel rules.
But when I boarded the plane, I was randomly selected to have my bag searched.
Of course, in front of everyone, the agent pulled out my bottle of vodka. Since the seal was cracked and the bottle was only half-full, he wanted me to take a sip for security purposes.
It was 5:30 in the morning. The thought of taking a shot of liquor made me sick.
As did the looks I received from my boss and the head of research, both of whom were standing behind me.
I refused, and told the agent to keep the bottle.
Though my boss didn't make an issue out of the search, since I was allowed to board, let's just say it was a long trip to Atlanta.
But sometimes, employees go above and beyond to help you. And it really stands out.
My husband, daughter and I took a trip to Hawaii recently. In our carry-on, we packed extra undergarments and clothing for Marin, who is 3. We wanted to make sure that if she had an ''accident'' on the plane we were prepared.
The flight to Honolulu was great. Marin was an angel, and she had no accidents. She was also great during our return flight. But the minute we touched down, my lovely daughter starting screaming nonstop about her need to use the potty.
Of course, we weren't allowed to leave our seats as the plane was moving toward the gate. My fellow passengers looked at us in disgust. A flight attendant leaned over and whispered to my husband. She then radioed the pilot.
My husband got permission to take our daughter to the restroom. As they made their way there, the pilot made an announcement telling us that we weren't moving until he received a gate assignment.
When we got off the plane, my husband told me that he thought it was really nice that the pilot stopped the plane so Marin could go to the bathroom. The ''gate assignment'' announcement, apparently, was a cover to help us out.
That was above and beyond the call of duty. I was only sorry I didn't have a bottle of vodka with me as a thank-you gift.
Q. How often do you fly? A. About once or twice a month. I'm expanding the business, so I'll fly more next year. Q. What's your least favorite airport? A. McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas. It's too loud and too crowded. Q. Of all the places you've been, what's the best? A. Africa, particularly Botswana, Zimbabwe and Tanzania. It's beautiful, and I am dying to go back. I love Paris, too. Q. Do you have a secret airport routine? A. Yes, and it's kind of embarrassing. Once the plane lands, I secretly race other passengers from my flight to ground transportation, counting to see how many of them I can pass. I know it's awful, competitive and obsessive compulsive, but

HEADLINE: Training a Gimlet Eye on the News Media and Finding Them Wanting

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
As self-absorbed as the news media can sometimes be, only a small amount of self-criticism appears on television.
 The cable news networks seldom speak about their infatuation with stories of white women gone missing or delve into their military analysts' conflicts of interest. But a new series on the Independent Film Channel, ''The IFC Media Project,'' finds plenty to be introspective about. 
 The program, which begins on Tuesday, calls itself a ''user's guide to how the news gets made.'' It examines a wide range of subjects, from coverage of the financial crisis to the narrative of the ''war on drugs.'' 
 ''The point of the show is that American journalism and especially broadcast journalism right now seems to be spiraling downward,'' said Gideon Yago, the host of the six half-hour installments. 
 Mr. Yago, 29, may seem too young to be disillusioned about journalism, but his seven years spent at MTV News and his contributions to CBS News would suggest otherwise. In an interview last week, he said he had watched ''news stories that were super-relevant get the kibosh because Purina had bought the first hour of the morning show and they wanted to do a profile on fat cats.'' He added, though, that the practices examined on the program are not only ones he has witnessed personally. 
 Asked if he has become a journalistic cynic, he responded, ''That, my friend, is the understatement of the year.'' He then quoted a line from the 1987 film ''Broadcast News'': ''You're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.''
 ''The IFC Media Project'' gives Mr. Yago a chance to critique what he sees as misleading media practices. Much of the territory it covers is well worn in print and on the Internet, although not addressed as often on television. Mr. Yago said the series hoped to cover both original stories and ones that ''fell through the cracks on broadcast.''
 The first segment profiles Larry Garrison, a consultant who helps families of missing children deal with the news media. At the time of the filming Mr. Garrison was a spokesman for the family of Caylee Anthony, the Florida toddler who was reported missing last July. 
 ''People love to hear stories about tragedies,'' Mr. Garrison tells the producers, sitting in his office, a framed copy of a People magazine cover saying ''What Happened to Caylee?'' on the wall. ''It's like eating a potato chip; you just can't stop.''
 Cable channels presented almost 900 reports about Caylee in the first 12 weeks after she disappeared. ''During that time, approximately 100,000 other children were reported missing,'' the program observes. (Last week The Orlando Sentinel reported that Mr. Garrison had collected payments from news organizations. He denies profiting from the Anthonys, although he is no longer working with them.) 
 But the segment does not directly ask the producers of cable news about why they devote so much time to certain cases. Similarly, the second episode's long examination of television military analysts, titled ''How to Sell a War,'' does not include the perspective of the networks that hired the analysts and allowed them to espouse the government's talking points without any disclosures about their ties to the Pentagon or to defense contractors. The segment is based on an investigation by The New York Times in April and includes an interview with the Times reporter David Barstow.
 Meghan O'Hara, the program's creator and executive producer, said the omission was not for lack of trying. ''None of them wanted to talk to us,'' she said. 
 The television networks have generally declined to talk about the military analysts. On Monday representatives of ABC, NBC and CBS declined comment. 
 Ms. O'Hara worked with the filmmaker Michael Moore on the documentaries ''Bowling for Columbine,'' ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' and ''Sicko,'' and the series adopts an outraged tone reminiscent of those left-leaning films. 
 Jennifer Caserta, the general manager of the Independent Film Channel, sidestepped questions about whether the program represents any kind of partisanship. ''The goal was to just present the stories and allow the audience to make the judgment,'' she said.
 While the series is essentially an exercise in media literacy, it is far less academic than one might expect. Each episode includes an editorial cartoon, ''News Junkie,'' that pokes fun at media stereotypes and shortcomings. While the media criticism programs on cable news, ''Fox News Watch'' and CNN's ''Reliable Sources,'' emphasize debates among guests, ''The IFC Media Project'' prefers taped segments and one-on-one interviews. The third episode applies neuroscience to so-called shout shows to see why pundit-driven talk is so entertaining to viewers.
 Mr. Yago said the program seeks to praise great journalism just as it criticizes questionable media practices. ''Mostly,'' he said, ''it's trying to get into the process -- to ask why stories become news and how stories get to the top of the queue.''

HEADLINE: At Public Board Meeting, Smithsonian Practices New Openness

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Fielding questions about its diminished endowment fund, the possibility of charging admission fees and the fate of its fabled yet shuttered Arts and Industries Building, the Smithsonian Institution held the first public board meeting in its 162-year history on Monday as part of its new commitment to openness and accountability. Sitting on the stage of a 565-seat auditorium at the institution's National Museum of Natural History, members of the governing body, or Board of Regents -- including members of Congress -- took questions from the audience present and online. 
 The two-hour meeting was a window on public concerns about the Smithsonian's shaky financial state and potentially endangered programs, rather than merely a forum for combative accusations after two tumultuous years in which the institution has been battered by mismanagement scandals. Museumgoers and Smithsonian staff members had the opportunity to ask whatever they wanted about the organization's operations and direction. 
 Although billed as an open board meeting, the session seemed more like a chance for the regents to hear from the public than for the public to observe the regents at work. Questions ranged from broad issues like the thrust of the Smithsonian's new strategic planning initiative, intended to draft a course of action for the institution's financial future and its programs, to whether a tram might be built at the National Zoo. 
 There were nonetheless more challenging moments.
 ''Why did you not all resign?'' was the first question, submitted on a card by an audience member. It referred to the Board of Regents' decision to stay on after revelations about the lavish expense-account spending of Lawrence M. Small, the Smithsonian's former secretary, or chief executive, who resigned in March 2007.
 Roger W. Sant, chairman of the Smithsonian's executive committee, replied that the regents had asked themselves, ''Do we resign, or do we roll up our sleeves -- and we chose the latter.''
 The question that drew one of the most emphatic responses from the regents concerned the viability of the Smithsonian's policy of free admission at all of its components, which include 19 museums and galleries, the zoo and 9 research centers. The Smithsonian draws 70 percent of its $1 billion annual budget from the federal government. 
 One written comment suggested that ''the luxury of free admission must be a thing of the past.'' The audience booed. 
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and a Smithsonian regent, called the admission policy ''one of the great hallmarks'' of the institution.
 Calling attention to the Smithsonian's unusual governance structure was the scheduled role of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who serves as the Smithsonian's chancellor and traditionally presides over board meetings. At the last minute the chief justice was unable to attend and Mr. Sant presided instead. ''We've been trying to do some fixing,'' Mr. Sant said upon opening the meeting. ''The board views this meeting as an opportunity to directly engage with all of you about the issues facing the Smithsonian.''
 Many questions were answered by G. Wayne Clough, the former president of the Georgia Institute of Technology, who took over in July as the Smithsonian's secretary. 
 He faces the task of restoring stability to an institution struggling with a $2.5 billion shortfall, crumbling buildings and a recent legacy of improprieties by leading Smithsonian executives. ''We believe the Smithsonian is at a turning point,'' he said in his opening remarks. ''The world is rapidly changing in so many ways.''
 Like other organizations, the Smithsonian has been seriously affected by the nation's economic downturn; the value of its endowment has dropped 21 percent since June. ''Of course we can't predict the future,'' Dr. Clough said, ''but we can prepare for it.'' 
 He said the Smithsonian had ''to find ways to be more self-reliant.'' The institution raised $135.6 million last year, he said, an improvement on its goal of $115 million. 
 The developer and philanthropist Eli Broad, who serves as a regent, said the board had become more conservative about its investments. 
 The organization has also raised $400,000 toward the $1.3 million cost of its strategic planning effort, Dr. Clough said. But he said that fund-raising was not enough and that the institution needed to set about attracting a younger and more diverse work force and audience. 
 Dr. Clough said he had established a committee to ensure that executives at the institution -- including regents, staff members and contractors -- reflected the nation's ethnic diversity. ''The Smithsonian is the treasure of America and it represents America,'' he said. ''Therefore its Board of Regents should as well.''
 Several of the questions dealt with the Smithsonian's neo-Classical 1881 Arts and Industries Building, which has been closed for four years and is listed by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as one of the nation's most endangered places because of its state of disrepair.
 Dr. Clough said that the cost of repairs had been estimated at about $75 million and that the Smithsonian would conclude a study on its future use in January. One member of the audience suggested setting aside part of the building as an information center for all the institutions on the National Mall. 
 The Board of Regents plans to hold open meetings at least once a year. The next one is expected in June. Mr. Sant said the board might adjust the format in the future. 
 ''We don't have it exactly right,'' he said. ''But at least we're trying to tinker with it.''

HEADLINE: Fighting the Financial Crisis, One Challenge at a Time

BYLINE: By HENRY M. PAULSON Jr.. 
Henry M. Paulson Jr. is the secretary of the Treasury.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 WE are going through a financial crisis more severe and unpredictable than any in our lifetimes. We have seen the failures, or the equivalent of failures, of Bear Stearns, IndyMac, Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual, Wachovia, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the American International Group. Each of these failures would be tremendously consequential in its own right. But we faced them in succession, as our financial system seized up and severely damaged the economy. 
 By September, the government faced a systemwide crisis. After months of making the most of the authority we already had, we asked Congress for a comprehensive rescue package so we could stabilize our financial system and minimize further damage to our economy. 
 By the time the legislation had passed on Oct. 3, the global market crisis was so broad and so severe that we needed to move quickly and take powerful steps to stabilize our financial system and to get credit flowing again. Our initial intent was to strengthen the banking system by purchasing illiquid mortgages and mortgage-related securities. But the severity and magnitude of the situation had worsened to such an extent that an asset purchase program would not be effective enough, quickly enough. Therefore, exercising the authority granted by Congress in this legislation, we quickly deployed a $250 billion capital injection program, fully anticipating we would follow that with a program for buying troubled assets.
 There is no playbook for responding to turmoil we have never faced. We adjusted our strategy to reflect the facts of a severe market crisis, always keeping focused on our goal: to stabilize a financial system that is integral to the everyday lives of all Americans. By mid-October, our actions, in combination with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's guarantee of certain debt issued by financial institutions, helped us to accomplish the first major priority, which was to immediately stabilize the financial system. 
 As we assessed how best to use the remaining money for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, we carefully considered the uncertainties around the deteriorating economic situation in the United States and globally. The latest economic reports underscore the challenges we are facing. The gross domestic product for the third quarter (which ended Sept. 30, three days before the bill passed) shrank by 0.3 percent. The unemployment rate rose in October to a level not seen since the mid-1990s. Home prices in 10 major cities have fallen 18 percent over the previous year. Auto sales numbers plummeted in October and were more than a third lower than one year ago. The slowing of European economies has been even more drastic. 
 I have always said that the decline in the housing market is at the root of the economic downturn and our financial market stress. And the economy, as it slows further, threatens to prolong this decline, as well as the stress on our financial institutions and financial markets. 
 A troubled-asset purchase program, to be effective, would require a huge commitment of money. In mid-September, before economic conditions worsened, $700 billion in troubled asset purchases would have had a significant impact. But half of that sum, in a worse economy, simply isn't enough firepower. 
 If we have learned anything throughout this year, we have learned that this financial crisis is unpredictable and difficult to counteract. We decided it was prudent to reserve our TARP money, maintaining not only our flexibility, but also that of the next administration.
 The current $250 billion capital purchase program is strong medicine for our financial institutions. More capital enables banks to take losses as they write down or sell troubled assets. And stronger capitalization is essential to increasing lending, which is vital to economic recovery. 
 Recently I've been asked two questions. First, Congress gave you the authority you requested, and the economy has only become worse. What went wrong? Second, if housing and mortgages are at the root of our economic difficulties, why aren't you addressing those problems? 
 The answer to the first question is that the purpose of the financial rescue legislation was to stabilize our financial system and to strengthen it. It is not a panacea for all our economic difficulties. The crisis in our financial system had already spilled over into the overall economy. But recovery will happen much, much faster than it would have had we not used TARP to stabilize our system. If Congress had not given us the authority for TARP and the capital purchase program and our financial system had continued to shut down, our economic situation would be far worse today.
 The answer to the second question is that more access to lower-cost mortgage lending is the No. 1 thing we can do to slow the decline in the housing market and reduce the number of foreclosures. Together with our bank capital program, the moves we have made to stabilize and strengthen Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and through them to increase the flow of mortgage credit, will promote mortgage lending. We are also working with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the F.D.I.C. and others to reduce preventable foreclosures. 
 I am very proud of the decisive actions by the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and the F.D.I.C. to stabilize our financial system. We have done what was necessary as facts and conditions in the market and economy have changed, adjusting our strategy to most effectively address the crisis. We have preserved the flexibility of President-elect Barack Obama and the new secretary of the Treasury to address the challenges in the economy and capital markets they will face.
 As policymakers face the difficult challenges ahead, they will begin with two considerable advantages: a significantly more stable banking system, one where the failure of a major bank is no longer a pressing concern; and the resources, authority and potential programs available to deal with the future capital and liquidity needs of credit providers. 
 Deploying these new tools and programs to restore our financial institutions, financial markets and the flow of lending and credit will determine, to a large extent, the speed and trajectory of our economic recovery. I am confident of success, because our economy is flexible and resilient, rooted in the entrepreneurial spirit and productivity of the American people.

HEADLINE: Industrial Output Rebounds, Moving Past Disruptions

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Industrial output posted a bigger-than-expected increase in October after plunging in September by the largest amount in more than 60 years. 
 The Federal Reserve said Monday that industrial output rose 1.3 percent last month, reflecting a return to more normal operations after hurricanes and a strike at Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer, in September.
 Those disruptions along with the weak economy caused industrial production to fall 3.7 percent in September, the biggest one-month drop since a 5 percent plunge in February 1946.
 The 1.3 percent increase in October was bigger than the 0.2 percent rise that economists expected, but the September decline was worse than the 2.8 percent drop originally reported. The government attributed the steeper fall to revised data showing that Hurricanes Gustav and Ike had a bigger impact on the chemical industry than initially thought.
 October's rebound reflected a return to more normal operations at chemical plants, oil refineries and drilling platforms along the Gulf Coast.
 The big drop in output in September and the increase in October were heavily influenced by the hurricanes and the strike at Boeing. Without those special factors, total industrial production would have fallen by around 0.6 percent in both September and October, the Fed said.
 Manufacturing posted a 0.6 percent rise in October after having fallen by 3.7 percent in September. Manufacturing, including the ailing auto industry, has been under pressure as economists forecast further troubles ahead as the country undergoes what many expect to be a severe recession.
 Output at the nation's mines, which includes oil drilling, shot up by 6.1 percent in October, reflecting the resumption of production at Gulf Coast rigs after an 8.5 percent drop in September.

HEADLINE: G.M. Sells Suzuki Stake in Its Effort to Raise Cash

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
General Motors will sell its entire stake in Suzuki Motor Corporation, the Japanese automaker, for 22.37 billion yen ($230 million), G.M.'s latest move to stay afloat while awaiting a decision from Washington on aid for the industry. 
 Suzuki said Monday that it would buy back the 3.02 percent stake from the American auto giant, which is seeking a $25 billion government lifeline, together with the Ford Motor Company and Chrysler, to weather the deepening economic crisis.
 Hit by the worst sales slump in more than 25 years and frozen credit, G.M. has warned that it might not survive through the year's end without the federal government's financial support.
 Some Republican opponents of a bailout have branded the auto industry a ''dinosaur'' whose ''day of reckoning'' is near, while Democrats on Sunday pledged to try to get Detroit a slice of the $700 billion originally earmarked for a Wall Street rescue.
 Suzuki said G.M.'s stake sale was necessary for the ailing American automaker to raise capital, but the Japanese company insisted it would continue a business partnership with G.M.
 ''We fully understand the necessity for G.M. to raise cash,'' Suzuki's chief executive, Osamu Suzuki, said in a statement. He said he was in close contact with Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chief executive, and the two companies would keep joint projects, including the development of hybrid vehicles and a joint venture for sport utility vehicles in Canada.
 The partnership dates to 1981 but those ties loosened after G.M. sold a 17 percent stake in Suzuki in 2006, leaving it with 3 percent.
 G.M. reported on Nov. 7 that it lost $2.5 billion in the third quarter.

HEADLINE: Pollution Has Leveled Off, but the Figures Have Holes, Report Says

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Emissions from industrialized countries plateaued in 2006 after six years of growth, the United Nations said Monday. But the countries have not yet reported emissions from the past two years, and the new report did not include large emerging economies like those of India and China. 
 The United Nations report was released two weeks before the world's environmental ministers are to meet in Poland to discuss ways to curb greenhouse gases and against the backdrop of the global financial crisis. 
 In presenting the latest findings, United Nations officials said they were concerned that the economic downturn would add a new layer of uncertainty to the coming talks, because many of the programs under development to curb the emissions that cause global warming require credit and financing. 
 While they expressed some optimism about the new data, which went through 2006, the last year available, they said the slight decline -- one-tenth of 1 percent from 2005 to 2006 -- was too small to indicate a significant downward trend. 
 Over all, among the 40 industrialized countries that reported to the United Nations, emissions had increased by 2.5 percent from 2000 to 2006, leading the climate panel to denounce what it called ''continued growth.'' 
 ''This is a critical moment for ministers and politicians,'' said Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, at a news conference in Bonn, Germany. He called the coming climate negotiations ''the most complicated process the world has ever seen.'' 
 Mr. de Boer said he found some cause for hope in the figures issued Monday. ''What I saw was a slowing of the increase in emission from industrialized countries,'' he said. 
 But his statistician, Sergey Kononov, pointed out that the percentage decline had been so small that it could have been caused by either improved policies or simply the relatively warm 2005-2006 winter.
 Just one year ago, the United Nations climate agency convened the world's environment ministers in Bali, Indonesia, where the group committed itself to hammering out a climate pact by 2009. Rich nations pledged to design a system to help the poor in coping with global warming. 
 The current agreement, the Kyoto Protocol, expires in 2012 and does not cover the United States, which never ratified it, or developing nations like China. 
 But the world has changed since Bali. The United States, a reluctant participant in the United Nations meeting last year, now has a president-elect, Barack Obama, who has pledged to make climate change a centerpiece of his administration.
 Perhaps more important, fallout from a global economic crisis has turned the economics of climate change upside down. 
 On one hand, oil is now cheaper than in the recent past, making it tempting for struggling economies to fall back on this relatively dirty fossil fuel, rather than plowing ahead with efforts to develop less polluting alternatives, like wind and solar power. 
 On the other hand, stagnant economies mean less industrial production, which historically leads to a drop in emissions. 
 ''It is clear that the financial crisis and subsequent economic downturn will have implications for climate negotiations,'' Mr. de Boer said. But he added that ''it will take time to see how.'' 
 In any case, Mr. de Boer said that the hoped the world would meet its climate goals by ''relying on policy actions and not an economic turndown,'' adding, ''I hope never to be in the situation where we say we made our Kyoto target, but everyone is starving.'' 
 Indeed, he and others have expressed hope that some nations will renew their economies by investing in green jobs and green growth, a proposal put forth by Mr. Obama during the campaign and endorsed by nongovernmental organizations like the Clinton Foundation. 
 United Nations officials said Monday that Mr. Obama would not attend the meeting, but expressed hope that the United States delegation would work closely with the next administration, which takes office in January. 
 Unlike the Bush administration, Mr. Obama supports a cap-and-trade system, similar to the one that operates in the European Union. Companies and industries are assigned emissions limits and must buy ''carbon permits'' to exceed those limits. Such permits can come from investing in emissions-reducing projects such as planting trees or cleaning up a dirty coal mine in Asia, in theory ''offsetting'' environment damage done at home.
 Jeffrey D. Sachs, an economist who directs Columbia University's Earth Institute, said the global financial crisis could well lead to a slowdown of emissions growth, though it was unlikely to reverse it. 
 But he said it also provided an opportunity to restructure polluting industries, such as America's automakers, which could be pressed to make high-mileage, low-emissions vehicles. 
 With the new administration poised to take power in the United States, ''I think everyone's waiting for a discussion between the United States and China, the two biggest emitters and the two countries that haven't been at the table,'' Mr. Sachs said.

HEADLINE: Web Sites That Dig for News Rise as Community Watchdogs

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO 

 BODY:
Over the last two years, some of this city's darkest secrets have been dragged into the light -- city officials with conflicts of interest and hidden pay raises, affordable housing that was not affordable, misleading crime statistics.
 Investigations ensued. The chiefs of two redevelopment agencies were forced out. One of them faces criminal charges. Yet the main revelations came not from any of San Diego's television and radio stations or its dominant newspaper, The San Diego Union-Tribune, but from a handful of young journalists at a nonprofit Web site run out of a converted military base far from downtown's glass towers -- a site that did not exist four years ago.
 As America's newspapers shrink and shed staff, and broadcast news outlets sink in the ratings, a new kind of Web-based news operation has arisen in several cities, forcing the papers to follow the stories they uncover.
 Here it is VoiceofSanDiego.org, offering a brand of serious, original reporting by professional journalists -- the province of the traditional media, but at a much lower cost of doing business. Since it began in 2005, similar operations have cropped up in New Haven, the Twin Cities, Seattle, St. Louis and Chicago. More are on the way. 
 Their news coverage and hard-digging investigative reporting stand out in an Internet landscape long dominated by partisan commentary, gossip, vitriol and citizen journalism posted by unpaid amateurs.
 The fledgling movement has reached a sufficient critical mass, its founders think, so they plan to form an association, angling for national advertising and foundation grants that they could not compete for singly. And hardly a week goes by without a call from journalists around the country seeking advice about starting their own online news outlets.
 ''Voice is doing really significant work, driving the agenda on redevelopment and some other areas, putting local politicians and businesses on the hot seat,'' said Dean Nelson, director of the journalism program at Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego. ''I have them come into my classes, and I introduce them as, 'This is the future of journalism.' ''
 That is a subject of hot debate among people who closely follow the newspaper industry. Publishing online means operating at half the cost of a comparable printed paper, but online advertising is not robust enough to sustain a newsroom.
 And so financially, VoiceofSan Diego and its peers mimic public broadcasting, not newspapers. They are nonprofit corporations supported by foundations, wealthy donors, audience contributions and a little advertising.
 New nonprofits without a specific geographic focus also have sprung up to fill other niches, like ProPublica, devoted to investigative journalism, and the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which looks into problems around the world. A similar group, the Center for Investigative Reporting, dates back three decades.
 But some experts question whether a large part of the news business can survive on what is essentially charity, and whether it is wise to lean too heavily on the whims of a few moneyed benefactors.
 ''These are some of the big questions about the future of the business,'' said Robert H. Giles, curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard. Nonprofit news online ''has to be explored and experimented with, but it has to overcome the hurdle of proving it can support a big news staff. Even the most well-funded of these sites are a far cry in resources from a city newspaper.''
 The people who run the local news sites see themselves as one future among many, and they have a complex relationship with traditional media. The say that the deterioration of those media has created an opening for new sources of news, as well as a surplus of unemployed journalists for them to hire.
 ''No one here welcomes the decline of newspapers,'' said Andrew Donohue, one of two executive editors at VoiceofSanDiego. ''We can't be the main news source for this city, not for the foreseeable future. We only have 11 people.''
 Those people are almost all young, some of them refugees from older media. The executive editors, Mr. Donohue, 30, and Scott Lewis, 32, each had a few years of experience at small papers before abandoning newsprint. So far, their audience is tiny, about 18,000 monthly unique visitors, according to Quantcast, a media measurement service. 
 The biggest of the new nonprofit news sites, MinnPost in the Twin Cities and the St. Louis Beacon, can top 200,000 visitors in a month, but even that is a fraction of the Internet readership for the local newspapers.
 VoiceofSanDiego's site looks much like any newspaper's, frequently updated with breaking news and organized around broad topics: government and politics, housing, economics, the environment, schools and science. It has few graphics, but plenty of photography and, through a partnership with a local TV station, some video.
 But it is, of necessity, thin -- strictly local, selective in what it covers and with none of the wire service articles that plump up most news sites.
 VoiceofSanDiego grew out of a string of spectacular municipal scandals. City councilmen took bribes from a strip club owner, a mishandled pension fund drove the city to the brink of bankruptcy and city officials illegally covered up the crisis, to name a few.
 A semiretired local businessman, Buzz Woolley, watched the parade of revelations, fraud charges and criminal convictions, seething with frustration. He was particularly incensed that the pension debacle had developed over several years, more or less in plain sight, but had received little news coverage.
 ''I kept thinking, 'Who's paying attention?' '' Mr. Woolley recalled. ''Why don't we hear about this stuff before it becomes a disaster?' ''
 In 2004, his conversations with a veteran columnist, Neil Morgan, who had been fired by The Union-Tribune, led to the creation of VoiceofSanDiego, with Mr. Woolley as president, chief executive and, at first, chief financial backer.
 Most of this new breed of news sites have a whiff of scruffy insurgency, but MinnPost, based in Minneapolis, resembles the middle-age establishment. Its founder and chief executive, Joel Kramer, has been the editor and publisher of The Star Tribune, of Minneapolis, and its top editors are refugees from that paper or its rival, The Pioneer Press in St. Paul.
 MinnPost is rich compared with its peers -- with a $1.5 million bankroll from Mr. Kramer and several others when it started last year, and a $1.3 million annual budget -- and it has been more aggressive about selling ads and getting readers to donate.
 The full-time editors and reporters earn $50,000 to $60,000 a year, Mr. Kramer said -- a living wage, but less than they would make at the competing papers. MinnPost has just five full-time employees, but it uses more than 40 paid freelance contributors, allowing it to do frequent reporting on areas like the arts and sports.
 If MinnPost is the establishment, The New Haven Independent is a guerrilla team. It has no office, and holds its meetings in a coffee shop. The founder and editor, Paul Bass, who spent most of his career at an alternative weekly, works from home or, occasionally, borrows a desk at a local Spanish-language newspaper.
 In addition to state and city affairs, The Independent covers small-bore local news, lately doing a series of articles on people who face the loss of their homes to foreclosure.
 With a budget of just $200,000, it has a small staff -- some are paid less than $30,000 -- and a small corps of freelancers and volunteer contributors. It does not sell ads, which Mr. Bass says would be impractical.
 ''There's room for a whole range of approaches, and we're living proof that you can do meaningful journalism very cheaply,'' Mr. Bass said.
 Crosscut.com, a local news site in Seattle, does reporting and commentary of its own, but also aggregates articles from other news sources. It began last year as a business, but is changing to nonprofit status.
 VoiceofSanDiego took yet another approach, hiring a crew of young, hungry, full-time journalists, paying them salaries comparable to what they would make at large newspapers and relying less on freelancers. Mr. Donohue and Mr. Lewis earned $60,000 to $70,000 last year, according to the VoiceofSan Diego I.R.S. filings. 
 On a budget under $800,000 this year -- almost $200,000 more than last year -- everyone does double duty. Mr. Lewis writes a political column, and Mr. Donohue works on investigative articles. But the operation is growing and Mr. Woolley says he has become convinced that the nonprofit model has the best chance of survival.
 ''Information is now a public service as much as it's a commodity,'' he said. ''It should be thought of the same way as education, health care. It's one of the things you need to operate a civil society, and the market isn't doing it very well.''

HEADLINE: The Formerly Middle Class

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
Bob Herbert is off today.

 BODY:
At the beginning of every recession, there are people who see the downturn as an occasion for moral revival: Americans will learn to live without material extravagances. They'll simplify their lives. They'll rediscover what really matters: home, friends and family.
 But recessions are about more than material deprivation. They're also about fear and diminished expectations. The cultural consequences of recessions are rarely uplifting. 
 The economic slowdown of the 1880s and 1890s produced a surge of agrarian populism and nativism, with particular hostility directed toward Catholics, Jews and blacks. The Great Depression was not only a time of F.D.R.'s optimism and escapist movies, it was also a time of apocalyptic forebodings and collectivist movements that crushed individual rights. 
 The recession of the 1970s produced a cynicism that has never really gone away. The share of students who admitted to cheating jumped from 34 percent in 1969 to 60 percent a decade later. More than a quarter of all employees said the goods they produced were so shoddily made that they wouldn't buy them for themselves. As David Frum noted in his book, ''How We Got Here,'' job dissatisfaction in 1977 was higher than at any time in the previous quarter-century. 
 Recessions breed pessimism. That's why birthrates tend to drop and suicide rates tend to rise. That's why hemlines go down. Tamar Lewin of The New York Times reported on studies that show that the women selected to be Playboy Playmates of the Year tend to look more mature during recessions -- older, heavier, more reassuring -- though I have not verified this personally.
 This recession will probably have its own social profile. In particular, it's likely to produce a new social group: the formerly middle class. These are people who achieved middle-class status at the tail end of the long boom, and then lost it. To them, the gap between where they are and where they used to be will seem wide and daunting. 
 The phenomenon is noticeable in developing nations. Over the past decade, millions of people in these societies have climbed out of poverty. But the global recession is pushing them back down. Many seem furious with democracy and capitalism, which they believe led to their shattered dreams. It's possible that the downturn will produce a profusion of Hugo Chavezes. It's possible that the Obama administration will spend much of its time battling a global protest movement that doesn't even exist yet.
 In this country, there are also millions of people facing the psychological and social pressures of downward mobility.
 In the months ahead, the members of the formerly middle class will suffer career reversals. Paco Underhill, the retailing expert, tells me that 20 percent of the mall storefronts could soon be empty. That fact alone means that thousands of service-economy workers will experience the self-doubt that goes with unemployment.
 They will suffer lifestyle reversals. Over the past decade, millions of Americans have had unprecedented access to affordable luxuries, thanks to brands like Coach, Whole Foods, Tiffany and Starbucks. These indulgences were signs of upward mobility. But these affordable luxuries will no longer be so affordable. Suddenly, the door to the land of the upscale will slam shut for millions of Americans.
 The members of the formerly middle class will suffer housing reversals. The current mortgage crisis is having its most concentrated effect on people on the lowest rungs of middle-class life -- people who live in fast-growing exurbs in Florida and Nevada that are now rife with foreclosures; people who just moved out of their urban neighborhoods and made it to modest, older suburbs in California and Michigan. Suddenly, the home of one's own is gone, and it's back to the apartment complex. 
 Finally, they will suffer a drop in social capital. In times of recession, people spend more time at home. But this will be the first steep recession since the revolution in household formation. Nesting amongst an extended family rich in social capital is very different from nesting in a one-person household that is isolated from family and community bonds. People in the lower middle class have much higher divorce rates and many fewer community ties. For them, cocooning is more likely to be a perilous psychological spiral.
 In this recession, maybe even more than other ones, the last ones to join the middle class will be the first ones out. And it won't only be material deprivations that bites. It will be the loss of a social identity, the loss of social networks, the loss of the little status symbols that suggest an elevated place in the social order. These reversals are bound to produce alienation and a political response. If you want to know where the next big social movements will come from, I'd say the formerly middle class.

HEADLINE: Big Retailers Feeling Pain On the Web And Off It

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
The retail industry continued to see signs of a sharp pullback in consumer spending, both online and in stores.
 Growth in online sales slowed to a near halt in October, comScore, a research firm, is expected to report on Tuesday. Separately, Lowe's and Target reported Monday that third-quarter profit fell as consumers cut back on large home-improvement projects and discretionary purchases. 
 Online spending grew by only 1 percent over October 2007, comScore said. That was the lowest monthly growth rate since comScore began tracking e-commerce in 2001, and was down from 5 percent in September. 
 In the past, e-commerce has been somewhat protected from cutbacks in consumer spending that have affected retail stores, because online shopping was perceived as more convenient. Consumers also turned to online outlets to compare prices easily. 
 But goods sold online are often discretionary, and as necessities like food and energy have become more expensive, people have less discretionary income, said Gian Fulgoni, chairman of comScore. ''If people are stretched to basically make their budget, it just sucks the disposable income out of consumers' wallets, and e-commerce is really driven by disposable income,'' he said. 
 Online sales had been the one bright spot for many retailers, growing as much as 28 percent in August 2007. 
 In October, sales of music and movies online fell 38 percent from the year before. Sales of clothes, books, computer software, video games, flowers, toys and jewelry were also negative. 
 ''Those are troubling because those are categories that in the holiday season are very popular,'' Mr. Fulgoni said. 
 Only sales of computers and hand-held devices, consumer electronics and sports and fitness equipment rose over the year before. 
 Households with income under $100,000, which have been hit hardest by the pullback in the economy, account for two-thirds of online spending. Those making less than $50,000 have led much of the recent decline, spending 3 percent less in the last three months than they did in the same period last year, comScore said. 
 Lowe's, meanwhile, said its net income in its third quarter dropped 24 percent to $488 million, from $643 million the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose slightly to $11.7 billion, up 1.4 percent from $11.57 billion in the same quarter a year ago.
 Profit at Target decreased 23.8 percent to $369 million, from $483 million. Earnings were 49 cents a share, which beat estimates by 1 cent. Sales for the quarter, which include revenue from credit card operations, were $15.1 billion, up 1.9 percent from $14.8 billion. Same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, fell 3.3 percent.
 Target also said it would suspend its share-buyback program and cut capital spending by $1 billion.

HEADLINE: Rescuing Detroit: The Great Debate

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Saving Detroit From Itself'' (editorial, Nov. 15), along with Bob Herbert's Nov. 15 column, '' 'Drop Dead' Is Not an Option,'' tries to make a case for bailing out Detroit before the Big Three automakers go bankrupt. 
 As a liberal Democrat and Barack Obama voter, I disagree. I fear that any ''deal,'' no matter how well prospectively constructed, will still leave Detroit too free to continue bad policies too long for the good of the country.
 My local New Jersey newspaper today, as on most Saturdays, has many pages of large, full-color auto sales ads. Only 5 of the 25 brands (with duplicates) are for ''American'' cars, although most of the foreign models are made in this country. (And many parts of ''American'' brands are made outside the United States.) 
 Furthermore, almost all of the Big Three ads are for S.U.V.'s, trucks and larger trucks, all of which would serve the environment better if they were scrapped rather than sold.
 Detroit deserves bankruptcy and truly forced, rather than bargained, restructuring. The country will survive, perhaps in better shape.
 Lonnie B. Hanauer
 West Orange, N.J., Nov. 15, 2008
 To the Editor:
 I agree that letting the Big Three domestic automakers collapse would result in a catastrophic loss of jobs, but find the terms of your proposed bailout counterproductive (editorial, Nov. 15).
 Companies as large and complex as automakers simply cannot afford to replace top management in the middle of a crisis. Doing so would also be pointless when the industry's troubles stem primarily from the temporary spike in oil prices and the continuing financial crisis, not poor management.
 After all, the Big Three did not specialize in trucks out of shortsightedness or social irresponsibility, but because that is what the market demanded. 
 Forcing automakers that accept a bailout to produce only micro cars that get 50 miles per gallon would deprive Americans of the larger, sportier vehicles they prefer, while placing the rescued automakers at a competitive disadvantage when gas is cheap. 
 The federal government must help the Big Three weather the current financial crisis; they are truly too big to fail. But such assistance should not be used as an excuse to dictate the types of cars that Americans can drive.
 Karl von Schriltz
 Washington, Nov. 15, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 Some commentators presuppose that a bankruptcy of General Motors will lead to the business's being dissolved and, with it, the loss of millions of jobs throughout the economy. This need not necessarily be the case. 
 Many industries, most recently the airlines, have emerged from Chapter 11 with a new lease on life and without the baggage of prior bad decisions. The key to a successful reorganization is a structured bankruptcy with financial and operating help lined up before the actual filing.
 In the case of General Motors, before the Chapter 11 filing, the government should line up financing, both from the private banks it has already recapitalized and from the Treasury's economic stabilization funds, as well as new and creative managers to replace the team that got G.M. into its current situation. 
 If properly structured, such a bankruptcy could eliminate many of the past mistakes that are dragging G.M. down and permit it to emerge with a relative clean slate with which to compete in a 21st-century global environment. In the process, millions of jobs could be saved.

 To the Editor: 
 Re ''Bailout to Nowhere,'' by David Brooks (column, Nov. 14):
 It has been proposed that an automaker bailout be contingent upon radical change of the automaker culture and practice. One practical solution to achieve this would be to make bailout funds available to automakers through a grant application process. 
 Just as the academic community is required to do to receive federal funds, automakers would be required to develop and submit a specific proposal and a thoughtful budget that are then reviewed by a government-appointed panel. Financing would then be based simply on the merits of the company proposal to draft a specific and workable plan to emerge from the current financial mess that is consistent with our long-term environmental goals. 
 Subsequent financing would be contingent upon meeting interim goals of the project. This would guarantee that new and innovative ideas come before financing -- not the other way around. 
 It might even be reasonable to set Jan. 20, 2009, as a suitable deadline for the automakers' applications. 
 Christopher Almond
 Boston, Nov. 17, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 Regarding the debate for bailing out Detroit (''If Detroit Falls, Foreign Makers Could Be Buffer,'' front page, Nov. 17), it seems the only viable entity currently flush with plenty of cash available for such a bailout is the oil industry. 
 Big Oil has been a direct recipient of Detroit's S.U.V./small-pickup sales for years, which has contributed to the oil industry's run of record profits; perhaps now is the time for the oil industry to pay back some of what it has reaped directly to its source.
 Robert A. Rasmussen
 Brookline, Mass., Nov. 17, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Here is an opportunity for the government to help the auto industry retool for a new millennium of energy-efficient, affordable automobiles. 
 Instead of financing the industry to continue as it is, or to further support foreign manufacturers, why not finance a new way to make the cars that India and China are trying to make? Why not get China and India to help finance, and thereby benefit from, our new industry, too?
 We have the factories, we have the manpower, we have the ability to lead the world once again, with government help, in manufacturing the cars the world needs for the future: electric, hybrid, small and affordable for all.
 Barbara S. Thomas
 New York, Nov. 17, 2008
 To the Editor:
 You are right in saying that if one or more of the Detroit Big Three automakers fail, foreign carmakers can pick up the slack by expanding their operations in the United States. The good news is that foreign producers will fill much of the vacuum, provide relatively well-paying manufacturing jobs and keep afloat thousands of auto-parts makers.
 But the bad news is that most of the jobs won't be going to the displaced workers from the Detroit Three. Even in a severe recession, would a displaced autoworker sell the house and travel with his or her family halfway across the country for a nonunion job with lower pay and benefits? I don't think so. 
 A transformation might be good for the auto industry and car buyers, but it would leave behind thousands of workers, and their families and communities.

HEADLINE: Cheap Electricity? Well, Not So Fast

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
CHEAP ELECTRICITY?
 Well, Not So Fast
 The economy is tanking, and so are electric rates, a small measure of relief for beleaguered homeowners.
 But New Yorkers shouldn't break out the Champagne: The state's average rates this summer, 19.75 cents per kilowatt hour, were the second-highest in the country, after Hawaii, where it was 34.99 cents (West Virginia, coal country, had the lowest, 7.18 cents). 
 Now, with oil prices down, the typical apartment dweller in New York City should expect to pay 19.01 cents per kilowatt hour this month, down from 23.46 cents a year ago, according to Con Edison. 
 It is still far less than the 45 percent slide in oil prices, because Con Ed's rates for delivering electricity are up 13.1 percent this month, compared with the rate in November 2007.
 Any relief, though, should be tempered by the latest figures from the federal Energy Information Administration, which showed that New York State had the highest electric rates in the lower 48 in July. And while the federal figures do not break out metropolitan areas, Con Ed's customers paid far more than their counterparts upstate. 
 In the city, a typical apartment dweller paid 30.9 cents per kilowatt hour in July, not even a nickel less than the Hawaiians -- minus the lanai and pineapple. KEN BELSON 
 IN DOWNTURN, KNIT
 Your Own Scarf
 A time of looming recession might seem a bizarre moment to open a high-end Manhattan store that sells a low-tech product: yarn. But the Lion Brand Yarn Company is betting otherwise, opening the first retail store in its 130-year-old history as a wholesaler on Tuesday. 
 ''Knitting has always been recession-proof,'' said David Blumenthal, the company's president. ''People are cocooning. So for $5 or $10 in yarn, you can have a great weekend and come away with a scarf that would cost $60 in a store.''
 His company sells 49 yarn lines in 600 colors, and the store -- the Lion Brand Yarn Studio at 34 West 15th Street, between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas -- will carry wools, cottons and recycled and organic materials. 
 ''In this high-stress environment, people want to zone out with a skein of yarn,'' he said. ''It's today's yoga.'' 
 The company's Web site offers crafters' podcasts and 2,000 free patterns. The store will offer crocheting and knitting classes, get-togethers, lectures and book signings. It will also encourage free ''yarn tasting,'' sampling from spools. 
 Mr. Blumenthal said that despite the economic downturn, sales have been rising at a pace to achieve a double-digit increase by the end of the year. GLENN COLLINS

HEADLINE: Computing From Weather to Warcraft

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

 BODY:
For years, Western governments have used supercomputers to model weapons of nuclear war.
Now a company in China uses the powerful machines to tend the fantasy realms of World of Warcraft.
Supercomputers, which are up to a million times faster than the typical desktop PC, are still staples in the data warehouses of national laboratories and universities in the United States, Japan and Western Europe. But over the last few years, the falling cost of supercomputer systems has allowed a broader range of corporations and institutions, including many in China and India, to buy them for everything from processing movie graphics to searching for oil.
Just 18 months ago, China and India lacked a single system among the 25 fastest in the world. But on the latest list of the 500 fastest computers, released Monday, China nailed the No. 10 spot, standing as the only nation besides the United States in the top 10. India, meanwhile, had the 13th-fastest machine, beating Japan, a longtime leader. 
China now claims 15 of the world's 500 fastest computers. That makes it the top-ranking supercomputing country outside the United States, Western Europe and Japan.
The presence of supercomputers in emerging nations like China and India says as much about those countries' growing national ambitions as the changing state of science and business.
''These other countries are following behind the U.S. and perhaps some other nations in Western Europe, but they are there,'' said Jack Dongarra, a computer scientist at the University of Tennessee who helps maintain Top500, the official list of the fastest supercomputers. ''These countries are making a clear statement about their intentions.''
The vast majority of supercomputers are built by I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard. But China's top system, located at the Shanghai Supercomputer Center, was assembled by the Chinese manufacturer Dawning. Like many of the fastest machines, the Shanghai system will handle research tasks, which remain the most important role for supercomputers. The ability of these machines to simulate experiments, explosions and the weather makes them crucial in an age when scientific discovery often takes place by manipulating large databases of information instead of running physical experiments.
''They are not buying these machines because they like to burn electricity and heat the air,'' said Mark Seager, head of advanced computing at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. ''It's for the simulation capabilities, which will be an important economic driver not just for the U.S., but for anyone else with two neurons to rub together.''
Still, the sharply falling cost of fast computers, which are often created by yoking together thousands of standard servers, makes them attractive to businesses for uses that would have been impractical even a few years ago.
For example, in 2007, the Tata Group, an Indian conglomerate, invested $35 million in a computing subsidiary that built what was then the fourth-fastest system in the world. Tata hopes to turn the machine into the basis of a profitable business with government contracts and work for researchers and companies in fields like nanotechnology, biology and electromagnetics. Tata's computer is already being used to simulate aircraft designs for Boeing and render animated movies.
''We haven't recovered our investment yet,'' said Sunil Sherlekar, head of the Tata lab. ''We don't expect this to be hugely profitable in the short term, but we understand this is a long-term activity.''
For years, some of the fastest machines in China have belonged to The9, a video game developer that owns the local distribution rights to Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft franchise. Earlier this year, The9 boasted of hosting more than one million World of Warcraft players online at the same time. To support the complex calculations required to create the game's graphics, The9 owns more than 10 supercomputer systems.
The list of China's fastest computers is also filled with systems owned by oil and gas companies, financial firms, research groups and other media companies.
Of all the new entrants to the supercomputing race, China appears the most focused. The government has spent a vast amount of money building out its computing infrastructure, hoping to improve science and industry.
''If you look at China and what they are spending to get ahead, it's clear this is a national priority,'' said Douglas Comer, vice president of research at Cisco Systems. ''They are definitely coming from behind, and they know that. They're hungry.''
New Zealand is the leader in terms of computing capacity per capita, thanks to Weta Digital, a visual-effects company whose founders include the movie director Peter Jackson. Weta, based in the New Zealand capital, Wellington, operates four of the fastest machines on the planet for its work on film franchises like ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Fantastic Four.'' Weta also rents out space on its systems to local research labs.
The idea of renting out space on big machines harks back to the early era of computing, when computers were so expensive that customers bought blocks of time on them for specific tasks. Today, a number of companies, like the high-speed computing specialist Cray and the graphics-chip maker Nvidia, are building beefy systems that can sit next to a desk and replicate some of the functions handled by room-sized machines. Nvidia, for example, has started selling deskside machines starting at $10,000 that can process data 250 times faster than a regular PC.
The goal behind such computers is to provide scientists, engineers and artists with direct access to strong machines before they send larger jobs off to supercomputers.
And, of course, there remains a prominent place for machines that can cost more than $100 million and take care of the United States government's most secret jobs. The current fastest computer in the world is operated by Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, which uses it to perform classified military work.

HEADLINE: Canadian Insurer Revises Its Stance On Auto Suppliers

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: OTTAWA 

 BODY:
Export Development Canada, a government-owned lender and insurer, has stopped writing new policies to protect Canadian auto parts makers in the event of a bankruptcy filing by Chrysler. 
 A spokesman for the Ottawa-based insurer, Phil Taylor, said by e-mail on Monday that Export Development Canada would honor existing insurance policies covering receivables for Chrysler suppliers, but that current clients would not be able to increase their coverage and that new policies were not being written.
 ''The change was based in credit consideration,'' he said. ''We have to balance our mandate with our credit decisions.''
 The decision by the E.D.C., as the lender is known, may create problems for small- and medium-size parts makers, said Gerry Fedchun, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association, a trade group. 
 Mr. Fedchun said that Canadian parts makers are disproportionately dependent on Chrysler, which has several plants in Northern states, as well as two large factories in Ontario.
 ''The fact that E.D.C. isn't issuing new stuff tells us that this situation is very, very, very grave,'' Mr. Fedchun said. ''Because they are a government-backed bank, they are more risk-tolerant.'' 
 Lenders generally require that small and medium-size auto parts makers acquire insurance against the possibility that their customers will not pay outstanding bills because of bankruptcy.
 The export agency insures auto parts sold to the Canadian plants of carmakers because most vehicles assembled here are shipped to the United States.
 In the current economic climate, Mr. Fedchun said, the agency has become almost the only source of receivables insurance. The few policies still available from other underwriters, he said, come with premiums as high as 10 percent, far above typical margins of parts makers.

HEADLINE: Savings as Part of the Job

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
With the economy in a downturn, corporate travel managers are using strategies from other frugal eras to save money -- pushing advance purchases of airline tickets, moving meetings to cheaper destinations, skipping trips that are not likely to generate revenue or requiring employees to refuel before returning a rental car.
 But the difference this time is that travel managers are getting much more support from employees. 
 ''That's the main difference -- the mindset of the traveler,'' said Mary Ellen George, general manager for Advito, a travel management consultant based in Dallas. ''Now it's, 'How can I not support that? I'm glad I have a job.' ''
 Ms. George said she has seen a big shift toward thrift in the last two months, helped by online booking tools that help nudge travelers toward cheaper options -- an effect commonly referred to as ''visual guilt.''
 ''They're more likely to take the lower fare when they actually have to select it online themselves,'' she said, adding that booking tools are getting more sophisticated with features that can even encourage travelers to consider whether a trip is necessary at all.
 ''They have to click on a box that says, 'Yes, I did consider a videoconference or teleconference in lieu of taking this trip,' '' Ms. George said.
 Susan Mays, a travel manager for a Fortune 100 company based in Tennessee, said her company recently imposed limits on how much employees can spend on hotels in about four dozen cities and is rigorously enforcing the policy.
 ''Say you stayed in a hotel that costs $400 and we have a negotiated rate with a hotel that's $300, then we don't reimburse you for the difference,'' she said.
 Her company is also encouraging employees to book trips earlier to get better deals, and is compiling reports about trips that could have been planned ahead but were not -- like a training class scheduled weeks in advance.
 These measures have also been promoted by top executives at the company.
 At Symantec in Cupertino, Calif., budget cuts went into effect at the end of October that included a directive specifically related to reducing travel costs.
 ''All the managers have been told that we want to limit travel to only what is essential for customer-facing types of business,'' said John Sorci Jr., Symantec's vice president for global operations. ''What we've pretty much put a clamp on is internal meetings and any travel that could be postponed.''
 Mr. Sorci recently canceled a two-week trip to visit employees in Asia, and while on business in Orlando, Fla., chose to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn instead of a more expensive hotel.
 He said Symantec has added more low-cost hotels as an option for employees to book, and is considering reinstating a pretrip approval process. But, he added, the company is weighing the cost benefits against the nuisance created by requiring approval memos.
 As for trade shows and conferences, Mr. Sorci said, ''I think those will all be few and far between, unless it's some kind of technical conference where somebody needs to be there to represent the company.''
 Companies are also getting creative about finding ways to encourage employees to embrace frugality. A survey conducted by the National Business Travel Association cited a member whose company is considering using carbon emissions data as a way to lead increasingly environmentally conscious employees to think twice about flying.
 Another mentioned offering financial incentives to employees who fly coach even when business class is allowed.
 Kathleen Hall-Zientek, travel manager for Moog, an aerospace manufacturer in East Aurora, N.Y., said her company has been urging employees to use the travel department's services to reduce costs.
 One strategy is better management of the credits travelers accrue when they cancel nonrefundable tickets; such credits can generally be used within a year, minus a change fee of up to $150.
 ''Our system identifies the unused tickets, and if we can't use them for the same traveler, we'll use that credit for someone else,'' Ms. Hall-Zientek said.
 She is also considering investing in software that continues to monitor a fare even after a ticket has been bought, issuing an alert if the price drops.
 Even companies not feeling a pinch are finding frugality is now in vogue.
 Jim McMullan, travel manager for Monsanto, said employees have been opting for the lowest airfare more than 90 percent of the time, using the company's online booking tool and even downsizing to premium economy instead of business class to save money.
 ''This is all without a message to cut travel -- this is people reacting to the headlines and trying to be conservative,'' he said.
 Coincidentally, Monsanto's sales and its travel spending were both up 36 percent in 2008 over 2007 -- perhaps illustrating that travel planning can also improve the bottom line.
 Indeed, the National Business Travel Association forecast that the number of business trips would actually rise in 2009, extrapolating from member survey data. But the Travel Industry Association predicts a drop of nearly 3 percent in business trips in 2009.

HEADLINE: Gambling With Lives

 BODY:
Asked to choose between the casinos and the health of the people who work in them, Atlantic City has sided with the casinos. The City Council voted in October to allow smoking in the city's gambling parlors for at least another year -- a complete cave-in to the industry and a cruel insult to hundreds of dealers, waiters and other casino workers who will continue to be exposed to the demonstrable risks of secondhand smoke. 
 Six months ago, following testimony from employees about the discomforts and dangers of working in a smoke-filled atmosphere, the Council voted 9 to 0 to make the casinos smoke-free as of Oct. 15. But after heavy pressure from casino executives, who complained that revenue had dropped 10 percent after the ban took effect and warned of bigger losses down the road, the Council reversed course and voted to suspend the ban for a year. The suspension began on Sunday. 
 So much for political courage. 
 Under the moratorium, Atlantic City's casinos will still be required to make 75 percent of their floor space smoke-free. But even that will provide less clean air than one might expect, mainly because there are few partitions between the smoking and nonsmoking areas. 
 The Council certainly needed to take a far more skeptical look at industry's claims that the ban -- and not the weakening economy -- caused the revenue loss. They would have quickly discovered that revenues at casinos in Las Vegas, which allow smoking, also have dropped drastically, and the casino industry almost everywhere is suffering. In addition, many gamblers have told reporters that they like a smoke-free atmosphere. 
 The eventual outcome is unclear. One councilman, John Schultz, had this to say after voting to suspend a ban that he had originally supported: ''Gaming is about smoking, drinking and gambling. It all goes together. It's all sin.'' 
 Perhaps, but it seems the greater sin is to threaten the health and, indeed, the lives of the people who work in the casinos.

HEADLINE: Citigroup To Eliminate 52,000 Jobs

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH; Louise Story contributed reporting.

 BODY:
With its losses mounting, Wall Street is cutting jobs faster -- and deeper -- than even pessimists had feared.
 In one the largest single rounds of layoffs on record, not just for the financial industry but for any industry, Citigroup said on Monday that it planned to eliminate a staggering 52,000 jobs, or 14 percent of its global work force. 
 While Citigroup had announced its intention to do away with about half those jobs already, news of the additional cutbacks -- and the sheer size of the total -- underscored the flagging fortunes of the entire financial industry. Not since the early 1990s has an American company announced such a sharp reduction in one swoop. 
 But few think the pain will end there for Citigroup or its industry rivals. After years of breakneck growth during which the financial industry, its profits and its pay assumed outsize roles in the nation's economic life, Wall Street is in the grips of its sharpest contraction in modern times. The industry has shed more than 120,000 workers since the beginning of 2007, and many predict at least 240,000 more will go this year and next. 
 Citigroup has suffered through a year of losses, and its stock price has spiraled lower for months. It is hardly alone in its pain. Given the gaping losses at many financial companies, and the hundreds of billions of dollars that the government is spending to shore them up, executives are under growing pressure to reduce their pay and forgo annual bonuses. That is particularly so now that jobs are disappearing along with the profits that banks generated in good times.
 After Citigroup announced its plan for accelerated layoffs on Monday morning, Andrew M. Cuomo, the attorney general of New York, called for the company to refrain from paying senior executives bonuses this year, a step that Goldman Sachs said on Sunday that it would take. 
 ''It would send exactly the wrong message for Citigroup's top brass to collect bonuses while investors, taxpayers and now Citigroup's own employees suffer,'' Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. 
 Across Wall Street, it is the outlook for rank-and-file workers that is particularly dire. In early September, Moody'sEconomy.com predicted that 45,000 to 65,000 financial workers in the New York area would lose their jobs by the middle of 2010. Now, Moody's puts that figure at 70,000 -- and that assumes some workers find new jobs in a rapidly shrinking market. 
 The New York economy will feel Wall Street's pain, since the financial industry is one of the region's main sources of city and state tax revenue. 
 In New York, public officials are bracing for thousands of additional layoffs. Last month, the New York City comptroller raised its estimate of Wall Street job losses over the next two years to 35,000, from 25,000. That is about one-third of the 165,000 private sector net job losses the city expects as the pain at financial firms spills over to businesses that cater to the financial sector.
 Ed Witherell, who advises Wall Street banks for the outplacement firm Right Management, likens the industry downturn to the one that hit Wall Street after the 1987 market crash. The difference, he said, was that two decades ago, the stock market plunged quickly. ''This is just a whole series of crash after crash after crash,'' he said.
 The financial industry is just waking up to the severity of the market crisis, said Charles Peabody, a financial services analyst at Portales Partners.
 ''At first, the belief was that the problem was in fixed income,'' Mr. Peabody said. ''Now, the problem has spread to all the other areas.''
 At Citigroup, executives had announced more than 27,000 job cuts, including ones shed through the sale of the company's Indian outsourcing operations and German banking franchise and prior layoffs. But the bank stepped up its efforts on Monday with plans to eliminate 17,000 workers in the coming months. It will also cut an additional 7,000 or so employees by divesting businesses in the future and could shed more jobs through attrition. 
 The job cuts would be in addition to about 23,000 layoffs already this year and leave the bank with about 300,000 employees, down from its peak of about 375,000 in the fourth quarter of 2008. And Citi executives said there could be more layoffs ahead as they moved forward with plans to reorganize the company next year. 
 Citigroup is eliminating jobs around the world, from highly paid investment and corporate bankers to junior managers in its credit card, consumer banking and brokerage ranks. But back-office functions, like the bank's legal and human resources divisions, are expected to be particularly hard hit. Most Citi workers will be told of their fate by the end of the year.
 Once the most valuable financial company in America, Citigroup has been withering along with its share price. It has reported four consecutive quarterly losses, including $2.8 billion in the third quarter, and is heading for another ugly quarter as mortgage and credit card losses surge. After falling sharply after the announcement, Citigroup's shares recovered somewhat on Monday, closing down 6.6 percent, to $8.89.
 Now, as Vikram S. Pandit nears the end of his first year as chief executive, he is redoubling his belt-tightening efforts. In a meeting with employees, he said Citigroup would trim expenses by as much as 19 percent, to about $50 billion in 2009. He also said the bank was seeking to shore up its capital base and cut risky positions.
 Citigroup executives said that Mr. Pandit viewed the layoff announcement as a bold step to show he was getting the company's expenses in control -- and quickly. Mr. Pandit had grown frustrated by the slow pace of budget reductions and felt that the company would benefit from shock therapy. 
 Mr. Pandit, however, has not decided on whether to share the pain by turning down an annual bonus. ''Citi's board of directors will make the decisions about the structure and level of compensation after the end of the year,'' the bank said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Textbooks Dwell on a Painful Past, Offending South Korea's Conservatives

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
To conservative critics, a widely used textbook's version of how American and Soviet forces took control of Korea from Japanese colonialists in 1945 shows all that is wrong with the way South Korean history is taught to young people today. 
 The fact no one disputes is that, at the end of World War II, the Soviet military swept into northern Korea and installed a friendly Communist government while an American military administration assumed control in the south. 
 But then the high school textbook takes a direction that has angered conservatives. It contends that the Japanese occupation was followed not by a free, self-determining Korea, but by a divided peninsula dominated once again by foreign powers. 
 ''It was not our national flag that was hoisted to replace the Japanese flag. The flag that flew in its place was the American Stars and Stripes,'' reads the textbook, published by Kumsung Publishing. 
 ''Our liberation through the Allied forces' victory prevented us from building a new country according to our own wishes,'' it adds. 
 The critics include the government of President Lee Myung-bak, the conservative who came to power this year with a pledge to overturn a decade of liberal policies that he said had coddled North Korea and denigrated the American alliance -- the alliance that liberals have accused of propping up South Korean dictators in the name of anti-Communism. 
 On Oct. 30, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology demanded that the authors of the Kumsung book and five other textbooks used in high schools delete or revise 55 sections that it said ''undermine the legitimacy of the South Korean government.'' 
 ''A textbook of modern history should be written in a way that does not hurt our national pride,'' it said. 
 The authors rejected the interference, saying critics were trying to ''beautify'' the country's problematic history, overlooking Korean collaboration with the Japanese occupiers and postwar dictatorships. The liberal opposition in Parliament said the government's attempt to censor the textbooks was reminiscent of those dictatorships, which once exercised control so complete that it included what books South Koreans could read and the proper length of women's skirts. 
 ''National pride? Patriotism? They should be based on historical facts,'' said Hong Soon-kwon, a history professor and co-author of the Kumsung textbook. 
 South Korea used to use a single government-issued modern-history textbook to teach teenagers. But in 2003, to encourage diversity in historical views, the government approved six privately published history textbooks for high school use. 
 Ever since, the textbooks have drawn criticism from conservatives, sharpening the larger debate in South Korea over how to appraise past leaders -- including the founding president, Syngman Rhee, and the military strongman Park Chung-hee -- and the complicated relationship with the United States. 
 Conservatives say the ''left leaning'' textbooks poison the minds of teenagers by reveling in dark corners of history. The books, they say, inspire a masochistic view of Korean history by demeaning the role of the Allied forces in Korea's liberation from Japan, casting the United States as an imperial power, and by dwelling on the faults of South Korean dictators while slighting their achievements, including their contributions to the country's economic growth. 
 ''The textbooks are teaching a patricidal history,'' said Park Hyo-chong, a professor of ethics education at Seoul National University and the leader of Textbook Forum, a conservative group that campaigns against the textbooks. ''They teach that South Korea is a country that should not have been born.'' 
 Complaints like these were brushed aside by the previous government, which was liberal. But after President Lee took office in February, government agencies issued their own complaints about the books. 
 One textbook, published by the Institute for Better Education, says that President Rhee, revered as a nation-builder by the conservatives but detested by liberals as a ruthless anti-Communist, exploited the North Korean threat to ''shore up his dictatorial regime.'' 
 The Ministry of National Defense has demanded the Rhee passage be rewritten to say, ''He did his best to contain Communism.'' 
 According to the Kumsung textbook, Park Chung-hee -- who seized power in a coup in 1961 and tortured political dissidents, while mobilizing the nation for export-driven economic growth -- was ''a president who placed himself above the nation's Constitution.'' 
 The Defense Ministry wants this to be replaced with ''a president who contributed to the nation's modernization.'' 
 As for the ''sunshine policy'' of engagement with North Korea espoused by President Kim Dae-jung, whose inauguration in 1998 ousted the conservative establishment and brought many former dissidents into positions of power, the Ministry of Unification now suggests that this term be replaced in textbooks with the official, drier ''policy of reconciliation and cooperation.'' 
 Mr. Park, the conservative scholar, said that in the past decade students were inculcated with a ''left leaning'' nationalism from the new textbooks and a younger generation of teachers who had no memory of the 1950-53 Korean War and who were prepared to reconcile with the Communist North. 
 They came of age amid other formative experiences. Many were students during campus protests against Chun Doo-hwan, who took power after the assassination of Park Chung-hee in 1979. Mr. Chun deployed forces in 1980 that killed hundreds of pro-democracy protesters in Gwangju, a southern city. 
 When the United States, which technically had command of the combined American-South Korean forces, did not prevent Mr. Chun's junta from unleashing troops against its own people, students turned against Washington. If the division of the peninsula engendered a mistrust of big powers, Gwangju helped shape views of the United States, historians say. 
 That resentment persists and surfaced in the huge demonstrations against American beef imports this year. 
 Younger South Koreans' view of their history was best summarized by the previous president, Roh Moo-hyun, who inherited the liberal government from Mr. Kim in 2003. That year, the same year the new textbooks were distributed to schools, Mr. Roh said, ''Our modern history is a painful one, in which justice was defeated and opportunism gained the upper hand.'' 
 Conservatives seethed as the Kim and Roh administrations delved into long-hidden aspects of the recent past -- collaboration with Japanese colonialists (Park Chung-hee was an officer in the Japanese Imperial Army), mass killings of civilians during the Korean War and the abuse of political dissidents. 
 They contended that these liberals ignored the difficult choices faced by earlier South Korean leaders. 
 ''In the turbulent era we lived through, no one could be completely innocent, no one could live by law alone,'' Cho Gap-je, 63, a conservative columnist, said to the cheers of elderly South Koreans who gathered recently to denounce liberal teachers. ''When necessary, we shed blood, sweat and tears so that our children no longer have to shed tears.'' 
 In the months since Mr. Lee assumed the presidency, the swing back to the right has been palpable, and not just in textbook complaints.
 In July, the Defense Ministry banned what it called 23 ''seditious books'' from military barracks on the grounds that the country's security was threatened by ''pro-North Korea, antigovernment, anti-American and anticapitalism'' works, including two by the American linguist and left-wing intellectual Noam Chomsky. 
 After the list was leaked to the news media, sales of the banned books soared. The military was further embarrassed on Oct. 22, when seven of its own lawyers appealed to the Constitutional Court, saying the book ban violated soldiers' basic rights. 
 Even Mr. Chomsky chimed in. 
 ''Perhaps, for the sake of honesty, it should be renamed Ministry of Defense Against Freedom and Democracy,'' he offered in an interview with the Seditious Books Club, a new Web site created to discuss the banned books.

HEADLINE: Once Again, Stocks Slide in Last Hour of Trading

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY and DAVID JOLLY; David Jolly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Once again, Wall Street held on until 3 p.m., then lost its grip. 
 After clawing back from early losses on Monday, equity markets flattened and looked as if they might break a recent spate of triple-digit losses. But about an hour before the end of trading, stocks plunged as jittery investors sold amid signs of a deteriorating economy.
 The Dow Jones industrial average declined 223.73 points, or 2.63 percent, to 8,273.58, its second-lowest closing of the year. The lowest closing this year was Oct. 27, at 8,175.77 
 The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 22.54 points, or 2.58 percent, to 850.75, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 34.8 points, or 2.29 percent, to 1,482.05.
 ''Come the 3 p.m. hour, you just feel your whole body tighten up, waiting for the final hour,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. ''We are so dislodged from fundamentals, what we're left to is just the vagaries of the oceans. It's sort of left to your worst imagination.''
 On Monday, investors faced a drumbeat of troubling news from disparate corners of the financial world. 
 Shares in Citigroup fell 6.6 percent, or 63 cents, to $8.89, after the bank announced it would lay off thousands more workers as it tries to put its financial house in order. 
 The discount retailer Target and the Lowe's home improvement chain joined the litany of major retailers whose profits have withered in the face of falling consumer spending. 
 Target reported that its third-quarter profit fell 24 percent compared with the period last year, and that sales at stores open at least a year were 3.3 percent lower. Shares of Target fell 4 percent, or $1.35, to $31.68.
 Lowe's reported a decline of 24.1 percent in net profit for the third quarter, and said it expected sales to continue to fall. Shares in Lowe's fell from their midday highs, but ended regular trading up 4.2 percent, at $18.99.
 ''We expect continued, broad-based external pressures on our industry, as rising unemployment, falling home prices, tight credit and volatile equity markets continue to erode consumer confidence and impact sales,'' Robert A. Niblock, the chief executive of Lowe's, said in a statement.
 Two new reports showed mixed news about America's manufacturing and industrial sectors.
 In a bit of good news, the government reported that industrial output had a bigger-than-expected increase in October after plunging in September by the largest amount in more than 60 years. Industrial output rose 1.3 percent last month, the Federal Reserve said, reflecting a return to more normal operations after hurricanes in September.
 But industrial output has contracted severely in the last year, and was 4.1 percent lower last month than in October 2007. Production in nearly every sector, from consumer goods and office equipment to construction supplies and manufacturing, was lower than last year. Only mining production, driven by a spike in fuel and minerals prices earlier this year, was higher in 2008.
 The slide is expected to further reduce American exports in the months ahead.
 ''Industrial production has really lost a lot of its momentum,'' said Scott Anderson, senior economist at Wells Fargo. ''The economy is looking like a wet noodle right now. There's really no sector supporting growth outside government spending.''
 A report on manufacturing in New York State released Monday had no silver linings. It showed that conditions for manufacturers are the worst in the survey's seven-year history, and said that measurements of new orders and shipments had skittered to record lows.
 With Japan and the euro zone now officially in recession, and after so many months of dismal financial news, some analysts wondered whether the market has finally priced in its expectations of lower profits and falling economic data.
 ''Certainly no one can be surprised that we're in a recession,'' said Christopher N. Orndorff, head of equity strategy at Payden & Rygel. ''It's not like it's new news to the market. It's like piling on. It's negative reinforcement.''
 Shares of General Motors were up 17 cents, to $3.18, and Ford ended lower by 8 cents, at $1.72, as Congress reconvened to discuss emergency legislation for the struggling automakers. 
 The leaders of the Big Three automakers and the United Automobile Workers union were scheduled to testify Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee amid uncertainty over whether Democrats can muster enough votes to get an auto-rescue bill out of the Senate.
 The December contract for crude oil fell $2.09, to $54.95 a barrel in New York.
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 23/32, to 100 27/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 3.65 percent, down from 3.73 percent late Friday.
 Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of 3-month and 6-month bills and 254-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: The Great Bailout Debate

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In the headlong rush here this week to devise a way to keep the Big Three automakers alive, it might be worth pausing for a moment to ask what this latest bailout exercise is intended to accomplish.
 Are we trying to save General Motors, Ford and Chrysler? Have Americans given up on the companies themselves, but want to preserve as many jobs as possible for their workers and suppliers? Or are we simply trying to forestall the shock of huge bankruptcies and layoffs at a moment when the economy cannot take another hit? 
 So far, all three goals have been jumbled together. But as the chiefs of the carmakers begin two days of congressional testimony today -- with most attention on Rick Wagoner, the chief executive of G.M., the most imperiled of the automakers -- it is possible to imagine very different kinds of bailouts, from those that simply buy time to those that might force the industry to make the kinds of changes that a generation of competition with the Japanese have failed, remarkably, to bring about. 
 ''The problem right now is that everyone is trying to accomplish in a few days something that no one has been able to get the auto industry to do in a few decades,'' Mickey Kantor, a former United States trade representative, who was a central player in the Big Three's negotiations with the Clinton administration in 1992, which also vowed to help Detroit and preserve jobs. ''You are not going to protect everyone, find new leadership for the car companies, force innovation -- and get Congress home for Thanksgiving.'' 
 This would be a difficult debate to have at any time. But it is virtually impossible to sort out priorities when the president is focused on surviving the last 64 days of his term and the president-elect is in Chicago running a government-in-waiting that wants to avoid specifics until he has the constitutional authority to act. At the same time, the Senate seems unlikely to be able to put together the votes for a truly large bailout. 
 So far the only real money on the table is $25 billion that Congress authorized in September as part of an energy bill to help the auto industry re-tool their factories to make high-mileage vehicles, something the Big Three have resisted for a quarter of a century. 
 Back in the 1980s and 1990s, a government-financed initiative like that would have been called ''industrial policy,'' which real capitalist democracies were supposed to avoid. When the Japanese perfected this approach -- with a mix of research help, tax incentives and government ''guidance'' -- American presidents would dispatch negotiators to demand a halt to the practice. The Japanese took them out to nice sushi dinners, gave them a police escort back to the airport, and ignored them. 
 But in the past few days, the talk about using the government's money to retrofit factories has begun to fade. Suddenly, the $25 billion is being talked about as a cash infusion to avoid layoffs or bankruptcies for the next few months. On Monday, Dana Perino, the White House spokeswoman, said President Bush would be willing to release the money if the Big Three ''can show viability and a willingness to make tough decisions to restructure themselves.'' 
 A few minutes later, though, she made it pretty clear that this was not like the Chrysler bailout of the 1980s, or even the Mexican bailout of the 1990s -- emergency loans on which the taxpayers ultimately made a profit. This is a giveaway, she acknowledged, saying there was virtually no chance that ''the taxpayers would actually be paid back.'' 
 Suddenly, this sounds like money to stop the bleeding, not pay for retooling. If so, is this the best way to save jobs? 
 David Yermack, a professor of finance at New York University, made a case the other day in The Wall Street Journal that with the $465 billion Ford and G.M. have invested in their factories over the past decade, they ''could have closed their own facilities and acquired all the shares of Honda, Toyota, Nissan and Volkswagen.'' 
 Of course, the Japanese and the Germans weren't selling. But the professor was making a deeper point: If the huge inefficiencies, the wrong mix of cars, the union contracts and the work rules leave no hope of saving G.M. and Ford from eventual bankruptcy, maybe the debate should explore alternative ways to spend the $25 billion and whatever follows. 
 Professor Yermack's half-facetious suggestion of ''cutting each worker a check for $10,000'' would not solve the problem, but there has always been a debate about whether helping foreign carmakers take over some of the American-based production facilities, and the dealer networks, might, in the end, save more jobs in the United States. It might also save the automotive suppliers, who would be among the first casualties if G.M. and Ford are forced into bankruptcy.
 President-elect Barack Obama has said his goal is to make sure there are jobs, and automotive production facilities, inside America's borders. To President Bush, that always meant promoting American-owned companies; early in his term, when he invited carmakers to show off their innovative technologies on the South Lawn of the White House, foreign manufacturers who were the first to put hybrid cars on the streets were left off the guest list. 
 So it was telling that on Monday, at the end of the Bush administration, there was a ribbon-cutting to open a new car plant in the United States in Greensburg, Ind. It belongs to Honda. The company has already begun hiring 2,000 workers to build four-cylinder Civics, including one model fueled by natural gas.

HEADLINE: In Bloomberg We Trust (Unless He Wants to Cancel Your Tax Rebate Checks)

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberm@nytimes.com

 BODY:
New Yorkers got unnerving news from President Bush when he came to town the other day. He thinks we're doing great, never mind Wall Street's stomach-churning loop-the-loops.
 ''There are many reasons for confidence,'' the president said, ''and one of the greatest is the spirit of New York City.''
 Given the grim realities that lay behind many of Mr. Bush's upbeat assessments over the years, this pat on the back was cause enough for New Yorkers to be discouraged. On the bright side, no one hung a ''Mission Accomplished'' banner behind him as he spoke at Federal Hall. 
 Confidence certainly does not flow at City Hall, where the City Council's Finance Committee convened on Monday to hash over Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's proposals to plug multibillion-dollar holes that the economic crisis has poked in his budget plans. Not that the Council needed to be reminded that times are tough. But Mark Page, the mayor's budget director, reinforced the point anyway.
 ''We are not in particularly good financial straits,'' Mr. Page told committee members. It was a masterly display of understatement, worthy of Emperor Hirohito's appeal to the Japanese people to accept their crushing defeat in World War II. ''The war situation,'' the emperor said in August 1945, ''has developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage.''
 Comparable understatement brought Mr. Page no reward. Council members had no desire to make life comfortable for him.
 They were particularly angry at the mayor's plan to save the municipal treasury $256 million by canceling $400 tax rebate checks that were supposed to have been mailed to homeowners weeks ago. It turns out that the cancellation needs the Council's consent; that approval is as likely as your winning the Mega Millions lottery. Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Page will have to figure out another way to scrape together the money.
 ''This is just one of those 'out of touch with reality' moments that you guys have from time to time,'' Councilman Lewis A. Fidler of Brooklyn said to the budget director, his voice laced with scorn.
 Christine C. Quinn, the council speaker, who on most matters is almost surgically attached at the hip to Mr. Bloomberg, also opposes him on the rebate. She has spoken harshly as well about another of the mayor's money-saving ideas, this one affecting city services for the elderly. It belongs, she said, ''in the garbage can.''
 It also turns out that the mayor got it wrong in calling for a 6-cent charge on plastic bags in stores. He had called it a fee, which he and the Council could impose on their own. On Monday, Mr. Page acknowledged this amounts to a tax, requiring Albany's approval. 
 Just think: Only days ago, Council members were offering Mr. Bloomberg (and themselves) as New York's salvation from fiscal doom. Ms. Quinn and Mr. Fidler were among the 29 council members who voted to amend the term limits law and thereby allow Mr. Bloomberg (and themselves) to run for an extra four years in office.
 Everyone knows that the only way they could pull off this self-serving rules change in midgame was to argue that the billionaire Mr. Bloomberg was uniquely positioned to lead the city, Moses-like, out of the fiscal wilderness. Now, on key matters of finance, they say the mayor doesn't know what he's talking about. There is a serious disconnect.
 For his part, Mr. Bloomberg may not want to trumpet how well he knows the buck. That's what Abraham D. Beame, then the city comptroller, did to win the mayoralty in 1973. ''He knows the buck'' was his campaign slogan. In no time, New York teetered toward bankruptcy, and ''he knows the buck'' became a punch line.
 Even during the battle over term limits, not everyone saw Mr. Bloomberg as a savior. Some critics accused him of not having done nearly enough to wean the city from its dependence on Wall Street money. Now that Wall Street has laid an egg, to steal from the classic Variety headline after the 1929 crash, we are hurting.
 The crisis has led to contradictory impulses.
 On one hand, most working stiffs probably do not want financial industry executives to get so much as a penny in year-end bonuses. Aware of the mood, senior officers at Goldman Sachs asked on Sunday that this be a no-bonus year for them. Other banks may go the same route.
 But as objectionable as multimillion-dollar rewards for miserable performances may be, the bonuses translate into barrels of cash for the city and the state. Those millions are taxed. So is the $3,200 bottle of 1990 Margaux that a Wall Street bonus baby may order at Per Se. The restaurant's profits are taxed, too.
 As the fellow once said in another context: Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em.
 What's the mayor's next move now that his rebate-withholding plan seems dead? Hard to tell. ''Forecasting the future is challenging,'' Mr. Page said on Monday.
 That it is. But we are prepared to go out on a limb. We predict that in this crisis every single interest group will make the city's well-being its paramount concern, and will beg City Hall: Please don't cut the other guy's budget. Cut mine first.
 This will happen on the same day that Osama bin Laden is captured, Israel and the Palestinians sign a lasting peace treaty and the American League gets rid of the designated hitter.

HEADLINE: New York Suitors Prepare for James

BYLINE: By JONATHAN ABRAMS

 BODY:
LeBron James is coming to New Jersey on Tuesday, and if the Nets are primping themselves for a courtship, they are running a bit late. 
 Next week, James and the Cavaliers visit New York and the Knicks. They are also a possible suitor when James potentially headlines a star-studded free-agent class in the summer of 2010. But much like the Nets, the Knicks also face barricades in landing James. 
 Although much can change in a fluid market, and handicapping possible situations nearly two years away is almost impossible, the Nets and the Knicks are expected to join close to 15 teams in the league in jockeying for position come 2010. 
 The Nets were once considered the odds-on favorite to get James, possibly the game's most transcending player. He is a close friend to the rapper Jay-Z, a part-owner of the Nets.
 But the team's planned move to Brooklyn is at a standstill, which could significantly lessen the chances of James becoming a Net. That is the view of Sonny Vaccaro, the former shoe executive who keeps tabs on his former ABCD campers, James included. Vaccaro said he thought James would end up with the Knicks.
 ''LeBron's relationship with Jay-Z will go on regardless,'' Vaccaro said. ''He'll be an international celebrity in New York. If the Nets aren't in Brooklyn, he's not going over there for even $200 million. They're putting pieces together. They're doing the right things. They're just living in the wrong building.''
 The Nets' move has been sidetracked by delays, the faltering economy and legal challenges to Atlantic Yards, the proposed development that would include the new arena. The latest litigation has pushed groundbreaking to next spring at the earliest, with a predicted opening in 2011.
 Recently, Barclays affirmed its commitment to the naming rights of the Brooklyn arena even though the project was lagging. 
 ''We are very excited about being part of the continued renaissance of Brooklyn and we eagerly look forward to opening night at the Barclays Center,'' Gerard LaRocca, the capital chief administrative officer for the Americas at Barclays, said in a statement.
 Meanwhile, the Nets are a team in transition on the court as well. They shed enough salary-cap space with the trade of Richard Jefferson last summer to be in good position to add a high-level free agent in 2010. And, despite the innovative tactics of Brett Yormark, the president and chief executive of Nets Sports and Entertainment, swaths of empty seats remain at the Izod Center. 
 In Manhattan, the Knicks are confounded with their own issues that could hurt their chances of wooing James. The team is weighed by heavy contracts and Donnie Walsh, the team's president, has been unsuccessful in finding a taker for Eddy Curry and Zach Randolph, whose deals extend through the 2011 season. Curry is owed $11.28 million that year, Randolph $17.33 million.
 All this speculation is contingent on James's opting out of the final year of his contract. Although he has been spotted wearing a Yankees hat on numerous occasions, including in the stands at Progressive Field when the Indians hosted the Yankees in an American League division series game in 2007, James insisted he was happy in Cleveland. 
 ''I love being here, I love playing in front of these fans,'' James, a native of Akron, Ohio, told The Cleveland Plain Dealer during the team's media day. ''My family's here. I grew up 30 miles away from here. I never gave any indication I did not like playing for the Cleveland Cavaliers.''
 Barring a sign-and-trade agreement, the Cavaliers will be able to offer James a longer and more lucrative contract than any other team. They also appear retooled in the early season, with the addition of point guard Mo Williams. 
 No matter the Cavaliers' efforts, Vaccaro said he thought James was destined to leave Cleveland. 
 ''LeBron is this generation's personality,'' said Vaccaro, not one to shy away from hyperbole. ''Even though Cleveland has done everything right, you don't get to Mount Rushmore from Cleveland. He has to go to New York or Los Angeles. There's no question. The money will be available anywhere. But this is about his persona.''
 James could be joined by Toronto's Chris Bosh, Miami's Dwyane Wade and Phoenix's Amare Stoudemire in the 2010 free-agent class. Like the Cavaliers, those teams may have an abundance of salary-cap space. Realistically, they could each re-sign their own star, then use him to lure another franchise player. 
 Would James rather team with Wilson Chandler or Yi Jianlian in New York? Or would he be more content having Wade or Bosh join him in Cleveland or changing jerseys to play with those players' current teams?
 ''Things can change between now and two years from now, but there are a lot of teams pointing toward that year to have cap space as of today,'' Nets General Manager Kiki Vandeweghe said. ''There's the potential to have a lot of good free agents available.''
 None more valuable than James, who will most likely be the most sought-after free agent in league history.
 ''He's not going to get another decision,'' Vaccaro said. ''We aren't going to be coming back to this when he's 32. This is the one. This is the one that's going to shake the landscape.''

HEADLINE: In New York, Prosecutor Defends Spitzer Decision

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN WEISER

 BODY:
Of all the important cases handled by Michael J. Garcia, who for three years has held arguably the most prestigious United States attorney's post in the country, perhaps the one that drew the most attention is the case he did not file.
 In a wide-ranging interview on Monday, hours before he formally announced his resignation as federal attorney in Manhattan, Mr. Garcia defended his decision not to file criminal charges against Eliot Spitzer, who stepped down as governor in March after he became caught in a prostitution ring. 
 ''I think at the end of the day that decision is the right decision,'' said Mr. Garcia, who made a name pursuing corrupt officials at the state and city level. ''And it's justice in that case,'' he added. ''And I stand by it.''
 Mr. Garcia, 47, said he would leave office on Dec. 1 and would be succeeded, at least temporarily, by his deputy, Lev L. Dassin, 43, a veteran prosecutor who will serve until President-elect Barack Obama chooses a new United States attorney for the Southern District of New York.
 In the interview, Mr. Garcia said that although there was evidence that Mr. Spitzer had violated the Mann Act, which prohibits transporting people across state lines for the purpose of prostitution, there were none of the other factors that traditionally weighed in favor of bringing charges, like the use of juvenile prostitutes, or commercial or other exploitation of them. 
 Mr. Garcia, disputing criticism in some quarters that Mr. Spitzer was selected for prosecution by Republican administration officials, reiterated what he said when he announced that he would not bring charges: His office began its investigation after learning of payments made in a questionable manner by Mr. Spitzer to a bank account in the name of a front company for the prostitution ring.
 ''That's how it came up,'' Mr. Garcia said. ''That is how it started.''
 The case was one of a number of public corruption investigations Mr. Garcia oversaw as United States attorney. When he took office in 2005, he said in the interview, he made corruption a top priority. 
 ''I just had a sense that we weren't looking hard for those problems,'' he said. 
 His office has prosecuted several state politicians and city officials; former Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik; and Norman Hsu, the Democratic political fund-raiser. Most of those cases are still pending, with the defendants pleading not guilty. The office also brought a prosecution in connection with corruption in the United Nations oil-for-food program.
 Mr. Garcia said that a number of the cases exposed the need for greater transparency in how discretionary money is distributed by politicians, which he called ''a vulnerability in the system.''
 Mr. Garcia said the scandal over the dismissals in 2006 of United States attorneys, including some who were removed for political reasons, was extremely harmful because it could affect ''the public perception of the reasons we do cases.'' 
 ''It focused a light on that political process of appointing U.S. attorneys, and that was very unfortunate,'' said Mr. Garcia, who was not himself one of those selected for dismissal.
 ''Not only is it bad generally,'' he added, ''but it particularly undermines the message you're sending out in public corruption cases.''
 Although Mr. Garcia would not discuss the details of how he decided not to charge Mr. Spitzer, he said he had made the final decision and was comfortable with it. 
 ''In making that decision,'' he said, ''and every decision, you try to think about the equities of the case, what would the charge be, can you make that charge, and how is that consistent with what the office does.'' He added, ''You try at the end of the day to do justice.'' 
 He said he disagreed with critics who suggested that the decision ''gives a free pass to human trafficking.''
 He said that criticism was ''not accurate if you look at the history of the cases we've done,'' citing as examples cases in which the office had charged people in Mann Act cases, and in which extra factors weighed in favor of that, as with juvenile prostitutes.
 As a prosecutor in the 1990s, Mr. Garcia handled a series of major terrorism cases, including the 1996 trial in a foiled plot to blow up passenger jets over the Pacific Ocean. One man who was indicted but not arrested in that case was Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the former senior aide to Osama bin Laden who has said he was the principal planner of the 9/11 plot.
 Since there are questions about the government's treatment of Mr. Mohammed and the future of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, where he is being held, some have suggested trying him in federal court solely for his role in the 1990s airliner plot.
 Mr. Garcia said that it was impossible to predict how the legal issues would play out in such a case, but he said his office could prosecute Mr. Mohammad if that became necessary.
 ''We make that decision that we had sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury all the elements of those crimes,'' Mr. Garcia said. ''We're prepared to do that. The indictment's still out there.''
 As for the current financial crisis, Mr. Garcia, whose office has major investigations under way, said the meltdown exposed a variety of schemes, like predatory lending and fraud. ''The swamp is draining, and we are seeing some strange things on the bottom,'' he said.
 Mr. Garcia, who will be joining the law firm Kirkland & Ellis, expressed concern that some people in government had raised expectations that broad indictments would necessarily follow.
 ''This is a very serious time,'' he said. ''People are very nervous about the market, about the economy, about their livelihood and families. And the worst thing we could do is be alarmist on either side.''
 ''We do what we always do,'' he said. ''We'll look hard. If there are violations of the law, we'll charge them.''

HEADLINE: What Should Congress Do With G.M.?: A Chairman Fights For Carmaker's Future And His Reputation

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Rick Wagoner cannot afford to leave Washington this week without at least $10 billion in federal aid to keep General Motors in business.
 But a major question for Mr. Wagoner, G.M.'s chief executive for the last eight years, is whether he will return to Detroit with his job as well.
 While the heads of the Ford Motor Company, Chrysler and the United Automobile Workers are scheduled to also testify before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday, it is Mr. Wagoner and his company that have become the lightning rods of the debate over whether Detroit should get a bailout.
 G.M., the largest American automaker, is in desperate need of cash to survive the worst vehicle market in the United States in 15 years. Mr. Wagoner has, so far, led the industry's intensive lobbying effort to get federal loans for all three companies. 
 Like Lee Iacocca, Chrysler's chief in 1979, Mr. Wagoner has the tall task of convincing skeptical Republican lawmakers to back a Democratic plan to save Detroit.
 But unlike with Mr. Iacocca, Mr. Wagoner's 31-year career at G.M. has not been built on personal charisma and the art of the deal. Instead, he is seen as the leader of a company that has lost $20 billion in the first nine months of this year alone, as its stock price has dropped into the low single-digits from more than $30 a share a year ago. 
 The company's cash cushion is shrinking so fast -- by more than $2 billion a month -- that it has said federal help is needed to keep it from running out of sufficient cash for its operations by the end of the year.
 Mr. Wagoner has said that despite its perilous financial condition, G.M. has no plans to file for bankruptcy, or even prepare for the possibility that it may need to seek Chapter 11 protection. But that is the clear threat. 
 ''G.M. is the biggest of the three and it's in the worst shape,'' said John Casesa, principal in the auto consulting firm Casesa Shapiro Group. ''I think it would be a pretty big blow to Rick if they don't get the money.''
 The debate on Capitol Hill will focus on whether the Detroit automakers can get $25 billion in aid immediately from either the Treasury Department's $700 billion financial rescue program, or from an existing loan program aimed at improving the fuel-efficiency of Big Three vehicles.
 Ford and Chrysler, however, have not made the same dire predictions about their businesses -- putting the urgency of the bailout squarely on the shoulders of Mr. Wagoner and G.M.
 Some members of Congress have suggested that a management change is necessary at G.M. before any loans can be made.
 ''I do not support the use of U.S. taxpayer dollars to reward the mismanagement of Detroit-based auto manufacturers,'' said Senator Richard Shelby, the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, which holds its hearing on the bailout on Tuesday afternoon.
 The lanky, 6-foot-4-inch Mr. Wagoner, a 55-year-old former Duke University basketball player and Harvard Business School graduate, has refused to consider resigning even if it would help G.M.'s chances of getting emergency aid.
 G.M. has declined to make Mr. Wagoner available for interviews. In a Nov. 10 interview with the trade journal Automotive News, however, he said that a change in management at G.M. would not be wise at such a crucial time for the company. ''I don't think it'd be a very smart move,'' he said. ''I think our job is to make sure we have the best management team to run G.M. It's not clear to me what purpose would be served.''
 A spokesman for G.M., Tony Cervone, said Monday that the G.M. board remains supportive of Mr. Wagoner, who became G.M. chief in 2000 and added the chairman's title three years later. Mr. Wagoner was paid about $24 million a year in 2006 and 2007 from a combination of salary, stock option grants and other forms of compensation. His 2008 base salary is $2.2 million.
 ''A solid management team is the most important thing you need in the time of a crisis,'' Mr. Cervone said.
 But Mr. Wagoner has some convincing to do in Congress to show that G.M.'s team can pull it out of a downward spiral of shrinking market share and mounting losses.
 Stoic and unemotional in public, Mr. Wagoner has been rigidly protective of G.M.'s strategy to expand internationally while downsizing its North American operations.
 A few years back, Mr. Wagoner said G.M.'s goal was to be ''both big and fast.'' Yet the company has made agonizingly slow progress in reshaping its product lineup in the United States to focus less on large vehicles and more on the smaller, more fuel-efficient cars.
 Moreover, G.M.'s startling admission on Nov. 7 that it was spending down its cash reserves by more than $2 billion a month caught analysts and investors by surprise. 
 As recently as July, G.M. said it had a plan to bolster its liquidity by $15 billion through cost cuts, asset sales, and new borrowing.
 Wall Street has responded to G.M.'s sudden cash crisis, and its plummeting sales, by driving its stock price to levels not seen in more than 60 years. 
 ''In the eyes of the street, G.M. is now in a permanent liquidity crisis,'' Mr. Casesa said.
 Mr. Wagoner is saying that without federal aid, G.M. could run out of money and drag down Ford, Chrysler and countless suppliers, dealers and small businesses.
 ''This is an issue of the whole auto industry, if that becomes under severe pressure, the impact on the whole U.S. economy will be devastating,'' Mr. Wagoner said in an appearance Sunday on a television news program in Detroit.
 Yet in the same appearance, Mr. Wagoner also said, ''Our basis business is in as good a shape as it's been for 30 or 40 years.''
 If Mr. Wagoner cannot sway Congress this week to come to G.M.'s aid, the company will be forced to hang on until President-elect Barack Obama takes office in January and presents his own auto bailout strategy.
 ''That might be the most rational approach, to see what type of plan Mr. Obama and the new Congress will take,'' said David Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.
 Mr. Cole, who has known Mr. Wagoner for nearly 30 years, said he hopes that any decision on his future with G.M. is not taken lightly by officials in Washington.
 ''I hope they take a deep look at what G.M. has done to fix its business, make an assessment, and then pass judgment,'' he said. ''Knowing Rick, whatever is best for the company is what he will do.''

HEADLINE: Congress Unites, Briefly, to Welcome New Members

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Newly elected members of Congress received an enthusiastic welcome to Capitol Hill on Monday, but the celebratory mood did not extend to the outlook for a broad economic recovery measure or a separate bailout for the nation's automakers.
 As the Senate began a postelection session, Democrats remained at odds with Republicans and the White House over whether the last days of the 110th Congress should be used to initiate a national public works program or help ailing auto manufacturers. 
 ''If ever there were a time for bipartisan solutions, this is it,'' Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader, said. ''Senators have a choice to make: We could wait until January -- when we have a new Congress and a new president -- or we could start solving this crisis now.''
 Mr. Reid proposed a $100 billion economic stimulus plan that would include $25 billion in loans for the auto industry as well as $13.5 billion for roads, mass transit and other public infrastructure; money for financially ailing state governments; more jobless benefits; and added food stamp assistance. 
 If that plan stalls, as seems virtually certain since the White House and Congressional Republicans have resisted it in the past, Democrats say they will propose a separate program that would divert to the auto industry $25 billion of the $700 billion approved earlier for the financial industry. Companies would have to meet a set of conditions like limits on executive compensation and a ban on dividend payments. Under the Democratic legislation released Monday evening, the loans would be for 10 years at 5 percent interest the first five years and 9 percent the second five.
 But the White House, backed by Republicans on Capitol Hill, has instead proposed bolstering the auto companies by using $25 billion in federally subsidized loans already approved by Congress. Those loans were authorized earlier this year to help auto companies retool their plants to produce more fuel-efficient cars, but the money has been tied up while the government drafts rules for distributing it. Republicans say Congress could accelerate the process for making the money available, but some Democrats say those dollars should remain committed to the retooling.
 ''We want the automakers to succeed and we support using an existing program to help them do so,'' said White House spokeswoman Dana Perino. Ms. Perino said the administration preferred using the existing pool of funds set aside specifically for the auto industry rather than dipping into the $700 billion meant for financial institutions.
 Congressional Republicans say the auto companies, partially due to union contracts, have contributed to their own financial difficulties. Many Republicans also are pessimistic that a federal bailout would save Detroit.
 ''The fact is they're in trouble for reasons that relate to their own decisions rather than a lot of consumers out there who have gotten caught up in this credit crunch, in effect, through no fault of their own,'' said Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate.
 Another Republican, Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, called for Congress to freeze the Treasury Department's underlying $700 billion bailout altogether, saying the current approach was veering too far from what Congress originally approved.
 ''It is clear that it was a mistake to sign a blank check to one man for such a tremendous amount of money,'' said Mr. Inhofe, referring to Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.
 A showdown vote over the auto deal is set for Wednesday, and at the moment Democrats appear short of the 60 votes they need to move ahead, meaning the session is likely to be abbreviated.
 With the outlook dim for any legislation, lawmakers were already looking toward the start of the new Congress on Jan. 6. More than 50 new House members and 8 senators were on hand to start learning the ropes.
 Mr. Reid met with the six new Democratic senators, who will give Democrats a greater advantage in the new Congress. The final margin will depend on three races still to be decided in Alaska, Georgia and Minnesota.
 Those six new members -- Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Mark Warner of Virginia, Mark Udall of Colorado, Tom Udall of New Mexico and Jeff Merkley of Oregon -- will be among the Democrats voting in party elections Tuesday before being sworn in on Jan. 6.
 ''I'm so excited, so pleased and so happy to have a real majority now,'' said Mr. Reid as he briefly paraded his new troops before the cameras.
 At the same time, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, huddled with two new Republican senators -- Jim Risch of Idaho and Mike Johanns of Nebraska -- who replaced retiring Republicans Larry E. Craig and Chuck Hagel respectively.
 In the House, the dozens of new Democrats and Republicans who will be joining the Congress in January were going through orientation and gathered for a bipartisan dinner Monday night in Statuary Hall of the Capitol, the original House chamber.
 ''Your job title is the description of your work here: representative,'' Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in remarks prepared for delivery at the private dinner. ''I'm sure you agree that there is no higher honor.''
 Democrats expanded their House majority by more than 20 seats, up from 236, giving them commanding numbers in the House and sparking predictions by some that the party will move too far left and provide Republicans an opening in the next election. Counting Democrats elected to replace retiring members of their own party, more than 30 new Democrats will join the House.
 In a speech he is scheduled to give Tuesday at the National Press Club, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, intends to dispute the notion that a strong Democratic majority will be more partisan.
 ''The 33 new members of Congress coming to Washington to swell our side of the aisle are pragmatic, not dogmatic,'' Mr. Hoyer said in a draft of his speech. ''They were elected on promises of bipartisanship and fiscal discipline. They were elected, quite simply, to solve problems, not further politicize Washington.''

HEADLINE: Many Dealings Of Bill Clinton Under Review

BYLINE: By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and JO BECKER

 BODY:
Over the weekend, former President Bill Clinton enthusiastically endorsed the prospect that his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, might join the Obama administration as secretary of state. ''If he decided to ask her and they did it together,'' the former president said, ''I think she'll be really great as a secretary of state.''
 Mr. Clinton delivered those remarks at an international economic symposium in Kuwait City sponsored by the National Bank of Kuwait, which said the former president would ''share with a select audience his perspective on the issues likely to shape the future prospects of the region.''
 It is precisely that kind of paid speech, which Mr. Clinton delivered 54 times last year for a total of $10.1 million in fees, that has complicated the vetting process that Mrs. Clinton is undergoing by the Obama transition team. ''Whatever happens or doesn't happen is between Obama and her,'' Mr. Clinton said. 
 That may be, but Mr. Clinton's postpresidential life as a globe-trotting philanthropist, business consultant and speech-giver poses the highest hurdle for Mrs. Clinton to overcome if President-elect Barack Obama chooses to nominate her as secretary of state, according to aides of the Clintons and Mr. Obama. 
 The Obama transition team is focused on the wide array of Mr. Clinton's postpresidential activities, some details of which have not been made public. This list includes the identity of most of the donors to his foundation, the source of some of his speaking fees -- he has earned as much as $425,000 for a one-hour speech -- and his work for the billionaire investor Ronald W. Burkle. 
 The vetting of Mr. Clinton's myriad philanthropic and business dealings is ''complicated, and it may be the complications that are causing hesitation on both sides,'' said Abner J. Mikva, one of Mr. Obama's closest supporters and a White House counsel during the Clinton administration. ''There would have to be full disclosure as to who all were contributors to his library and foundation. I think they'd have to be made public.''
 While aides to the president-elect declined Monday to discuss what sort of requirements would make it possible for Mrs. Clinton to serve as secretary of state, they said Mr. Obama would not formally offer her the job unless he was satisfied that there would be no conflicts posed by Mr. Clinton's activities abroad.
 Associates of the Clintons said that Mr. Clinton was likely to have to make significant concessions and that he was inclined to do so. Among other things, they said, he would probably have to agree not to take money for speeches from foreign businesses that have a stake in the actions of the American government. Another obvious issue, Democratic lawyers said, would be whether Mr. Clinton's foundation should accept money from foreign governments, businesses or individuals for the foundation's philanthropic activities and if it should disclose those donors publicly.
 ''The problem is it's going to require some sacrifice by him,'' said a former Clinton aide who is not involved in the discussions but did not want to be identified because the talks are confidential. ''If he's not willing to do that, it could blow up.''
 One proposal, floated by Mr. Mikva and several other aides involved in the vetting process, would be for Mr. Clinton to separate himself from the activities of his foundation, including raising money.
 ''It's not just what he does or says -- it's the fact that the foundation is involved with foreign countries, some of which might well be in conflict with U.S. policy,'' Mr. Mikva said. ''It's more than a legal problem -- there are ethical problems and appearance problems.''
 Several longtime associates of the Clintons said the former president would be an asset to Mrs. Clinton if she were appointed secretary of state. The Obama administration ''would be able to use Bill Clinton as the ultimate special envoy inside the tent,'' one longtime associate said. 
 Since the former president established the William J. Clinton Foundation in 1998, it has raised more than $500 million, a sum that allowed him to build his steel-and-glass presidential library in Little Rock, Ark., and create the Clinton Global Initiative, which has done good deeds all over the world, including working to eradicate AIDS in Africa. Much of that money has been raised from foreign sources.
 Mr. Clinton is not required by law to identify the donors to his foundation, and this year he declined to name them. Last year, while Mrs. Clinton was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, The New York Times compiled the first detailed list of 97 donors who gave or pledged a total of $69 million for the Clinton presidential library in the final years of his administration. The examination found that while some $1 million contributors were longtime Clinton friends, others were seeking policy changes from the administration. Two people pledged $1 million each while they or their companies were under investigation by the Clinton Justice Department. 
 The foundation has received contributions from the Saudi royal family, the king of Morocco, a foundation linked to the United Arab Emirates and the governments of Kuwait and Qatar.
 In a statement, the foundation said at the time, ''Donors did not seek, nor did President Clinton give, favors from the federal government,'' adding that most of the contributions were made after Mr. Clinton left office. A spokesman for the foundation, Matt McKenna, declined to comment on Monday.
 During Mrs. Clinton's presidential campaign, the Clintons agreed to sell $11 million to $26 million worth of stock and pledged to liquidate holdings that had been in a blind trust. She said then that they wanted to avoid conflicts of interest.
 In September, at his annual Clinton Global Initiative meeting, Mr. Clinton hosted more than two dozen foreign leaders, including Queen Rania of Jordan, President Shimon Peres of Israel and President Alvaro Colom of Guatemala.
 Mr. Obama met Thursday in Chicago with Mrs. Clinton. Shortly after that, the process of looking into Mr. Clinton's activities began, slowed in part because Mr. Clinton did not return to the United States until early Monday. 
 Several Democrats close to the Clintons said the former president's activities should not be a disqualifier because the couple had been more open about their finances than past veterans of the White House, thanks to Senate disclosure requirements.
 ''They are arguably the most transparent former first couple in history,'' said one Democratic official, who declined to be identified because the talks are confidential. ''For eight years, they've been doing this.''
 Lanny J. Davis, a longtime Clinton friend who said he was not speaking on the couple's behalf, said he ''completely rejects 100 percent'' any suggestion that there was a conflict between Mr. Clinton's work raising money for his foundation and the work Mrs. Clinton would be doing as the nation's chief diplomat. 
 When the Clintons released their postpresidency tax returns in April, the documents showed the couple had earned $109 million after leaving the White House in January 2001. Most of it has come from book-writing and speaking fees, a sum that accounts for nearly $92 million, including a $15 million advance from Mr. Clinton's best-selling autobiography, ''My Life.'' 
 The returns also showed that Mr. Clinton had collected at least $12.6 million since 2002 from his work as an adviser to Mr. Burkle, whose Yucaipa Companies have invested money for the Dubai government and acquired a stake in a Chinese media company.
 The former president helped drum up business for several domestic and foreign investment funds in Yucaipa's portfolio, although precisely what Mr. Clinton did is unknown. 
 Beyond Mr. Clinton's work for his foundation and his foreign business dealings, there is also the unique issue of having a secretary of state whose husband is a former president. During her campaign, Mrs. Clinton said if she were elected president, she would appoint Mr. Clinton as a ''roving global ambassador.'' 
 But if Mrs. Clinton were to be nominated as secretary of state, potential conflicts could occur if Mr. Clinton continued to serve as a traveling emissary of the United States. It is unknown whether he would be asked to curtail speaking out on foreign policy matters or, if asked, if he would be willing to do so.

HEADLINE: Newest Veterans Hit Hard by Economic Crisis

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
After a mortar sent Andrew Spurlock hurtling off a roof in Iraq, ending his Army career in 2006, the seasoned infantryman set aside bitterness over his back injury and began to chart his life in storybook fashion: a new house, a job as a police officer and more children.
 ''We had a budget and a plan,'' said Mr. Spurlock, 29, a father of three, who with his wife, Michelle, hoped to avoid the pitfalls of his transition from Ramadi, Iraq, to Apopka, Fla.
 But the move proved treacherous, as it often does for veterans. The job with the Orange County Sheriff's Office fell through after officials there told Mr. Spurlock that he needed to ''decompress'' after two combat tours, a judgment that took him by surprise. Scrambling, he settled for a job delivering pizzas. 
 Mr. Spurlock's disability claim for his back injury took 18 months to process, a year longer than expected. With little choice, the couple began putting mortgage payments on credit cards. The family debt climbed to $60,000, a chunk of it for medical bills, including for his wife and child. Foreclosure seemed certain.
 While few Americans are sheltered from the jolt of the recent economic crisis, the nation's newest veterans, particularly the wounded, are being hit especially hard. The triple-whammy of injury, unemployment and waiting for disability claims to be processed has forced many veterans into foreclosure, or sent them teetering on its edge, according to veterans' organizations.
 The problem is hard to quantify because there are no foreclosure statistics singling out veterans and service members. Congress recently asked the Veterans Affairs Department to find out how badly veterans were being affected, particularly by foreclosures. The Army, too, began tracking requests for help on foreclosure issues for the first time. Service organizations report that requests for help from military personnel and new veterans, especially those who were wounded, mentally or physically, and are struggling to keep their houses and pay their bills, has jumped sharply. 
 ''The demand curve has gone almost straight up this year,'' said Bill Nelson, executive director for USA Cares, a nonprofit group that provides financial help to members of the military and to veterans. Housing, Mr. Nelson said, ''is the biggest driver in the last 12 months.''
 Congress has recently taken small steps to help, banning lenders from foreclosing on military personnel for nine months after their return from overseas, up from three months, and ensuring that interest rates on their loans remain stable for a year. Another relief bill to prevent certain injured veterans from losing their homes while they wait for their disability money was signed into law in October. The protection is good for one year.
 ''We owe these men and women more than a pat on the back,'' said Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, who introduced one of the bills.
 But the short-term measures do little to address the underlying economic difficulties that new veterans face, beginning with the job hunt. Veterans, particularly those in their 20s, have faced higher unemployment rates in recent years than those who never served in the military, though the gap has shrunk as the economy has worsened. (Veterans traditionally have lower unemployment rates than nonveterans.)
 Recently discharged veterans, though, fared worst of all. A 2007 survey for the Veterans Affairs Department of 1,941 combat veterans who left the military mostly in 2005 showed nearly 18 percent were unemployed as of last year. The average national jobless rate in October was 6.5 percent. 
 A quarter of those who found jobs failed to make a living wage, earning less than $21,840 a year.
 ''You fill out a job application and you can't write 'long-range reconnaissance and sniper skills,' '' said Mr. Spurlock, who searched a year for a better-paying job than delivering pizza, finally finding one as a construction supervisor. 
 The situation is especially troubling for the injured, whose financial problems begin almost immediately.
 ''The wife drops everything to be by his bedside,'' said Meredith Leyva, founder of Operation Homefront, a nonprofit group that provides emergency money and aid to 33,000 military families a year, including the Spurlocks. ''She stays at the nearest hotel to make sure he is alive. They live that way for months. She either has to quit her job or she is fired. This bankrupts people.'' 
 Some injured veterans cannot work at all and must rely on disability checks and other government payouts. The wait for a disability check from the Veterans Affairs Department averaged six months in August, enough to financially crush some families. 
 Those who can work struggle to find employers willing to accommodate their injuries, including mental health problems. The Labor Department recently started a Web site, America's Heroes at Work, that prods employers into hiring more wounded veterans and explains that post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury are manageable conditions and not necessarily long-term.
 Some believe that the government has to do more. 
 ''There have to be incentives for employers,'' said Thomas L. Wilkerson, a retired Marine Corps general who is chief executive of the Naval Institute, an independent nonprofit group. 
 Active duty troops who switch installations also find themselves struggling. Many of those forced to sell their homes this year are finding a scarcity of buyers, or even renters, particularly in states hit hard by the mortgage crisis. Military spouses must choose between taking a loss on their homes or riding out the housing slowdown and facing another separation from their loved one.
 Although the government offers safeguards for some federal employees in similar circumstances, it will not help service members make up the difference if they are forced to sell a home at a loss.
 What is worse, foreclosure or excessive debt can damage a service member's career by leading to discharge, the loss of security clearances or, in extreme cases, jail. 
 A 2007 California task force reported that in the Navy, the number of security clearances revoked because of debt increased to 1,999 in 2005, from 124 in 2000. 
 ''It's the crash in the market,'' said Joe Gladden, managing partner of Veteran Realty Service America's Military, who sees families in extremis out of Northern Virginia. ''It's not that they have made stupid decisions.''
 Mr. Gladden said e-mail messages and phone calls to his office had become so routine that he encouraged military families to share their stories anonymously on his company Web site, vrsam.com.
 ''I am about sick over this situation,'' one woman wrote. ''Our two young boys have to go without seeing Daddy until we can sell our house. Not only that, but we face the possibility of Daddy deploying to Iraq again. Shouldn't we be able to spend as much time together until that happens?''
 For the Hatchers, the financial decline began after Roger, a Navy reservist and father of four, returned from his first tour of duty in Iraq. When he got back to Ventura, Calif., in 2004, his job as a groundskeeper for a school district was gone. He was offered a custodial job for less pay. Mr. Hatcher decided to find another job. He looked for several months, then was redeployed to Iraq. By then, the family had moved to Bakersfield, to a cheaper house near relatives.
 His second tour was tougher. Iraq had grown more violent, and in late 2006, Mr. Hatcher was blown out of a Humvee after it hit a roadside bomb. The blast injured his shoulder, arm and neck. Back home, Mr. Hatcher, 49, fell prey to nightmares and rages. He drankheavily, said Tami, his wife of two decades. The pain in his shoulder never let up. 
 It took Mr. Hatcher eight months to find a job, and the family fell behind on their house payments. A disability claim filed in 2007 was still pending in August, Mrs. Hatcher said. 
 Mr. Hatcher wound up hospitalized for post-traumatic stress disorder three times. ''We noticed there was a change after the first tour, but not as drastic as this time,'' Mrs. Hatcher said. ''The person comes back a different person, and then you have financial issues on top of it.''
 His new employer, a construction company, welcomed him back after each medical absence. Still, weeks off the job meant weeks without pay.
 Meanwhile, the mortgage company ratcheted up the pressure. Feeling cornered, the Hatchers signed a forbearance agreement, which significantly increased their monthly payment. ''They knew about my husband's situation,'' Mrs. Hatcher said of the mortgage company. ''They wouldn't work with us.''
 The Hatchers borrowed from friends and relatives but still came up short. Then two nonprofit groups stepped in to help. One of them, Operation Homefront, negotiated with the lender to keep them in their house.
 Mrs. Hatcher, a purchasing agent, tried her best to shield her husband from their financial troubles. ''It's putting a big strain on me,'' she admitted. ''But only one of us can lose it at a time right now, and it's his turn.''
 The Spurlocks, back in Florida, were not so lucky. Operation Homefront managed to stop foreclosure proceedings, but the couple had to agree to a deed in lieu, turning over their house to the bank. Their debt was forgiven.
 The family moved into a rental house and whittled down its credit card debt to $26,000. 
 ''It feels impossible right now to pay off our bills,'' said Michelle Spurlock, 28, her voice breaking. ''I had to get my mom to bring diapers over. We couldn't go grocery shopping. As soon as we turn a corner, it's something else.''

HEADLINE: Obama Meets With McCain in Chicago

BYLINE: By BRIAN KNOWLTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama and Senator John McCain agreed on Monday, in their first meeting since the election, to work together on some of the nation's most pressing challenges, from the financial crisis to national security problems.
 After a private meeting in the Obama transition offices on the 38th floor of the Kluczynski Federal Building in downtown Chicago, the two men issued a joint statement saying that they agreed ''that Americans of all parties want and need their leaders to come together and change the bad habits of Washington so that we can solve the common and urgent challenges of our time.'' 
 The statement continued: ''We hope to work together in the days and months ahead on critical challenges like solving our financial crisis, creating a new energy economy, and protecting our nation's security.'' 
 There were few other clues to the dynamics between the two men, who until two weeks ago were vying for the presidency, and whose relations during the campaign were at times a bit frosty. When a reporter asked Senator McCain at the outset of the meeting on Monday whether he would help Mr. Obama with his administration, he replied, ''Obviously.''
 The meeting came four days after Mr. Obama met with his main rival for the Democratic nomination, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, sparking widespread speculation that he would nominate her to be secretary of state.
 And it came three days after Mr. Obama met with another former rival, Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a former ambassador to the United Nations who might now be in competition with Mrs. Clinton for the State Department post.The Obama-McCain meeting in Chicago, an effort at reconciliation after a sometimes bitterly fought campaign, came unusually soon after Election Day. 
 The president-elect and the Arizona senator hold relatively similar views on issues like climate change and ethics reform, where cooperation might be fruitful. More urgently, Mr. Obama may be hoping for help in pushing for a new economic stimulus package that faces stiff Republican resistance. 
 Also taking part in the meeting were Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a trusted McCain ally, and Representative Rahm Emanuel, Democrat of Illinois, who is to be Mr. Obama's White House chief of staff.
 Advisers to both Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama said that they did not expect Mr. McCain to be offered a job in the new administration.
 Mr. Obama said in an interview broadcast Sunday on the CBS program ''60 Minutes'' that there would be at least one Republican in his cabinet. He would not say when he might announce his first cabinet nominations, except to say ''soon.''
 While the Obama-McCain meeting came earlier than some past efforts at reconciliation between newly elected presidents and their vanquished foes, the president's father, George H.W. Bush, met on almost exactly the same date -- Nov. 18 -- with Bill Clinton after losing to him in the 1992 election. 
 Mr. Clinton later called the meeting ''very helpful,'' though he found that his host wanted to talk almost exclusively about foreign affairs while he had hoped to pick the outgoing president's brain on domestic affairs.
 In 2000, it was not until Dec. 19 that President-elect George W. Bush called on Vice President Al Gore, though that was just a week after the Supreme Court resolved the Florida recount debacle; the two spent less than 20 minutes together at the Naval Observatory, the official vice-presidential residence, where the elder Bushes themselves had once lived. 
 (President-elect Bush also called that day on Mr. Clinton at the White House. This time it was Mr. Clinton who guided the conversation to foreign affairs for most of a two-hour talk. It was unclear whether anyone brought up Mr. Bush's vow, during the campaign, to ''restore honor and dignity to the White House.'')
 In Chicago, Mr. Obama might be mindful of the fact that former rivals can also be future foes. In 2005, Senator John Kerry did not wait even a week after the inauguration of President Bush before launching into barbed attacks on his health care plan, calling it ''window dressing.''

HEADLINE: Chip Maker Sues Samsung Over Patents for Memory

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Spansion, a struggling Silicon Valley maker of flash memory chips, filed a pair of broad patent infringement suits on Monday against Samsung of South Korea, the world's largest producer of the chips. 
 In a complaint to the International Trade Commission in Washington, Spansion is seeking to bar the import into the United States of more than 100 million music players, cellphones, cameras and light laptop computers that use Samsung's flash memory chips. The chips store data in a wide range of products. 
 In a federal court in Delaware, Spansion is seeking an injunction and triple damages for its claim of patent violations in Samsung flash products. It estimated that Samsung sells $7 billion of infringing chips a year.
 Spansion executives said they had tried to negotiate a licensing agreement with Samsung over the last few years, with no progress. ''This is not something we wanted to do, but Samsung has closed the door,'' the chief executive of Spansion, Bertrand Cambou, said. ''And they are infringing.''
 Ideally, he added, the two companies can reach a ''reasonable licensing agreement.''
 If not, Spansion is prepared to pursue a legal strategy. In the 43-page complaint filed with the trade commission, the company details 10 patented technologies that it claims Samsung has used without compensating Spansion. 
 A spokeswoman for Samsung declined to comment.
 Cases move through the trade commission quickly, usually within 16 months, unlike the federal courts, where litigation can drag on for years. The trade commission has the authority to bar the offending goods from the American market. But given the pace of change in the marketplace, and the potential damage to the economy and industry of such a step, the chances of that actually happening in this case are low, according to analysts. 
 ''If you have strong patents, a complaint before the trade commission can be a very powerful tool for a patent holder,'' said Jeffrey D. Neuburger, an intellectual property lawyer at Proskauer Rose. ''Litigation can always be used as a tool in negotiation.''
 Spansion, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., began in 1993 as a joint venture of Advanced Micro Devices and Fujitsu. In 2005 it was spun off as an independent company. 
 Spansion has suffered financially as flash-memory prices have plummeted; they are down 62 percent this year and could fall another 50 percent in 2009, according to iSuppli, a market research firm. During the third quarter, Spansion lost nearly $119 million on revenue of $631 million.
 When product markets turn sour, it is not unusual for high-tech companies to seek to harvest profits from their ideas with more aggressive licensing tactics and patent infringement suits, Richard Doherty, director of research at Envisioneering, a technology consultant, said.
 A year ago, Spansion bought Saifun, an Israeli company that specializes in licensing intellectual property for chip makers. ''These suits are a sign of the strategy that began last year with that acquisition,'' said Jim Handy, director of Objective Analysis, a semiconductor market research firm.

HEADLINE: Pass the Colombian Trade Pact

 BODY:
We don't say it all that often, but President Bush is right: Congress should pass the Colombian free-trade agreement now. 
 Mr. Bush signed the deal two years ago. The Democratic majority in Congress has refused to approve it out of a legitimate concern over the state of human rights in Colombia and less legitimate desires to pander to organized labor or deny Mr. Bush a foreign policy win. 
 We believe that the trade pact would be good for America's economy and workers. Rejecting it would send a dismal message to allies the world over that the United States is an unreliable partner and, despite all that it preaches, does not really believe in opening markets to trade. There is no more time to waste. If the lame-duck Congress does not approve the trade pact this year, prospects would dim considerably since it would lose the cover of the rule (formerly known as fast track) that provides for an up-or-down, no-amendment vote. 
 Because of trade preferences granted as part of the war on drugs, most Colombian exports already are exempt from United States tariffs. The new agreement would benefit American companies that now have to pay high tariffs on exports to Colombia. 
 It also would strengthen bonds with an important ally in a volatile corner of South America -- that also is the main source of cocaine shipped into this country and where the United States has very few friends these days.
 In neighboring Venezuela, President Hugo Chavez spouts fierce anti-American rhetoric to distract attention from his autocratic policies. Last month, Bolivia expelled the United States ambassador and accused Drug Enforcement Administration agents of conspiring against his government. Ecuador has refused to renew a lease on an airbase used by American counternarcotics flights in the coastal city of Manta.
 We, too, have strong concerns about human-rights violations committed by the government of President Alvaro Uribe. But Democrats opposing the trade pact on these grounds are ignoring undeniable improvements. Violence has abated considerably during the Uribe administration as it has taken on the left-wing guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and right-wing paramilitaries. The number of trade unionists killed, a major Democratic concern, is still too high but has dropped sharply. 
 Washington must keep pressing Bogota to reduce abuses by Colombia's Army, ensure the prosecution of paramilitary thugs and further rein in violence against union members. It has a powerful tool to do that: $600 million a year in mostly military and anti-narcotics aid. 
 Failing to approve this trade agreement would do nothing to improve Colombia's human-rights record. Walking away from it now would alienate many people in Colombia and undermine Washington's credibility.

HEADLINE: FOR AUTOMAKERS AND UNION, CLOUT HAS PLUNGED, TOO

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
When the leaders of the three Detroit auto companies and the United Automobile Workers union travel to Washington to make their case for a federal bailout, they will be flying into stiff headwinds of public opinion.
 Thus far, much of the commentary in Washington, in the pages of major newspapers and on the Web, has been against providing financial support for the companies, which they will say they desperately need in hearings beginning on Tuesday. 
 The waves of criticism have been so strong that Susan Tompor, a columnist for The Detroit Free Press, was moved to write on Sunday's front page: ''I never knew Detroit was a dirty word.'' 
 It is a remarkable shift for an industry that has long wielded considerable clout in Washington. 
 But that support has dwindled for many reasons, leaving backers of a bailout, including the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, having a tough time making their case that Detroit should be saved.
 So how did the famous 1953 quotation from the former General Motors president Charles E. Wilson -- that what was good for our country was good for G.M., and vice versa -- become a dated notion to so many people?
 Analysts and longtime observers of the industry say several strategic missteps have hurt Detroit's standing.
 The carmakers, for example, fought hard in recent years against two Congressional efforts to raise fuel economy standards, at a time when Americans were struggling with more expensive gasoline and had become more environmentally conscious.
 They won the 2005 fight, when 67 senators, including Hillary Rodham Clinton and John Kerry, sided with Detroit's argument that it did not have the technology to meet a modest increase.
 But Detroit lost last year's effort to block an increase to 40 miles per gallon by 2020. Some senators criticized the industry's failure to sell cars like the Toyota Prius, which was built only as a hybrid -- a vehicle that G.M.'s vice chairman, Robert A. Lutz, dismissed early on as a public relations move.
 Some Congressional support has also dwindled because the automakers closed plants in other states, like Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Delaware, and consolidated their operations closer to home. 
 Meanwhile, foreign auto companies have built plants across the South, picking up lawmakers like Senator Richard Shelby, Republican of Alabama, who now are more allied with the foreign car companies.
 Michael Useem, professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said the lack of leadership from within the Detroit companies had hurt their effort as well. He pointed to Lee A. Iacocca, former chief of Chrysler, whose public profile soared after his company was given federal loan guarantees in 1980, turning him into a 1980s equivalent of the popular businessman Warren E. Buffett.
 While many Americans might know Rick Wagoner's name, ''they couldn't tell you anything about him, except that he's been there a while and his company has gone from bad to worse,'' Professor Useem said of the General Motors chief executive. And one of the U.A.W.'s most prized accomplishments -- winning income security for its laid-off members -- is not helping the union as it argues for money to help protect its workers at a time when employees across other industries are facing layoffs.
 The U.A.W. program, called the Jobs Bank at G.M., provided nearly full pay for laid off workers while they waited for new jobs. A new version of it is less generous, but has left an impression in the public imagination of a place where workers sit around getting paid for doing nothing.
 ''In good times, the public can tolerate the Jobs Bank,'' said Gary N. Chaison, professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. ''But in bad times, the public has very little patience for that.''
 The Bush administration has steadfastly opposed giving automakers a chunk of the $700 billion banking bailout. While President-elect Barack Obama has said the auto industry should get assistance, ''I think that it can't be a blank check,'' he said Sunday on ''60 Minutes.''
 Michigan's Congressional delegation, led by Democrats Senator Carl Levin and Representative John D. Dingell, the industry's longtime champion, have been left to plead hardest for federal help. G.M. and Ford are among the heaviest spenders on lobbying, according to OpenSecrets.org, a Web site that tracks political contributions.
 So far this year, G.M. has spent $10 million on lobbying, out of $95 million in the past 10 years, placing it at No. 16 on the site's ''top spenders'' list. Ford, which ranks No. 19 on the list, has spent $5.7 million this year, out of $80.6 million the last decade.
 In arguing for a bailout, Detroit's automakers and the union have found themselves without much help from the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an industry trade group that was an important player in last year's fuel economy debate.
 The group, whose 11 members include Toyota, BMW and Volkswagen, blocked efforts to impose even higher fuel economy standards. Its members support letting carmakers tap $25 billion approved by Congress last year to retool aging auto plants, but the alliance has not lobbied for any additional money, a spokesman said on Monday.
 That has left the Detroit executives and the union to go it alone. 
 Mr. Wagoner and Ron Gettelfinger, head of the U.A.W., appeared on local TV in Detroit this week, but no Detroit representatives landed spots on the Sunday morning talk shows out of Washington. Senator Levin was their primary spokesman on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' and ''Face the Nation'' on CBS.
 Meanwhile, Senator Shelby of Alabama, whose home state has Toyota, Honda, Mercedes and Hyundai plants, has kept up his pressure. Appearing on ''Meet the Press'' on Sunday, he called Detroit ''a dinosaur, in a sense.''
 ''There's not a bank in this country that would lend a dollar to these companies,'' he added.
 There have not been many comforting words in newspapers, either. ''Just Say No to Detroit,'' said a headline over an article in Saturday's Wall Street Journal by David Yermack, a business professor at the Stern School at New York University. 
 It all feels excessive to some in Detroit. ''I didn't know that some really, really hate us,'' said Ms. Tompor of The Free Press.

HEADLINE: Mayor Lacks Power to Block $400 Rebates

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN; Michael Barbaro contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Remember two weeks ago when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced he was shelving the $400 homeowners' rebate checks because the city could not afford them?
 Look for yours in the mail.
It turns out the mayor does not have the power to halt the rebates, the city's top budget official grudgingly admitted on Monday, under questioning from the City Council.
 Any elimination of the popular rebates requires City Council approval, budget director Mark Page acknowledged. And council members, who have been flooded with calls from angry residents looking for their checks, declared the mayor's idea to cut them ''dead on arrival.'' 
 The revelation represented an unusual embarrassment for an administration that prides itself on precision and efficiency, especially coming weeks after Mr. Bloomberg based his successful campaign for an extension of term limits on his fiscal resume. On Nov. 5, when he announced he was shelving the rebates, the mayor said that the move would save the city $256 million as it grapples with an economic downturn.
 The news about the rebates was not the only red-faced moment for the administration on Monday. Mr. Page also acknowledged that the mayor could not impose his much-discussed plan to impose a 6-cent charge on plastic bags without the approval of the State Legislature.
 The Bloomberg administration had hoped to bypass the Legislature by calling the charge a fee, rather than a tax, but Mr. Page, after researching the issue, said that it would legally be considered a tax, and Albany's approval -- never a sure thing for Mr. Bloomberg -- would be required.
 It was the rebate, however, that dominated a three-hour budget hearing at City Hall on Monday. Under the program, New Yorkers who own an individual home, apartment, condo or co-op receive a rebate, just before Christmas.
 At one point during the hearing, City Councilman David I. Weprin, chairman of the Finance Committee, waved a document in the air and, invoking Perry Mason, declared he had a ''smoking gun'': a city bond prospectus including legally binding language that stated that rescinding the $400 property tax rebate ''requires city legislative approval.''
 Mr. Weprin told Mr. Page that either the administration or the document was wrong.
 ''I'm not addressing,'' Mr. Page began, before burying his face in his hands, and mumbling, ''Oh, forget it. Fine.''
 After the hearing, Mr. Weprin told reporters that ''there's overwhelming opposition to the revocation'' on the Council and that ''it's pretty much dead on arrival.'' He also predicted that the checks would go out soon.
 Mr. Bloomberg, for his part, appeared to be abandoning the idea, speaking to reporters after meetings in Washington on infrastructure with members of President-elect Barack Obama's transition team and with Congressional leaders. 
 He said that the important issue was not the rebate itself, but rather the need to come up with enough spending cuts and tax increases to compensate for that lost revenue.
 ''Look at it this way: If we don't do that, we're going to have to cut another quarter of a billion dollars out of our expenses,'' the mayor said.
 Under Mr. Bloomberg's plan, some 600,000 homeowners would not have gotten a $400 rebate check, which they have grown accustomed to receiving since 2004 -- a check that was initially intended to ease the sting of an 18.5 percent property tax increase imposed in 2002.
 The mayor's cancellation of the rebate had met with fierce opposition from council members and ordinary citizens, who were taken aback by Mr. Bloomberg's announcement that the checks would not be distributed. City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn even threatened a legal challenge.
 Of course, some skeptics wondered whether the Council's harrumphing was merely posturing, with the outcome predetermined: The Council would protest the cancellation of the rebates, the rebates would then be restored, and meanwhile, property tax increases and other spending cuts would be approved.
 Mr. Weprin, a former finance executive who is no stranger to bond prospectuses, thinks there was a simpler explanation: The mayor's budget aides did not clear the rebate cancellation with their legal team.
 ''I don't think it's so Machiavellian; I just think they didn't talk to their own lawyers,'' he said.
 The proposal to freeze the checks was part of a broad package Mr. Bloomberg unveiled on Nov. 5, in which he said -- citing the global economic meltdown -- that the city was staring at a $4 billion deficit over the next two years.
 To plug that hole, Mr. Bloomberg proposed raising property taxes by 7 percent in January, six months earlier than planned. He estimated that could generate $600 million more in six months, and $1.2 billion over a full year. He spelled out $1.5 billion in proposed budget cuts, including closing libraries for a half day, eliminating dental programs and closing a clinic in East Harlem.
 The mayor also warned that the city might need to raise its personal income tax as much as 15 percent -- with Albany's approval -- and impose a sales tax on clothing.
 No Council votes on the budget were taken at the hearing. The Council plans seven other hearings on the mayor's plan within the next week. 
 But one thing was clear from Monday's hearing: Higher taxes are coming. 
 There was discussion about raising taxes the city directly controls, like the property tax or the hotel tax, as well as the ones that require Albany's blessing (sales, income and commuter taxes.) And there was discussion, too, about concerns over the city's capital budget and proposed cuts to the police, education and public housing.
 ''We know there's no way to keep the 2009 budget intact without making cuts,'' Ms. Quinn said, adding that the Council must wrestle with how to raise revenues. ''If tax increases are necessary, what is the best mix?''
