HEADLINE: Baker, on Hill, Passes Hat for Russia

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d went to Capitol Hill today to tell Congress it "absolutely must" move quickly to authorize the Administration's package of aid to Russia, and to head off efforts by some lawmakers to attach special interest riders to the bill.
But Mr. Baker was told that if the Administration wanted Congress to approve the United States contribution to the $24 billion international aid plan for the former Soviet republics, the President would have to take a much more active lobbying role. 
 While most lawmakers agree that there is still a majority in support of the Russian aid package, that majority is beginning to wilt a bit in the heat of the election season.
Representative Dante B. Fascell, Democrat of Florida, noted that the Administration had asked that the legislation be finished in time for the visit of President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia to Washing on June 16 and 17.
"That's quite a tall order," Mr. Fascell told Mr. Baker at the start of his testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
 
Jobs 'Must Come First'
 Mr. Fascell, the committee chairman, added: "I want to say it's going to take your best efforts politically, and I know you are already hard at work at that. But may I venture that it's going to take more than that. I think it's going to take the personal intercession of the President of the United States to help us with this very vital program that we consider in our best interest."
Mr. Baker's appearance on Capitol Hill to drum up support for the Freedom Support Act, the Administration's contribution to the $24 billion international aid package for Russia and other republics, coincided with the circulation of a letter by the House Democratic whip, David E. Bonior of Michigan, urging lawmakers not to support the package until the President has a more effective domestic policy. Mr. Bonior's office said that he had already collected close to 100 signatures on the letter to the President, which he plans to send to the White House on Tuesday.
The letter says: "Dear Mr. President: Last week you announced that the time has come for the United States to provide billions in aid to the former Soviet republics. Today we are writing you with a very simple message: jobs for Americans must come first. We cannot support your plan for additional assistance to the former Soviet republics until you have first addressed the issue of jobs and economic growth for America. Specifically, we are calling on you to support an extension of unemployment benefits and an accelerated jobs program for America."
Many Democrats on the Foreign Affairs Committee, at least, disassociated themselves from the letter. Representative Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana said jobs and the Russian aid package were both important to the country, but to link them might jeopardize passage of the aid bill, and therefore he would not endorse the Bonior move.
The Freedom Support Act would authorize appropriations for a variety of aid programs, including American participation in a $6 billion currency stabilization fund for Russia and a $12 billion increase in the American share of financing for the International Monetary Fund, which in turn, would lend the money to Russia.
 
A Plea on Amendments
 "In my private discussions with members of the House," Mr. Baker said, "I have been told repeatedly this is an issue that is too important for partisan politics, that they agree with me that this is a once-in-a-century opportunity to advance our national interest. We hope those sentiments which have been expressed in private will be expressed just as honestly and openly in public."
Mr. Baker said that he particularly hoped that lawmakers would oppose any efforts by their colleagues to attach amendments, "which, however well intentioned, could insure the legislation's defeat."
On March 11, for instance, six conservative Republican senators sent a letter to President Bush expressing their "concern" that the former Soviet Union was secretly retaining a covert force of the SS-20 and SS-23 misslies it was supposed to declare as part of the Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile Treaty.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Mixed in Slow Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were narrowly mixed in slow trading yesterday in a session sprinkled with rumors about Argentina and its willingness to buy 30-year zero-coupon bonds in the open market.
The thought that Argentina may buy large quantities of zero-coupon securities as part of a commercial bank debt-restructuring plan was officially raised by the Treasury on Wednesday, even though the issue had been a topic of conversation in the credit markets for weeks. 
 The rumors continued to fly yesterday about whether the open-market purchases would take place, and bond prices reacted to all of them.
 
Jobless Claims Unchanged
 Traders said, however, that the most important piece of information was the weekly report on initial unemployment claims, which were unchanged at just over 400,000 in the week ended April 18.
Traders had feared that unemployment claims, which had fallen for three consecutive weeks, would post another decline, providing further evidence of improvement in labor markets that could strengthen the economy enough to reignite inflation.
"The claims numbers were a relief," a government bond trader said.
Reports released yesterday on new factory orders and the Government's index of leading economic indicators had little impact on trading. Analysts said they were consistent with a halting recovery.
"There is nothing in these numbers to suggest the economy is firing on all cylinders," said Stuart G. Hoffman, senior economist at the PNC Financial Corporation in Pittsburgh.
 
Quarterly Refunding
 Although Treasury bond prices posted the biggest gains of the session, traders said further gains would probably be limited in the final run-up to next week's quarterly refunding auctions.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at a price of 99 5/8, up 11/32 , to yield 8.03 percent, compared with 8.05 percent late Wednesday.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 1/2, up 5/32 , to yield 7.57 percent. The 6 7/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 9931/32 , up 3/32 , to yield 6.88 percent. And the 5 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 9929/32 , unchanged on the day, to yield 5.42 percent.
The Treasury held an auction of new one-year bills yesterday, and they were sold at an average discount rate of 4.20 percent, down from an average rate of 4.34 percent at the last one-year bill sale on April 2.
 
Rates on Treasury Bills
 Rates on outstanding short-term Treasury bills fell slightly. Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.68 percent late yesterday, down two basis points, or two-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 3.81 percent.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, Baxter International Inc. offered $200 million worth of five-year notes through an underwriting group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The 7 1/2 percent notes were priced at $100, or par, 59 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 7/8 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing.
The noncallable securities are rated A-3 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Corporate bond traders said prices of most outstanding investment-grade issues were unchanged on the day. And prices of most widely quoted tax-exempt municipal bonds were also little changed, market participants said.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported that two of the three measures of the nation's money supply that it tracks on a weekly basis rose during the week ended April 20. The broadest measure, M-3, fell by $4.9 billion.
The drop in M-3 and the $1.6 billion rise in M-2, the aggregate most closely followed by the Fed, were somewhat weaker than analysts had anticipated. Nevertheless, the report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Media;
As Political Campaigns Turn Negative, the Press Is Given a Negative Rating

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
The bitter Presidential race pictured this year on television has been blamed for ills ranging from Gov. Bill Clinton's negative polls to the scant primary turnout in most states. But it could be the news media that sustain the most damage if the campaign turns out to be another overwhelmingly negative race.
Social scientists studying the election say that voters are increasingly blaming the news media -- newspapers, magazines and, most powerfully, television -- for what they see as the degeneration of Presidential politics. In a burst of apparent self-loathing, even the press seems to have been swept up in this wave of anti-press sentiment. 
 Four years ago, 60 percent of the commentators assessing campaign coverage on the network news gave the press a negative rating, according to a study by the Center for Media and Public Affairs in Washington. This year, the proportion of negative assessments jumped to 90 percent.
"In American politics, there's a tendency to be suspicious of power brokers no matter who they are," said Darrell West, a professor of political science at Brown University in Providence, R.I. "It used to be this was the back-room politicians, and people were very upset with them. Now people are becoming more suspicious of the media. They see the media as part of the establishment, and that's not a great position to be in."
 
Attack Ads (Against the Press)
 Professor West noted that a few candidates, including Governor Clinton of Arkansas, had used television commercials this year explicitly attacking the news media, breaking a longstanding taboo.
"Even the media haters like Richard Nixon never dared run an ad against the press," he said.
Voters increasingly seem to view the campaign as a function of what news organizations choose to report rather than the other way around. In a January poll by the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press in Washington, 58 percent of the respondents said news organizations had "too much" influence on who became President, as against 51 percent who said that at the start of 1988.
"Press-bashing used to be ideological," said Todd Gitlin, a professor of sociology at the University of California at Berkeley. "It was from the right, like from Goldwater and Nixon, or from the left over the Vietnam War. But this is different. I think people are tired of knowing more about Gennifer Flowers than about the defense budget the Senate passed that day."
 
How News Reporting Rates
 In a recent survey of Boston-area residents, Mr. West found that roughly half the respondents rated the reporting on this year's campaign as "poor" or "fair." A recent nationwide poll by the Center for the People and the Press showed Americans to have a more benevolent view of the news media but one that is nevertheless souring.
In the center's poll, 65 percent of the respondents rated the reporting on the campaign as "excellent" or "good," down from 71 percent in 1988. The proportion of respondents who rated the coverage "fair" or "poor" was 33 percent, up from 22 percent four years ago.
Just as politicians tend to fare badly in hard times, journalists, too, may be suffering from side effects of the recession. Many news executives say that if the public blames the news media for its disappointment with the race so far, it is blaming the wrong party.
"I'm continually impressed with how little we can do about the tone of a campaign," said Tom Hannon, political director for the Cable News Network. "The tenor seems beyond the control of any news organization. The process moves along; the media are essentially passive, despite appearances to the contrary."
Social scientists agree that much of the criticism of news organizations is probably a result of general disgruntlement with the economy and the political process. But they say, and some journalists concur, that long-term trends are at work that may also be undermining Americans' faith in the news media.
 
Standards of Privacy
 As in the last campaign, when Gary Hart's love life became a national news event, news organizations this year are once again struggling with a changing standard of privacy for public officials. To many reporters, Governor Clinton often seemed to be inviting scrutiny of his private life by equivocating when questioned by journalists. But this struggle between public and private makes many Americans uncomfortable -- they are at once curious and disgusted, researchers say -- and has probably contributed to the growing complaints about the coverage.
At the same time, the structure of the news reporting itself is changing.
While once the major newspapers and the network television news programs set the agenda for the campaign coverage, this year the newspapers and the networks often seemed to be responding to supermarket tabloids and television talk shows. Governor Clinton and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California put in appearances in New York not only with the standard newscasters and editorial boards, but also with Don Imus, the radio personality, and with Phil Donahue. Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire, has conducted virtually most of his campaign on "Larry King Live."
Local newscasts have also assumed greater influence in recent years, and this, too, has changed the nature of campaign coverage. "The day of the network news being the horse that pulls the cart is over," said Lane Venardos, executive producer of special events for CBS. "We're either being pulled, or at best we're running alongside."
When voters criticize the news media, they tend to lump together the most sedate and the most sensational outlets, from newspapers to the local news to "tabloid" television programs like "A Current Affair," social scientists say. "People get their news in a remarkably haphazard way," said Tim Cook, a professor of political science at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., who is studying local news coverage of the election.
 
Focus on the Networks
 When professional critics talk about the role of news organizations in the campaign, however, they tend to focus on the network news.
The networks' initial commitment to reporting on the campaign in a substantive way can be seen in the early emphasis of their broadcasts. Reports about policy made up 45 percent of the coverage in the weeks leading up to the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 18, according to the Center for Media and Public Affairs in Washington.
But in the weeks after New Hampshire, when voters in dozens of other states began to attend to their own primary contests, the focus of the reporting shifted to the daily back and forth among the candidates. The proportion of policy reports dropped to 19 percent.
"The evidence is clear that the networks tried to do the right thing," said Marvin Kalb, director of the Shorenstein Barone Center on Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University. Early in the campaign, he noted, the networks agreed to provide prime time slots for debates and to broadcast in-depth features on the candidates.
But after the New Hampshire primary, he said, "You could see the descent on a day-to-day basis. The sound bites decreased. Substance became character. They allowed themselves to be seduced by the obvious: sex, sleaze, draft."
 
'Taken Aback' by 'Donahue'
 Network news executives call such criticism a clear case of blaming the messenger for an unwelcome message. It was not the networks' fault that name-calling became the principal campaign theme, they say; it was the candidates'.
"I think it's much improved over '88," Tim Russert, senior vice president of NBC News, said of the reporting this year. "But the tone of the campaign forced us to cover the shooting back and forth. We started out very much on the issues, but when the candidates got off the issues and got into the attacks and counterattacks, we had to go with them."
But even network executives confessed that they were "taken aback" by the debate on the "Donahue" show April 6, the day before the New York primary, when Governor Clinton and Mr. Brown questioned each other without a moderator.
"It was so interesting that on 'Donahue,' with no interlocutor, all the talk was about issues, as opposed to when somebody else was asking the questions, and then there were absolutely no issues involved," Mr. Venardos of CBS said.
To be sure, even the most vehement critics of the campaign reporting this year give the networks credit for some gains over 1988. For example, there has been little reporting of the kind of photogenic events, like flag factory visits, that were so popular with the Bush campaign four years ago.
But the soul searching that followed the 1988 campaign, and the efforts this year to elevate the public debate, make this year's lapses all the more significant in the eyes of critics. They question whether the unwritten rules of journalism in general, and television journalism in particular, allow for the kind of consistently substantive reporting that news executives insisted they wanted to provide.
Since issues like the economy and health care remain constant, these critics argue, they will inevitably be sacrificed to the latest scandal by an industry that values newness and drama above public policy.
"The classic pattern we always see is before the public begins to focus, the media provides substance," said Thomas E. Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution. "As soon as the race gears up, the focus shifts to the horse race and the scandals. Once voters finally begin paying attention, they see the slash and burn and nothing else. So basically what we get is a vicious cycle."
 
Stressing Early Reporting
 Mr. Mann and other critics have also expressed growing concern about the disproportionate influence of early reporting. Candidates, they argue, once categorized by the news media, tend to receive only reporting that will reinforce that initial representation.
"You can empirically demonstrate that each candidate carves out a sort of niche," said S. Robert Lichter, co-director of the Center for Media and Public Affairs in Washington. "Each candidate gets defined in certain terms, and then everything is built around that initial definition. Once reporters decided that the character issue was most important for Bill Clinton, that's what was newsworthy. In theory, in a different world, Clinton could have been defined as a very issue-oriented candidate."
Out of the 189 reports on Mr. Clinton that were broadcast on network news leading up to the New York primary, more than half involved a discussion of "character," according to Mr. Lichter's organization. In contrast, out of the 85 reports featuring Mr. Brown, only 6 percent discussed "character."
If news organizations were to change their habits, of course, there is no guarantee that the public or even news media experts would respond enthusiastically. News executives argue, and some social scientists agree, that reporting of the campaign reflects the public's real tastes, rather than the idealized preferences they profess in public opinion surveys.
"People are both turned off by the media and attracted to it at the same time," Mr. West of Brown University said. If campaign reporting remained fixed on the weighty issues and ignored the scandals, he said, "it would probably be pretty boring."

HEADLINE: Dow Soars 25.94 to Second-Highest Close

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stock prices staged a broad rally yesterday on encouraging economic news, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average to its second-highest close.
The Dow jumped 25.94 points to close at 3,359.12 in heavy volume. The finish was just shy of the record of 3,366.50 set on April 16. 
Advancing issues more than doubled declining ones, 1,198 to 562, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Big Board's volume totaled 223.6 million shares, against 206.8 million on Wednesday, and the exchange's composite index rose 1.72 points to end at 228.30.
 
'Best of All Worlds'
 Traders looked at the latest economic news, which pointed to a slow climb out of the recession, and determined that "maybe the best of all worlds is a mediocre world -- a slow, sluggish recovery," said Jack Solomon, an analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company.
"A lot of companies have gotten lean and mean, and they don't need a fat-cat type of recovery because they've fired people and closed plants," he said.
The broader market was also higher. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 2.93 points, to 414.95, while the American Stock Exchange index finished 4.83 higher at 390.61. In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index jumped 8.74 points, to 578.68.
Traders started yesterday's session in a positive mood after the Dow's rise of 25.26 on Wednesday. They were further encouraged by the latest economic reports from the Federal Government.
The index of leading economic indicators, the Government's chief economic forecasting gauge, edged up two-tenths of a percent in March, signaling slow but continued growth for later this year.
 
Other Data, Bonds Help
 The Labor Department said the number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits was unchanged during the third week in April, the fourth straight week without an increase.
The Commerce Department said orders to American factories jumped 1.6 percent in March, the largest rise in five months, which was far better than expected. Further signs of strength in manufacturing came from purchasing managers in the Midwest.
A stronger bond market added fuel to the rally.
Chrysler was one of the Big Board's most-active issues, falling 3/8, to 19 1/4, on a volume of 3.4 million shares. The No. 3 car maker said it had lost $13 million in the first quarter.

HEADLINE: Their Image Poisoned, The Serbs Voice Dismay

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, April 30

 BODY:
Over an embassy dinner here the other day, a middle-aged woman who is a professor at one of Belgrade's leading universities spoke up passionately on the subject of Serbia and its battered image in the world.
"In 1914, we had so many friends in Europe and the United States, and again in 1941," she said, referring to the years when World War I and World War II erupted in the Balkans, and the Serbs aligned themselves with the Western allies. "In 1948, when Tito broke with Stalin, it was the same. Now, I have to ask myself, why do we not have any allies at all? Are we so terrible that the whole world has to turn its back on us?" 
 For 10 months, Serbia has borne the brunt of Western condemnation for fanning the civil wars in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina, two of the four republics of the old Communist Yugoslavia that have declared themselves independent. Over the last month, relentless offensives by Serbian paramilitary groups and by the Yugoslav Army, backing Bosnian Serbs in a contest for Bosnian territory, have brought the United States and the European Community to the brink of imposing diplomatic and economic sanctions on Serbia.
For the moment, the threat has receded. On Monday, Serbia joined the mountainous republic of Montenegro in proclaiming a new Yugoslav state less than half the size of Communist Yugoslavia, with a Constitution that defined the new state's territory as that of Serbia and Montenegro only. This was accompanied by a declaration that the new Yugoslavia has "no territorial claims" on its neighboring republics, a pledge to settle all disputes peacefully, and statements by senior Serbian officials that they expect Bosnian Serbs to become loyal citizens of an independent Bosnian state.
If the pledges are honored, Serbia, accounting for 9.8 million of the 10.5 million inhabitants of the new Yugoslavia, stands a strong chance of having the new Yugoslav state recognized by the Western powers, and eventually of regaining the renown Serbia has long enjoyed in the Western world.
Serbian offensives in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina have resulted in large numbers of civilian casualties, including summary executions of groups of men, women and children. But before then, Serbia was associated in Balkan history as much as anything with its struggles for freedom -- against the Ottoman Empire during nearly 500 years of Turkish rule, on the Allies' side in World War I, and against the Nazis in World War II.
For many Serbs, the poisoning of Serbia's image has been deeply painful, worse even than the steep plunge in living standards brought about by the old Yugoslavia's violent disintegration. Little pleases a Serb more than lingering over cups of thick Turkish coffee or thimble-glasses of shlivovica, a powerful plum brandy, telling visitors of the legends of old Serbia, beginning with the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 in which a Serb army went down to a glorious defeat by the invading Turks.
From Kosovo to Jasenovac, the World War II death camp in Croatia where hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews and gypsies were killed by the Ustashe fascists who ruled Croatia for the Nazis, the Serbs' sense of themselves as a people victimized by history has grown. Many Serbs believe that the fighting in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, on behalf of Serbs living outside Serbia, is a continuation of that history, a new example of Serbs having to take to arms to defend their homes, their Eastern Orthodox religion and their culture.
Among Croats in Croatia, and the Muslim Slavs and Croats who form the majority in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as among Westerners who have witnessed the fighting, this version of events is seen as a distortion. In this view, the notion of Serbs outside Serbia as mortally threatened by other ethnic groups has enabled some Serbs to support, or at least to rationalize, policies under which Serb paramilitary units have engaged in a campaign of terror against civilians, and the Serb-led Yugoslav Army has shelled ancient towns like Dubrovnik, Sarajevo and Vukovar.
In Serbia, too, the months of fighting have eroded popular support, even among people who backed the idea of supporting the Bosnian and Croatian Serbs. At least 100,000 young Serbian men have fled abroad or into hiding to avoid conscription into the Yugoslav Army, and many conversations with Serbs in Serbia quickly turn to expressions of disgust at outrages by Serbian forces. While most Serbs insist that the atrocities have been matched by the Croats and the Muslim Slavs, there is a strong sense among Serbs that what has happened has besmirched Serbia's name.
 
Dismay Is Widespread
 The dismay has spread even among those considered to be supporters of Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian President. Dobrica Cosic, the writer of novels about Serbia in the two world wars, said that while the fighting in Bosnia and Croatia had been started by the Croats and Muslim Slavs, Serbia would rue what it had done in response.
"I cannot accept that we Serbs are satanists and criminals and barbarians," he said, referring to what he described as one-sided Western reporting on the fighting. "But I am deeply unhappy that our role has been tainted by these criminal acts."
To many Serbs, blame for what has happened rests heavily with Mr. Milosevic, who runs an authoritarian Government like the Communist one that ruled here for 45 years. Mr. Milosevic first showed his colors in the early 1980's with inflammatory rallies in Kosovo, an autonomous region of Serbia where Serbs and Montenegrins are outnumbered nearly 10 to 1 by ethnic Albanians. When Communism's collapse across Eastern Europe ignited nationalist passions in all of the Yugoslav republics, the 52-year-old Serbian leader inflamed the situation by declaring that all Serbs had the right to live under Serbian rule.
To many Serbs, this was dangerous, since it implied the wholesale redrawing of the Balkan map, extending Serbia's borders to enfold the 580,000 Serbs scattered across Croatia and the 1.4 million Serbs who live in even more dispersed communities across Bosnia.
 
Reunion 'an Impossible Dream'
 For Bogdan Bogdanovic, a Serbian architect, the sense of the vulnerability of Serbs was heightened by the commission he received to design the monument to the victims of fascism at Jasenovac, the wartime death camp. He described the idea of reuniting Serbs under one government as "an impossible dream," adding, "The only way that could ever have been accomplished was by war."
Because Serbs are the most widely dispersed of the Balkan peoples, Serbian intellectuals were a major force from the early 19th century behind the idea of a nation that would unite all south Slavs. That idea became reality in 1918, with the formation of the first Yugoslavia, a kingdom that ended with the Nazi invasion in 1941. On Monday, at the ceremony that marked the formal end of the second Yugoslavia, the one founded as a Communist state in 1946, at least one Serbian present said Mr. Milosevic, by making the survival of the second Yugoslavia impossible with his aggressive Serbian nationalism, had done more to undermine the Serbs' search for security than any other figure in Serbian history.
Many Serbs, including Mr. Cosic, the novelist, believe that the nations formed from Yugoslavia's break-up will rebuild some of the links that have been shattered, perhaps in a confederation of independent states similar to that formed from the republics of the former Soviet Union. But they also say the task will have been made much harder by the blood spilled in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the meantime, Serbs in both republics must live with the consequences of what has been done on their behalf, and many Serbs in Serbia acknowledge that the Bosnian and Croatian Serbs are worse off now than they were before the fighting started.
In Croatia, at least 300,000 Serbs have been driven from their homes as refugees, dozens of predominantly Serbian towns and villages have been devastated, and Serbia has signed a United Nations-brokered cease-fire, undertaking to withdraw or disarm all Serbian forces.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, with a mass migration still under way, about 500,000 people have become refugees, many of them Serbs, and the harmony that existed between Serbs, Croats and Muslim Slavs in many of the towns seized by Serbian forces has been brutally disrupted.

HEADLINE: House Votes Lean Budget But Short of Weicker Plan

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, April 30

 BODY:
Connecticut's House of Representatives tonight approved a budget that imposes deep cuts in welfare, education aid to municipalities and other social programs, but that stops short on many of the more ambitious spending overhauls proposed by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. The vote was 85 to 66.
Majority Democrats said that the compromises were a key to passing a budget at all, and that cutting any more would have ravaged the poor and the already troubled cities that would have had to pick up the burden. Republicans, who supported Mr. Weicker's initial proposal, called the revised budget a betrayal. 
 "What happened to the year of reform, my friends?" asked Representative Reginald L. Jones, a Republican from Darien and the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee. "The reforms disappeared and the year is still here."
The $8.08 billion budget would not remove people from General Assistance welfare rolls after six months, as Mr. Weicker wanted. Instead, indigent residents would get nine months of relief and be offered a series of job training programs. Adding those to the budget cost $52 million.
 
Total Is Near Weicker's
 Altogether the House added more than $250 million to Mr. Weicker's original budget, primarily by changing the formula on contributions to the state pension fund and by reducing payments on bonds issued last year. But cuts in other mostly nonsocial spending programs, including the Department of Correction, which runs the prison system, left the bottom line fairly close to Mr. Weicker's.
The budget avoids a statewide tax increase -- a priority from the beginning in a year when all 187 members of the General Assembly are up for re-election -- although municipal officials have said for months that the contention of avoiding a tax rise is a sham because local property taxes will have to go up anyway to compensate for many of the cuts.
Supporters also argued tonight in selling their plan that it was still tough, even if it was not quite in the Governor's league. General assistance recipients judged employable, for instance, would from the start get $60 a month less than people deemed unemployable. The categories take into consideration physical and mental abilities to obtain and hold a job.
Overall, benefits would be cut to $296 to $356 a month after July 1, from $400 to $450 a month now. Local communities, which now pay 10 percent of general assistance costs, would pay 20 percent; Mr. Weicker had wanted a 33.3 percent contribution from the towns.
 
Sharp Cuts in School Aid
 Many communities would also see sharp cuts in education aid because of changes in formulas. Many affluent suburbs of Hartford, and those across Fairfield County, would see their education cost-sharing grants fall more than 90 percent. But those levels are also a moderation: Under Mr. Weicker's plan, some towns would have ended up owing education money to the state.
Last year, Mr. Weicker, a third-party independent Governor, proposed an overhaul of the tax system, then vetoed three budgets until he got the one he wanted. He declined to comment in detail early today about the House budget because he said he had not had a chance to study it.
But in comments to reporters earlier in the day, Mr. Weicker praised lawmakers for their work in reaching a budget agreement. By contrast, last year Mr. Weicker was more likely to disparage lawmakers for their lack of backbone, and he made his intentions to veto the budget plainly known well in advance.
Senate leaders, who said the budget would probably be considered on Friday in their chamber, said tonight that the bill might be amended and sent back to the House, but that the basic agreement over the plan reached earlier this week was still holding up.
 
Shaking Heads in Wonder
 And that in itself had lawmakers shaking their heads in wonder. Many legislators had said earlier this year that a budget agreement would simply be impossible. With both parties fractured by last year's prolonged struggle over the question of imposing a tax on wages, they said that building a majority around deep spending cuts would simply open old wounds. The wage tax was passed in August by a slim bipartisan majority, and lawmakers were in special session as recently as December trying to repeal it.
But it was clear tonight inside the ornate Hall of the House as the eight hour debate wore on that the mechanics and internal politics of the legislature had reverted to traditional party lines. Democrats voted in lock step to defeat several Republican amendments, and every time the unbroken line of red lights appeared on the voting boards, members of the majority broke into cheers.
Democrats control the House 87 seats to 64 for the Republicans. Mr. Weicker's independent party, called A Connecticut Party, has no representation in the House.
"One of the things that I feel proudest of is that we have been able to bring the process back to a semblance of order," said Representative William R. Dyson, a Democrat from New Haven and the co-chairman of the Appropriations Committee.
But within the Democratic majority, there were still some echoes of last year's fights. The moderate Democrats, who crossed the aisle last year to form a majority coalition with the Republicans in vote after vote, balked only this week over a last-minute concern about the deferral of the pension-fund payment.

H.I.V. ON THE RISE AMONG BLACK WOMEN
The rate of H.I.V. infection has risen among black women having babies in New York City, while it has dropped sharply among white and Hispanic mothers, the State Health Department said. The finding prompted a health official to warn that unless AIDS education efforts among blacks are more successful, "AIDS in future generations may be primarily a disease of black people." B3.
 
SIGNS OF AN ECONOMIC TURNAROUND
The financial vise that has been gripping many New York City companies may finally be easing, according to recent data collected by Dun & Bradstreet Information Services. The data provide new evidence that the local economy may be improving, and, surprisingly, at a faster rate than the rest of the nation. B3.
 
CUOMO'S MAN FROM LIMERICK 
 It's a long way from the thatch-roofed cottage in Limerick, Ireland, where Michael J. Dowling grew up to the office in Albany where he serves as Governor Cuomo's director of health, education and human services. But Mr. Dowling's journey out of poverty left him with both a personal compassion for the poor and a pragmatic approach to government that has left a lasting imprint on New York's social policy. B4.
 
TROUBLE FOR GOTTI'S LAWYER
John Gotti's longtime lawyer, Bruce Cutler, has been ordered to appear in court to face an unusual charge of criminal contempt for public comments he made before the recent Gotti trial. Among other things, Mr. Cutler was quoted as saying that the Government was engaging in a "continuing vendetta" against Mr. Gotti, that "they threw the Constitution out the window" in his case, that the Government's witnesses were "bums" and that "John Gotti is loved more than anyone else in the city."

AT ODDS OVER THE COMMUTER TAX
A decision by Republicans in the New Jersey Senate to call off a threatened commuter tax war with New York City has touched off a fight with a Democratic state senator who wants to proceed with a retaliatory tax. "Why should New Jersey pull its punch now?" said Senator Robert Menendez, who is running for Congress. "We shouldn't let our guard down." A Republican Senator, declaring the commuter tax war "a dead issue," accused Mr. Menendez of political grandstanding. B5.
 
A RULING ON HOW WETLANDS ARE TAXED
In a decision that could cost municipalities millions of dollars, a state tax court judge has ruled that New Jersey's wetlands must be taxed as undevelopable land, not on its potential commercial value. The case involved a 240-acre tract in the Meadowlands, near Giants Stadium, and the judge reduced its assessed valued to $1 million, from $20 million. B5.

HEADLINE: Bigger Business Role Urged in Prenatal and Maternal Care

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
Business is increasingly recognizing that the health of employees is as important as fever lines on stock charts in determining long-term competitiveness and profitability.
At the Corporate Summit for Children today, some 200 business leaders cited the need for involvement by Corporate America in prenatal and maternal health care to insure that the nation's work force can compete in the global economy. 
 For most employers, expenses related to childbirth are the largest single portion of health-care costs, ranging from 10 to 49 percent. Because nearly 60 percent of women with children now remain in the work force, low birth weight, lack of immunization and poor overall health care can continue to contribute to a company's health-care costs long after a child is born.
"Business is spending $800 billion on health care, and we're not getting our money's worth," said Dr. Mary Jane England, president of the Washington Business Group on Health, a national not-for-profit organization of employers interested in health issues.
The Cigna Corporation, a large operator of employee health-insurance plans and the sponsor of the conference, released two studies that said problem births cost American businesses $5.6 billion each year in insured health-care costs for mothers and infants. Another $4 billion is passed along to businesses through insurance costs to pay for uncompensated health care for America's poorest mothers and their newborns. About 34 million Americans are not covered by any insurance, including 11 million children.
G. Robert O'Brien, a Cigna executive vice president, said the studies by Georgia State University and the Center for Health Policy Studies in Maryland showed that "strong prenatal education and care programs for all women will ultimately save billions of dollars and, more importantly, save thousands of infants' lives."
 
More Cost Efficient
 Dr. England and other health officials and business leaders at the conference emphasized that preventive care was more cost efficient than later medical care. Part of the purpose of the conference, she said, was to honor corporations that have innovative health plans. These included Honeywell, I.B.M. and Levi Strauss.
Yet last year, many businesses were vocal opponents of the Family and Medical Leave Act, legislation in Congress that would have provided some preventive-health care options. Dr. England said that while large corporations recognized a connection between health care and performance, small businesses were often put off by the cost.
National health-care reform has become an issue of national debate in the last decade as the costs of care and insurance spiraled. President Bush and both the leading Democratic presidential candidates are offering health-care plans.
Plans under discussion include everything from replacing the present system with a universal system similar to one in Canada to reforms that would require employers to pay for health care for their workers or pay into an overall fund.
Last year, executives from A.T.& T., Honeywell and BellSouth urged Congress to increase spending for Federal programs that promote better nutrition for pregnant woman and infants.
At today's conference, Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida said businesses in his state had recognized the connection and helped lobby for new money for a prenatal program.
Mr. Chiles, a Democrat, said Florida had added $91 million to a prenatal program in its 1990 budget at a time when $2 billion was being cut. In the following 18 months, the state's infant mortality rate dropped from 9.5 percent to 8.9 percent.
"We think there is a definite causal connection," Mr. Chiles said. Florida is one of several states experimenting with voluntary universal coverage.
Mr. Chiles, chairman of the National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality, said that everyone had a stake in providing access to care for all children and pregnant women.
He added that today's conference was a starting point for further involvement by the business community. "This is not a one-shot deal," the Governor said, "but rather the beginning of a movement to improve the health and well-being of children and families."

Coffee Prices at 17-Year Low As Oversupply Is Perceived

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Coffee prices tumbled yesterday to the lowest levels in 17 years on widespread perceptions of a world oversupply that could send prices lower still.
 The fall came despite a lower forecast for Brazil's crop, the world's largest, by the commodity trade house E. D. & F. Man. The estimate for Brazil's 1992-93 crop predicted a harvest of 18.7 million 60-pound bags, a figure that was at the low end of other recent estimates.
 
 July coffee declined 1.30 cents, to 62.90 cents a pound, in heavy trading at the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange. Prices have not been this low since the summer of 1975.
 The expiring May contract in sugar futures led the slide in sugar prices, as speculators sold futures to avoid the obligation to make delivery.
 May sugar lost 0.46 cent to close at 9.45 cents a pound.
 Traders said the weak close could signal lower sugar prices ahead for succeeding contracts. "I think this will be viewed negatively," one said.
 At New York's Commodity Exchange, July silver edged above the $4-an-ounce level, rising 3.2 cents, to $4.0125.
 Gold also advanced, although traders said the rally might be short-lived. June gold firmed $1.50, to $337.90 an ounce.
"There is no interest in the market," said a Merrill Lynch analyst, William O'Neill.
 Platinum was the strongest of the three precious metals, as Japanese investors were rumored to be active overnight and optimism about a rebounding United States economy generated interest in the metal.
 A 1.6 percent rise in March factory orders strengthened sentiment that more platinum will soon be needed by industry.
 July platinum rose $4.60, to $347.40 an ounce, at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Technical factors and a spurt of buying by commodity funds lifted energy futures at the same trading exchange.
 Light sweet crude oil gained 8 cents, to $20.85 a barrel. "The market clearly wants to challenge $21" in the June contract, one trader said.
 May heating oil, on the final day of trading before the contract expired, advanced 0.88 cent, to 57.85 cents a gallon. May gasoline, which also expired at the close, rose 0.42 cent, to 63.16 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: Companies in New York Are Paying Bills More Swiftly, Data Show

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
The financial vise that has been gripping many New York City companies may finally be easing, according to recent data collected by Dun & Bradstreet Information Services. The data provide new evidence that the local economy may be improving, and, surprisingly, at a faster rate than the rest of the nation.
"We're finally seeing some turnaround," said David Kresge, a vice president at the company. Mr. Kresge bases his optimism on two measures that are showing improvement: the speed with which companies have been paying their bills and the number of companies that are expected to have credit problems over the next 6 to 12 months. 
 The improvement is good news at a time when many economic forecasters are still maintaining that New York -- hard hit by cutbacks in service industries and manufacturing -- will likely lag behind the rest of the nation in recovering from the recession.
Throughout 1990, companies in New York City generally paid their bills at about the same rate as companies nationally. However, in 1991, the cash available to New York companies apparently deteriorated sharply, for businesses began paying their suppliers at substantially slower rates than their national counterparts. Now that trend seems to have reversed.
 
A Ripple of Late Payments
 Late payments can have a severe ripple effect: because some companies cannot pay their suppliers, their suppliers, in turn, cannot pay the companies that were servicing them, and so on. The end result is often bankruptcies, particularly for small companies that do not have the financial cushion to survive long periods without being paid for work that has often already been performed. Indeed, bankruptcies in New York City rose sharply in 1991, claiming 2,423 victims, a 78 percent increase over the previous year.
Since the end of last year, however, Dun & Bradstreet has detected considerable improvement in the rate at which companies in the city are paying their bills.
Although the percentage of those paying more slowly than they were previously still exceeds the number that are paying more promptly, the population of slower-paying companies is shrinking. The data are based on the actual bill-paying performance of about 125,000 companies in the city that is provided to Dun & Bradstreet by suppliers, rather than by companies themselves.
Dun & Bradstreet also has developed a computer model to help it identify companies that are likely to have problems paying their bills in the future. By that measure, the financial fortunes of New York City businesses also seem to be improving, leading Mr. Kresge to believe that the improvement evident in the historical data will continue.
 
Worse Record Nationally
 In a normal economy, Dun & Bradstreet has identified about 30 percent of all companies nationally as being high-risk billpayers, that is, likely to pay bills after 90 days or longer. Last December, 40 percent more New York businesses than normal fell into that high-risk category. But by March, that percentage had fallen to 27 percent greater than normal.
Mr. Kresge found that the prospects for New York companies' bill-paying performance are substantially brighter than those for the nation as a whole. In March, 33 percent more companies than normal were expected to have trouble paying their bills over the next 6 to 12 months, the same level reported in December.
"Over one-quarter of the firms we looked at nationally have at least one bill that is past due by at least 90 days," said Mr. Kresge. "That's really very late."

HEADLINE: Expensive Homes;
Move-Up Buyers May Be Returning

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

DATELINE: RANDOLPH, N.J.

 BODY:
After a slow start, the pace of sales at two expensive single-family home communities in western Morris County is picking up, suggesting that move-up buyers, long absent from the market, are returning.
"It is still a tough sell, but the projects are moving," said Andrew B. Abramson, president of the Value Group of Clifton, the developer. 
 Mr. Abramson credits the rise in sales to lower interest rates and to increasing buyer confidence in the economy. He also said that the willingness of first-time buyers to purchase existing homes had "eased the logjam" for move-up buyers, who had been unable to purchase new homes until they had sold their old ones.
A total of 56 semi-custom, four- and five-bedroom, mostly colonial-style homes are planned at the two communities, which are a 75-minute drive from Manhattan. They have from 2,800 to 5,000 square feet of space and such standard features as a fireplace, three-car garage and two-story entrance. The architects are Kitchen & Associates of Westmont and Stern, Ring & Associates of Livingston, both in New Jersey.
At the 50-acre Rickland Estates at Shongum in Randolph, not far from the intersection of Route 10 and Franklin Road, the 32 homes sit on 1- to 1.5-acre lots and cost from $397,900 to $627,900. Since sales began in early 1991, contracts have been signed or are pending on 17 homes, seven of them in the last four months, said Mary Boorman, director of sales and marketing at the Value Group.
At the 75-acre Rickland Estates at Flanders in Mount Olive close to Route 46, there are 24 homes on two- to five-acre wooded lots. Because it is farther west where land is less expensive, these houses carry lower price tags -- $289,000 to $400,000. In the six months since sales began, contracts have been signed on four homes.
The two projects, Mr. Abramson said, offer the same basic house with a range of extras to draw additional buyers. Selling prices are negotiable -- now about 1 percent off the selling price, down from 4 percent last year, Ms. Boorman said.
"A pent-up demand from buyers has spurred sales for new and existing houses in all price ranges," said Gail Goggin, president of the Morris County Board of Realtors. "They have more faith in the economy and recognize that now is a favorable time to buy."
Last month there were 324 sales in the county, up from 219 a year ago, she said, adding that the average sales price of all forms of housing was $235,189.
The market's modest improvement has led a cadre of builders with financial strength to return to home construction. State figures show that 1,103 housing permits were issued in the county last year, up from 733 in 1990. And in the first two months of this year the number swelled to 381 from 55 for the 1991 period.
There are two primary appeals to living in the 477-square-mile county. It is only an hour's drive from midtown Manhattan, easily accessible over interconnecting Routes 80, 287 and 46. There are also job possibilities in the myriad office buildings in the area. Projections are that by the year 2000 the population in the county will grow by 15,120, to 436,473, and it will gain 304,100 new jobs.
Officials in both Randolph and Mount Olive, in the western part of Morris County, said activity was on the rise, with some builders rekindling developments stalled by the recession and others looking to take over troubled projects. To prepare for the next round of growth, master plans are being revised that call for, among other things, limiting high-density development and preserving open space.
Some of the undeveloped land in the communities is subject to environmental constraints to protect wetlands and steep slopes. Those areas are protected by state law or local ordinances and will help keep development in check.
The Value Group, using its own equity, purchased the two tracts for $3.7 million in 1989 and 1990. The land came with already approved site plans made by the prior owners. The company got a $6 million construction loan from the Valley National Bank of Wayne, N.J. The homes, which take six months to construct, are being built at a pace that keeps production just two houses ahead of sales.
Five models are being offered at both projects, and for an additional cost buyers can customize their homes. Residents at Rickland Estates at Shongum can go swimming and boating at the 80-acre Shongum Lake, half a mile away. The entrance fee is about $550 and annual dues are $200.
John and Nancy Soriano, both 36 years old, sold their four-bedroom house in Mount Olive and expect to move into a larger one at Rickland Estate at Shongum in August. He is a physician and she cares for their four children. "We needed more space, and, with interest rates favorable, it was an appropriate time for us to buy," Mrs. Soriano said. "Otherwise, we could not afford this much of a house."

HEADLINE: Panel Votes to Preserve 2 Seawolf Submarines

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
The Senate Appropriations Committee voted today to preserve two Seawolf submarines President Bush wanted to eliminate but still cut $424 million more in Federal spending than the Administration had proposed.
The committee action reflected conflicting trends. Members of Congress are forced to demonstrate support for programs that provide jobs. But they also want to appear to be greater cutters of pork-barrel spending than the President and to back a balanced Federal budget. 
 President Bush proposed four bills by which Congress would take back money it had already appropriated, covering more than 100 programs totaling $7.86 billion. The Senate panel voted 19 to 9 to augment those cuts, known as recisions, with additional cuts of $189 million in domestic spending, $172 million in international aid and $63 million in military spending.
The committee decided to go ahead with constructing the Seawolf submarines at a cost of $2.9 billion by cutting $1.3 billion in Strategic Defense Initiative research and $1 billion in B-2 bomber expenditures instead.
Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who is chairman of the committee, said Mr. Bush "threw down the gauntlet" by proposing the cutbacks and Congress was forced to react.
Among the items cut by the committee were more than $500 million in excess Defense Department inventories and executive salaries, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of Federal grants, including some for studies like one on the mating behavior of swordfish and another on ways of measuring patients' fear of dentists.
The committee decided to cut permanently $39 million in military aid to Peru, which the Administration had merely suspended in protest of President Alberto K. Fujimori's dissolving his country's Congress and judiciary April 5.
Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said that money could go toward paying compensation to the family of an airman who was killed when Peruvian combat planes opened fire on an American military aircraft last week.
The hottest debate was over the two submarines, part of the Seawolf program being phased out by the Administration. Several Republicans argued that in the post-cold-war world the United States needs sophisticated antimissile defenses in the sky far more than sophisticated submarines under the oceans.
But the Democratic majority disagreed, in part because the Seawolf program provides more jobs. Senator Brock Adams, Democrat of Washington, estimated that the committee action could save 7,500 jobs, most of them in Connecticut, or 3,500 more than are jeopardized by the accompanying cuts in the "Star Wars" and B-2 programs. The submarines are to be built in Groton, Conn., by the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation.
Republican Senators Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire, Don Nickles of Oklahoma and Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York joined the Democrats in voting for the Democratic alternative.
"Congress is finally getting the message that we better wake up and get a grip on spending," said Mr. D'Amato, explaining his vote in an interview. "I predict a constitutional amendment will be passed and eventually lead the Congress to make decisions it was heretofore unlikely to make, especially with the growth of entitlements."
Still, the New York Republican was quick to take credit in a news release after the committee meeting for removing a cut of upgraded engines for F-14 warplanes that was planned for Grumman Corporation. The reduction would have cost the Long Island economy $143 million over five years, he said. He also noted that the Seawolf program would benefit subcontractors in Syracuse, Buffalo, Westchester, Elmira and Long Island.
 
The Next Steps
 Before the Democratic bill can be enacted it must be passed by the full Senate and reconciled with a House version.
On Wednesday, the House Appropriations Committee considered three of the four Administration measures and proposed adding $100 million more in cuts than the White House had asked for. The House committee voted to save one of the two Seawolf submarines.
Whatever cuts are eventually passed will be too small to significantly dent the nearly $400 billion budget deficit. The cuts made will affect programs in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Primaries;
Next Campaign Stop Is Indiana, a Friendly State (to Clinton, That Is)

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, April 30

 BODY:
It is a wonder that Edmund G. Brown Jr. even bothers with Indiana.
This is one of the few states where party organizations retain most of their power, and Gov. Evan Bayh has thrown the Democratic Party apparatus solidly behind the former California Governor's front-running rival for the 1992 Democratic Presidential nomination, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas. 
 The popular, 35-year-old Mr. Bayh is not the only heavy hitter working hard for Mr. Clinton in the run-up to the state's primary on Tuesday; so is the executive director of the state party, Ann Delaney, who refers to the Clinton campaign as "we." Her husband, Edward O. Delaney, is listed as Mr. Clinton's state coordinator. Three of the state's eight Democratic members of the House, including the highly influential Representative Lee H. Hamilton, are also in the Arkansan's corner.
Mr. Clinton, who has made only one appearance here so far, has offices in four cities in the state; Mr. Brown has none. Mr. Clinton comes into the Indiana campaign with all the advantages of solid victories in New York and Pennsylvania; Mr. Brown has not won since Connecticut on March 24.
 
Cautious Kind of Voters
 And to top it all off, Indiana is Mr. Clinton's kind of state.
Hoosiers are a culturally cautious lot, more turned off than voters in many other states by the former California Governor's interest in Buddhism and his unconventional dress. A visitor hears the mocking nickname "Governor Moonbeam" everywhere. What's more, the southern half of the state behaves politically like a Southern state, giving Indiana as a whole a decidedly conservative cast.
"There's not a lot of anti-incumbent, anti-insider sentiment here, so Brown can't count on that," said Mary Beth Schneider, The Indianapolis Star's politics writer. "We don't have anyone in the House who wrote 300 bad checks, we don't have anyone who beat up on Anita Hill and we don't have a Governor who's raised taxes."
Governor Bayh has, in fact, led a major Democratic comeback in the state by holding the line on major taxes and cutting government spending. Republicans now hold the two Senate seats and a one-vote majority in the State Senate, but not much else.
Mr. Brown, who qualified for the ballot in Indiana only when the sheet-metal workers' union agreed at the last minute to circulate his petitions, presses on anyway. He flew directly to Indianapolis from Pennsylvania for a rally Tuesday night, and he is to be back this weekend, with stops scheduled for Fort Wayne and for northwest Indiana, near Chicago.
"Clinton is getting very close, but he's not there yet," he acknowledged here this week. "We're here because in a democratic society there's got to be a debate. Issues have got to be raised and fought over."
 
Little Behind Candidacy
 As he had in his final speech in Philadelphia, the former California Governor looked beyond the current test, even beyond the June 2 primary in his own state, which will end the long series of nominating battles. After "the last gavel" of the Democratic National Convention, he said, "we build a movement and a cause to restore real democracy based on the American people controlling their government."
But every politician and political observer interviewed here agreed with the comment of Mrs. Delaney, the party executive director, who said of the Brown campaign, "There's nothing there but the candidate himself."
"I'd be very startled if Clinton didn't roll up a very impressive margin in percentage terms, although the turnout will be very low and a lot of people will vote for him without much conviction," said Prof. Leroy Rieselbach of Indiana University's political science department. "Brown doesn't generate much excitement, except in the academic enclaves around Purdue, Notre Dame and this place, and even here it's not very much."
Indiana, which chooses 77 Democratic delegates, is one of three states with primaries scheduled Tuesday. North Carolina chooses 84 and the District of Columbia chooses 17.
With his Pennsylvania victory, even slightly clouded as it was by many Democrats' continuing doubts about his electability, Mr. Clinton appears to be unstoppable, even if Mr. Brown were to win California, which most party leaders think less and less likely. But Mr. Clinton is holding to his intention of campaigning everywhere, partly to introduce himself to voters for the fall campaign against President Bush and probably H. Ross Perot.
"People in Indiana want to participate," said Jeffrey Watson, Mr. Clinton's state director. "They don't want to be taken for granted. So we will make every effort to let voters here get to know Governor Clinton."
So Mr. Clinton will campaign in New Albany, across the Ohio River from Louisville, Ky., on Sunday, then head to Indianapolis for appearances on Monday. A stop at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend is also under discussion, Mr. Watson said.
Occasionally in the past, Indiana has had spirited Presidential primaries. A notable example was the turbulent 1968 campaign, when Robert F. Kennedy defeated Eugene J. McCarthy and Gov. Roger Branigin, running as a stand-in for Lyndon B. Johnson in an effort to stop Mr. Kennedy. The Indianapolis newspapers, owned by Vice President Dan Quayle's family, took a harshly anti-Kennedy line.
But alas, no such zesty melodrama is likely to develop this time. Neither candidate has run any television commercials, and it seems doubtful that either will. No television confrontations are scheduled. About the biggest excitement of the primary, one leading Democrat said, has been the appearance in the last few days of big red "Perot" buttons on a lot of lapels in downtown Indianapolis.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Down Marginally Despite Favorable Reports

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell marginally in quiet dealings yesterday, with traders ignoring economic news that might otherwise have benefited the currency.
Dollar trading was virtually unaffected by several reports that showed an improving economy. Such reports often strengthen the dollar. 
 John McCarthy, chief currency dealer for Algemene Bank Nederland in New York, attributed some of the dollar's decline to traders who were selling the currency to take profits. He also said technical factors played a role.
In addition, some traders trimmed their holdings in the face of a three-day May Day holiday in Europe that starts today.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 133.38 Japanese yen, from 133.07 on Tuesday. The Japanese market was closed Wednesday for a national holiday. In London, the dollar fell to 133.32 yen. In New York, the dollar weakened to 133.25 yen, from 133.50 late Wednesday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7755, from $1.7700 late Wednesday. In New York, one pound cost $1.7780, more expensive than $1.7725 the day before.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with rates late Wednesday, included: 1.6480 marks, down from 1.6575; 1.5105 Swiss francs, down from 1.5210; 1.1924 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1946; 5.5600 French francs, down from 5.5875, and 1,239 lire, down from 1,246.00.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday, were: 1.6530 German marks, down from 1.6560; 1.5175 Swiss francs, down from 1.5220; 5.5770 French francs, down from 5.5845; 1,241.75 Italian lire, down from 1,245.75; 1.1964 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1940.

HEADLINE: A Free-Enterprise Plan for an Everglades Cleanup

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.

 BODY:
Civilization is nowhere to be seen in the center of the state's Water Conservation Area 2A, a part of the Everglades just 20 miles west of the shopping malls and golf courses of suburban Palm Beach County. A half-dozen wading birds stalk their prey in the clear, shallow lagoon, a blue-gray contrast to the wet prairie of pale-green sawgrass stretching to the horizon.
A few miles north, though, closer to the pumps that drain irrigation water from sugar and vegetable farms into the great marsh, the scene is very different. Dense stands of cattails, nourished by traces of phosphorus used to fertilize lettuce, celery and sugar cane, have overwhelmed competing plants. The water is clouded with cattail debris, denying life-sustaining sunlight to the algae that anchor the Everglades' fragile food chain. 
 To many Floridians, this cattail invasion is a symbol of Big Agriculture's indifference to the environment. And they see the 1991 legal settlement requiring the state to purify the runoff at the farm owners' expense as a triumph of decency over greed.
 
Looking to Cut Costs by 75%
 But to economists working far from the rough-and-tumble of Florida's interest-group politics, the mandate to get the phosphorus out of Everglades waters is an opportunity to show that free markets can slash the cost of keeping America green. They have proposed a system of tradable pollution credits that would give farm owners incentives to find and use the cheapest possible phosphorus-removal methods. They contend that the plan, which they hope will win state approval, could get the job done for less than a quarter of the cost of a government cleanup.
Washington has given its stamp of approval to similar cost-conscious approaches for containing smog in Los Angeles and limiting emissions of acid rain nationwide. And the Everglades plan is already winning cautious praise from the Bush Administration.
"People want to realize both economic goals and environmental aspirations," said William K. Reilly, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. "Trading is one of the most promising strategies."
 
Thousands of Jobs at Stake
 With thousands of jobs on the line in Florida's bitterly poor farm country, the South Florida Water Management District also seems ready to listen to alternatives to regulation-as-usual. "It doesn't matter how we get to the goal," said Peter Rhoads, the administrator of the cleanup, "as long as we get there soon."
The unique ecology of the Everglades is a product of the state's pancake-flat geography and subtropical seasons of wet and dry. During the rainy summer months, rivers from the north fill Lake Okeechobee, in the center of the state. From there, the water slowly drains south to the sea.
Before human intervention, the lake simply overflowed its southern bank each year, transforming all but a narrow ridge along the east coast of South Florida into what the environmentalist Marjory Stoneman Douglas called a "river of grass." Today, 1,400 miles of canals, built largely at Federal expense over the last 70 years, channel the water through a half-million acres of farmland and an equal area of suburban sprawl. The portion that does not evaporate ends up in the Everglades marsh, now protected by the state and Federal authorities in a series of parks and conservation areas.
 
Difficulty Mimicking Nature
 This multibillion-dollar plumbing system prevents floods, irrigates farms that produce much of the nation's sugar cane and winter vegetables and helps to slake the thirst of greater Miami. But it cannot precisely mimic nature in sustaining the wetlands. And for decades, environmentalists have asserted that the decline in both the quality and quantity of water entering protected areas is slowly degrading the Everglades into a garden-variety swamp.
In 1988, they got the ear of the United States Attorney in Miami, who sued the State of Florida to prevent phosphorus-laden water from reaching the jewel in the Everglades crown, the Everglades National Park. And in spite of protests from farm groups, the state settled the suit last July with a promise to convert a wide swath of agricultural land into filtration marshes. These "storm-water treatment areas" would be filled with phosphorus-gobbling plants that would remove virtually all the offending nutrient before it reached the part of the Everglades the state is trying to protect.
A 3,700-acre prototype is now under construction. But to remove the 100 tons of phosphorus as required in the legal settlement, the Water Management District plans to expand the filtration area to a total of 35,000 acres now used for farming.
 
Cost Estimated at $380 Million
 Paul Muncy, the district's financial expert, estimates that the acquisition of the land and the construction of the marshes could come to $380 million. A 1991 state law gives the district the authority to pass most of the costs on to the farm owners, through charges on each ton of phosphorus they discharge into public canals.
Such numbers are the stuff of nightmares for local farm owners, from vegetable growers with a few acres to mighty agribusinesses. Robert Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who is a consultant to the United States Sugar Corporation, the largest of the growers, estimates that the interest on bonds used to finance the treatment areas, plus operating expenses, would run to at least $34 million a year. That comes to $340,000 for each ton of phosphorus removed, a level at which Bob Buker, a vice president of the company, said, "all winter vegetables would become uneconomic."
Mr. Hahn, at the behest of United States Sugar, developed an alternative. Under the plan, the Water Management District would set a ceiling on total discharges of phosphorus and assign discharge credits to each farm in proportion to its acreage or historical rate of pollution. Farm owners would be free to meet their limit any way they liked, either cutting runoffs on their own or buying credits from others prepared to run super-clean operations.
 
Variety of Cheap Fixes
 The approach is attractive to Mr. Buker, because he is certain that United States Sugar can cut phosphorus output for a small fraction of the $340,000 a ton the Water Management District is likely to charge. The company runs two sugar mills, which could isolate several tons of phosphorus each year for just a few thousand dollars a ton. But every farm owner could probably count on finding a few relatively cheap fixes.
One is to monitor farm water levels more closely, thereby pumping a lower volume of dissolved phosphorus into public canals and stirring up a smaller volume of phosphorus-laden sediment from canal bottoms. Better pumping practices alone, Mr. Buker reckons, could reduce the amount of phosphorus reaching the Everglades by 58 tons a year, at a cost of just $13,000 a ton.
Another is to line canals with limestone, which chemically traps phosphorus dissolved in water. Potential savings: 42 tons at $147,000 a ton -- big money, indeed, but far less than the Water Management District would charge.
 
Agribusiness Figures at Issue
 Experts will no doubt dispute Mr. Buker's figures on both the potential reductions in phosphorus and cost savings from specific cleanup technologies. But one advantage of a system of trading pollution credits, Mr. Hahn notes, is that regulators do not call balls and strikes but certify only that the game was played by the rules.
Mr. Rhoads of the Water Management District agrees that monitoring the amount of phosphorus leaving each farm would be relatively cheap and easy. Farm owners could thus be held to their obligation to dump no more of the offending nutrient than the permits call for.
Outlining a system of trading pollution credits for the Everglades is one thing. Persuading the parties to the settlement to give a market-based solution a try is quite another.
In part, the reluctance to recast the agreement is based on issues of substance. Everyone agrees that phosphorus is only one source of damage to the Everglades. Other chemicals -- and probably more important, the timing and pattern of water flows -- may be responsible for much of the damage. And some environmentalists believe that filtration marshes would offer greater flexibility in curing the as-yet-undiagnosed malady.
A bigger problem is that the long battle over the farms' responsibility for damage to the wetlands has left environmentalists wary of dialogue that might only be an excuse for delay. "There's lots to talk about," said James Webb of the Wilderness Society's office in Miami. "I just don't feel like talking to those guys."
But this ill will is not likely to be a deal-stopper, if only because many environmental professionals think pollution-credit trading is just too good an idea to pass by. "No one in his right mind," said Zach Willey of the Environmental Defense Fund, should fight an approach that "would achieve environmental goals and save jobs and money at the same time."

Results Improve at Chrysler, But It Remains in the Red

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 30

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation, in the midst of feverish efforts to improve consumer acceptance of its models and its financial stability, reported a sharply improved performance for the first quarter today. But unlike Ford and General Motors, which reported profits earlier in the week, the auto maker was unable to move into the black.
The No. 3 American car maker posted a loss of $13 million, on revenues of $8.19 billion, in contrast to a loss of $598 million, on revenues of $5.84 billion, in the comparable period last year. Both losses reflected large one-time gains from an accounting change relating to income taxes. 
 "The industry is starting to show some signs of recovery, but it's not coming back as fast as we'd like," said Lee A. Iacocca, the chairman and chief executive. "We couldn't overcome the cost of several new-product launches and other unusual events during the quarter."
Although analysts and investors are pleased at the progress Chrysler has made by introducing new models, cutting costs and raising more capital, the company still has major hurdles looming before it is out of danger.
"Chrysler still depends on the economy and auto sales improving, and they are very fragile, though improving," said Harvey Heinbach, the automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company in New York. "The costs for product introduction are big, but they aren't going away."
Because of its large losses relative to its equity base, Chrysler has a far thinner financial cushion than the General Motors Corporation or the Ford Motor Company. Analysts remain concerned about Chrysler's financial subsidiary, the Chrysler Financial Corporation, which is negotiating new credit lines to replace financing that expires over two years.
Without revived sales and earnings, Chrysler could have trouble obtaining new credit from its bankers, which would jeopardize retail financing for its new models.
The Chrysler Financial Corporation posted a first-quarter profit of $111 million, including a one-time gain related to the new accounting standard for income taxes, up from a profit of $77 million last year.
 
Sells Mitsubishi Stake
 Also included in the quarter was a one-time net gain of $88 million from Chrysler's sale of the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation's common shares, reducing Chrysler's stake to 5.9 percent from 10.9 percent. Chrysler common shares fell 37.5 cents on the New York Stock Exchange today to finish at $19.25. And Chrysler recorded a one-time loss of $63 million in the first quarter, reflecting the loss on its investment in a Canadian real estate company, which it declined to name.
Last year's first-quarter loss was increased by a $257 million charge against earnings to reflect a change in accounting for sales incentives.
Like the rest of the domestic industry, Chrysler was able to improve financial performance mainly by increasing the sales volume of cars and trucks from factories to dealers. Last year, retail sales to individuals were only slightly lower, but dealers were liquidating inventories so they were not buying aggressively from the Big Three.
Chrysler's worldwide vehicle sales to dealers totaled 496,190 in the quarter, up 25.1 percent from 396,410.
The results were not surprising to Chrysler, which had predicted that its first-quarter results would be worse than those of the fourth quarter, when the car maker bested Ford and G.M. by posting a small profit as the others recorded losses.
On the positive side, the Chrysler's new Jeep Grand Cherokee model has received very favorable reviews since production began in January. Chrysler will soon begin promoting its L/H mid-sized sedans, three new car models aimed at the Ford Taurus, Honda Accord and others that some in the automotive industry have named "last hope."
Prototypes of the L/H models have received positive comments from indpendent testers, but Chrysler also needs a problem-free rollout of production vehicles from its plant in Bramalea, Ontario.

HEADLINE: Indicators Up by 0.2% In March

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
The Government index meant to forecast the economy posted its third straight gain in March, rising a modest two-tenths of 1 percent, the Commerce Department reported today.
This latest reading of the index of leading indicators, combined with other statistics reported today on first-time jobless claims, factory orders and the rising activity of Chicago-area purchasing managers, was still further indication of an economic recovery that unlike last year's was very likely to be sustained. 
 "The risk of a triple-dip can almost be ignored," asserted Howard Keen, the chief economist for Conrail, the big freight carrier based in Philadelphia.
But while many analysts have been busy this week raising estimates for overall growth, with 3 percent for the year no longer regarded as unduly optimistic, most continued to point to relatively sluggish expansion in coming quarters.
 
A Cautious Outlook
 "No change to our slow-go outlook," C. J. Lawrence's team of economists told clients, adding that the first-quarter surge in consumer spending reported by the Government on Tuesday could not continue.
The March gain in the leading index was well under the nine-tenths of 1 percent average gain for January and February, with big gains for two components being largely offset by weakness elsewhere.
At the same time, a companion index gauging current economic activity was unchanged in March after a five-tenths of 1 percent February advance that broke a string of declines from October through January. The four components of the coincident index -- the non-farm payrolls, industrial production, manufacturing and trade sales and personal income excluding transfer payments -- were essentially the criteria used by the National Bureau of Economic Research to designate July 1990 as the start of the latest, and still officially unended, recession.
 
Confirmation of Trend
 Still another index, one that lags behind the economy at large and thus is seen as confirming a new direction, rose four-tenths of 1 percent in March, breaking a streak of 13 straight declines. The seven components of the index of lagging indicators are average duration of unemployment, the inventory-to-sales ratio, unit labor costs, the prime rate, bank loans, the ratio of consumer installment credit to income, and consumer prices.
The rise in the predictive index was paced by a big improvement in consumer expectations and a surge in the price of a group of materials particularly sensitive to the business cycle. Small positive contributions were made by a rise in contracts and orders for new plant and equipment and by an increase in the proportion of companies reporting slower deliveries from suppliers.
Six of the 11 components pulled the leading index down, the biggest drag being a drop in the M-2 money supply, which includes currency, checking accounts, savings accounts and money-market mutual funds.
Other negative forces were lower building permits, a fall in manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods, lower unfilled orders for durable manufactured goods, a drop in stock prices and a rise in first-time claims, since reversed, for unemployment insurance.
The final component, the length of the average workweek, was unchanged in March.
 
'A Very Reliable Indicator'
 Mr. Keen of Conrail said one reason for his confidence that this year's economic pickup would not run out of steam was that April was the first month since the recession began in which there was both a rise in commodity prices and a decline in initial jobless claims. "This to me is a very reliable indicator," he added, citing what he called a nearly infallible record of moving with, though not ahead, of the economy.
Meanwhile, two predictive indicators compiled by private analysts also moved forward at latest reading. Safian Investment Research said its index had risen four-tenths of 1 percent, and Herzog Heine Geduld reported its Macro-Economic index had risen to plus 139 from 126 on a scale at which 50 signals recovery.
The ratio of the Government's coincident index to its lagging index -- regarded as a forecaster -- fell slightly after two straight gains.
The Center for International Business Cycle Research at Columbia University, citing the strong correlation it has found between the length of a business expansion and the behavior of the prime rate at its outset, ventured today that the economy would grow for nearly three years from last year's trough, "or through early 1994."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Where Will East Find Foundations?

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE euphoria that greeted the downfall of Communism in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union has given way to anxiety that it will take many years for these states to make the transition to effectively functioning market economies -- and some may not make it at all before dictatorship returns.
A major obstacle is the difficulty of supplying the enormous amount of capital that will be required for the capital stock of the countries in the East to reach the level of Western industrial nations. The requirements of the former East Germany alone, with a population of only 20 million, is expected to cost the German Government more than $50 billion a year for several years. 
 Nothing on that scale will be possible to meet the capital needs of the nearly 400 million people of Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, which, by conservative estimate, will total $180 billion a year for 10 years.
The seven major industrial countries -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- this week endorsed a $24 billion aid package for Russia alone within the context of an agreed International Monetary Fund program for stabilizing the economy.
The problem of capital shortage is only one of the fundamental obstacles the former Communist states must overcome. They have to get rid of Stalinism's economic institutions if they are to move forward. In "Faulty Foundations: Soviet Economic Policies, 1928-1940," to be published next week by the Princeton University Press, Holland Hunter and Janusz M. Szyrmer describe that Stalinist legacy, which includes these shortcomings:
*An irrational structure of relative prices set by bureaucrats, which distorts the use of resources and breeds shortages and inefficiencies.
*A focus on physical output and an excessive emphasis on producer goods and monumental projects, to the neglect of intangible output, improvement in the quality of goods and services and environmental consequences.
*Obsolete plant and equipment, and poorly trained and motivated labor and mangement.
*Public suspicions of the old Communist leaders, agents, operatives and the "nomenklatura" -- the important officials and bureaucrats -- and public suspicions of the new capitalists, many of whom were drawn from the old order or from criminal elements of society.
"These new business efforts, surrounded as they are by graft, corruption and Mafia-like 'protection services,' need a legal system equipped to enforce a normal commercial code," Mr. Holland says. "At the same time the code should not be a cloak for maintaining the old planned-economy administrative controls over day-to-day business decisions. In the absence of a well-enforced commercial code, joint ventures with Western firms face discouraging prospects."
Conventional economic prescriptions for reforming the ex-Communist economies neglect the barriers to economic growth posed by the inadequate legal, moral and institutional foundations for an effective market economy, says Prof. Richard Rose of the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, writing in the April issue of the Journal of Democracy, published by the Johns Hopkins University Press. The standard view taught in most American graduate economic departments that "a market is a market is a market, whether legal or not," may hold up tolerably well in Western economies, where illegality is the exception not the rule.
But in this transition period between Communism and capitalism, the systems are an inefficient and chaotic mixture of legal, nonlegal and parasiticial economies. Most households in Eastern Europe have people working in the official economy, subject to law, but with incomes insufficient to meet their basic needs. Mr. Rose quotes a Bulgarian saying of the day: "If you have to live from only one job, you will die." So most people turn to the illegal economies to make ends meet.
Achieving legitimacy and true civil societies, essential to the development of a market system in which domestic and international businesses can operate freely and effectively, must become the primary goal of countries in the former Soviet empire.
But how to achieve a more legitimate society? In an interview in New York yesterday, Anatoly A. Sobchak, the Mayor of St. Petersburg, who is a lawyer by profession, said: "Everyone thinks the answer is a quick fix -- greater coercion. But the best answer is to raise living standards."
A recent survey in Moscow, he said, found that 60 percent of female students were engaged in prostitution. In St. Petersburg, he said, the ratio is 30 percent. "You can't stop it by coercion," he added. "You've got to try something else. We have no proper legal framework. The problem is not having enough laws. Rather, as the German philospher Karl Jaspers said, 'It's not what we create on paper, but what we live by."

HEADLINE: Safety Net Savior

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 30

 BODY:
In his two-story house in one of Albany's most comfortable suburbs, Michael J. Dowling keeps a scale model of the thatch-roofed cottage that was his boyhood home in Limerick, Ireland. He built the model several years ago as a reminder of humble beginnings.
A large cooking fireplace provided the only heat in the three-room house, and a ditch in the yard served as the toilet. At night, rats would crawl out of the thatch to warm themselves by the embers. When it rained, water would seep through the thick mud walls, forming inch-deep puddles on the dirt floor. 
 It is a long way from that wee house in Limerick to Mr. Dowling's spacious office in the Capitol, where he is now Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's director of health, education and human services. In that job, he serves as the Governor's top adviser on everything from Medicaid to mental health and oversees agencies that spend almost two-thirds of the state's $30.8 billion budget.
But Mr. Dowling's journey out of poverty left him with both a personal compassion for the disadvantaged and a pragmatic approach to government. And that approach, which emphasizes self-help over dependency and incremental progress over grand vision, has left a lasting imprint on New York's social policy during the difficult days of the recession.
 
Fiscal Pressures
 "Nobody knows the poor better than Mike or feels for them more than Mike," Mr. Cuomo said in a recent interview. "But he's a person who knows life too, and knows that you can't always have all that you want at the moment."
That understanding has been critical to the 42-year-old Mr. Dowling's efforts to preserve New York's social safety net when there is increasing political pressure to shrink it.
In a nod to the fiscal constraints of the times, he has used a succession of tough budgets as a rationale for making the system more efficient. But he also has placed his linebacker's frame in the way of the kind of radical cuts in social-service programs being made in states from California to Massachusetts.
For a man whose greatest joy was once the creation of new programs, the sometimes frustrating mission of the last three years has been to protect what already exists.
"Given the bad budgets of the last couple of years, we've been able to maintain the core programs we feel are most important," Mr. Dowling said. "Nothing has been dismantled."
 
Expanding Portfolio
 But social-service advocates, while praising Mr. Dowling's commitment, said that the state's recurring budget problems had forced him to swallow hard over some decisions. "I think he's holding together what he can hold together," said Elie S. Ward, deputy director of Statewide Youth Advocacy. "In some cases he's being successful, and in other ways things are crumbling."
"The budget and the politics have put him in a position of having to defend things you can tell he doesn't want to defend," she added.
Many who work with Mr. Dowling, whose salary is $96,662, believe he is stretched too thin. As Mr. Cuomo has expanded Mr. Dowling's portfolio in the last year, it has fallen to Mr. Dowling to forge agreements between the Democratic-majority Assembly, which is highly protective of programs for the disadvantaged, and the Republican-led Senate, which sees the recession as an opportunity to cut social-service spending.
Last month, he brokered major components of the deal that produced $1.1 billion in savings from the state's Medicaid and welfare programs.
In the last year, Mr. Dowling directed the searches for the state's new health and social services commissioners. He worked with New York City officials to design new programs to move homeless people out of shelters and to fight outbreaks of tuberculosis and measles.
He helped design legislation to require Medicaid recipients to seek care from health maintenance organizations. He had a heavy influence on Mr. Cuomo's decision to keep private the names of health care workers who are infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. And Mr. Dowling successfully pushed to close underused mental hospitals in order to free money for community mental health programs.
"There's an understanding in Albany now that in the health and human services arena he is the most important policy-maker, more important than any commissioner," said Cesar A. Perales, the former state social-services commissioner who is now New York City's deputy mayor for health and human services.
 
Work at a Young Age
 When Mr. Dowling's father, a laborer "with big meathooks for hands," had to stop working at a young age because of a debilitating bout with arthritis, the family accepted disability payments from the Irish welfare system. But Mr. Dowling, the oldest of five siblings, helped support the family by working continuously through his childhood -- milking cows, toiling in factories and traveling to England for the summer because the wages there were higher.
"I basically developed the feeling that families who are struggling need assistance, and that the kind that is provided should recognize their struggle," Mr. Dowling said. "But I also developed a very strong sense that while the system should help you, it should never undercut the desire of people to help themselves."
Mr. Dowling first came to the United States to find summer jobs that would help him pay for his undergraduate education in Ireland. He worked on construction crews, on the New York City docks, and even in the engine room of a Circle Line cruise boat, where he often slept as well.
 
Bond With the Governor
 After moving to New York permanently in 1971, he earned a master's degree in social work from Fordham University, held a series of jobs as a consultant on anti-poverty issues and then returned to Fordham to teach and serve as an assistant dean. He joined the State Department of Social Services as a deputy commissioner in 1983 and moved to Mr. Cuomo's central staff five years later.
Those who know both Mr. Dowling and Mr. Cuomo see a special bond between the two men, largely because Mr. Dowling's story is so similar to that of Mr. Cuomo's parents, who were poor Italian immigrants.
"Mike is not some academician," Mr. Cuomo said, "not some elegantly educated elitist type who, with heart pure as gold, turns the pages of his texts with uncallused fingers and learns about life mostly by observing -- albeit with great compassion -- how poorer people live lives he's never experienced. That kind of person can become an intellectual zealot on a subject and be unbending.
"Mike knows what poverty is, knows what hard work is. Most of all he knows the give and take of life, the hard practicalities."
 
Lobbying Over a Beer
 On a staff that is known for being all work and no play, Mr. Dowling does much of his most persuasive lobbying over a pitcher of beer at pubs near the Capitol. Tall and burly, he wears a scruffy beard that perfectly complements his ready smile and a lilting accent that Mr. Cuomo describes as one-quarter prose and three-quarters music.
"With that disarming Irish brogue of his, he can tell people bad news and they will look at it and say thank you," said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association.
But Mr. Dowling is also known as a no-nonsense negotiator whose face turns port-red when he grows impatient. His bouts of profanity, including those in the Governor's presence, are so common they are now dismissed as more endearing than intemperate.
"It's no big deal anymore when his cheeks turn red," said one colleague. "It's only when his neck starts to turn red that I get worried."
That side of Mr. Dowling's temperament may have been honed on the hurling field, where he was a championship player of the rugged Irish pastime that is part field hockey, part soccer. His philosophy on game day, Mr. Dowling said, was that "if your head gets in the way of my stick, that's your problem."
But for the most part, Mr. Dowling has become known as a conciliator who is forever seeking common ground. "I'm not a purist who identifies an ideal and says we can only accept success if we get what we've set in our dreams," he said. "The history of progress is taking continuous steps forward all the time."

HEADLINE: Dinkins to Visit Europe in June on Trade Mission

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Seeking foreign investments to pull the city out of its economic slump, Mayor David N. Dinkins will try to persuade European companies to place their American corporate headquarters in New York City when he visits Europe in June, city officials and business leaders said yesterday.
Mr. Dinkins formally announced yesterday that he will visit London, Paris and Frankfurt on a five-day trade mission beginning on June 1. The New York City Partnership and the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry will pay expenses for the Mayor and his aides, estimated at about $4,000 per person. A total figure could not be obtained last night because officials had not decided how many aides would go. 
 At least 20 executives from utilities, banks, insurance companies, accounting firms and real estate companies will accompany the Mayor, along with his recently appointed Deputy Mayor for Finance, Barry F. Sullivan. Representatives from the state Department of Economic Development and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey also plan to go.
The delegation will include Preston R. Tisch, president of the Loews Corporation, Lance R. Primis, president and general manager of The New York Times, and Robert B. Catell, president of Brooklyn Union Gas.
The city will pay for the Mayor's security detail. The companies sending executives will pay for them.
 
'Not a Junket'
 Mr. Sullivan, who took over as the city's chief financial development official last month, said the trip to Europe would be all work.
"This is not a junket," Mr. Sullivan said yesterday. "For those of you who have done overseas travel, there is no fun in being in three cities in five days, working from breakfast through dinner."
Mr. Dinkins's travels stirred controversy last year. Last fall, good-government lobbyists raised questions about his use of a quasi-public corporation to solicit donations from companies doing business with the city for his journey to South Africa, which he billed as a trade mission. The Mayor also initially accepted an expense-paid trip to Munich, Germany, to see a tennis tournament, but canceled the trip after critics charged that it presented a conflict of interest.
Gene Russianoff, a staff lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research Group, said the trip in June did not pose the same ethical dilemmas that the South African trip did. The trip to Europe is not a vacation, he said, and the partnership asked the Mayor to head the delegation, not the other way around.
 
Normal Course of Duties
 "These kinds of trips are classic in the job resume of what the Mayor is supposed to do," Mr. Russianoff said.
The city will focus on attracting service-sector companies that wish to establish corporate headquarters in the United States, Mr. Sullivan said, though a few of the companies the group will court may have interest in light manufacturing plants.
The delegation will fly to London on June 1, where it will meet with the American ambassador, British concerns with New York offices and London financial institutions that may be interested in underwriting city projects.
On June 3, the Mayor plans to fly to Paris for a meeting with Mayor Jacques Chirac, the Chamber of Commerce and several financial institutions and the next day he is scheduled to meet with French business leaders. On June 5, Mr. Dinkins will meet in Frankfurt with its mayor and business leaders including executives of the Treuhandanstalt, the German privatization agency that is selling the businesses and property of the former East German state. The Mayor is also scheduled to visit a Holocaust memorial.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Up 1.6%, Biggest Gain in 5 Months

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
Orders to United States factories in March recorded their sharpest advance in five months, the Government said today in another sign the economic recovery is proceeding.
Manufacturers told the Commerce Department that they had received a seasonally adjusted $240.8 billion in new orders, a stronger-than-expected 1.6 percent increase over the previous month. 
 It was the third consecutive monthly rise, after advances of seven-tenths of 1 percent in February and five-tenths of 1 percent in January, and the largest since October.
"Cross your fingers," said Priscilla Trumbull of the WEFA Group, a forecasting firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. "I think things are turning up, but it's going to be agonizingly slow."
Analysts had been anticipating a March rise of about 1 percent. But manufacturers continued to reduce their backlog of unfilled orders, an indication they can handle the rise in new orders without substantially expanding their payrolls.
The backlog fell six-tenths of 1 percent in March, the seventh drop in a row.
 
Layoffs Are Stemmed
 Ms. Trumbull said today's report suggested the manufacturing sector had rebounded enough to stem layoffs but not enough to generate a lot of new jobs.
"We are at a kind of delicate balance right now," she said. "Things are pointing up but they aren't pointing up so definitively and strongly that we're going to see employers rushing out to hire new people."
Despite recent gains in new orders, their level was still 5.6 percent below the $255 billion peak reached in December 1990, early in the recession.
Much of the strength in March came from a revised 2.1 percent gain in orders for durable goods, substantial items expected to last three or more years. They range from industrial turbines to computers to automobiles to washing machines.
Last week, in an advance estimate, the department said durable goods orders rose only 1.6 percent in March. They were up two-tenths of 1 percent in February and 2.4 percent in January.
Orders for nondurable goods, like food and clothing, rose 1.2 percent in March after a 1.3 percent gain in February.
Among the individual areas of strength in March were engines and turbines, up 14.3 percent; metalworking machinery, up 8.5 percent; communications equipment, up 14.5 percent; military goods, up 10.1 percent, and transportation equipment, up 6.4 percent.
Excluding the often-volatile transportation category, which in March included a 27.1 percent jump in aircraft, overall orders rose nine-tenths of 1 percent last month after a six-tenths of 1 percent gain in February.
Leaving out orders for military goods, another category that swings widely from month to month, orders rose 1.4 percent, the same as in both February and January.
Shipments from factories, a measure of current production, rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in March to $243.9 billion, the 11th increase in the last 12 months.
Inventories held steady at $372.85 billion, the first break after five consecutive declines. Economists are hoping for production gains in future months as manufacturers start to restock their inventories.

HEADLINE: New Claims By Jobless Hold Steady

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits held steady in mid-April, the Government said today, suggesting that the tentative recovery is starting to buoy the labor market.
 Initial claims were unchanged at 404,000 for the week ended April 18, after three weeks of decline in the number of applications for state benefits, the Labor Department said.
 
 Economists, who were expecting an increase of 5,000, viewed the figure as a sign that the recovery is taking hold.
 "It suggests we are not going to slip back into recession and that we will maintain a moderate growth pace," said Jean Sundrla, an analyst at the consulting firm Evans Economics Inc.
 Labor Secretary Lynn Martin said the report was "another indication of the potential for a sturdier recovery."
 "A strengthening of the labor market does seem to be occurring," she said.
 The labor market is usually the last sector of the economy to respond to recovery because companies prefer to delay rehiring until they are convinced that growth is firmly on track.
 Economists said four weeks of flat or declining jobless claims suggested the labor market was stabilizing.
 "These figures are consistent with a modestly recovering economy," said Samuel Kahan, economist at Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago.
 The four-week moving average, which irons out the volatility of weekly reports, declined for the fourth week to reach 414,250, its lowest level since Oct. 25, when claims averaged 411,750.
 The apparent strengthening in the labor market was widespread. Forty-three states and United States territories reported declines in initial claims, led by a 9,032 drop in Pennsylvania.
 Michigan, hard-hit by the downturn, reported a 3,955 decline in first-time claims, with fewer layoffs in the automobile industry, the department said.
 Only two states, Texas and Virginia, reported gains of more than 1,000 new applications, with 2,489 and 1,225 additional claims, respectively. Virginia cited layoffs in the textile, food processing and trade industries for its rise.

HEADLINE: Earnings Up 7% at I.C.I.

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LONDON, April 30

 BODY:
Britain's biggest industrial manufacturer, Imperial Chemical Industries P.L.C., said today that first-quarter 1992 pretax earnings edged up 7 percent, to 212 million, or $374.7 million.
Revenues were little changed at 3.06 billion, or $5.4 billion. 
 I.C.I.'s chairman, Denys Henderson, said there were tentative signs of an economic recovery in the United States and Britain, especially in housing, consumer products and textile markets. But he added, "It is still uncertain when the difficult trading conditions of the past 18 months will finally be behind us."
Pharmaceuticals profits rose by more than a third, to 122 million ($216 million), helped by continued sharp growth in sales of newer products such as the heart drug Zestril, the cancer drug Zoladex and the anaesthetic Diprivan.
Agrochemical profits, however, dipped below levels a year earlier, to 48 million ($85 million) because of lower volumes in January and February.
Analysts expect full-year profits for 1992 to be about 900 million ($1.6 billion), compared with 1991's 843 million ($1.5 billion).

HEADLINE: The Art Market;
Auction Houses Cutting Prices To Lure Buyers

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
TO judge this spring's contemporary-art auctions by their catalogue's covers, literally, is to conclude that times are good. And they are, for buyers. But for sellers and auction houses, the story is not so rosy.
Debt, death and divorce, the three D's of the auction business, keep the art market going. And the adage will be underscored by this season's two weeks of auctions at Sotheby's and Christie's in New York, which begin on Tuesday. And starting this weekend, the works to be sold, over 3,000 paintings, drawings and sculptures by such artists as Picasso and Polke, Renoir and Warhol, valued at more than $325 million, will go on public view at the two houses. 
 With the economy still in a slump and the art market trying to recover from its shaky performance over the last 18 months, few sellers are willingly putting works on the block. As a result, auction house executives are stressing bargain prices and estate merchandise to rebuild buyer enthusiasm.
They are reluctant to predict the outcome, however. "It's in the lap of the gods for both houses," said Christopher Burge, president of Christie's in New York. "There's been a lot of polite interest, especially in the top lots, but until the actual event it's impossible to say what will really happen."
Another issue that neither house is willing to discuss is why much of the art is for sale in the first place. But the works on the covers of Sotheby's and Christie's contemporary catalogues tell the tale. Both are considered exceptional paintings by big-ticket artists, and both are being sold by men whose companies are in financial trouble.
In the case of Sotheby's, the catalogue cover shows Malcolm Morley's 1968 "Vermeer, Portrait of the Artist in His Studio." The work, which belongs to the advertising magnate Charles Saatchi, is a stunning re-creation of a poster of an Old Master painting and is expected to fetch $350,000 to $400,000.
Contemporary experts agree the work is priced to sell. One reason might be to raise money for Mr. Saatchi's London-based company, Saatchi & Saatchi, which reported losses of $103.3 million last year. The Morley is just one of 21 works from Mr. Saatchi's collection that are going on the block on Wednesday. Together, the Saatchi pictures constitute more than a third of the evening's offerings.
Much of Sotheby's contemporary-art sale in November was also from Mr. Saatchi's holdings. While the collector refused to talk about his art dealings, Lucy Mitchell-Innes, head of contemporary art for Sotheby's, said: "Mr. Saatchi is changing the nature of his collection. He is concentrating more on young British artists and blue-chip Americans." This collector's bulk-buying habit a decade ago was widely regarded as a factor in the soaring prices of contemporary art in the 1980's, and his vast unloading when the market peaked was thought to have made the value of many contemporary artists' works plummet.
On Christie's catalogue cover for the Tuesday sale is Andy Warhol's "210 Coca-Cola Bottles," which people in the art world say is still owned by Martin S. Blinder, the man credited with being the first to sell art in shopping malls a decade ago. But his company, Martin Lawrence Limited Editions of Van Nuys, Calif., recently reported a 50 percent decline in revenues between the first nine months of 1990 and the first nine months of 1991.
Mr. Blinder bought the Warhol for $1.43 million at Christie's four years ago. Painted in 1962, it is the largest and most complex of the artist's Coke bottle paintings. Christie's has optimistically estimated that it will bring $2.2 million to $2.8 million. Mr. Blinder did not return phone calls.
"This was the first Warhol to break a million dollars," said Diane Upright, who heads Christie's department of contemporary art. "After that there was a whole upward spiral of prices culminating in 1989, when a Marilyn Monroe sold for more than $4 million. In this context, our estimate really isn't too high." Although Mr. Blinder's name never appears in the catalogue, art experts say they think he is selling several other works that night, too.
Mr. Blinder and Mr. Saatchi are not alone in trying to raise quick cash by selling art. As a result, works are coming back on the market faster than in the years when the economy was stronger. Take the painting on the cover of Christie's May 12 catalogue of Impressionist and modern paintings, drawings and sculpture. It is "La Loge," Renoir's 1874 work of a woman sitting in a box at the opera. It was last at auction at the height of the market, in May 1989, when the German collector Hermann Schnabel bought it at Christie's in New York for $12.1 million.
Mr. Schnabel is selling the painting, along with 13 other works, but this time Christie's has shied away from putting a firm presale estimate on "La Loge." "We're figuring anywhere from $6 million to $8 million," Mr. Burge said. "But who knows."
Estate property is by far the freshest art on the market this spring. And Christie's has two of the season's most enticing estates. On Tuesday, the night of its contemporary auction, it will be selling 25 works from the estate of Frederick Roos, a Swedish businessman, collector and founder of the Rooseum Center for Contemporary Art in Malmo. He died last May at the age of 40, leaving 2,000 works of art and debts of about $20 million.
This spring Christie's is selling only a portion of his holdings. "It's the right estate at the right time," Ms. Upright said. "The sale is filled with artists of the 80's, such as Kiefer, Baselitz, Polke and Richter, German artists whose current price levels are viewed as attractive to collectors and who did stunningly well last spring."
Among the highlights of the sale are Anselm Kiefer's "Columns" (1983) and Georg Baselitz's "Franz in Bed" (1982). Each is estimated to bring $300,000 to $400,000. Another work receiving attention in this sale is Robert Gober's "Untitled (Sink)," estimated to sell for $90,000 to $120,000 and his "Untitled (Bed)," thought to bring $80,000 to $120,000.
"In this climate, Gober is one of the few artists either American or European whose prices continue to rise," Ms. Upright said.
The other big estate sale at Christie's focuses on the property of William A. McCarty-Cooper, the companion and adopted son of Douglas Cooper, a Cubist scholar and collector. The auction will take place on May 11 in a single-owner sale. Highlighting the evening are Braque's "Atelier VIII" (1952-55) and Picasso's "Compote Dish and Guitar" (1932). The auction house refused to commit itself to an estimate on either painting.
Other pre-Cubist and Cubist art from an estate is being offered at Sotheby's on May 13. The works belonged to Sidney E. Cohn, a labor-relations lawyer. Included in the auction are two 1907 drawings Picasso made as studies for the oil painting "Nude and Drapery." One is "Study of Head for Nude With Drapery," which depicts a masklike face and is estimated to sell for $500,000 to $700,000; the other is "Study for Nude With Drapery," estimated to fetch $600,000 to $800,000.
Another large estate in the sale that night belonged to Benjamin and Minna Reeves. Mr. Reeves, an importer, manufacturer and distributor of expensive foods, and his wife collected works by Pissarro, Renoir, Sisley and Fantin-Latour. The star picture in the group is Pissarro's "Parc aux Charrettes, Pontoise," a city scene painted in 1878. It is estimated to bring $1 million to $1.5 million.
Many of these Impressionist works once strongly appealed to Japanese buyers. Now that the Japanese have, for the most part, stopped buying, auction-house experts and gallery owners are hoping to lure collectors from Europe and America by putting low estimates on these works.
"There's a pent-up demand to buy across the board," maintained David Nash, who heads the Impressionist and modern departments at Sotheby's. "But the interest in 20th-century art is greater than in Impressionist right now."
Drawings by big name artists are also attracting buyers. And on May 13 Sotheby's is selling many outstanding ones by Matisse, Vuillard, Cezanne and Degas that were recently owned by the Manhattan dealer William Acquavella.
In the contemporary field, German artists are expected to fare particularly well. "There's no question there are good buys around," said Lawrence Rubin, director of M. Knoedler & Company in Manhattan. "If the auctions do well it will be a big step in the right direction. But at this point we can only hope."

HEADLINE: As Museum and Mall, A Seaport Lives On

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
IN a city of marvels, the escalator ride in the Pier 17 Pavilion at the South Street Seaport occupies a special category. The ascent begins next to a display of Nordic Track exercise equipment, and as the escalator rolls upward, a memorable scene unfolds before the dazzled spectator: a genuine middle-American mall, a spotless temple of T-shirt commerce, complete with functioning restrooms and telephones that work.
And food. Lots of food. For the full effect, one really has to leave the tasteful ground-floor restaurants behind and ascend to Level 3. There, in the infernal circle of fast food, the cholesterol transgressors circulate from Pizza on the Pier to Seaport Fries to Wok and Roll to Athenian Express and back to South Philly Steak and Fries, clutching oversize waxed cups stuffed with french fries, balancing pizza slices whose three-inch surface of goo is moving steadily toward the edges of the crust, already drooping under the weight. 
 For many, this is the South Street Seaport, an inviting stretch of shops and eating places with a breezy riverside promenade and a few ships for atmosphere. It is commercial, clean and safe.
Off to the side of the Seaport action, in a tiny workshop at Pier 15, Glenn Braun spends his days fashioning little ships and putting them in bottles. He also fields questions from curious visitors, 200 of them on a busy day. A lot of them ask, "Where's the museum?"
Good question. It's easy to forget, but the enormously popular "festival marketplace" created by the Rouse Company of Columbia, Md., is the outsize child of the South Street Seaport Museum, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this week with a retrospective exhibition titled "Of Sailing Ships and Sealing Wax: 25 Years of Collecting." The show, which opened on Tuesday, offers a selection from the museum's holdings, including maritime oil paintings, ship models, nautical fixtures and maps.
The exhibition could have been called "25 Years Up a Creek Without a Paddle." For a quarter of a century, the museum, founded on a wing and a prayer, has passed through one financial crisis after another, while experiencing more leadership turmoil than the Bounty. In 1985, it nearly voted itself out of existence. But it survives. Despite Government cutbacks and shrinking revenue sources for cultural institutions, it is showing surprising signs of vigor.
The museum and its excursion vessels have been averaging about half a million admissions in the last several years. A year and a half ago, the museum acquired, for $3.4 million, the large collection of maritime art and artifacts, 2,000 objects in all, that once belonged to the Seamen's Bank for Savings. And it has received grants totaling $750,000, the largest chunk of it from the state, to restore the Lettie G. Howard, the last Fredonia-type inshore fishing schooner, which will eventually set sail as an educational and sail-training vessel.
Of course, there is that nagging question. "The poor museum has been shunted off to the perimeter," says Peter Neill, who took over as its president in the summer of 1985. "It's a fact. My biggest problem is, physically, where's the museum?"
At the moment, it is many places. The museum includes administrative offices, a new visitors' center, exhibition galleries, a restored 19th-century stationer's shop, a library and a children's center.
At Bowne & Company, the stationers, visitors can operate a 19th-century hand press, order wedding invitations or talk over the fine points of the history and design of type with Julia Boltin, the shop's frighteningly well-informed printer. "Something Fishy," the exhibition at the children's center, tells youngsters ages 4 to 10 how fish get from the deep blue sea to their dinner plates.
Moored in the East River is a small fleet of historic vessels, dominated by the mammoth bark Peking. Like most of its fellows, the Peking serves as a floating museum, with photographs and text illustrating life on board the ship when it carried guano between South America and Europe. The Pioneer, a two-masted schooner, takes on passengers regularly and heads out for the open water of New York Harbor, racing past the Statue of Liberty and out as far as the Narrows.
"We now have a museum without walls," says Mr. Neill, interviewed in his office at 207 Front Street. "But the world needs to see a museum with walls. In typical Seaport fashion, we have worked backward, building what goes inside before we constructed the edifice."
 
Culture vs. Commerce
 The edifice arrives next. The museum is in the middle of an unannounced $20 million capital campaign, from which $8 million is to go toward turning the block of early 19th-century buildings on Schermerhorn Row, the architectural centerpiece of the Seaport, into a central exhibition space with two permanent displays. One will tell the story of New York as a port city; the other will present international maritime history as it bears on New York. As part of the project, to be completed in 1995, a historically accurate row house is to be built where the boat-building shop now stands, near the corner of Water Street and Burling Slip.
The Schermerhorn Row project is intended to create a physical focus for the museum and, Mr. Neill hopes, increase membership, which has held steady at about 7,000 for several years. Just as important, it will begin to restore the balance between commerce and culture, which, Mr. Neill admits, is badly out of whack.
Make no mistake: Mr. Neill has a high tolerance for commerce. A self-described "cultural entrepreneur," he sees it as part of the grand and glorious story of New York's waterfront. "They criticize the Seaport as real-estate speculation," he fumes. "Well, Schermerhorn Row began as a speculative real-estate deal. People talk about fast food. Well, look at old photographs of the area, and you'll see 'quick lunch' signs all over the place -- cheap food for the working man."
Passion and sophistry blend as Mr. Neill, a burly, bearded 50-year-old given to pounding the padded arm of his office chair with a fist, works up a righteous head of steam. In the bright, not too distant future, the milling throngs -- potential museumgoers, each and every one of them -- will enter Schermerhorn Row as consumers and emerge as savants, filled with a new understanding of the commerce that surrounds them. The buying and the selling will suddenly have a historical context. Past and present will seamlessly merge. Mr. Neill is firm on the notion that artifacts have to be used as metaphors to explain a way of life.
"A lot of museum people are snobs," he says, as though revealing a secret, "but we're populists because history is populist." A rogue thought intrudes: Would Melville have sprung for a jumbo cup of fries?
 
A Hard Bargain
 The South Street Seaport came into existence when a hardy band of preservationists decided that the decaying downtown waterfront district -- the original source of the city's wealth, the entry point for more immigrants than passed through Ellis Island -- had to be saved. From headquarters in a small storefront, the museum began acquiring historic properties and piers before they could be demolished. City landmark designation followed, and by agreement with the city, the museum became a kind of caretaker for the district.
The idea was to restore the neighborhood and create the museum along the way. Reality intervened. In the mid-1970's, the museum, financially prostrate, turned to the Rouse Company and begged it to work the magic that had made Faneuil Hall Marketplace in Boston and Harborplace in Baltimore artistic and commercial successes.
Seaport Marketplace, a Rouse subsidiary, would pay rent for its two retail coliseums, Fulton Market and Pier 17 Pavilion, to the museum, which, acting as agent for the city, would serve as landlord for the waterfront district, which includes the Fulton Fish Market and the commercial tenants.
The base rent from Rouse would insure a stable financial base for the museum. And if Rouse achieved excess profits, determined by a complicated formula, the extra money would be funneled directly into the museum. The Rouse deal has turned out to be a Faustian bargain. The city stepped in and rewrote the lease so that it would take 60 percent rather than 20 percent of total rents. And the extra profits never materialized.
 
Taking Back Control
 But the mall culture did. Chic boutiques appeared, like Ann Taylor and J. Crew. The Pier 17 Pavilion sprouted shops with funny names, like Hats in the Belfry. It got Foot Locker and Lady Foot Locker, and pushcarts selling everything from jewelry to computer-printed genealogical scrolls. Mass quantities of beer were consumed as thousands of Wall Streeters swept over the Seaport after work like a human tide. With an estimated 13 million to 15 million million visitors last year, the Seaport is now one of New York's leading tourist attractions.
In the late 1970's, John B. Hightower, the museum's president, defended the agreement with Rouse, saying, "The fact is that shopping is now the chief cultural activity in the United States." And how.
As Fulton Street and Pier 17 drew millions, the museum languished, offering few exhibitions and doing almost no restoration work on its ships. As it concentrated on its real-estate interests, membership and donations plummeted. A third of the staff was laid off.
Then came what Mr. Neill calls "the last great catharsis," a series of confrontations in early 1985 "when the museum people took back leadership from the real-estate people." The galvanizing moment came when John Ricker Jr., then the chairman, moved that the museum be dissolved. "The board said, 'Wait a minute, that's not the idea here,' " Mr. Neill says.
When the dust settled, both the chairman and the president of the museum resigned.
 
'A Fool or a Hero'
 Enter Mr. Neill. A St. Louis native, he had started out as a teacher and novelist, then drifted into maritime history and preservation while teaching writing and literature as an adjunct professsor at Yale University in the late 1970's. Already active in land-conservation groups, he became director of Schooner Inc. in New Haven, a nonprofit environmental group that offered educational programs aboard a working ship. In 1984, he was named director of the Office of Maritime Preservation of the National Trust for Historic Preservation in Washington, where he toiled happily until he was approached by the Seaport museum in 1985 about becoming its president.
The Seaport's offer was less than seductive. "The museum was intellectually and financially bankrupt," Mr. Neill recalls. "Every philanthropic relationship had been tainted. The job was considered by everyone to be a disastrous career move."
As Mr. Neill tells it, one look at the masts of the Peking against the towers of lower Manhattan sold him on the idea. "I decided I'd either be a fool or a hero to take the job," he says. Settling back into his chair with a broad smile, he adds, "I'm a hero." Mr. Neil recruited a solid board, as he puts it, "from the abyss." He beefed up the museum's education department, now the museum's largest. And he went to work on the financial problems, insisting that the museum rely more on philanthropy and earned income, less on Government aid. Since talking the helm, Mr. Neill has retired $1.5 million in debt and produced a surplus in the operating fund each year.
On this front, he has been relentless. Visitors to the museum gallery are pointedly encouraged by the guard to leave an extra dollar on the way out if they like the exhibition. Volunteers are eagerly recruited. (The museum has 400 of them.) "Are you a member?" Mr. Neill asks a reporter. Genuine alarm registers on his face when the answer is no. He jumps up and snatches a membership form from his desk.
"The arts have to compete for hearts and minds," he says. In a singsong voice, he ridicules "this idea of 'We need to be kept because we're this precious thing.' "
On the other hand, Mr. Neill makes it clear that he would like to see a little giveback from the city, which gives the museum no direct grants. "Do I want a city subsidy and do I think we deserve it?" he says. "Yes." The fist is pounding again. "We are one of the most imaginative purveyors of education to the city that there are. We served 40,000 students last year. That merits a public subsidy. Not charity, but a return for services rendered." Between fall and spring, the Pioneer roams the East Coast, offering educational programs to other cities.
 
A Touch of Rebellion
 If Mr. Neill is miffed at the city, that goes double forthe Rouse Company, the mere mention of which causes him to roll his eyes and sigh profoundly. The Pier 17 Pavilion he regards as a carbuncle on the face of his beloved. He will not pose for pictures with it in the background.
"There's real hostility there because, as you may have noticed, I don't shut up," he says, characterizing the relationship with Rouse. Mr. Neill has tried to explain to the company that a strong museum drawing more visitors will contribute to the Rouse bottom line. The company has thus far limited its enthusiasm to a single monetary pledge of $150,000, of which it has paid half.
Joseph E. Ochs, vice president and general manager of the Seaport Marketplace, says that the pledge, to help restore the Lettie G. Howard, was based on a more ambitious version of the project, and that as things now stand "$75,000 is more than fair." He also said the company has lent money to the museum from time to time, and takes a benefactor's table, at a cost of $50,000, at the museum's annual fund-raising dinner.
Rouse has resisted one of Mr. Neill's more daring proposals. In his quest for a permanent exhibition space, he suggested that Rouse sell the top two floors of the mammoth Fulton Market Building to the museum. The price? One dollar. The reasoning? "Up to now, that's been dead space for retailers," says Mr. Neill, who theorized that having fewer commercial tenants in Fulton Market will raise the profits in Pier 17. The museum once needed Rouse. Now, as Mr. Neill sees it, Rouse needs the museum.
Mr. Ochs says: "The marriage of the museum and the marketplace is what makes the seaport work. We salute the museum, but our whole basis is to lease space so we have the dollars to pay rent."
Mr. Neill says: "Rouse does what it does very well, but it's been done in many other places. What's different about this place is the architecture, the ships and the history, and the only way that can be articulated is through the museum."
Even with the expansion, it will remain a small museum in a city of powerhouse institutions. And Mr. Neill says he nourishes only modest territorial ambitions for it. The Schermerhorn Row complex and the piers seem about right to him.
"But on the program side, the sky's the limit," he says. "There's a population here that's the biggest intellectual sponge going, and I'll take the program anywhere, whether it's up to Harlem or floating off Sandy Hook."

HEADLINE: Selling in Japan, With Japan's Help

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla.

 BODY:
Takashi Tanji knows a thing or two about exports. As a child in Japan during the 1950's, he recalled, the essence of elementary-school economics was that Japan must export to survive. After graduating from college, he joined the Kanematsu Corporation, a big trading house, where he spent most of the next 25 years selling Japanese steel abroad.
For the foot soldiers in Japan's export-led economic miracle, like Mr. Tanji, the work was often hard and humbling. He remembers trying to sell steel pipe to oil-patch suppliers in Texas and Louisiana in the 1970's, staying in cheap hotels, scouring the Yellow Pages for prospective customers, and making cold calls with decidedly mixed results. 
 Today, the 49-year-old Mr. Tanji is back in America, working the other side of the trade ledger, as part of an unusual Japanese Government program to help smaller American companies sell to Japan. The program itself is a sign of the economic times: it is run by the Japan External Trade Organization, or Jetro, an arm of the powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry established in 1958 to aid Japan's postwar export drive.
Yet given Japan's huge trade surpluses and trade conflicts with other nations, Tokyo no longer needs an export-promotion agency. So Jetro has reversed course, becoming an agency that helps Western companies sell in Japan. To the extent that it is successful, of course, Japanese exports are less likely to run into protectionist problems in the United States.
Mr. Tanji is one of 18 senior trade advisers stationed by Jetro across the United States, whose task is to find American companies -- typically with 300 or fewer employees -- with products that can be sold in Japan and help them do it. Most of the advisers, like Mr. Tanji, who arrived in Tampa in the fall of 1990, have been lent from trading companies and are veterans of Japan's export drive, not the country's recently acquired enthusiasm for imported goods.
"When I was assigned this job, I thought it would be difficult," Mr. Tanji said. "And it is difficult. To sell in Japan is not easy."
But the so-called Jetro experts program, begun less than two years ago, can now point to 35 companies it has helped makes sales in Japan. To be sure, many of these success stories fit into the tradition of Western niche-and-novelty suppliers that do well in Japan, so long as they operate on the periphery of Japan's industrial economy. Indeed, the products Jetro has ushered into the Japanese market include catfish, log cabins, fishing tackle, T-shirts, trendy hats and refurbished 50's-vintage American cars.
And the Jetro program will do little to narrow America's big trade deficit with Japan, $43 billion last year. But Japanese officials and American trade experts say its impact goes well beyond the handful of companies in the program so far. Advisers like Mr. Tanji have met with hundreds of American companies and thousands of individuals, getting out the word that Japan is a big market that can be cracked.
 
Developing Export Culture
 The Jetro program, American trade officials say, is a useful step in helping smaller American companies develop an export culture. And a more outward-looking mentality is already in evidence as technological and economic forces that began in the 1980's -- lower costs for international travel and phone calls, the worldwide proliferation of fax machines, a weaker dollar that makes American exports more competitive and soft markets at home -- made going abroad easier and necessary, according to David Birch, a Cambridge, Mass., consultant. In fact, 87 of 51,000 exporters surveyed by his firm, Cognetics Inc., had fewer than 500 employees.
Yet there is still plenty of room for growth. At present, just 15 percent of United States manufacturers account for 85 percent of American manufactured exports. "Smaller U.S. companies aren't beginning to meet their potential as exporters," said Susan Schwab, director general of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service, an export promotion arm of the Commerce Department. "And the real significance of the Jetro program is the spillover effect as other companies see some of their local peers exporting to Japan."
Across the country, there is now a solid core of companies that Jetro has helped sell in Japan. In many ways, the agency's representatives have played the time-honored role in Japan of the go-between, making introductions, trading on longstanding relationships and interpreting the local business culture for the Americans.
For example, Crane National Vendors of Bridgeton, Mo., which sold $4 million of its computerized vending machines in Japan last year, was coached in how to get the many health and product-standard approvals from government agencies required to sell its machines in Japan. Merlink Inc. of Rocky Mount, N.C., was introduced to a Japanese company that has begun to market its log-cabin homes aggressively , with estimated sales in Japan of $1.3 million this year. And Andermac Inc. of Yuba City, Calif., was scouted by Jetro representatives and, after its specialized hospital beds were tailored for the Japanese market, the company's sales in Japan reached $500,000 last year.
 
One Company's Story
 One of the intriguing small-company cases is here in Clearwater, Fla., CLI Systems Inc., across the causeway from Tampa. Founded by Donald Lewis and two partners, the company began five years ago with a stake of $500,000 and a catchy invention, a device for preventing rust by directing a low-voltage flow of electricity on the metal being protected. Cars and construction machinery were seen as the main markets.
The three local businessmen also started with an unusual marketing strategy. They decided to try to sell their product first in Japan, the Everest of export markets, a big and formidable challenge. They had read research reports saying Japanese companies were particularly receptive to new technology, and they figured that selling to Japanese industrial customers would give the company credibility worldwide.
After a couple of trips to Japan, CLI Systems had a few encouraging orders. But in early 1990, the company nearly went under when follow-up orders were slow in coming. Then, soon after an American trade official in Japan told Mr. Lewis of the new Jetro program, he got in touch with the Japanese agency, and in the fall of 1990 the company was listed in a Jetro journal as one of several imports that might be of interest to Japanese industrial buyers.
In the next two weeks, the little Florida company received 47 inquiries from Japanese trading companies and industrial companies. "The fax machine here was just humming," recalled Mr. Lewis, the company's president.
About the same time, Mr. Tanji arrived in Tampa. One of his first moves was to visit CLI Systems. He examined its rust arrestors, and immediately took samples to New York, where officials from the Tokyo Electric Power Company, a big utility, were on a buying trip. Soon afterward, Mr. Lewis was introduced to the right people at the Nissan Motor Company.
 
Opening Doors
 "The notion of my getting in to see the decision maker at Tokyo Electric and Nissan without the help of Jetro is pretty remote," Mr. Lewis said.
Getting in the door was one thing, but the company quickly learned that making goods to discriminating Japanese standards was quite another. The rust-proofing device that CLI Systems sells today looks entirely different from the one it offered a few years ago. The black plastic device is smaller and more stylish than the original design. Before, it was presented to customers plopped in a clear plastic case.
Now, it rests mounted in a cardboard box, set off by red velour paper. Metal anodes that attach to the metal surfaces being protected are similarly mounted, jewel-box style, in the presentation box, the wires neatly coiled. The packaging has pictures of planets, an atom icon and, in high-techese, declares its contents to be a "Solid State Electronic Rust Proofing System."
In Japan, the looks of an industrial product can mean as much as its utility. Mr. Lewis vividly recalls being told over drinks one evening with a Japanese trading company official that if a product was going to cost $400 to $1,500 apiece, as did the company's rust proofers, it should look like it's worth it.
A bit to his surprise, the Japanese wanted an American flag insignia and "Made in U.S.A." prominently displayed on the package. "Americans are perceived as innovators by the Japanese," Mr. Lewis explained. "But we're not seen as good manufacturers."
CLI Systems lived up to that national stereotype of sloppy manufacturing a few years ago, but by rigorous testing at each stage of production, it now says its systems are virtually free of defects.
The product modifications and hard work seem to have paid off. Its current customers include Nissan, Honda, Tokyo Electric, Japan Airlines, Sony and the Japan Highway Corporation, while several other major corporations are testing its devices. Its sales have jumped to the rate of a few million dollars a year. But Mr. Lewis conceded that because growth has accelerated so quickly recently "I'm really flying blind on volume, and if any of these big guys kick in, it could be astronomical."
CLI Systems currently employs 17 people and is hiring more, while some of the work is farmed out to three subcontractors. The Japan Import-Export Bank has just lent the company $250,000 to expand its production for the Japanese market, the first such loan to an American company to export to Japan. Mr. Lewis has shipped some of his rust proofers to other markets, including Australia, Malaysia, South Korea and Britain. The company is also looking to raise additional capital to begin selling in the United States.
For his part, Mr. Tanji runs through the litany of the Florida company's virtues -- patience, hard work, catering to customer demands and a willingness to spend money and time to develop a distinctive technology. "If other companies do the same, they will succeed in Japan," he said. "There's no mystery to it."

HEADLINE: RIOTS IN LOS ANGELES: The Overview;
TOLL IS 38 IN LOS ANGELES RIOTS BUT VIOLENCE SEEMS TO ABATE; BUSH DISPATCHES FORCE OF 5,000

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 1

 BODY:
After witnessing two days of nearly unchecked rioting across vast swaths of the city, residents today began the excruciating process of getting on with life in ravaged neighborhoods, and the White House sent 5,000 Federal troops to help insure a growing but tenuous calm.
National Guard troops were sent to shopping centers that the police had cleared of looters. Children, their schools closed for the second day in a row, could be seen playing unsupervised. Families strolled along fire-scarred streets and gawked at the troops. 
 And Rodney G. King, in his first public appearance since just after police officers beat him 14 months ago, asked for the violence and lawlessness to end.
 
Cleanup Efforts Begin
 But as an uneasy peace took hold, sporadic violence flared in several other cities around the country, among them Atlanta, Seattle, Miami and San Francisco.
In South-Central Los Angeles there were scattered shootings and stabbings, but the widespread looting of Wednesday night and Thursday gave way to spontaneous cleanup efforts by residents of some of the areas worst hit by the rioting. The Los Angeles Fire Department said that by early evening all but one or two of the 3,767 building fires that had raged throughout the city since Wednesday were doused and that few new fires were breaking out.
Officials said the dusk-to-dawn curfew imposed on Thursday had generally succeeded in keeping people off the streets and would remain in effect for at least another day.
 
1,419 Injured
 By late afternoon the death toll from the violence stood at 38, surpassing the total of 34 who died during the seven days of the Watts riots here in August 1965. In addition, 1,419 people, along with two police officers this morning, had been reported injured and more than 4,000 arrested.
Of the 38 people known to have died in the unrest, 15 are black, 11 Hispanic, 5 white and 2 are Asian. The races of 5 had not been determined, the Los Angeles County Coroner's office said. And like the victims of the violence, those looting the stores across the city were of every race.
The coroner said 28 of the dead had been killed by gunfire, with 6 of them having been killed in gunfights with the police.
Five people were killed on Wednesday and most of the others were killed on Thursday, the coroner's office said. The coroner could not provide a figure for the number of people killed today.
Damage has been estimated at more than $500 million by the Mayor's office, although no one had begun a complete accounting of the losses.
After a request from Mayor Tom Bradley and Gov. Pete Wilson, President Bush dispatched almost 4,000 troops from the Army and the Marines to the area, as well as 1,000 Federal law-enforcement officers. The troops, 1,300 marines and more than 2,500 soldiers, began arriving in the Los Angeles area late today from bases around California.
Anton Calleia, Mayor Bradley's special assistant for emergency operations, said the Federal troops would take up positions on the streets this evening. The decision came as President Bush put control of the National Guard under the Federal military commanders on the scene.
Federal military commanders and local officials now have at their disposal close to 30,000 uniformed personnel in the Los Angeles area. That figure includes more than 8,000 members of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, almost 8,000 members of the Los Angeles Police Department, 6,000 members of the National Guard, almost 4,000 marines and Army infantry troops, 1,000 Federal law-enforcement officers and several thousand police officers from Long Beach and other municipalities in the region.
Mr. Calleia said policing decisions would be made by local officials and that local officials and the Federal military commanders would work together on how to deploy the troops. But he said that the ultimate power over how to use all the uniformed personnel would rest with the military commanders.
 
Tallying the Destruction
 Throughout Los Angeles, already battered by recession, residents began taking stock of the enormous economic toll to the city's poorest neighborhoods. Scores of small businesses were burned to the ground. Almost no grocery stores in the South-Central area were open, and many of those that were conducted business through locked gates.
With the violence apparently ebbing, the attention of city, state and Federal officials began shifting toward the underlying racial tensions that exploded on Wednesday after the acquittals of four white police officers in the videotaped beating of Mr. King.
Mr. King himself asked for the violence and lawlessness to end.
"People, I just want to say, you know, can we all get along?" Mr. King said today in a quavering voice as he faced scores of reporters and cameras outside his lawyer's office in Beverly Hills. "I mean, we're all stuck here for a while. Let's try to work it out."
Earlier in the day, Governor Wilson said at a news conference that the major goal once the rioting is quelled should be to provide more economic opportunity to the city's minorities and to give young people more reason to feel they have a stake in the community. But he offered no specific programs, and it was unclear what steps Federal, state and local officials would take to address the widespread feelings that the criminal justice system and the economy in Los Angeles remain segregated and inequitable.
Willie L. Williams, the Philadelphia Police Commissioner who has been chosen to replace Daryl F. Gates as the chief of police, said today that despite their acquittal on criminal charges, the four policemen who were videotaped beating Mr. King will still have to answer to him when he takes the helm.
"I cannot tell you if I'm going to fire anybody because that administrative process will most likely have just begun or not even have been completed prior to my arrival in Los Angeles," he said. "But clearly, the burden of proof and the burden of evidence in an administrative trial is far less in terms of a violation of departmental policy than it is in a criminal court, so the decisions that will and can be made are significantly different."
Today, the city slowed to a near halt. Because the looting and arson had spread on Wednesday across a wide area of the city, including more affluent neighborhoods, many residents stayed home.
Many businesses remained closed, as did most schools and universities throughout the city. Concerts, sporting events and other activities were canceled. Some flights in and out of Los Angeles International Airport were delayed or canceled because of the lingering concern about smoke billowing from the burning buildings.
Unlike Wednesday night and early Thursday -- when the rioters roamed the streets at will -- the police were out in force throughout much of South-Central Los Angeles. Chief Gates has been widely criticized for not responding more aggressively to quell the unrest.
And as of mid-afternoon, 4,393 people had been arrested in connection with the disturbances throughout Los Angeles County since Wednesday afternoon, said Deputy Hal Grant, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The arrests were made by the Los Angeles Police Department, the Sheriff's Department and law-enforcement agencies in nearby cities, including Long Beach, where more than 500 arrests were made Thursday night and this morning.
About 1,300 of the arrests were made by the Los Angeles Police Department. Officer Anita McKeon of the department's Emergency Operations Center said the pace of arrests in the city today had declined as the looting had subsided.
Deputy Grant said jails in the area were in danger of becoming overcrowded if arrests continued in large numbers. He said officials were developing plans for dealing with the problem, but said he did not have details.
 
Flash Points Cool
 Some of the flash points cooled as police officers, the California Highway Patrol and the National Guard took up visible positions. In Koreatown, where Korean-American merchants had banded together on Thursday into armed vigilante groups that occasionally fired on what they considered menacing youths, there were no reports of further incidents.
National Guard troops were sent to several shopping centers that had been cleared of looters by the police.
Several hundred Korean-Americans gathered along Wilshire Boulevard in mid-afternoon in an apparently spontaneous demonstration calling for interracial unity and an end to the violence.
Two hours of criss-crossing South- Central Los Angeles and adjacent neighborhoods today found scenes of war-like destruction interspersed with scenes of near-normalcy.
Entire blocks of businesses were totally destroyed by fire. At some stores, looters were still carrying out merchandise. At Martin Luther King Boulevard and Normandie Avenue, a Mobil gasoline station on one corner had been burned down. A Shell station across the street, the words "black owned" scrawled across its windows, remained intact.
 
Thousands Go for Mail
 With mail deliveries canceled, thousands of people lined up at post offices, many of them to pick up county welfare and Social Security checks, even as it dawned on them that they might be unable to cash the checks because most banks and check-cashing services were closed.
In some of the worst-hit areas, residents and other people from around the region appeared this morning with brooms and shovels to begin a cleanup effort and, they said, send a signal that they are determined to recapture control of the streets from looters and arsonists.
"We can't say we're going to control the violence," said Juan Guinto, a 22-year-old Angeleno as he shoveled debris from a looted and burned building. "But if our leaders, Jesse Jackson and our councilmen, can help by getting us to work together, then this community can rise again."
Officials here said they had requested that Federal troops be sent here in case looting and arson erupted again tonight.
The 1,300 marines, almost all of them veterans of the war in the Persian Gulf, were from Camp Pendleton, north of San Diego. They were dispatched to the Los Alamitos Naval Air Station, where they were to wait for further orders.
The Army troops sent to Los Angeles are based at Fort Ord, on the central California coast near Monterey. They are units of the 7th Infantry Light, which was sent to Panama City during the invasion of Panama in 1989, and include military police and some units with training in urban warfare.
The 1,000 Federal law-enforcement officers sent here by President Bush include units from the United States Marshal Service, the Border Patrol and the Bureau of Prisons.

HEADLINE: RIOTS IN LOS ANGELES: The President;
Bush Says Verdict 'Stunned' Him; He Vows to Put an End to Rioting

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
President Bush said tonight that he had been "stunned" by the verdict in the Los Angeles police beating case, promised that the state court trial that touched off rioting and looting "was not the end of the process" and sent Federal troops into the ravaged city to restore order.
Seeking to diminish tensions and demonstrate that Mr. Bush is taking action, the Justice Department disclosed that a grand jury in Los Angeles has been reviewing evidence and issuing subpoenas to determine whether the four police officers acquitted of beating a black motorist should now be charged under Federal civil rights laws. 
 Mr. Bush, while expressing sympathy for the outrage of civil rights leaders over the acquittal, said he would use "whatever force is necessary" to stop the violence in Los Angeles. The President sent 1,000 marines and between 2,500 and 3,000 soldiers into the streets. They werearmed with light weapons and ordered to return fire if fired upon. Mr. Bush also put the California National Guard under Pentagon command and dispatched 1,000 riot-trained Federal law officers to reinforce the local police.
 
Troops on City Streets
 His orders, issued at 9:20 P.M., put a total of between 6,500 and 7,000 soldiers, marines and National Guard troops into the streets of Los Angeles during the night.
Mr. Bush addressed an anguished nation from the Oval Office, surrounded by the symbols of the Presidential power that he has brought to bear in war and diplomacy and is now being forced to turn to in the biggest domestic crisis of his political career. [Excerpts, page 8.]
By mixing forceful calls for order with expressions of sympathy, he seemed to be moving to stabilize the situation before the violence that has touched Los Angeles and a number of other cities developed into a national pattern of civil unrest.
He condemned the riot in Los Angeles as producing television pictures that were "horrifying almost beyond belief."
"What we saw last night and the night before in Los Angeles is not about civil rights," Mr. Bush said, his expression grim and determined. "It's not about the great cause of equality that all Americans must uphold. It's not a message of protest. It's been the brutality of the mob, pure and simple. And let me assure you I will use whatever force is ncessary to restore order."
Under pressure from civil rights leaders who met with Mr. Bush today in the White House and from some of his own advisers, the President broke with his refusal to comment on the verdict in the police officers' trial.
 
'Hard to Understand'
 "Viewed from outside the trial," the President said, "it was hard to understand how the verdict could possibly square with the video" of the beating of Rodney G. King. "Those civil rights leaders with whom I met were stunned, and so was I, and so was Barbara and so were my kids," he said. "But the verdict Wednesday was not the end of the process."
Mr. Bush said he had immediately ordered Federal authorities to pursue the possibility of filing criminal charges against the four acquitted men and other police officers under Federal civil rights laws, an investigation being conducted in a political climate that seems to demand an indictment. Today's announcement that a grand jury is reviewing the case seemed likely to increase the pressure to bring charges against the officers.
During a day of urgent meetings and rapid decisions that threw the White House into a state of emergency of a kind not seen since the war in the Persian Gulf, Mr. Bush sent 1,500 marines from the First Marine Expeditonary Force and 3,000 members of the Army's Seventh Infantry to Los Angeles to help keep order.
Mr. Bush signed the deployment order after speaking to Gov. Pete Wilson of California and Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles. Though they told him that the situation was improving, Mr. Bush wanted a strong show of force on the streets through the night, a senior Administration official said.
Mr. Bush's orders were to equip the troops with loaded handguns and M-16 rifles and to have them shoot back if fired upon, the official said.
 
New Test for Bush
 Although Federal troops were used to prevent rioting in the Virgin Islands after Hurricane Hugo in 1989, today's action was more in keeping with the deployment of soldiers in the 1960's and 1970's to control race riots and disturbances during the Vietnam War. The decision, reached early at the White House meeting by Mr. Bush and his top military and legal advisers, was a major escalation in Mr. Bush's response to the rioting.
The violence thrust a dizzying new test on Mr. Bush in already stormy political days, and the President sought to reassure outraged minorities by meeting with civil rights leaders in the White House. The guest list was drawn from the old guard of the 1960's with whom he is more comfortable rather than from prominent young politicians, intellectuals or artists.
The session forced him to confront questions about what had become of the more tolerant America he promised at his inauguration more than three years ago, just as his public stance immediately after the verdicts aroused criticism that he is not sensitive to racial issues.
Before tonight's televised address, Mr. Bush had been walking a fine political line: While he focused on issues of law and order in public, his aides behind the scenes sought to convey the impression that he was as upset and confused as anyone else.
Administration officials said Mr. Bush had felt constrained in his public statements out of concern that he not prejudge any new Federal proceeding or appear to undercut his own arguments in favor of law and order by denouncing the original jury verdict.
There is precedent on both sides of the question. Lyndon B. Johnson used the arrest of four Ku Klux Klansmen on charges of murdering a civil rights worker in March 1965 to declare war on the racist organization, which he said was responsible for the slaying. But Richard M. Nixon was embarrassed into making a public retraction of his pronouncement that Charles Manson was "guilty, directly or indirectly, of eight murders" before the Sharon Tate murder case went to trial in 1970.
After the White House meeting, the civil rights leaders continued to assail the President's policies and demanded that he exert "moral leadership." In doing so, they openly confronted Mr. Bush with an accusation that had simmered unspoken since Wednesday's acquittal of the four police officers: that 12 years of Republican leadership had created a climate of economic inequity and racial injustice.
"He's been very vociferous about violence in the streets, but very silent about violence in the economic and in the criminal justice suites, which are the breeding grounds for violence in the streets," said the Rev. Joseph E. Lowery, head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
Mr. Lowery and the others applauded Mr. Bush's decision to send Federal reinforcements to Los Angeles and his announcement that the Justice Department had revived its inquiry into whether the police officers should be charged under Federal civil rights statutes.
But they demanded that Mr. Bush address the broad range of economic, social and racial issues that they said were behind the violence in Los Angeles and have gone unattended during the Bush Administration.
 
System 'Failed Us'
 "We reminded the President that for 14 months the black community has been very patient, waiting on the American justice system to act, and it failed us miserably," said Benjamin L. Hooks Jr., executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
Mr. Bush echoed those words tonight in his speech and said, "We owe it to all Americans who put their faith in the law to see that justice is served."

The Administration has quietly tested Congressional reaction on a possible free-trade agreement with Chile, but is deeply divided over whether to proceed with negotiations.

HEADLINE: Chile Test On Broader Free Trade

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
The Bush Administration quietly tested Congressional reaction this week to a possible free-trade agreement with Chile, but is deeply divided over whether to proceed with negotiations, Administration and Congressional officials said today.
The pact would be the next step in President Bush's vision of a free-trade zone spanning the Western Hemisphere. Negotiations are now taking place to broaden an existing free-trade agreement with Canada to include Mexico. 
 But Congressional reaction has been mixed, with some members concerned that American companies and workers already face the prospect of more acute competition with Mexico and should not be rushed into facing South American competition as well.
 
Pollution and Other Concerns
 The Administration is also struggling with concerns that more trade and industry in Mexico would worsen pollution there and in border states, and some members of Congress want those issues resolved before new talks begin.
Senator Max S. Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Finance Committee's Subcommittee on International Trade, said, "I would be far more comfortable if we worked out the details" of a free-trade agreement with Mexico, "including the environmental and worker-adjustment components, before beginning formal negotiations with Chile."
President Patricio Aylwin of Chile is scheduled to meet President Bush here on May 13 and will seek the opening of negotiations then, Chilean and American officials said. The Treasury and State Departments are enthusiastic about the idea as a way to reward Chile for opening its economy, making regular payments on its foreign debt and moving to democracy after more than a decade of military rule.
 
 
Already Cut Tariffs
 Chile has been singled out because it has already reduced tariffs and adopted laws protecting foreign investments, so that a free-trade agreement would be easier to negotiate with it than with virtually any other Latin American nation right now.
But Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, has been reluctant to open talks now for several reasons, Administration officials said. She worries that Congress might vent its frustration over the negotiations with Mexico by blocking the Chilean talks. And she has been concerned about how her 162-employee agency could handle another significant project when it is already swamped with not only the Mexico negotiations but also the deadlocked global trade talks in Geneva.
Kathleen A. Lydon, a spokeswoman for the trade office, said, however, that Mrs. Hills wanted to negotiate an agreement and only wanted to wait so as to allow time for consultations with Congress, businesses and unions. "We very much want to go forward quickly," she said. "The only question is when."
 
A Busy Office
 Mrs. Hills expressed reservations to colleagues last year about her agency's ability to start talks with Mexico if the negotiations in Geneva continued. But while a shortage of lawyers skilled in drafting trade agreements did delay a few meetings with Mexico late last fall, the extra burden has so far not had a significant effect on either set of talks, Mrs. Hills has said.
The United States has a widening trade surplus with Chile. Last year the United States sent Chile $1.84 billion worth of aircraft, computers, cars and other mostly manufactured goods, while importing from Chile only $1.3 billion worth of fruit, copper, fish and other raw materials.
Under the fast-track rules that now govern Congressional consideration of important trade agreements, the Administration must notify Congress before beginning negotiations. The talks cannot then begin until after at least 60 days have passed during which Congress has been in session, and once an agreement has been reached, Congress must vote on it without amendments.
Because of the political conventions this summer and various recesses, these 60 days would be spread over four or five months, so actual negotiations probably would not begin until December, after the American elections, said Andres Velasco, the international economics coordinator at Chile's Finance Ministry.
Alejandro Foxley, Chile's Finance Minister, met here on Wednesday with Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady to discuss the timing of free-trade talks, a Treasury official said. No decision was reached.
 
A Possible Snag
 Either the House Ways and Means Committee or the Senate Finance Committee could stop the opening of negotiations by passing a resolution of disapproval. Both committees have traditionally defended free trade in Congress.
Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat who is a strong free-trade proponent on the Ways and Means Committee, said such a resolution might pass. While few members have taken a position on the issue, lobbying by unions could sway a majority against talks, he said.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. does not oppose trade talks with Chile but would want them to address labor and environmental issues that the negotiations with Mexico have not resolved, said Candice M. Johnson, a spokeswoman.
Gary R. Edson, the general counsel at the White House trade office, and William E. Barreda, the Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary for trade and investment, held a closed-door meeting on Monday with Congressional aides to discuss a possible deal with Chile.
But even though the two men came together, along with more junior officials from the trade office and the State Department, Mr. Edson expressed noticeably less enthusiasm for immediate negotiations than did Mr. Barreda, said a Congressional aide who insisted on anonymity.
"There did not appear to be a unanimous Administration position," the aide said.
Mr. Edson and Mr. Barreda declined to comment.
David Mulford, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, has been Chile's strongest supporter. He said in a speech on April 24 that if negotiations were held, the Administration should start the process by early June so as to allow time to draw up an agreement before the Administration's fast-track negotiating authority comes up for renewal next spring.

HEADLINE: Dow Off 23.03 as Traders Leave Early

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stock prices closed lower yesterday as computerized sell programs kicked in gear and many Wall Street traders trekked home early, anxious about the possibility of street demonstrations.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 3,336.09, off 23.03 points for the day but up 11.63 for the week. 
 Declining issues outnumbered advances on the New York Stock Exchange by 922 to 794.
Prices were narrowly mixed in the morning session after traders took profits from the market's recent rise and responded to a report showing slow growth in manufacturing.
 
Computer-Driven Selling
 But computer-driven selling hit stocks shortly after noon. Dennis Jarrett, chief market analyst for Kidder, Peabody, said the selling started after rumors of rioting related to the Rodney King verdict circulated in Chicago and New York.
The rumors affected stock futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which brought down stock prices in New York, he said.
Trading dropped off in the afternoon session, as many investors and stock dealers went home early. Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 177.4 million shares, down from 223.2 million in the previous session.
Other indexes were also lower. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.42 points, to 412.53; the New York Stock Exchange index, 1.10 points, to 227.20; the Nasdaq composite, 0.54 point, to 578.14, and the Amex composite, 0.83 point, to 389.78.
 
Effect of Early Exit
 Merrill Lynch, Salomon, Chemical Banking, Chase Manhattan and First Boston were among the large brokerage houses that allowed employees to go home early.
"People are leaving early, so you don't have full participation in the securities market," said Steven Van Brunt, assistant vice president for equities trading at Nikko Securities International. The early exit of traders posed "a liquidity problem," he said, with a scarcity of buyers with cash to steady the market.
Hildegard Zagorski, vice president at Prudential Securities, said many large investors were selling as a precaution. "The market hates uncertainty," she added. "They don't know what's going to happen over a long, hot weekend."
 
UAL Off 1 5/8
 UAL fell 1 7/8, to 122 5/8, after it told securities analysts it expected a loss in the second quarter. Constar International was up 2 3/4, to 43 1/4, but the Tennessee-based plastics concern said it had no explanation for the sudden rise.
Oil-service companies did well in the session, as oil prices reached their highs for the year. Schlumberger was up 2 1/8, at 64 1/4; Kerr-McGee, 3/8, at 39 3/8, and Haliburton, 1 3/8, at 26 5/8.
One bit of economic data released in the session was the National Association of Purchasing Management's monthly index on manufacturing activity. The index was 51.3 percent in April, down from 54.1 percent in March, an indication of slow growth ahead for the nation's industries.

HEADLINE: Purchasers Say Pace of Gains Slid in April

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The growth of the nation's manufacturing economy slowed in April, as a result of more modest growth in production and new orders, according to a report released yesterday by the nation's purchasing managers. Economists said the figures demonstrated that the nation's emergence from recession would be gradual.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of economic activity fell in April to 51.3 percent from 54.1 percent in March. The March reading had been the highest since last summer. 
 The April numbers seem to indicate that the economy has lost some of the steam it developed in the previous few months. Since the beginning of the year, the index has climbed steadily. But the April reading represented the first monthly decline since December.
"The numbers indicate that the recovery is pretty spotty and there is not much confidence in a widespread economic advance," said Wayne C. Stevens, chief economist with Duff & Phelps Inc. in Chicago. "The economic recovery seems to be concentrated in certain regions and in certain industries. The recovery is fragile."
The monthly index, compiled from a survey of more than 300 purchasing managers representing a wide range of industries, is the first significant indicator of the previous month's activity. A reading below 50 indicates that the economy is contracting, while a reading above 50 shows expansion.
A more upbeat reading on the economy came yesterday from the Commerce Department, which reported that construction spending rose 1.6 percent in March, to its highest level in 15 months. [Page 36.]
"The growth rate of the economy slowed in April from the rapid pace of the previous two months," said Robert J. Bretz, director of corporate purchasing at Pitney Bowes Inc. and chairman of the association's survey committee. "Nevertheless, the growth in new orders continues at a relatively high rate and should sustain a healthy growth in production."
The purchasing managers' report came a day after the Government's index of leading indicators posted its third straight gain in March, rising a modest two-tenths of 1 percent. Also, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for April increased to 77.2 from 76 in March, according to people with access to the report.
The association's index of new orders for everything from hydraulic pumps and photographic film to polyester coatings and lumber fell to 56.7 percent in April from 62.4 percent in March. The association said that despite the decline, the rate of new orders was strong enough to fuel growth in production in coming months.
The rate of production was significantly weaker in April, the association said, stating that its production index fell to 56.6 percent, from 60.1 percent in March. But the association said strong new orders, coupled with a low level of inventories, would keep production growing. The association's index of inventories dropped to 42.4 percent in April from 43.8 percent in March.
New orders for exports took a slight drop, the association said, stating that its index of exports slid to 52.3 percent in April from 52.9 percent in March. That is a sharp drop from the February level of 55.9 percent. Meanwhile, the association's index of imports increased to 53 percent in April from 51 percent in March.
The association's employment index increased to 43.9 percent in April from 42.8 percent in March. The industries with the greatest growth in employment in April were in apparel, textiles and wood products. The association said an employment index under 48 percent was generally consistent with a decline in the Bureau of Labor Statistics' data on manufacturing employment.
The price index increased in April, to 49.6 percent, from 46.6 percent in March. That reading was the highest in a year. The association said that purchasers reported that they resisted sellers' attempts to raise prices for a number of basic products like steel, paper and plastic resins.

HEADLINE: Compromise Offered at U.N. on Greenhouse Gas Emissions

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 1

 BODY:
The chairman of a United Nations negotiating committee today offered a proposal that officials from several countries said could provide the basis for an agreement to curb emissions of atmospheric gases that scientists fear will cause global warming.
The proposal was offered by Jean Ripert of France, who heads a multi-national negotiating effort aimed at producing a global warming treaty, to be signed next month at the world environmental conference in Rio de Janeiro. However, its wording was seen by many delegates as unclear, and was interpreted in various ways. 
 A common interpretation among European and American officials was that it provided the elements of an agreement by which industrial nations would set a goal of reducing emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide and methane to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
Progress toward that goal would be periodically reviewed by the treaty signers, and they could strengthen its provisions if need be, according to this interpretation.
Scientists predict that if the greenhouse gases continue to be poured into the atmosphere at current rates, earth temperatures will warm 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the next century, with possibly catastrophic effects. These might include sea-level rise, increased droughts and storms, severe damage to natural ecosystems and damage to agriculture.
 
Environmentalists Unhappy
 A global warming treaty would be the centerpiece of the Rio conference, and failure to achieve it would be considered a big blow to the success of the conference, which is to be attended by many heads of state and government.
Some environmental advocates said the proposal was meaningless because it did not require advanced nations to abide by a firm target for reducing emissions.
"It's a text that commits no one to doing anything, ever," said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, a research and advocacy group.
Until now, European Community countries have insisted that a target be adopted, limiting greenhouse-gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. The United States has argued that actions it is already taking will bring it close to that goal by 2000, but that it cannot promise to meet it without harming its economy.
While it is "not obvious" what Mr. Ripert's proposal means, "our reaction is positive," said Robert A. Reinstein, the head of the American delegation. He said it would become evident in the next few days whether the proposal could be a "vehicle for bridging the gap" between the Americans and the Europeans in time to meet a deadline of next Friday.
This disagreement has been the chief obstacle to settling on a proposed treaty. Mr. Reinstein said he was "encouraged that the process was moving in the right direction."
James Cameron, who represents the Alliance of Small Island States, countries that could be inundated by rising seas if global warming becomes a reality, said that while the proposal displays some "bad drafting," the "grist for a settlement is there."
A somewhat similar view was expressed by Bert Metz, head of the Dutch delegation, who said that although the proposal was not acceptable as it stands, "it could be made acceptable." The Netherlands has been one of the strongest advocates of firm targets and timetables for reducing emissions.
Mr. Ripert said he formulated his proposal after consultating with a number of European governments and with the Bush Administration. "It is my perception," he said, "that the United States could live with it."

HEADLINE: U.S. to Resume Contacts With Peru's Leader

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
The first high-level talks between the Bush Administration and President Alberto K. Fujimori since the Peruvian leader suspended democratic institutions nearly a month ago will be held on Saturday in Lima, the State Department said today.
Bernard W. Aronson, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, left today for weekend meetings with President Fujimori and other Peruvian officials. A State Department official said today that Mr. Aronson's goal in the talks was to persuade Mr. Fujimori to cooperate with mediators from the Organization of American States in efforts to restore democracy promptly. 
 The Peruvian President, who dissolved the national legislature and dismissed much of the judiciary on April 5 in order to give himself and the army more power to deal with leftist guerrillas and narcotics producers and traffickers, has proposed a one-year plan to revive democratic institutions in phases. Bush Administration officials say that Washington would like to see the process speeded up.
Diplomats from the region say that there is apprehension that Mr. Fujimori's action, while popular with many Peruvians, set an unwelcome precedent for other Latin American nations, where recent moves toward democracy and free enterprise are also threatened by economic problems and social unrest, if not guerrilla war. Venezuela, a democracy of long standing, suppressed a military coup only with great difficulty earlier this year.
Mr. Aronson and a large interagency aid team were in Lima on April 5 when Mr. Fujimori dissolved the national legislature and suspended judges, saying that politicians were corrupt and the courts inefficient in meeting a national crisis. The Assistant Secretary canceled a meeting with the President and returned instead to Washington. The Bush Administration suspended most nonhumanitarian assistance.
Relations with Peru were further strained when on April 24, Peruvian fighter planes fired on an American C-130 transport aircraft 60 miles off the coast of Peru. The attack on the plane, which had just completed an anti-narcotics surveillance mission, killed one airman. Four other crew members were wounded.
Peruvian officials later described the attack as accidental and apologized.

HEADLINE: RIOTS IN LOS ANGELES: On the Streets;
Getting Back to Daily Life: Searching for a Place to Shop Amid Destruction

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 1

 BODY:
Having torn itself apart in an agony of looting and burning, South-Central Los Angeles was a place of anger, sadness and futility today.
Convoys of screeching fire trucks and police cars sped back and forth through the smoky streets as residents searched in vain for a loaf of bread or a tank of gas or a pack of cigarettes. 
 "When are we ever going to recover from all this?" asked Al Johnson, who left his house today for the first time in two days to search for food. "Not in my time. Not in your time."
The crumbling streets of Los Angeles's inner city were still dangerous today after two nights of anarchy and violence. From among its blackened and still smoking buildings, and its smashed storefronts with their twisted security bars, men were still firing occasional shots at each other and at the police.
 
'Only Going to Get Worse'
 From one block to the next, new fires continued to break out, pursued by clusters of three, four or five fire trucks, always escorted for protection by several police cars with shotguns poking from the windows.
And with the war brought home, National Guard troops with their helmets and flak jackets and their military transport vehicles from the Persian Gulf war stood guard against an unknown enemy.
"The sad thing," said William Hicks, a Superior Court bailiff who was walking the streets in search of food, "is that it's only going to get worse from here. There's going to be added frustration because of something that we caused ourselves."
Mr. Hicks was waiting in line outside Echo Video and Mini Market, which had been looted but not burned and was admitting just one or two customers at a time to prevent further looting.
"I've spent two days trying to find a place to shop," Mr. Hicks said. "Thank God this guy's still open. I'm all right for people being angry. I'm angry, too. But I don't believe we should do it this way. Twenty-seven years ago we burned the place down when we had the Watts riot and things have only gotten worse."
 
'Hard Times Ahead'
 James Hill, a drug counselor who was also waiting, said he saw "hard times ahead."
"What happens when the food runs out?" he said. "It's going to be soup lines. Look at all the people who have been put out of work. Look at the medical center down there that burned up. That's 15 or 20 people out of work."
Los Angeles is such a racially divided city that people like these do not even consider driving a few blocks north to the other side of the freeway for a tank of gas or a bag of groceries.
"There's no markets left around here," said Kiris Coburn, an usher at a sports arena. "We're going to have to drive 15 or 20 minutes to get food, and when we get there, they're going to look at us worried."
William Dorsey, a retired gardener, added: "You take every freeway in Los Angeles, it's a dividing line. That's the way they corral you, keep you 'where you belong.' "
South-Central Los Angeles is a largely black and Hispanic area, and most of the destruction over the last two days has been concentrated there. One of the most stunning developments has been the movement of some of the violence into other parts of the city.
But in an area still suffering from the destruction of the 1965 riots, with a minimal economic base and continuing gang and drug violence, recovery is likely to take many years longer here than elsewhere.
 
Protective Graffiti
 Amid the destruction in the already-crumbling neighborhoods, new graffiti have appeared on the sides of shops: "Black Owned." On some streets, the effects of this strategy can be striking, with individual black-owned storefronts standing undamaged amid the charred ruins of their neighbors.
Other, more ominous graffiti have appeared on a broad white wall on Slauson Avenue. They read, in large, neat letters: "Crips Bloods Mexicans together forever tonite 4/30/92."
Others on the same wall read, "Now what you going to do honkey," "L.A.P.D. killa" and "Black thang/ brown thang."
More plaintively, some shopfronts with living quarters above them, carry hand-lettered signs in their windows reading, "People live here."
 
Like a War Zone
 On the corner of Jefferson and Western, National Guard troops had set up a strong point at a burned and looted mall.
They stood with raised weapons before a panorama of the economic destruction the rioting has brought: Duds 'n' Suds Coin Wash, Midcity Discount Records, Ar-Ex Pharmacy, Wigs Shoes Century Fashion, Checks Cashed Money Orders, J J's Burgers, Chuck's Beauty Supply, Shelton's Barber Shop, Fashions for the Foxy Lady.
"Why did they wait three days to send the National Guard when everything is already torn up and burned?" said Renee Harrell, staring at the Guard members, who stared back at her.
"The white people knew what was going to happen," she said. "They wanted it to happen. Now they're here protecting things that are already burned up."
Ms. Harrell's companion, Sandra Smith, said, "This is a modern-day plantation and they are the supervisors."
 
Crowded Gun Shops
 Everyone in this city was talking about the trial and the riots, but a few wanted to register their feelings publicly. The letters column of The Los Angeles Times, always a vibrant sounding board, today published emotional, often eloquent words from 19 readers, nearly all of whom disagreed with the verdict.
"Myself and two of my friends could have taken King down and hogtied him in less than 60 seconds," wrote Dan Jensen of San Clemente. "If 24 trained police could not do it without a number of them first teeing off on King's head 30 or 40 times, it is because they were not properly trained."
Another writer, Marc Norman, said: "As a third-generation, Afro-American Angeleno, I can definitely say I don't want my family's fourth generation here."
In more affluent areas of the city and its suburbs, it was the violence, not the verdict, that was uppermost in the minds of many.
At the loading dock of National Gun Sales in Northridge, a San Fernando Valley suburb within the city limits, workers stacked cartons with 3,000 rounds of 9-millimeter ammunition and 1,000 rounds of 12-guage hollow-point rifle slugs.
Under the terms of the state of emergency and curfew imposed by Mayor Tom Bradley, ammunition and weapon sales have been suspended here, but a steady parade of customers trooped into the store today, buying accessories for guns normally kept at home but these days being carried. The ammunition being unloaded would be ready for another day, when the curfew was lifted.
Joe G., a maintenance man who lives in Saugus, 10 miles north of Simi Valley, came to buy a holster for his .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun. "When they're coming up to the car and pulling people out, you have to protect yourself," he said. "I got my gun with me right now and I'm going to keep it with me til things settle down."
Mr. G., who said he was afraid to have his full name published, said that the dimension of the uprising in Los Angeles exceeded his wildest imagination and was the work of opportunistic thugs who "have absolutely no feelings about Rodney King" and were "just out to get stuff for free," while "the police watched and didn't do anything."
"If there'd been a show of force from the start, this wouldn't have happened," he said.
Another customer at the gun store, Dave Burkman, a contractor from nearby San Fernando, had a theory about why the police responded so slowly, blaming Police Chief Darryl F. Gates. The outgoing police chief, defensive about the behavior of his officers in the King beating and reluctant to cede the reins of his department to Willie L. Williams, the Philadelphia Police Commissioner who will become the chief of police in Los Angeles, set out to send the city a message, Mr. Burkman said.
"He was teaching people a lesson," Mr. Burkman said. "If you don't want police intervention, here's what you get. And it was the ultimate goodbye: Here Willie, it's your town now. I wouldn't put it past Gates to do that in a heartbeat."

HEADLINE: RIOTS IN LOS ANGELES: The Campaign;
Riots and Ballots

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

 BODY:
In the 1960's, pictures of Southern police beating black demonstrators helped propel civil rights to the top of the national agenda. A few years later, pictures of black rioters burning American cities helped Republicans push "law and order" to the fore.
If history is any guide, television coverage of Rodney G. King's beating and the protests it inspired have introduced a powerful new force that could reshape an already unpredictable political year. 
 But the question is, in what way would it do so: by focusing public attention on issues that the Democrats consider central to their cause -- civil rights, homelessness, education and economic opportunity for the poor? Or by promoting the law-and-order politics that have long been a hot button for Republicans?
The impact of the verdict and riots on the fate of American politicians and political parties may not seem like a major consideration when weighed against the tragedies of death, arson and mayhem and the heightened awareness of how far from solution the nation's worst social problem remains. But race and crime have opened sores in American politics and changed its direction before, and there is little reason to doubt they will again this year.
 
Possible Advantage for Clinton
 Turmoil in California could change the terms of the Presidential debate to the advantage of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the likely Democratic nominee. As a Southerner who has emphasized racial unity since his campaign began, he might be seen as a healer.
But the lurid television images of looting and burning could provoke deep resentment among middle-class whites. Responding to such resentments helped send Richard M. Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush to the White House and helped relegate the needs of the inner cities to a secondary position in the politics of the last decade.
Taken as a whole, the riots also present a golden opportunity for Ross Perot, the potential third-party candidate. He might well argue that an entirely new approach is needed because the Democrats had their chances to solve the problems of race and poverty in the 1960's and failed, and the Republicans achieved no more in the last two decades.
"Most people considered the verdict unfair, and that seemed to shift the focus decisively towards injustice," said Prof. Larry M. Bartels of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University. "The rioting may have moved it back towards fear. The way national leaders frame the question now will prove significant."
 
Riots of 1960's
 The events of the last 72 hours have stirred memories of the 1960's, whose early years were marked by the civil rights movement and widespread sympathy for the aspirations of blacks in the white middle class. But the Great Society lost momentum, urban riots broke out in 1965, 1966, 1967 and 1968, and significant segments of the white middle class turned to the Republicans, with their emphasis on crime rather than aid programs.
A New York Times/CBS News poll last month showed that blacks and whites in equal numbers, about two-thirds of each group, rejected the notion that it is sometimes "better for the people to take the law into their own hands." The figures might be different today; in this era of instant communication, popular sympathies can swing from one side of an issue to the other in a matter of hours.
But a national poll taken for USA Today on Thursday, after the first night of rioting, showed that 86 percent of white people still considered the King verdict wrong, and 47 percent considered the rioting "wrong but understandable," as opposed to 51 percent who said they considered the disturbances "completely unjustified." That suggests considerable residual sympathy for the plight of urban blacks.
Although such polls often fail to grasp the subtleties of a situation, they can provide valuable first reactions. The survey had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
Former Representative William H. Gray 3d, now the head of the United Negro College Fund, said on Friday that black people "have not made a lot of progress in this country" in the last 25 years, citing infant mortality, unemployment and education statistics. With his usual flair for the dramatic, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said more young black men were in American prisons than in American colleges.
"The fire next time is going to engulf all of us," said Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, in what could well become his party's clarion call this fall.
Clearly, the Democrats would like to use the rage and despair in Los Angeles to buttress their case that by neglecting domestic problems, President Bush has worsened racial tensions. Mr. Clinton spoke on Thursday of "more than a decade of urban decay" caused by lower Federal spending in cities.
Critics also argue that through devices like the Willie Horton commercial in the 1988 campaign and the description of Democratic civil-rights proposals as "quota bills," Mr. Bush had deliberately tried to play on the fears of the white middle class, particularly rural voters in the South and members of ethnic groups in the Northern cities and suburbs. Those have been the most important swing voters in Presidential politics for 25 years.
 
A 'Racial Firecracker'
 Christopher Arterton, dean of the Graduate School of Political Management in Washington, said, "The Republicans have been playing with this racial firecracker for a long time, and it has gone off in their hands." The riots, he said, could give "a political punch and vigor to a whole constellation of urban issues that they have lacked for many years," but he warned of the kind of white backlash that President Nixon capitalized upon.
Although Mr. Nixon advocated welfare reform and sought to create more jobs in the ghetto by inducing businesses to invest money there, he put the greatest emphasis, at last in his public utterances, on "more police and better pay and training for law officers." Making the political point explicit, Mr. Nixon once said, "Far from being a Great Society, ours is becoming a lawless society."
Republican strategy this time, it appears, will have several dimensions. Mr. Bush has so far tried to balance veiled criticisms of the acquittal of the four policemen who attacked Mr. King with condemnation of the rioters.
But the emphasis has increasingly been on law and order, with the dispatch of Federal marshals and troops to Los Angeles; he spoke at first of his "frustration" at the verdict, but he did not explicitly criticize it. He has not pledged any new programs and has met only with traditional civil-rights leaders, not with outspoken black politicians of the new generation, like Representative Maxine Waters, whose district includes the main riot area.
Although his nomination is assured, the President, always fretful about his party's conservative wing, might be pushed to the right by Patrick J. Buchanan, who is still a primary candidate in North Carolina next Tuesday and California on June 2. In television interviews yesterday, Mr. Buchanan defended the King verdict and attacked the Administration's continuing consideration of a civil-rights prosecution of the four policemen.
Mr. Clinton's mild criticisms brought instant dismissal from Marlin Fitzwater, Mr. Bush's spokesman, who called him "Slippery Bill" and accused him of politicizing the issue. That suggests that the White House thinks it can counter Democratic criticism not only on substantive grounds but also by exploiting the vulnerability of Mr. Clinton as the message-bearer.
Peter Hart, a leading Democratic poll-taker, sees the California turmoil as a plus for the Democrats, on balance, because it feeds into a pervasive public sense that fundamental issues in American society are not being successfully addressed.
"Jobs, education, now the criminal justice system -- people are looking for an alternative because they have the feeling the country is on the wrong track," he said. "That's never good news for an incumbent President. If it lasts, it has to help Bill Clinton, maybe Ross Perot even more."
Looking back three decades, Kevin Phillips, who predicted Republican dominance of the Presidency when others thought the party would never win again, also saw the dramatic events on the West Coast as an opportunity for the Democrats and for Mr. Perot, but doubted the Democrats' ability to exploit the opening before them.
 
G.O.P.'s Hold on Presidency
 "In the 1960's, the liberals were widely seen as having failed to deal with major questions of law enforcement, taxation, fiscal management and the role of government, as well as race," he said. "They were repudiated, and the Republicans moved into a 25-year period of executive hegemony.
"Twelve years of Reagan and Bush has not cured the problems, either. It hasn't given us morning in America. It's produced more columns of smoke rising from our inner cities."
The Democrats' problem, Mr. Phillips asserted, is that most Americans do not care deeply about big cities, and if that is the focus of the debate, they will lose. What they need to do, he said, is to make the cities part of a larger discussion of the Republicans' failure to address things most voters do care deeply about, like education and health care for everyone.

 BODY:

FUNDS FOR ROADS: A bill that would increase the New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund's spending limit by $200 million to help road construction projects has won final approval in the Assembly. The bill, passed on Thursday, would raise the trust fund cap to $565 million. The fund is backed by state gasoline taxes. The measure was first proposed by Gov. Jim Florio as a way to help the state recover from the recession.
 
MURDER-SCHEME INDICTMENTS: Five people have been indicted in a conspiracy that ended with the shooting death of a New Jersey Institute of Technology campus police officer.
The indictments, returned on Thursday, stem from the Nov. 23 slaying of Revell Quince, 43 years old, as he returned home from work. Prosecutors say Mr. Quince's stepdaughter, Cynthia Gregory, 22, said she engineered the plot because Mr. Quince had sexually abused her. 

NO NEW TRIAL FOR McCANN: A Federal judge has denied a new trial for the ousted Mayor of Jersey City, Gerald McCann, who was convicted of bank fraud and tax charges. The decision Thursday by Judge John C. Lif land of Federal District Court in Newark paves the way for the sentencing of Mr. McCann, who faces up to 71 years in prison and $1 million in fines. No sentencing date was set.
 
NO SIGN OF OFFICIAL: An intensive search continued yesterday today for the president of Exxon International, ho has been missing since Wednesday morning, when his car was found in his driveway in Morris Township, N.J., with the engine running.
"At this point, we don't have anything," Lois Ferguson, a spokeswoman for the Morris County Prosecutor's Office, said about the disappearance of Sidney J. Reso, 57 years old.
 
CONNECTICUT BUDGET STALLS: The $8.08 billion budget that sailed through the Connecticut House on Thursday stalled in the Senate yesterday.
Some House members charged that the Senate was holding the budget hostage to prod the House into passing a bill legalizing slot machines by a veto-proof margin. But Senate leaders denied the charge and said their caucus was grappling with House changes to the budget, especially in the teachers pension fund, welfare and local school aid.

HEADLINE: RIOTS IN LOS ANGELES: Political Memo;
Clinton's Reaction to Rioters Evolves

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., May 1

 BODY:
Bill Clinton has talked about race relations throughout the campaign. To white audiences in New Hampshire and Michigan and to black audiences in Chicago and Jackson, Miss., he issued pleas for an end to racial division, usually evoking warm applause that would suggest a unanimity of spirit on the issue.
But in the wake of the deadly riots that engulfed Los Angeles this week, Mr. Clinton found himself searching for the right moral and political tone to apply to some knotty and painful issues. Just as President Bush worked throughout the day on Thursday to devise an appropriate response to the Los Angeles violence, so too did Mr. Clinton. 
 After talking in the morning with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Representative Maxine Waters of California and Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles, Mr. Clinton began the day by condemning the acquittal of four white police officers in the beating of Rodney G. King and expressing sympathy for the outrage that fed the riots.
In Chapel Hill, N.C., where he taped radio interviews on Thursday, the Arkansas Governor said he understood the rioters' behavior. "To them, it sort of stands for all the neglect, all the economic decline, all the insecurity of the streets, and not being able to walk safely on the streets," he said.
 
Calls Rioters 'Lawless'
 But immediately afterward, aides said, Mr. Clinton watched the latest news reports from Los Angeles of looting, fires and innocent motorists being beaten by marauders. "There is a great deal of difference between being disappointed, angered and befuddled by the verdict, and taking the law into your own hands," he said today.
At the next stop, Birmingham, Ala., Mr. Clinton scrapped his standard rally speech and told a racially integrated gathering of supporters that the Los Angeles rioters were "lawless vandals." But he also characterized the unrest in Los Angeles as proof that the nation's leaders have allowed "the very fabric of our society to rot out from under us."
He continued: "It does not have to be that these children die in the streets of our cities. It does not have to be that their lives are lost to crime and drugs and gangs. It does not have to be that our schools fail just because the children who attend them come from families who are troubled. Let us resolve in this election, yes, to have a new economic direction; yes, to reorganize America to compete and win; but first to bind up the wounds of this nation."
Evoking memories of the racial strife that wracked his native South during the 1960's, Mr. Clinton told the Birmingham gathering: "We never got anywhere in this part of the country shouting at one another. When we started talking to one another, we found out that we were a lot more alike than we thought."
The evolution continued today, as Mr. Clinton called for a national day of prayer on Sunday. He also made plans to address the issue again when he speaks before the centrist Democratic Leadership Council meeting in New Orleans on Saturday.
"Racism and violence only beget more racism and more violence," Mr. Clinton said today.
Some political experts believe that Democrats will never triumph in a debate about law and order. Republicans seized that high ground years ago, the reasoning goes, and President Bush possesses an advantage of incumbency: He can order Federal troops into riot-torn neighborhoods.
The Clinton camp is hoping it can counter such political wisdom by focusing the debate on underlying causes of the violence. At a news conference in Chapel Hill, for example, Mr. Clinton said, "It is time for the President once again to be involved in sharing the pain as well as the promise of America."
After the Bush campaign accused him of politicizing the riots, Mr. Clinton resisted invitations at a news conference today to criticize the President as he had on Thursday, when he attributed the urban unrest to an "absence of action" on urban issues by successive Republican Administrations. "I don't think today is the day for us to be casting stones and placing blame," he said in a news conference at the State Capitol.
But Gov. Ann Richards of Texas, who endorsed Mr. Clinton at a news conference in Port Arthur, Tex., tonight, did not hesitate to lambaste the President.
"The people of Los Angeles are living through a nightmare that I think has been caused by years of manipulation," she said. "They've been manipulated politically on the issues about race, about economic equality. We've seen a lot of hypocrisy, we've seen a lot of indifference, and we've seen a lot of indecision that's brought us to a place where Willie Horton and Rodney King symbolize the polar opposites of the very same fear that the law cannot protect us and our Government won't do it."
"These young hoodlums who burn and batter and turn our streets into killing fields were once our children," Governor Richards said.

HEADLINE: Treasury Issues Rise on Purchasing Report

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose and interest rates moved lower yesterday, as traders bought notes and bonds after an important barometer of manufacturing activity showed that conditions were less healthy than expected.
Although results of a survey of the nation's purchasing managers showed that manufacturing activity rose for the third straight month in April, the rate of the expansion was down, an indication that credit is unlikely to be tightened soon. 
 Most traders and analysts had expected the survey's composite index to rise from March's 54.1 percent reading, the highest since last summer. Instead, it fell back to 51.3 percent. A reading below 50 percent means economic contraction; above 50 shows expansion.
The survey "showed some erosion in the pace of production and new orders," said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds.
Bond prices also got a lift from an article in The New York Times reporting that Brazilian officials had agreed to use some of their $14 billion in foreign-exchange reserves to buy Treasury securities, as part of the country's debt restructuring with commercial bank creditors.
Earlier this week, bond prices rose on rumors that Argentina would be buying zero-coupon Treasury bonds as part of its restructuring efforts.
"The story created expectations that the Brazilians will have demand for zero-coupon bonds as well," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J.
Trading tailed off in the early afternoon as a number of brokers sent employees home early because of fears that tumult might erupt in New York City, as it had in Los Angeles and some other cities.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 100, up 3/8 point, to yield 8.00 percent, compared with 8.03 percent late Thursday.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year securities were offered late yesterday at 9925/32 , up 9/32 , to yield 7.53 percent. The 5 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 1006/32 up 6/32 , to yield 5.30 percent.
Rates on short-term Treasury bills fell.
Three-month bills were offered in late trading at a discount rate of 3.61 percent, down 7 basis points, or seven one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 8 basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.73 percent. And one-year bill rates slid by 10 basis points, to a late offered rate of 4.09 percent.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, Ford Credit offered $700 million of securities backed by auto loan receivables through an underwriting group led by Salomon Brothers.
The 7 3/8 percent notes, which mature on April 15, 1997, were priced at $99.687 to yield 7.454 percent, 65 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 7/8 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing.
Triple-A ratings are expected from both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Goldman, Sachs & Company acted as lead underwriter for an offering of $150 million worth of noncallable three-year notes for Albertson's Inc.
The 6 3/8 percent notes were priced at $99.93 to yield 6.40 percent, 45 basis points over the prevailing yield on Treasury securities of comparable maturity.
The issue is rated AA-3 by Moody's and A+ by Standard & Poor's.

HEADLINE: A Scandal On China's Exchange

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 1

 BODY:
A scandal is unfolding in southern China involving a company that two years ago became the first foreign concern to be listed on a Chinese stock exchange. The garment and real estate company is now embroiled in a battle with regulators over its survival, and the Government has detained two employees and even refused to allow family visits.
The company suggests that it got into trouble because it refused to sell shares to the Chinese Government at a cut-rate price, while the Government hints that it intervened because of financial irregularities. 
 At the heart of the dispute is the Champaign Industrial Company, a joint venture between China and a group of American, Australian and Malaysian investors. In 1990 it sold shares to the public and was listed on the stock exchange in the city of Shenzhen, a special economic zone on the border with Hong Kong.
 
Spreading to Others
 While news of the scandal has generally been confined to the investment community in Shenzhen and Hong Kong, it is slowly spreading to other investors interested in China. The Shenzhen stock exchange recently began offering special shares to foreign institutional investors, and these shares are regulated by the same officials who govern Champaign's domestically traded stock.
The United States Consulate in Guangzhou has begun to investigate the scandal, but would not comment.
Whatever the real story, the battle illustrates the complexities of the Chinese market. Equities are new here, the country's securities regulations all fit into a tiny pamphlet and annual reports may run to eight pages.
"We obviously don't know quite where the truth lies," said Archibald W. F. Hart, director of research at Crosby Securities (Hongkong) Ltd. "The authorities suspect there might be some irregularities in the company and so they're quite keen to crack down on those irregularities and put a stop to them."
After the 1990 offering, the company's stock price soared, from about $2 a share to nearly $40, and the Chinese partner sold out at an enormous profit. But then various Chinese Government branches began paying visits to Champaign, inspecting it and interrupting its activities.
 
Stake Reportedly Sought
 According to a Hong Kong businessman close to the company, the Chinese officials made clear what they were after: a 22 percent stake in the company, at an insider price one-third the market level. Champaign refused, and the problems got worse.
On April 6, five officials in Shenzhen confiscated the official seal of the company and shut down its financial operations. Then the next day, regulators summoned Champaign's deputy general manager and the deputy chief accountant, who are both Chinese nationals.
The authorities later confirmed that the two were being detained but refused to explain just why they were being jailed or to allow anyone to see them.
The People's Bank of China, which regulates the market, refused to comment. However, the official Chinese press has quoted the regulators as saying that Champaign's directors have mismanaged and defrauded the company. The bank is conducting a thorough investigation, the Chinese press reports said.
A public security official in Shenzhen confirmed that the employees had been "temporarily detained," which means there is no need for an arrest warrant, but would not say where they were being held.
 
They 'Try to be Fair'
 Most analysts in Hong Kong are enthusiastic about Chinese stocks and express a measure of sympathy for the Shenzhen regulators.
"They didn't handle this very well," said Xu Yanping, research manager at Hoare Govett Asia Ltd. "But they really try to be fair with all the companies and they really care about their image."
The exchange's image may be tarnished, however, by a lawsuit that Champaign filed on April 18 against the People's Bank of China. The suit charges that the regulators overstepped their powers and illegally detained the two employees.
Shenzhen authorities, concerned that negative publicity could hurt their prospects for attracting overseas investors, have publicly emphasized their responsibility to take action against corrupt practices of listed companies.
American fund managers have been visiting China to survey the investment opportunities and several have already begun purchasing China's special shares for foreigners, called B shares, from Hong Kong brokerage houses. Champaign's shares are A shares, and can be purchased only by Chinese nationals.
 
Real Estate Potential
 One factor in Champaign's favor, if the company ever resolves its problems with Chinese officials, is that it is one of the few joint ventures that have purchased Chinese property development companies. The Chinese real estate market has been growing rapidly, and some analysts say the potential for profits is tremendous.
According to Champaign's annual report, audited by a Chinese accounting firm, revenues jumped from the equivalent of $14.8 million in 1990 to about $54.7 million last year. Profits, however, rose from $5.8 million in 1990 to only $8.4 million last year, in part because of higher administrative expenses and losses from overseas operations.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Weak Purchasers' Report Leads to Drop in the Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell in thin trading yesterday, mostly because of a disappointing report from the nation's purchasing executives.
Gold prices rose. At the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fetched $339 an ounce, up $1.40 from Thursday. At the Republic National Bank in New York, gold sold for $338.25, up $1.35. 
 The National Association of Purchasing Management said in its monthly report on business that manufacturing growth slowed in April.
"It was further incentive for the market to sell off the dollar," said Mike Faust, senior currency strategist at MMS International. "The dollar hadn't responded well to as-expected economic data released this week."
Reports showing an improving economy often strengthen the dollar, but on Thursday the dollar fell despite positive economic data. Traders said that numbers showing only sluggish recovery were no longer sufficient to lift the dollar and that the market would need strong data to move upward.
The dollar was not supported by another report yesterday that showed an improving economy. The Government said construction spending jumped 1.6 percent in March to the highest level in 15 months, the third straight increase.
In addition, trading was thin. Most of Europe observed a May Day holiday; only London markets were open.
And in New York many banks decided to close earlier than usual yesterday afternoon. There were fears that the two nights of racial unrest in Los Angeles and protests in other cities might spread to New York.
In New York, the dollar fell to 132.65 Japanese yen, from 133.25 late Thursday. In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 133.13 yen, from 133.38 yen Thursday. Later, in London, it fell to 132.75 yen.
Also in New York, the British pound rose to $1.7865, from $1.7780 Thursday. In London, sterling rose to $1.7840, from $1.7755.

HEADLINE: New York City Maintains Its Credit Rating

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
A major Wall Street credit-rating service expressed increased confidence yesterday in Mayor David N. Dinkins's fiscal plans by maintaining New York City's current credit rating.
"The city's single-A-minus rating on $17 billion in general obligation debt is affirmed," the Standard & Poor's Corporation rating service announced in a press release. 
 The affirmation is significant because Standard & Poor's had threatened to lower the city's rating. The agency had consistently objected to city plans for borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars to close a gap in its operating budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1. A lowered rating would have raised the interest rate the city pays to bond holders, and it would have discouraged some institutional lenders, particularly pension funds, from buying city bonds.
 
Creating a Surplus
 The Dinkins administration allayed the rating agency's concerns this week when it released a proposed $29.5 billion budget that did not include any borrowing for operating expenses. The Mayor said he had managed to create a $455 million surplus in the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, allowing the city to avoid borrowing next year for operating expenses.
Mr. Dinkins's proposed 1993 budget "is the third in a series of improving financial plans since November 1991 to address the substantial budget gaps facing New York City over the next several years," the Standard & Poor's statement said.
"The initial plan, proposed in November 1991, relied on $1 billion of debt proceeds to fund spending," the statement continued. "In addition, the plan was connected to a loosely structured effort to reduce the size of city government, and it relied heavily on uncertain state and Federal revenues, or spending relief."
In January and February, the city "provided more specific information on how and when government 'downsizing' would occur, and with each plan revision, the city demonstrated an ability to reduce its need for deficit financing," Standard & Poor's said.
Mr. Dinkins's spokesman, Leland T. Jones, said last night: "The Mayor was very pleased when he heard the news. The rating agency's decision reflects the very hard choices and the hard work the Mayor had to do to propose his third straight balanced budget. But, obviously, there's a lot more hard work to do in the months ahead."
The A- rating -- on a scale ranging from AAA+ to D, which means payment in default -- means the city remains safely within what Standard & Poor's calls its "investment grade" category. Any rating below BBB is considered "speculative grade."
While expressing renewed confidence, the agency warned that the city still must deal with difficulties. "The city's planned use of its projected $455 million surplus to fund 1993 spending is, of course, a one-shot budget gap closer," it said. "But it is much more preferable than earlier plans to finance the gap with deficit financing."
"Certainly, the current projected surplus cannot be viewed as a panacea to the city's financial stress," the statement continued. "It is more like a down payment toward additional budget actions that continue to be necessary for the city to live within its means over the next few years, without the need for major tax increases."

HEADLINE: Libyan Deal Has Complications for Lonrho

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LONDON, May 1

 BODY:
Shares of the British conglomerate Lonrho P.L.C. fell sharply in London today after a newspaper reported that the United States Treasury was looking into the company's sale of a one-third stake in Metropole Hotels to Libya.
The company's stock tumbled more than 10 percent -- down 11 pence (19 cents) to close at 95 pence ($1.69) -- after The Financial Times said the Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control was interested in the Libyan deal. 
 The newspaper quoted a senior official of the office as having said that Lonrho could be placed on Washington's list of banned companies, if Libya acquired shares that would give that country a significant interest in running a Lonrho company.
 
Treasury's Response
 In Washington today, a Treasury spokesman, Scott Dykema, cited the department's policy of not confirming or denying the existence of investigations. But he repeated a comment he had made on March 30 about the Metropole deal: "That transaction is the kind of thing that we would be interested in taking a look at."
Lonrho said last month that it would sell the stake for 177.5 million ($306 million) to the Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company.
Lonrho's deputy chairman, Paul Spicer, said The Financial Times article had no new information. "There is not a single new fact, and it was an uneccessary article," he said in an interview.
In recent weeks, the Treasury Department has been cracking down on violations of Washington's 1986 sanctions against Libya. It has sent warning letters to 80 Americans working in Libya and has updated a list of companies and individuals that it said were violating the sanctions.

HEADLINE: Susan Brewster, 41; Helped to Stabilize Yonkers's Finances

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Susan N. Brewster, the executive director of the State Financial Control Board for the City of Yonkers for the last six years, died on Tuesday at the Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y. She was 41 years old and lived in Ossining.
She died of complications of leukemia, her husband, Charles Eisenmann, said. 
 Mrs. Brewster helped stabilize Yonkers's municipal finances during a period of budgetary strain and turbulence over millions of dollars in fines that a Federal judge threatened to impose on the city to pressure compliance on housing desegregation.
She outlined what was called a doomsday budget, which warned that if the case was not resolved, the city would be forced to dismantle services to pay the fines. After some fines were collected, officials reached a settlement with the court.
Born in London, Mrs. Brewster grew up in Ossining. After graduating from Brown University, she earned a master's degree in business administration at Columbia.
She started as a financial aide in the Ossining urban renewal agency, then worked for the New York City Office of Management and Budget. She became director of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act program in Fairfield County, Conn., then was appointed the Private Industry Council's deputy director for southern Connecticut. She joined the Yonkers control board as deputy director.
Mrs. Brewster helped found Job's Refuge, a homeless shelter in Ossining. She served on the board of the Open Door Family Health Clinic in Ossining, was a deacon for Briarcliff Congregational Church and was president of the Inter-Faith Council for Action, a housing preservation organization.
Surviving are her husband of eight years; their daughter, Catherine Eisenmann; her mother, Barbara Brewster of Ossining; and three sisters, Deborah Ferrenz of Silver Spring, Md., Abigail McGahey of Tyngsboro, Mass., and Alison Henderson of North Andover, Mass.

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
For Draft Pick, Prosperity Is Just Around the Corner

BYLINE: By FRANK LITSKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., May 1

 BODY:
As a football player at Arizona State, Phillippi Sparks was a sophisticated cornerback. He covered receivers tightly. He hit them hard. He supported the run.
As a world traveler, he was not sophisticated. Until today, he said, he had never been in the East or anywhere near it. But as the Giants' second choice in the 1992 National Football League draft, he flew here today for a weekend minicamp for rookies. 
 "I was shocked by the stadium," he said at a news conference there. "It's beautiful. I didn't know the Giants, Jets and Knights all played here. I guess it keeps the economy going."
The Giants will keep his economy going. And his economy, Sparks said, is in good shape, thanks to Jim Wiedmann of Phoenix, his father-in-law, who manufactures fiberglass tops for tractors.
"He took care of us until I could play pro ball," Sparks said. "Jodi and I have a 2-year-old daughter, Jordin, and a baby due in June. He helped us financially. He bought us a Jeep Renegade, and that would have been illegal if an agent gave it to us. He said as long as you take care of my daughter, I'm happy to do it. I think I would do it for my daughter."
Sparks was full of stories. He told how he had met his future wife when he was a student at Glendale Community College in Arizona.
"I went to an Arizona State squad game," he said. "When you see a pretty girl, you want to talk to her. I said, 'You have pretty eyes.' What a line, huh? I didn't see her again for a year. She was going to Arizona State and taking one course at Glendale, and I saw her again at Glendale. I said, 'You have pretty eyes.' She said, 'Are you the guy I met at Arizona State last year?' "
Then there is the matter of his first name.
"I've been called everything," he said, "Filly-pie, Fillip-ee, things like that. It's Fill-EE-pee. My mother was one of 10 children. Her younger brother, Phillippi, died in a house fire, and she said she would name her first son after him."
Sparks is 23 years old, 6 feet and 195 pounds. He said his right shoulder, which popped out last season, forcing him to miss two games, was sound, and he cited his performance at February's scouting combine, where he bench-pressed 225 pounds 18 times.
He is solidly built, and his scouting report says he is a mean player. He has been compared with Mark Collins, the Giants' left cornerback. Coincidentally, they have the same agent: Frank Bauer of Stockton, Calif.
Sparks was a 24-foot long jumper in high school and a strong safety in junior college. At Arizona State, he also played free safety at times and returned punts and kickoffs.
The Giants, with Greg Jackson and Myron Guyton, are relatively sound at safety. But they hope a younger player can move ahead of Everson Walls, 32 years old, and Perry Williams, almost 32, at right cornerback. Sparks will get the chance.
"He'll work as a corner initially," Coach Ray Handley said. "If he can't play corner, we'll move him to safety. If he can play corner, and we think he can, he'll have a good opportunity to start. In any case, he'll be a kickoff returner and perhaps back up Dave Meggett as a punt returner."
Off the field, Sparks is well-spoken and quick to laugh. He sounds serious about doing the right thing. For example, he did not declare for the draft as a junior, he said, because he wanted a degree. He has four classes left for a degree in social work, which he expects to earn this summer or next spring.
The mild-mannered student changes personalities when he plays football.
"There's a big difference on the field," he said. "Off the field, I feel like any normal person. On the field, I'm totally different. There aren't words to describe how you change. Some players have to be that way to be motivated. I'm self-motivated. When I step across the line, it's business. I hate my opponent. Sometimes, I get carried away a little in practice. Sometimes, defensive players don't always get along with teammates."
Last Sunday's draft, he said, tested his nerves. He said the Giants called him early in the first round and asked about the shoulder. He said a reporter from Buffalo called later in the round and said the Bills were interested in him. When the Giants took him in the second round, he said, his main feeling was satisfaction.
"Three million men would like to be in that spot," he said. "I know the Giants need a little help in the secondary, and I hope and pray I can fill those shoes. I'll play safety or corner or return kickoffs, whatever they want me to do. I just want to make the team."
One question about Sparks concerns his tackling.
"I guess I have a lot to prove," he said. "I thought I was able to do fairly well in my collegiate career. It doesn't matter what other people think, it's what the Giants think."

HEADLINE: Banks Expand Their Range of Services

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
Walk into many banks or savings institutions these days and most likely there will be experts on hand to offer mutual funds, annuities and other investment or insurance products.
The traditional services, including checking and savings accounts and certificates of deposit, are still there, of course, but today about half of the nation's 1,600 savings and loan associations and many banks, both large and small, are also selling an array of securities and the like. 
 "There's a major movement in the industry now to market a broad range of investment services," said James Shelton, executive director of the Bank Securities Association, a trade organization for banks based in San Francisco. "It is a natural distribution system."
 
Interest-Rate Help
 Fred DeBussey, senior vice president of Fitch Investors Service, a major rating agency, said: "People feel comfortable with folks they know and a lot of people feel comfortable dealing with banks. Nationwide, this is a trend that is going to grow all through this decade."
Spurring this growth is the current low interest-rate environment, which has forced six-month bank C.D. rates down to an average of less than 4 percent. Many individuals who for a long time became accustomed to high C.D. rates, which as recently as a year ago averaged about 6 percent, are searching for alternative investment possibilities with larger yields; among the choices are common-stock mutual funds and long-term Government bonds.
Retail bankers are seeking ways to provide these and other options to keep their customers from taking their certificate of deposit dollars to brokerage or mutual fund concerns, or to insurance companies.
"If they have to go elsewhere to buy an investment option, maybe they will go elsewhere with their other business as well," said Anthony Ronda, a vice president of Apple Bank for Savings in New York. "And then we might lose them as a customer."
Richard Davies, president of First Chicago Investment Corporation, a subsidiary of the First Chicago Corporation, said: "There's nothing we can't offer. Early in the 80's, investment products were a little sideline. We really view this now as a key strategic product line."
As banks expand the range of their services and move more aggressively into investments, and as regulators continue to interpret the laws separating banking and securities more liberally, consumers are becoming more accustomed to a separate area in their branch devoted solely to these kinds of products.
Some banks have even developed their own group of proprietary funds available only in their branches to sell along with the nationally known funds from groups like Fidelity, Dreyfus and Nuveen. In buying nontraditional products from banks, cost is rarely a factor. Many banks give their customers a discounted rate, just as many brokerage firms do. Instead, banks emphasize intangibles like convenience, access and trust.
"Our average client is more risk-averse than the average client of a brokerage firm," said J. Edward Diamond, president of the Dime Agency, a subsidiary of the Dime Savings Bank in New York. "So there is a lower-pressure atmosphere and completely unbiased investment advice."
Gregory J. Weber, a senior vice president of INB Financial Corporation in Indianapolis, noted that securities buyers at banks "deal with one person and can develop a lasting relationship; the customers that we sell these products to trust us."
Even though savings and checking accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, investment and insurance products are not. Therefore, banks try to separate the two categories in their branches as much as possible to avoid some inevitable confusion. In fact, Federal and state laws and regulations force banks to establish distinct subsidiaries or affiliates for their brokerage activities.
As a result, even though there may be one-stop shopping, customers must still deal with different people in a different part of the bank when discussing deposits and loans on the one hand and stocks and insurance on the other.
Sometimes the sellers of nontraditional products are employees of the bank or one of its subsidiaries. Other times they are employed by outside companies hired by the bank to sell and promote stocks, bonds, funds and similar products on the bank premises. In either case, the securities sales representatives must have the licenses necessary to handle those more complex items.
"We intentionally separate people who can sell bank products, which are insured, and investment products, which are not insured," said Loren Smith, a managing director of Citibank. "We bend over backward to make that clear to people."
 
Integrating Services
 According to Roger R. Ludemann, a senior vice president of American Charter Federal Savings and Loan Association in Lincoln, Neb.: "For the most part, customers going into these products typically didn't go into these kinds of products in the past. So we have separate signage to make sure they understand that the products are not F.D.I.C. insured."
Although bankers generally keep the marketing of nonbanking products in a different niche from their banking products, they are developing ways to integrate customers' various financial transactions within the bank. For example, at Bank One in Milwaukee, money received by customers from securities sales is automatically credited to their checking accounts. And at Citibank, bank statements will soon include information about securities transactions along with the standard banking data.

HEADLINE: Yes, Environmentalists Have Answers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Senator Malcom Wallop notes in his commentary on our energy problems, excerpted in an advertisement by the Mobil Corporation (Op-Ed, April 9), that the North Atlantic and mid-Atlantic offshore areas may contain natural gas reserves equivalent to 450 million and 900 million barrels of oil, respectively. Since United States oil consumption is about 16 million barrels of oil a day, these postulated reserves are equivalent to less than 90 days of consumption. 
 Moreover, natural gas is in great oversupply from domestic wells; according to news accounts many small producers are being driven out of business. We do not need more natural-gas production, especially from expensive offshore platforms in environmentally fragile areas.
According to Senator Wallop, the environmental community, which is against war, coal, nuclear power, hydroelectricity and drilling offshore and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, must come forward with something positive. Indeed the environmental community has done so.
First among its suggestions is efficient use of available resources. An increase in automobile fuel economy standards from 28 to 40 miles a gallon could save 2.8 million barrels of oil a day, more than 10 times what might be produced from the Arctic refuge. Electric utilities in California and New York have found it is much easier and as profitable to sell energy efficiency as to build generating stations. Environmental organizations have produced energy strategies to save money and reduce pollution and our dependence on imported oil.
Despite massive cuts in renewable energy research funds by the Reagan-Bush Administration, there has been impressive progress in solar electric technologies: the California Energy Commission has stated that wind turbines, among all renewable and fossil fuel technologies, now produce electricity at the lowest cost, a monumental accomplishment.
Senator Wallop may be forgiven. However, if the people at Mobil agree with his statements, we are truly in great difficulty.

Spring Cleaning for Profit

 BODY:
Tag sales can raise cash in a tight economy, remove clutter, reduce moving costs and help the environment by promoting recycling and re-use. Here are some tips on how to organize a tag sale to achieve the best results.
 
PREPARATION
Use a porch, garage or driveway to prevent strangers from wandering through the house. The sale price should be about a third of the current purchase price of a similar new item. Group sales with neighbors mean more things to sell. Hot sellers this year include LP's, vintage linens, and Victoriana. 

PROMOTION
Advertise at least one week in advance in the classified sections of community and regional papers. Don't overlook local weekly giveaway papers. Use tempting words or phrases like "antiques," "collectibles," "estate sale" or "must sell." But make sure your ad is accurate. Say "no early birds" if you want to avoid bargain hunters at 6 A.M.
 
WHEN TO SCHEDULE
Saturdays and Sundays draw the best traffic. Try Friday and Saturday if you have items that might attract serious antique dealers. Two days is usually sufficient.
 
WATCH FOR THIEVES
Theft is common. Professionals use oversize shopping bags, rolled umbrellas and big inside pockets. To increase security, use only one area for the entrance and exit and ask two or three people to act as monitors. Another person should be posted full time at the checkout table. It is best to accept only cash, but if more costly items require checks, take a cash deposit until the buyer's check clears.
 
USING PROFESSIONALS
The whole job can be turned over to tag-sale professionals (listed under "T" in the Yellow Pages). They charge a commission that averages around 25 percent of total receipts, with a minimium amount as protection should sales be slow.

 CORRECTION:

CORRECTION:

The nonfiction best seller list on page 32 of The Times Book Review today omits "Brother Eagle, Sister Sky: A Message From Chief Seattle," which was carried for 17 weeks in the nonfiction category.
The change was made because of evidence, reported in a news article on April 21, that the contents of the book do not reflect words spoken by Chief Seattle, but have as their source a speech written for a 1971 movie by Ted Perry, a screenwriter.
 "Brother Eagle, Sister Sky" has been reclassified under "Advice, How-to and Miscellaneous." Because that category lists only five entries a week and the book is not among the top five, it does not appear.

QUEEN OF DESIRE
By Sam Toperoff.
276 pp. New York:
HarperCollins Publishers. $20. 
 A GRECIAN urn may have sufficed as an eternal home for Keats's anonymous Attic maiden, but it would never do for Marilyn Monroe. She'll be spending eternity not only on our movie screens but on our T-shirts, coffee mugs and pizza parlor walls.
In the publishing industry, Monroe's story appears to be both recession-proof and quintessentially American, a tawdry passion play of glittering triumph and early demise that can be retold season after season. In the 80-odd books she has inspired, her life has been pawed over by big-star biographers, archeologists of scandal, conspiracy theorists, semioticians, brand-name authors (Norman Mailer, Gloria Steinem and, of course, Arthur Miller) and every self-proclaimed "friend" with a memoir to peddle.
And now we have Sam Toperoff's "Queen of Desire," a novel based on Monroe's life, modishly blending truth and invention, real people and fictional characters. Mr. Toperoff's publisher invokes E. L. Doctorow and Don DeLillo as antecedents, but this is no jumbo jet of a book like "Ragtime" or "Libra," only a little two-seater that puddle-hops from period to period in its subject's spectacular history.
Mr. Toperoff, who is primarily known as a journalist, though he has published fiction as well, clearly covets the special laurel wreath of the novelist. Unfortunately, in harnessing his imagination to a tale that's been in reruns for 30 years, he has too severely limited his artistic boundaries.
But to give him his due, Mr. Toperoff gets some modest creative fire going intermittently; one effective strategy is to preface each phase of Monroe's life with an adroitly counterfeited magazine interview. Thus, the reader is properly cued for the mixture of imaginary and biographically accurate episodes that follows. The early chapters include graphic accounts of sexual abuse at age 9 by her mother's boyfriend and of her best friend's abortion in a seedy motel during World War II. A subsequent scene from Monroe's stint as a nightclub singer is rather programmatic, however.
A few chapters later, she is an ambitious starlet being coaxed into making minor adjustments to her face by Hollywood's leading plastic surgeon, who is presented to us as a Pygmalion-like genius. But with his secluded hilltop mansion and faint resemblance to a James Bond villain, the doctor arouses more mirth than awe (especially since his name is Goldfedder).
The remainder of the book teeters along this same erratic course. Mr. Toperoff, who has a good deal of sportswriting on his resume, is at his best in depicting Monroe's visit to Yankee Stadium with her second husband, Joe DiMaggio. Invading the press box, Monroe draws on a combination of ingenuousness, guile and glamour to neutralize two male chauvinist columnists, Red Smith and Jimmy Cannon.
IN later chapters, though, the story again turns dramatically inert. A mournful poker game including Monroe, Clark Gable, John Huston and Montgomery Clift, during the shooting of "The Misfits" (Monroe's last film), is intended to bang the drum slowly -- for the star's failing marriage to Arthur Miller, for her lost chances to have a baby, for Gable, who died soon afterward. Instead, the elegiac music is dim and muffled. Also, a defect that sabotages Mr. Toperoff's work throughout is particularly in evidence here: his real-life characters tend to be pallid facsimiles of the vibrant originals.
And yet Mr. Toperoff ends in bravura style, offering a surprisingly taut imagining of Monroe's final hours, during which the actress, groggy from drink and drugs, valiantly debates the overbearing atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair (of all people) on a call-in radio show. With the unctuous host falling under her spell, the great movie queen sinks into oblivion.
In essence, then, this Monroe is the tragic heroine we know so well -- pathologically insecure, a tender spirit bruised by life, a brilliant natural talent manipulated by men for their own ends, a born victim. But while Mr. Toperoff has the same right to his fictionalized celebrities as, say, Gore Vidal has to his Lincoln and Burr, the reader also has a right to decide that these concoctions suffer by comparison to their historical prototypes.
Still, in this instance enough of Monroe's extraordinary personality survives in Mr. Toperoff's rendering to keep us turning the pages. Dying young, Marilyn Monroe, famous for her eternally famished heart, got the most ironic present the world could give her: endless love. "Queen of Desire" is the latest wreath to be laid on her tomb. It certainly won't be the last.

INVENTING TIMES SQUARE
Commerce and Culture at the Crossroads of the World.
Edited by William R. Taylor.
Illustrated. 467 pp. New York:
Russell Sage Foundation. $39.95. 
 ONE evening in 1919, a short, shy fellow named Irving Caesar, who was just short of his 25th birthday, sat close to the stage of one of the cavernous theaters on Times Square and took in a performance of the song "Swanee," which he had written with George Gershwin. The song was a great early triumph for Gershwin, of course, and became the signature piece for the man who performed it that night, Al Jolson. As Jolson sang, Mr. Caesar recalled in a conversation in his Broadway office a full seven decades later, the young man felt bombarded by the excitement and spectacle. It had something to do with Jolson's presence, he thought, and the howl of applause, and the 60 showgirls stretched in a line with light bulbs beaming through their transparent high heels.
Mr. Caesar is not mentioned in the 23 essays that make up "Inventing Times Square," a volume culled from two years of seminars by urban studies scholars meeting at New York University. But noted and amply analyzed is just about every major cultural force that could have contributed to putting him in the middle of this place in the first half of the century, when to be there was to be at the center of a world of flash, trash and pop genius unlike anything before.
The lyricist of "Tea for Two" and "I Want to Be Happy" may be surprised to learn in this book of his debt to late 19th-century liberal Protestant theology, to say nothing of the establishment of tourism as an industry, the transformation of New York City zoning regulations or the pre-Depression accumulation of capital on Wall Street -- forces cited here as contributing to making Times Square the nation's cultural and commercial powerhouse. Together, the essays present a portrait of pre-World War II America in good-natured upheaval, shaking off convention and inventing and reinventing an unpredictable "commercial culture" that thrived in Times Square until, in recent decades, it was pre-empted by what the book's editor, William R. Taylor, a historian at the State University of New York, Stony Brook, defines as a standardized mass culture.
As one contributor, William Leach, who is now writing a history of American consumer culture, says: "Qualities once seen as subversive and immoral and as existing on the margins of American culture gradually moved to the heart of that culture -- carnival color and light, wishing, desiring, dreaming, spending and speculation, theatricality, luxury and unmitigated pursuit of personal pleasure and gain. These qualities were 'consumerist' and are today thought of by many Americans (and by people wanting to come to this country) as the most seductive features of American life and as somehow intrinsic to what it means to be an American."
None of the essays -- which cover topics as diverse as Irving Berlin and Times Square's gay underground -- are without interest, but those that are most intriguing deal with a breaking down of walls between classes, cultures, neighborhoods, pools of money, egos. The result, at its best, was a sort of hyperegalitarianism that still characterizes the city at its most exuberant.
Missing from the book is what others in words, song and spectacle have captured so well: the flavor of this world and what it was like to taste it. This shortcoming notwithstanding, if there is a latent point to the book, it is just how seemingly ignorant and disrespectful of the area is the huge city and state plan to replace Times Square with an office park duded up with lights and with some restored theaters that will fail to mask the plan's monolithic blandness.
This emerges full blast in an elegant and biting afterword by Ada Louise Huxtable, for many years the architecture critic of The New York Times. "From the start, the premises of the development project were wrong," she writes. "This was a back-from-the-dead example of the thoroughly discredited bulldozer urban renewal of the 1960's. It was predicated solely on the aims and principles of private development, even though it was a publicly sponsored and assisted project which used substantial amounts of public money." In Mrs. Huxtable's eyes, the "cleanup" promised by these buildings "was a convenient cover for conventional development." Lighting, building setbacks and other zoning features mandated around Times Square by the city are "a kind of splendid wallpaper, or light show for a performance that isn't there."
If the city chose to, it could try to reinvent Times Square in a way that, despite the physical realities of the development project, is truer to the ethnic, economic and cultural mix that percolates through these pages. Many of the new buildings in the Times Square area stand empty or nearly so, and there's no reason that eventually they should have to be filled entirely with lawyers, accountants and executives from companies looking for skyscraper fire sales. With some government inducements, they might be filled with the back offices that large corporations are moving out of the city in droves and that provide whatever 90's equivalents there are to the entry-level jobs that New York boasted in Times Square's heyday. The work force would no doubt be more varied in every way, and on payday it would no doubt be looking for some new forms of popular entertainment.
What better place than Times Square?

 BODY:
CHASING THE MONSOON: A Modern Pilgrimage Through India, by Alexander Frater. (Owl/Holt, $12.95.) When the author was a boy, he had over his bed a print of a landscape in India entitled "Cherrapunji, Assam: The Wettest Place on Earth." This book chronicles Mr. Frater's 1987 journey to that site. Last year our reviewer, Raleigh Trevelyan, called it "delightful, witty and unusual . . . full of humorous perceptions."
BRIEF LIVES, by Anita Brookner. (Vintage Contemporaries, $11.) This novel is narrated by Fay Langdon, who has reached old age with the somber realization that she has never really been loved. She looks back on her relationships with her husband and lover, both now dead, and her lover's wife, a woman who seems to embrace life with all the verve and daring Fay lacks. But in the end her story is a courageous one, Joyce Reiser Kornblatt said in The Book Review last year: "[Fay] 'felt a grief that was not merely personalized but general, and an unwilling solidarity with all female destinies.' That empathy, which Fay comes to late, informs all of Anita Brookner's novels. 'Brief Lives' is yet another instance of her large and knowing heart." 
 SOMEDAY, by Andrew H. Malcolm. (Harper Perennial, $11.) Mr. Malcolm, national affairs correspondent of The New York Times, had written extensively on death and dying before he had to confront the final illness of his mother. Last year our reviewer, Perri Klass, called his book "a noble salute to the many layers of family involvement, the specificity of illness and death and the complexity of love."
TO KNOW A WOMAN, by Amos Oz. Translated by Nicholas de Lange. (Harvest/Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $8.95.) An Israeli author writes about a retired secret service officer who is surrounded by women he struggles to know: his mother, mother-in-law, teen-age daughter and, in spirit, his dead wife. Last year our reviewer, William H. Pritchard, said that this is a novel in which "the human condition is observed -- kept watch over -- with scrupulous exactitude."
FREE SPACES: The Sources of Democratic Change in America, by Sara M. Evans and Harry C. Boyte. (University of Chicago, $12.95.) "Free spaces" are organizations that bridge the gap between citizens and the state, including church groups, labor unions and farmers' alliances. Although our reviewer, Benjamin R. Barber, did not always see such institutions as salutary (a new introduction addresses his and others' criticisms), he praised the book in 1986 for reminding us "how crucial it is to root democracy in the free space of local human communities."
OBJECT LESSONS, by Anna Quindlen. (Ivy, $5.99.) The intergenerational battle of wills within a large Irish Catholic family in the 1960's is at the heart of this first novel by Ms. Quindlen, a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for The New York Times. In 1991 our reviewer, Anne Tyler, characterized the book as "intelligent, highly entertaining and laced with acute perceptions about the nature of day-to-day family life."
BELLE MOSKOWITZ: Feminine Politics and the Exercise of Power in the Age of Alfred E. Smith, by Elisabeth Israels Perry. (Routledge, $15.95.) Belle Moskowitz, the largely unsung heroine of Al Smith's political career, was arguably the most powerful woman in American politics in the 1920's. This biography by her granddaughter is "compact" and "compassionate," David Seidman said here in 1987.
NOW YOU SEE IT, by Cornelia Nixon. (Harper Perennial, $9.) This novel consists of a series of intertwined stories about a romantic and impractical California professor, his rigid German wife and their children. Last year our reviewer, Rand Richards Cooper, found "more than a touch of magic in these graceful pages."
THE END OF LAISSEZ-FAIRE: National Purpose and the Global Economy After the Cold War, by Robert Kuttner. (University of Pennsylvania, $16.95.) While laissez-faire policies had a renaissance during the Reagan years, Mr. Kuttner believes that now that the Soviet threat has disappeared, the United States' allies will be less likely than ever to favor the extremes of free trade. The author's "richly detailed evidence . . . will have to be taken into account by anyone assessing the present state of the world economy," Dennis H. Wrong said in The Book Review in 1991.
THE M.D.: A Horror Story, by Thomas M. Disch. (Berkley, $5.99.) William Michaels is not the first doctor to sell his soul to the devil, and in this contemporary Faustian fable the workings of his magical caduceus are grisly indeed. Last year our reviewer, Gahan Wilson, said he was "highly entertained and constantly surprised by Mr. Disch's marvelous imagination."
MAKING SEX: Body and Gender From the Greeks to Freud, by Thomas Laqueur. (Harvard University, $12.95.) The author argues that our assumptions about gender are determined more by cultural bias than scientific fact. " 'Making Sex' is an impressive history of a particularly treacherous set of ideas -- those that relate biology to our concepts of male-female differences," Melvin Konner said here in 1990.
THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING, by Lisa Grunwald. (Warner, $9.99.) Science collides head-on with mysticism when Alexander Simon, a physicist, faces his long-absent mother. Last year our reviewer, Greg Johnson, found the novelist's characterization sometimes superficial, but praised her "gift for irony and her storytelling energy."

FRANK CAPRA
The Catastrophe of Success.
By Joseph McBride.
Illustrated. 768 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $27.50. 
 PROBABLY no film maker ever dominated an era the way Frank Capra dominated his. During the 1930's, at the peak of his powers and his success, he won three Academy Awards and was Hollywood's most highly paid director. He also served as president of both the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Screen Directors Guild. Time magazine put him on its cover. The Philip Morris Company used him to peddle cigarettes. ("I smoke quite a lot when directing a picture," he was paid to say. "I like to smoke Philip Morris because of their throat ease, so noticeable when one's voice is important.") The film critic for London's Daily Express thought that Capra's political influence was potentially as great as Franklin D. Roosevelt's. And Capra was one of those rare Americans whose name became not only a household word but an adjective as well.
Audiences flocked to see "Capraesque" movies like "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" and "Meet John Doe" -- parables of ordinary people forced to stand up against the greed and corruption of the rich and powerful. Those dramatic comedies, with their depictions of hardship, their "common man" heroes (usually Jimmy Stewart or Gary Cooper) and their celebrations of small-town virtues, gave expression to a country struggling to climb out of the Depression; they have, ever since their release, been identified with Roosevelt and the New Deal. Yet it is one of the great surprises of Joseph McBride's masterly, comprehensive and frequently surprising biography, "Frank Capra: The Catastrophe of Success," that the man who seemed to put the spirit of the New Deal on the screen was, in reality, a closet reactionary and a dogged Roosevelt hater.
Frank Capra managed to fool just about everyone; even his wife was unsure of his political affiliations. Longtime co-workers who were Democrats assumed he shared their political convictions. Katharine Hepburn, who starred in his 1948 picture "State of the Union," thought him "quite liberal"; others applied the term "radical" to him. And why shouldn't they have, when Variety was calling a sympathetic character in "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" "quasi-communistic" and The Saturday Evening Post was reporting that in the Soviet Union Capra was "hailed as a comrade"? But as Mr. McBride, the author of previous books on Howard Hawks, John Ford and Orson Welles, tells us, Capra was a lifelong Republican who never once voted for Roosevelt. He was an admirer of Franco and Mussolini. In later years, during the McCarthy period, he served as a secret F.B.I. informer.
In part, the misperception was due to Capra's writers, who generally ranged from New Deal Democrats to card-carrying Communists. One of Capra's great strengths as a director in the 1930's was his ability to work with anyone who had something to contribute to his pictures, even those who were far to his left. He was also enough of a popular entertainer to cater to his audiences; he understood that during the Depression the most hissable villains were grasping bankers and businessmen.
But ultimately the misunderstanding over Capra's politics seems to be a case of people seeing what they wanted to see. In his analysis of "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," Mr. McBride points out that the Gary Cooper character, far from being some sort of socialist or New Deal liberal, was, if anything, an "enlightened plutocrat" whose philosophy of voluntary giving was little different from that of Republican businessmen opposed to the New Deal; and he shrewdly notes that while Deeds got into trouble for trying to distribute most of the $20 million he inherited to desperate farmers, he was still planning to keep $2 million for himself.
A plutocrat less enlightened than Deeds, Capra derived his conservative politics from his battles to reach the top. His was a Horatio Alger story, full of pluck and luck, but in the end, as Mr. McBride vividly demonstrates, more chilling than inspiring. Capra was born in Sicily in 1897 and came to the United States with his family in 1903. He was raised in Los Angeles, where his father was a laborer and farmhand, and he spent a lifetime escaping from his background and family. While still in grammar school, Capra changed his middle name from Rosario to Russell -- a name that he said "didn't smell of the ghetto." He was determined to go to college despite his family's peasant distrust of learning ("Those people with education can't make a living," his brother-in-law, a fruit peddler, told him). Through a combination of loans, odd jobs and some help from home, he succeeded in graduating in 1918 from the Throop College of Technology (later the California Institute of Technology).
THE movie business was an obvious avenue for an ambitious young Californian, and within a few years Capra was writing gags for the Our Gang series and the comedian Harry Langdon. In 1926 he directed his first feature, "The Strong Man," starring Langdon. A year later he moved to up-and-coming Columbia Pictures, beginning a productive 12-year association with the studio's equally ambitious head, the feared and fearsome Harry Cohn. By the early 1930's Capra was Columbia's most successful director, earning huge salaries from the Depression-resistant movie industry for action-adventure films with names like "Submarine," "Flight" and "Dirigible." As the economy collapsed around his countrymen, the self-made Capra, Mr. McBride says, "could see in himself the living proof of . . . faith in the American system."
Still, his greatest triumphs were ahead of him. In 1931 he met the playwright Robert Riskin and started a collaboration that ran through nine screenplays and included the bulk of his most memorable movies. With Riskin, a Roosevelt Democrat, giving edge to Capra's natural sentimentality, the director hammered out a formula that took his films to another level, turning him from a successful studio hack into the kind of person Time puts on its cover and The New Yorker writes profiles of. His peers recognized his transformation by voting his picture "It Happened One Night" the best film of 1934 and awarding him his first Oscar for direction. (Riskin also won for best screenplay, and the two leads, Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, won for best actor and best actress, a sweep of the five top prizes that would not be duplicated until "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" in 1976.) Capra won another Oscar two years later for "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," directed from another Riskin script, and yet again in 1939 for Riskin's adaptation of the George S. Kaufman-Moss Hart play "You Can't Take It With You." Even without Riskin, Capra stayed with the formula to make "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" in 1939 and "It's a Wonderful Life" in 1946.
IT is hard to believe that anyone who reads "Frank Capra" will ever be able to watch these movies in quite the same way again. Instead of lively, socially conscious entertainments, one is apt to see the idealized fancies of an insecure immigrant parading his Americanism across the screen, or the contradictions of a parvenu who was contemptuous of the masses yet eager to please them. The platitudes in the films -- their persistent prating about human kindness and loving thy neighbor -- are likely to be more annoying than before, the melodrama at their heart more obtrusive. Isn't "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" really about the conflict between an overaged Boy Scout and an ogre who beats up little children? Does it have anything to do with politics at all?
Yet among the elements that make this book so rich is its intertwining of the bad and the good, so that while we may be appalled at the way Capra turned his back on his parents, we can at the same time admire his sheer determination to make something of himself in the face of huge obstacles. Similarly, if the themes that once provided Capra's films with their resonance no longer hold up, other qualities in them emerge clearer than ever: Capra's narrative strengths, his skill with ensembles, his facility for wringing every bit of juice out of a scene, his attention to (and joy in) his secondary characters. By filling his pictures with an assortment of kooks and clowns, Capra looked forward a few years to Preston Sturges, and backward to Charles Dickens. Although Mr. McBride does not say enough about these particular virtues, he makes certain that we will never forget another of Capra's special talents: his extraordinary ability to bring out the best in his actors.
Mr. McBride shows that Capra almost singlehandedly created a pantheon of screen idols. He established Jean Harlow as a star. He turned Clark Gable into a sex symbol. He highlighted Barbara Stanwyck's special combination of grittiness and vulnerability, making her an overnight sensation. He coaxed Gary Cooper into two of his finest performances, as Longfellow Deeds and John Doe. He changed Jean Arthur from an anxiety-ridden contract player into a feisty leading lady. He molded Jimmy Stewart into Jimmy Stewart. His actors understood what he did for them. "I just had complete confidence in Frank Capra," Mr. Stewart said. "I always had, from the very first day I worked with him. . . . I just hung on every word Frank Capra said."
Jimmy Stewart had cause to be doubly grateful to Capra. Following his military service as a pilot in World War II, the actor's future was in doubt, and he was thinking of quitting Hollywood. Capra, just back from the Army, where he had produced a celebrated series of propaganda films called "Why We Fight," revived Mr. Stewart's career by casting him in "It's a Wonderful Life." It was Capra's first postwar movie. It was also the last significant picture he directed -- and while it may now be Capra's most popular movie, television's very own Christmas chestnut, it was, Mr. McBride tells us, a box-office disappointment at the time of its release.
Though Capra's film making stretched into the 1960's, the remainder of his work consisted of formulaic exercises and remakes of earlier films, banal star vehicles and clinkers pure and simple. His was, says Mr. McBride, "the most precipitous decline of any American film maker since D. W. Griffith."
One can glean a host of reasons for the collapse from the last 150 pages of Mr. McBride's text. Capra himself blamed Hollywood's lower budgets and standards. Jimmy Stewart thought the problem was the change in the industry after the big studios lost power. Another co-worker noted that Capra seemed more anxious after World War II. Certainly he was more closed-minded, no longer the sounding board for his colleagues' ideas that he had been in the 30's. Instead of collaborating with his writers, now he was interested in grabbing most of the credit for himself.
One critic, William S. Pechter, believed that Capra had nothing more to say in his films. "It's a Wonderful Life," he argued, should logically have ended with the hero's suicide; the intervention of a guardian angel was a mask for Capra's deep pessimism about his fellow Americans, and revealed his intellectual bankruptcy. Mr. McBride talks about a lack of courage, especially after the Red scare of the late 40's and early 50's took hold. Any and all of these explanations can serve, but together they add up to the fact that Capra was very much a man of his time and the times had passed him by.
Mr. McBride's account of the last years is grueling and terribly sad. Capra found it increasingly difficult to secure work. He managed to direct only three features in the 1950's, and his last film was the egregious "Pocketful of Miracles" in 1961, a remake of his 1933 success "Lady for a Day." One sign of Capra's desperation in these years was his offer to direct an episode of the television show "The Addams Family." Another was his idea for a movie on the life of St. Paul -- starring Frank Sinatra. He suffered from debilitating headaches and was often suicidal. Though his first wife and many of his closest collaborators, including Harry Cohn and Robert Riskin, were Jewish, he now began blaming the Jews for his troubles. He finally retired from film making in 1966 and devoted the next several years to writing his autobiography. "The Name Above the Title" was published in 1971, and appears to have been a lie practically from beginning to end. "Frank Capra" is in one sense a 768-page corrective to the false impressions it gave.
Amazingly, Capra hung on for another two decades. When he died last year at the age of 94, he had been out of the movie business for 25 years. He had not made a major motion picture for 45 years. No doubt many people who saw his obituary were taken aback, believing he had died long before. The truth is, he had.
 
 
 
BETWEEN THE IMAGE AND THE MAN
 Joseph McBride was on an assignment for Variety when he first met Frank Capra in 1975 at a country club near Palm Springs, Calif. The director, he recalled, "was telling me how he hated rich people. And right in the middle a man from the country club came over and said, 'Frank, here are the pictures of you playing golf with President Ford,' and Capra said, 'Ah, wonderful.' "
Capra looked at the photographs for a moment and then asked, "Where was I? Oh yeah, I was telling you that I've always had a hatred of rich people," Mr. McBride said by telephone from his home in Los Angeles. "Then he just continued, without losing a beat. That illuminated something for me about Capra: there was a contradiction between the image and the man."
In 1982, Mr. McBride wrote a celebration of that image, the television script for "The American Film Institute Salute to Frank Capra." During that assignment, he discovered more contradictions in the Capra myth. In 1984 he started working on "Frank Capra," his 11th book.
Capra was happy to help, the 44-year-old Mr. McBride said. "I'm very grateful to him." But the director's stroke in 1985 made further cooperation impossible.
Some members of Capra's family and film crew also cooperated. They "clearly felt very hurt by his autobiography," Mr. McBride recounted, "and they were more than willing to open up and tell me anything that I needed to know. If he had only given people more credit, they would have been better disposed toward him."
Nonetheless, Mr. McBride said, "I still think he's a great director, and I still respond to the same things in his films -- the energy and the idealism mixed with disillusionment." -- JOSEPH A. CINCOTTI

HEADLINE: The Curse of the Statehouse

BYLINE: By Robert Reinhold; Robert Reinhold is chief of the Los Angeles bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:
It is not unusual for Pete Wilson, the Governor of California, to stay up half the night writing speeches at the Governor's residence in Sacramento while state workers sleep. And according to his wife, Gayle, he toiled until 4 in the morning before his address to Stanford University's centennial convocation last Oct. 1. This was no routine speech, because it was his first major public appearance after vetoing a bill giving homosexuals state protection against discrimination in the work place.
Feeling betrayed that the centrist Republican Governor had vetoed the bill after signaling he would sign it, enraged gay protesters in San Francisco had smashed up a state building a day earlier. The Governor's security people urged him to cancel, but he went to Stanford anyway, scarcely looking up while delivering his 15-minute speech against a thunderous barrage of shouts from 300 demonstrators straining against police lines. At one point, an orange flew out of the crowd toward the podium. Wilson reached up, caught it and threw it back. Tense bodyguards hustled Gayle Wilson out of the area. When it was over, George Raine, a political correspondent for The San Francisco Examiner, sought out the Governor and found him shaken, his pale-blue eyes moist with tears. 
 It was a rare moment of public emotion for the Governor, a man of measured actions and methodical habits who spends his entire 12-hour days at the state Capitol without taking off the jacket of his gray pin-striped suit. It was also yet another sign that all had not gone according to plan for Wilson, who had abandoned a safe seat in the United States Senate two years ago to run for Governor of the nation's largest state.
Wilson came to office 16 months ago amid high hopes and expectations -- with a reputation as a pragmatic conciliator and consensus builder who could bring changes to a troubled state and a virtually paralyzed state government. National Republican leaders had their own agenda for the new Wilson administration: to prevent California's Democrats from controlling reapportionment in the state, which, after the November elections, will hold roughly one of every eight seats in Congress.
Now it might be said that at age 58, after more than a quarter of a century in public life, Pete Wilson has the job he always wanted -- but at the wrong time.
Through most of his career, Wilson was seen as the quintessential Republican moderate, a fiscal conservative who favored "choice" on abortion, while keeping lines open to environmental, Jewish, women's, gay and other groups often at odds with traditional Republican thinking. He himself prefers to be called a conservative, though a "compassionate" one. Either way, after just a few months in office last year, he was widely touted by national publications as a top Presidential contender in 1996.
But the question, for now at least, is not whether Pete Wilson will run for President of the United States but whether he can survive more than one term as Governor of California.
Economic and political realities have blunted his goals. The combined forces of recession and cutbacks in military spending have plunged California into its worst economic slump since the Depression. Wilson himself opened a large fissure within his own party last year when he allied himself with the Democrats in the State Assembly to raise $7.3 billion in new taxes to help close a staggering $14.3 billion budget gap -- more than a third of the state's entire budget and the largest in the history of any American state. He has since alienated the Democrats also, already unhappy about his backing of a voter initiative that limited the terms of state legislators, by besting them on reapportionment.
By mid-March of this year, according to the California Poll, Wilson's job-performance rating had slid to the lowest point of any Governor in 30 years, with only 22 percent giving him excellent or good marks. This contrasted with 43 percent for his Republican predecessor, George Deukmejian Jr.; 53 percent for the last Democrat, Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., and 42 percent for Ronald Reagan, at comparable points in their administrations. "He's dodging grenades from left and right," says Dan Walters, the veteran political columnist for The Sacramento Bee. "This illustrates how difficult it is for a centrist to govern when dealing with polarized elements. People in the middle have no natural base."
WILSON'S TRAVAILS demonstrate how difficult it has become to govern the states, where the domestic problems that have taken second billing in Washington for more than a decade have come home to roost. Probably nowhere does this take more dramatic form than California, where vast immigration has swelled the population to more than 30 million. Since August 1990, the once-booming state has lost 690,000 jobs (or 1 in every 20), many of them high-paying positions in the stricken aerospace and defense industries. Over the last year, unemployment has run well above the national average, standing at 8.5 percent in March. The Los Angeles Aerospace Task Force recently estimated that 210,000 more jobs will be lost in the Los Angeles area by 1995 as a result of defense cutbacks. Commercial construction fell by 37 percent in 1991, and retail sales dropped by 3.4 percent from last year during the crucial November-December period.
This slump has unmasked severe fiscal problems that have been building in California since 1978. That was the year a tax revolt led to the passage of Proposition 13, which limited local governments' taxing authority and thereby shifted the main burden of providing services to the state. Later ballot measures further handcuffed the Governor and Legislature by guaranteeing minimum funds for public schools and other programs. Also, Congress has repeatedly imposed responsibilities on the states -- for Medicaid, welfare and other programs -- without necessarily financing them; in all, $1.4 billion of California's current general fund of $43.8 billion goes for such Federal mandates. The problems created by all this were disguised by the unrelenting economic growth of the 1980's, when it seemed as if the state were immune to national ups and downs, and revenues grew regularly by as much as 8 percent a year.
But now the Governor and the Legislature face fiscal problems of terrifying proportions. Wilson's proposed $60.2 billion budget for 1993 looked hopeless by late last month. The Commission on State Finance estimates that revenues will fall short of proposed spending by as much as $11 billion.
The prolonged drought, the San Francisco earthquake, the Oakland fire, the crop freeze, the whitefly infestation and other natural calamities have added to the state's burdens, not to mention such chronic ailments as traffic congestion, poor schools, high crime and smog. The major bond-rating agencies have downgraded California's credit rating, and some economists argue that California has begun a long decline from which recovery will be difficult. Economic stagnation, however, appears to have done little to slow population growth. Last year, the population increased by 670,000, nearly half of it from migration from other states and foreign countries. This increase further strained schools, welfare, public health and other entitlement programs. California has 12 percent of the American population, but bears 26 percent of the welfare burden.
"California was supposedly the bellwether for the nation, a model for others," says Mervin D. Field, director of the California Poll. "But now its problems are as large as the promise once was. The constraints on the Governor and Legislature are greater now than they've ever been."
ON A GLORIOUS SUNNY LATE-WINTER day in Sacramento, the grounds around the state Capitol are lush with vegetation that speaks to California's great diversity and wealth: towering ponderosa pines, Mexican fan palms, rows of elegantly manicured Irish yews, leafy citrus trees dripping with Valencia oranges. In a first-floor corner office behind a wall of bright red camellia blossoms, Peter Barton Wilson, 36th Governor of California, greets a visitor in the room from which Ronald Reagan, Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. and George Deukmejian ran the state. After 24 years of leadership under these men, during which many festering problems went neglected, the time would seem to have come for a pragmatic "hands on" technician of government like Wilson, a former Mayor of San Diego.
Wilson says he has always preferred the executive role to the legislative. "I have held both," he says. "The executive is much more challenging, much more demanding, much more satisfying. I came back to this job, if not knowing the full dimensions, at least knowing that it was not an easy job."
A close friend of Wilson's, Stuart Spencer, a Republican strategist, had strongly urged him not to run for Governor. "Stu sat down with me and said, 'Go ahead, you hard head,' " Wilson recalls. " 'You will do what you want to do, but I think being Governor of any major state is a terrible responsibility. The states have become ungovernable, and California may be the most of all.'
"Well, I don't buy the fact that it's ungovernable, that you cannot make change. I didn't come back here to wear a boutonniere or to cap off a resume. I came back intending to make change. I made the decision some years ago not to practice law and not to make money. This is a job I wanted for some time. In terms of challenges, it offers a great deal more now than it has to any of my predecessors."
Wilson is not alone as a Governor facing fiscal problems. Like many Republicans, Wilson attributes many of the states' ills to the "built-in autopilot spending" of Congress, of which he was a member for eight years and which he contends "distorts and reorders state priorities and state spending." He makes no mention of the fact that another Republican Governor of California, Ronald Reagan, was the architect of the new federalism, which shifted much of the load onto the states.
Still, Wilson is the most active Governor the Capitol has seen in years, and he has brought to the table the most ambitious set of programs since the heyday of California's great builder, Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown.
At the top of his agenda is a "preventive" government program meant to redirect some of the money being spent on "remedial programs" like welfare toward prenatal and early childhood care, to address what he calls "the default" of parental responsibility. He speaks often of infants born with crack addiction and the effects of fetal alcohol syndrome.
Another top priority is to reverse what he sees as a drastic deterioration of California's economic competitiveness and business climate, by lowering such barriers as a costly, fraud-ridden workers' compensation system for injuries. ("Most of the disabilities under which employers labor in this state have been imposed either by acts of the Legislature or local government," he says. "And there has been an attitude of arrogance, that we were irresistible to business.")
Wilson has also called for a revamping of the state's welfare system, whose caseloads have been growing at four times the rate of population growth and which he says is crowding out crucial health and educational programs. He would cut welfare grants by 10 percent overall, and add incentives to get families off welfare, like a 15 percent reduction after six months, except when the adult is disabled or too old to work, and a $50 monthly increase for teen-age parents who remain in school.
He has coupled these changes with a proposal to give the Governor sweeping new budget powers, a proposal he hopes to steer around the Legislature by placing it on the November ballot as a voter initiative. If passed, it would give the Governor the power to reduce government salaries and spending if the Legislature does not pass a budget acceptable to him by July 1, and then later declare fiscal emergencies if the budget becomes unbalanced, allowing him again to reduce spending unless the Legislature enacts its own plan within 30 days.
Wilson has also offered the outlines of a new long-range water policy, meant to alleviate shortages in some areas and repair environmental damage by various means, including the politically controversial concept of creating a freer market in water so that it can be transferred to cities and other areas of need.
And he has opened an emotionally charged debate by contending California is caught in "a population squeeze," its coffers drained by growth in school-age children, welfare recipients and other tax "receivers," caused in part by huge immigration, while older, working-age residents who pay the taxes are increasingly leaving the state. Critics argue, and Wilson vigorously denies, he is trying to scapegoat the poor and foreign for the state's ills.
Whatever the merits of Wilson's proposals, budget constraints have made it all but impossible to do much for now, and it is difficult to discern a consistent Wilson ideology. "I know Jack Kemp's views, I know Dick Cheney's," says one leading California Republican who has supported Wilson for 25 years and spoke on the condition of anonymity. "But I don't know Pete Wilson's. He is pro-choice on abortion, but if the majority of the public became pro-life, would he become pro-life? I don't know."
Almost from the beginning of his political career as an assemblyman, then later as a mayor and senator, Wilson has been called by political observers the consummate politician, paddling left, then right, just enough to keep his political canoe closest to both sides of the stream. "His recent rightward tilt is explained by the fact that he's in serious trouble with the people who elected him," says the Republican.
Wilson maintains that such accusations are "flatly contradicted" by his record in politics. "I have very consistently been a fiscal conservative," he says. "I have been recognized for good stewardship, for being tight with the taxpayers' dollars. The sole dereliction in that respect was the tax increase last year, and it was compelled by the Constitution and the inability of the Legislature to come to grips with deeper cuts."
When Wilson came to Sacramento as Governor last year, he was welcomed by both Republicans and Democrats, many of whom had become frustrated after eight years of the dour Governor Deukmejian. At the outset, Wilson seemed to do all the right things. Reaching out for bipartisan support, he did the unthinkable, for a Republican: he met with the Democratic caucuses of the Democratic-controlled Legislature, went to Assembly Speaker Willie L. Brown Jr.'s parties and showed up at Brown's office without staff. Senator David A. Roberti of Hollywood, the President pro tem of the State Senate, recalls getting a call from the Governor last summer amid the budget frenzy. Wilson did not want to discuss the fiscal crisis, Roberti says, slapping his forehead in amazement, but rather Norplant, the implanted birth-control device. The Governor wanted government family-planning programs to make it available to impoverished women of childbearing age.
Aided by the Democrats, Wilson finally got a budget last summer, with a painful mix of new taxes, fees and spending cuts. In the fractious Assembly, Speaker Brown delivered nearly every Democrat for Wilson, while the Governor, who had alienated his party's own right wing, could muster only 9 of the 31 Republicans on the crucial tax votes. The national news media portrayed Wilson as a hero; in California, his popularity nose-dived.
That was just the beginning of Wilson's ordeal. Many in Sacramento trace the Governor's troubles in large measure to the loss of Otto Bos. A former newspaper reporter who had joined Wilson when he was Mayor of San Diego, the Dutch-born Bos was not only his director of public affairs but one of his closest advisers and friends. The tall, jovial Bos, well liked and admired for his political savvy by both Republicans and Democrats, was a master at image building, and had a gift for anticipating the public relations consequences of political acts. For Wilson, he was also a keen set of eyes and ears on the world. While playing soccer on a fine Sunday afternoon in San Diego last June 2, Bos collapsed and died of a heart attack at the age of 47.
It is impossible to say for sure if Bos could have prevented his old friend's current plight, but after his death Wilson inflicted a number of wounds on himself. His handling of the gay-rights-bill veto illustrates this. Wilson had told a group of newspaper editors that he would "very likely" sign the bill, similar to one vetoed by Deukmejian. But instead he surprised everyone, including many of his own staff, by issuing a detailed, lawyerly veto message that said the state Constitution and various existing state laws and regulations already conferred adequate protection on homosexuals. Critics said he was pandering to the right wing still seething over his new taxes. The Governor was shocked by the furious reaction. In the end, his stand lost him many of the liberals and moderates who had voted for him, while doing little to shore up his right flank.
Then came the embarrassing episode following his State of the State Address in January. In an apparent effort to counter suggestions he was out of touch with people, he inserted into the speech three unnamed Californians he said he had met who were suffering from the recession. Wilson found himself ridiculed nationally when reporters asked for the names of the men, only to be told they were "allegorical" by his press office.
Wilson may have also misjudged the Sacramento he returned to after a two-dec ade absence. (He had been an Assemblyman from San Diego for six years.) Some say he took a myopic Washington view when he brought in most of his Senate staff, who tended to look down on the Legislature and the Sacramento press corps. To rectify this, he recently added three top deputies familiar with Sacramento politics: Bill Hauck, George Dunn and Joe Shumate.
But Wilson now faces an antagonistic Legislature. Many members resent him for supporting the successful 1990 voter initiative that imposed tight term limits on both houses (a measure that would sweep out the current Senate within eight years, the Assembly in six) and has already cut staff budgets by 40 percent. Wilson made even fewer friends when he vetoed three Democratic-drawn plans for reapportionment as gerrymandering, and asked the California Supreme Court to take over the process. A panel of retired judges appointed by the court ignored existing districts, forcing incumbents into a mad scramble. Even the powerful Senator Roberti found himself redrawn out of his seat in Hollywood and forced to take a second residence in the less-liberal San Fernando Valley to survive. "Things went south with the leadership on reapportionment," says Bob White, the Governor's chief of staff, warning that his boss is a "dogged" fighter who will not easily by beaten. "Pete Wilson has always been underestimated."
 IN ALL THIS, WILSON HAS remained, as Ronald Brownstein of The Los Angeles Times once put it, "smooth and cool and opaque, like a stone in a river." The Governor views the collapse of his popularity with a mixture of resignation and determination. "It obviously does not please me, nor does it surprise me," he says, adding that he found the public "schizophrenic" about the dire budget situation, at once outraged over the new taxes but unwilling to accept deep cuts in social programs. He waves off questions about Presidential ambitions with a standard answer that he is more concerned now with being a good Governor.
Throughout his career, Wilson has brought less the passion of an ideologue than the relentlessness of a workaholic, the obsessiveness of a perfectionist. Born in Illinois, Wilson, the son of an advertising salesman, grew up in St. Louis, attended the fashionable St. Louis Country Day School and then Yale, where he majored in English literature and graduated in 1955. He came to California as a Marine infantry officer, stationed at Coronado, near San Diego.
After discharge, he attended law school at Boalt Hall at the University of California at Berkeley, graduating in 1962, then got involved in Republican politics, working as an advance man for the failed gubernatorial campaign of Richard Nixon that year. He then gravitated to San Diego and, finally passing the bar exam after three failed attempts, practiced law there for a couple of years before running for State Assembly, winning a seat in 1966 at age 33. He rose quickly into the Republican leadership in the Assembly, but left to run successfully for Mayor of San Diego in 1971 and again in 1975. In 1978, he made a stab at the Republican gubernatorial nomination, but ran fourth in a field of five in the primary -- rejected as too liberal, by California Republican standards, for having backed Gerald Ford over Ronald Reagan in the 1976 Presidential race and for opposing the tax-cutting Proposition 13 that year.
He did not give up. After winning a third term as Mayor in 1979, he won the Republican nomination for United States Senator in 1982, and ploddingly outdistanced his Democratic rival, Jerry Brown. He won re-election in 1988, with the largest vote in California history, and then two years later beat out the flashy Democratic nominee for Governor, former Mayor Dianne Feinstein of San Francisco, in a whisker-thin victory.
If friends and foes agree on anything, it is that Pete Wilson is the hardest-working, most diligent and tenacious Governor that California has seen in modern memory. Wilson's aides run ragged late into most nights, as well as most weekends. "Whether one agrees with him or not, he has brought to the job more sheer energy and tenacity than I've ever seen in a public official," says Steven A. Merksamer, Deukmejian's former chief of staff. "He's a bulldog and a workhorse. He may be down, but he can never be written off."
Thomas W. Hayes, the Governor's director of finance, recalls Wilson's presentation of his first budget last year. Normally, the Governor presents an overview, then leaves, allowing the experts to explain the details to the press. As the briefing progressed, Hayes remembers, "I got a bruise on my arm, and the Governor knocked me off the podium." Wilson remained for an hour and a half, answering the most complicated questions. Another high-ranking official recalls trying to brief Wilson on the welfare issue. "I was supposed to be explaining the program to him," he says. "But here he was explaining it to me."
Wilson typically comes home late, has a cocktail (Scotch and water or gin and tonic) before dinner and then stays up late reading briefing papers. Even his leisure reading tends to be laden with policy content. Among the titles on his bed stand recently were "We Must Take Charge: The Schools and Our Future," by Chester E. Finn Jr., the neoconservative critic of teachers and schools; "The Content of Our Character: A New Vision of Race in America," by Shelby Steele, the conservative black scholar who argues that it is time for blacks to cease thinking of themselves as victims, and, in apparent preparation for California's first scheduled execution since 1967, "Public Justice, Private Mercy: A Governor's Education on Death Row," former Governor Edmund G. (Pat) Brown's 1989 book (with Dick Adler) on the dilemmas he faced in granting clemency appeals.
Indeed, according to the Governor's staff, the appeal on behalf of the condemned murderer Robert Alton Harris produced one of the most wrenching episodes of the Wilson administration. Though long an advocate of the death penalty, Wilson was presented with a difficult predicament in Harris's case. In 1978, while Wilson was Mayor of San Diego, Harris had committed the most heinous of crimes, shooting two teen-age boys to death in cold blood to cover up a robbery, then calmly eating the hamburgers the two boys had just bought. Yet Harris was also a victim of fetal alcohol syndrome and had a vicious father who beat him -- the very forms of prenatal and childhood abuse that Wilson has been combating. On the evening of April 16, Wilson rejected Harris's clemency appeal, saying he had compassion for Harris the child but that Harris the man was still responsible for his conduct. Even critics of capital punishment agreed that Wilson had diligently studied the case, as well as the scientific evidence about fetal alcohol syndrome. Harris went to his death in the gas chamber at San Quentin on April 21.
Despite the pace he sets for himself, friends say Wilson can relax. A dry wit, he invents limericks and is a superb impressionist, particularly of his former colleague in the Senate, Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. Though his voice is not great, he is not shy about performing at roasts and functions, delighting a high-powered audience last month at a dinner at the Beverly Hilton Hotel celebrating his 25th year in politics with a song-and-dance routine in a straw hat. He rises early for workouts on the Stairmaster Gravitron or on the treadmill at the Governor's residence, where he lives with his second wife, Gayle Wilson, and one of her two sons from a previous marriage. "This is a guy who gets up ready to go to work," says Gayle. "He's happy."
But Wilson cannot be entirely happy about the turn of events in Sacramento this year. Not least is the very personal and poisonous feud that has broken out with Speaker Brown.
FROM THE GOVERNOR'S ground-floor corner office, the axis of power runs to the opposite corner of the domed Capitol, upstairs on the second floor. There, amid the splendor of Victorian furniture and massive floral displays, presides Willie Brown, the second most powerful man in California, nearly 28 years in the Assembly, the last 11 as Speaker. He is determined to destroy Wilson politically.
One of the shrewdest politicians in America, Brown could hardly offer a sharper contrast to the blond, button-down Yalie Governor. Born in 1934, just seven months after Wilson, Brown, the son of a black Pullman porter in rural Mineola, Tex., came to California as a youth and worked his way through college and law school as a doorman, janitor and shoe salesman; unlike Wilson, he passed the bar exam on his first try. While the Governor's favorite pastime is barbecuing chicken for friends, Brown is an aficionado of fast cars and $1,500 Italian double-breasted suits.
After initially playing ball with Wilson, Brown has already this year opposed the creation of a new Office of Child Development and Education -- one of the Governor's top priorities -- dueled him on the budget, stalled key appointments and snubbed the the Governor's party after the State of the State Address in January. "I certainly wouldn't want to use whatever free time I might have to be with him," Brown told reporters.
"I think he hopes ultimately to get elected to the Presidency," says Brown. "But the first step is to get rid of Willie Brown, David Roberti, the Democratic majority in both houses, the influence the Legislature has on public-policy making in California. Period. And I think those five things constitute his menu, his recipe, ultimately propelling himself into the national spotlight as the Governor from the biggest state in the union who controlled welfare, changed the face of California politically on a partisan basis. That's his goal.
"I feel betrayed," Brown continues. "I agreed to cut my constituency for the solution to the budget problem last year. I cut welfare. I have a history of working closer with governors than probably any other Speaker ever. Wilson has been the only one I've worked with who is totally political in every one of his decisions. Reagan was not, Jerry Brown was not, Deukmejian wasn't in any of his decisions. None of the other three had such an overriding ambition for themselves personally and for their party. If this guy were up for election today, he'd be defeated. Get-even time will be November 1994, when he's retired, when his term is limited to one."
Senator Roberti, while less strident, is no fan of Wilson's either. "To win back the right wing, the Governor has sharpened his political attack on Democrats," he says. "The net effect now is that the Democrats are mad at him, and he has not won over the right." To support his point, he cites the words of Patrick J. Buchanan, who had just brought his Republican Presidential campaign to the steps of the State Capitol with a blast at Wilson. "Your party has been abandoned by Mr. Wilson," Buchanan, campaigning for the June 2 primary, told the crowd,
To all this, Wilson responds that he is determined to remake the Legislature. "If the only way to make change around here is to change the composition of the Legislature, I'm prepared to see that happen," he says. "The only real grounds they have for unhappiness is reapportionment. They had experienced the bonanza that had flowed from the flagrant gerrymander 10 years before. I am not going to pay tribute."
Wilson will say only that he wants a Republican majority. But as Roberti says, "If he believes a Republican majority will be helpful, he's hallucinating." The key, according to Wilson's political operatives, is to bring in more centrist Republicans, and redistricting has created more marginal districts likely to produce moderate candidates from both parties. In addition, three of the most conservative Republicans in the Assembly, William Baker, Tom McClintock and Phillip Wyman (part of a group of 15 or so "cavemen," as they are called in Sacramento), are running for Congress this year. With about two dozen of the 80 Assembly members leaving and others struggling in new districts, the November election is destined to bring about the biggest legislative turnover in years.
Fortunately for Wilson, he will not have to run for re-election until 1994. But he faces what may be a bigger hurdle within the next few months -- getting a new state budget. All sides agree there can be no more taxes this year, so still-deeper cuts in spending must be made -- cuts that are sure to hasten the decline of California's fine universities, public schools, parks, freeways and other "infrastructure" essential to economic recovery. Wilson and the Assembly are heading for a possibly calamitous shutdown of state services if no agreement is reached within a few weeks after the new fiscal year begins on July 1. The Democrats say this is exactly what Wilson wants, so that he can blame the Legislature for the resulting disarray and help push incumbents out in November. But the gamble is, the public is apt to hold Wilson accountable too.
Against this backdrop, Wilson faces another high-stakes political gamble over the welfare-cutting initiative he has mounted for the November ballot. Of every dollar spent under the California budget, 45 cents goes to primary and secondary education and 32 cents to health and welfare. Education should not touched, Wilson argues, because it is essential to rebuilding economic competitiveness, and he has targeted welfare. These proposed welfare cuts are called cruel by such opponents as California's two top Roman Catholic clergy, Roger Cardinal Mahony of Los Angeles and Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco, as well as Jewish, Lutheran and other religious leaders.
Besides cutting welfare payments, the Taxpayer Protection Act, as Wilson dubs it, would endow the Governor with major new budgetary powers. It would authorize him to declare an emergency if no budget is approved by July 1, under which he could cut by up to 5 percent the salaries of state workers not covered by union agreements. It would also empower him to declare fiscal emergencies and cut spending whenever spending and revenues are more than 3 percent out of whack.
This bid for increased budget authority has enraged many legislators as a "power grab," and the Democratic leadership has sought to undermine it by passing its own welfare cuts. This would strip the initiative of its welfare component, turning it solely into a vote on whether to shift the balance of power in Sacramento to the Governor -- in effect, a public referendum on Wilson's performance.
"It is a big gamble," says one top Wilson aide. "He either wins it or serves only one term."

HEADLINE: CLASSICAL MUSIC;
Muti: Arrivederci, Not Addio

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
When Riccardo Muti takes the stage of Carnegie Hall tomorrow evening to conduct works by Cherubini and Rossini, it will be the latest in a long series of goodbyes. The concert marks his last performance in the United States as music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra. And after leading a tour through Europe and Israel later this month, the 50-year-old maestro will turn his energies toward guest conducting and his duties as head of La Scala Opera in Milan, a two-hour trip (at the breakneck speed he drives) from his home in Ravenna, Italy.
For a dozen years he has held the Philadelphia post, which he inherited from Eugene Ormandy and will relinquish to Wolfgang Sawallisch. For eight years before that, he was a guest conductor of the orchestra. He suffered occasional barbs that his approach, particularly in vocal music, was rigid and dogmatic, and some complained that he did away with the plush "Philadelphia sound" made famous under Ormandy. Mr. Muti leaves with one of his major goals frustratingly unfulfilled, the realization of a new concert hall in which the orchestra could perform and record. 
 Yet his tenure has in almost every other respect been a resounding success. An exacting and sometimes withering commander on the podium, he earned the respect and admiration of his orchestra, almost half of which he appointed. He also won the affection of most of a Philadelphia public notoriously slow to embrace change. And the change from the staid Ormandy, whose personality mirrored the city's own, to Mr. Muti could hardly have been more radical.
Philadelphia was Ormandy's home. In a real sense, it never became Mr. Muti's, even though he spent more weeks conducting here than many music directors of major orchestras spend with their ensembles. He lived in a furnished apartment next to the Academy of Music, the orchestra's longtime hall, ate nearby and made no bones about the fact that his heart was in Italy.
But as his English improved and he accustomed himself to American ways, he tempered the severe image he had crafted for the role of music director, which masked personal warmth and a wicked sense of humor (aimed in private at critics and other musical hangers-on). Nowadays Mr. Muti seems cheerful and contented, and not at all the dour, unsmiling young autocrat that skeptics called him when he arrived. He has become an impassioned and eloquent spokesman for music and for the musical health of the city.
"I feel loved by the people here -- not by everybody -- but in general," he said recently after a performance of Shostakovich and Martucci, having been stopped several times to sign autographs at dinner and on the street. "The enthusiasm of Philadelphians is very important to me."
Especially against the backdrop of the erratic New York Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta, the cultivated, prismatic sound and precise ensemble playing that Mr. Muti fostered in his players also won over New York audiences during the Philadelphians' frequent visits to Carnegie and Avery Fisher Hall. The orchestra had grown shoddy in the waning years of Ormandy's tenure. Mr. Muti instilled discipline and fostered versatility. He insisted there should be no such thing as a single Philadelphia sound.
In the last years of Ormandy's reign, the orchestra served up week in and week out Romantic standards to a complacent Philadelphia public. Under Mr. Muti it regularly stretched out into contemporary music, increasingly by American composers, into early music and to the distant corners of the Italian repertory that is especially dear to the conductor.
He has recorded some of the central German repertory, like the Brahms symphonies. But this was never his strength, and he has wisely concentrated much of his energy both in concert and in the studio on material that accentuates his ability to elicit color and virtuosic excitement from the players. He leaves behind outstanding recordings not only of Italian music but also of the works of Shostakovich, Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev and other Russian composers. As he himself points out, the orchestra "does not impress through loudness, but it has a human, distinctive sound that I don't think has been conveyed through records, because we record on a basketball court."
Perhaps most significant, Mr. Muti has converted the Philadelphians to opera, and the orchestra's annual operas in concert became high points of the musical seasons both here and in New York. He conducted Gluck and Verdi, Wagner, Puccini and Leoncavallo. Particularly in the hothouse environment of an opera in concert, Mr. Muti's firm grip on the singers and orchestra stood out in relief. He has heard countless times the complaints that he dominates the singers, but at their frequent best his performances had a combination of refinement and coherence and overarching shape that was the strongest rebuttal.
"I believe in a stylistic unity for a performance," he said. "At the same time I of course realize that the conductor must not kill the individuality of the performer. But in Italy the perception is just the opposite -- that I should be praised for exercising control."
Mr. Muti is understandably proud of what opera has done for the orchestra. "It can now perform brilliantly an opera of Puccini, when 15 years ago it didn't know what an opera was," he said. Mr. Ormandy disdained opera, and his attitude spread among Philadelphians. "I remember the resistance of some people, even on the board, who didn't think opera was first-class music," Mr. Muti recalled. "But now the attitude is completely different."
Mr. Muti is a man accustomed to getting his way, whether it involves players, audiences or recording companies. Aghast that latecomers treated concerts as social events and regularly delayed the start of orchestra performances, he started precisely on schedule, and audiences learned to adjust.
But about one key issue, Mr. Muti failed to sway the public. He insists that his departure has nothing to do with the striking failure of the orchestra, the city's most glamorous cultural institution, to muster support for a new hall, a design for which has already been completed by the architect Robert Venturi for a site a block south of the Academy.
Since announcing his departure in 1990, Mr. Muti has become an even more outspoken advocate for the project, pleading with the city and the orchestra's board to "wake up" to the need for modern performing facilities. He points out that the Vienna Philharmonic, which he will lead on an American tour in 1994, refuses to play in the Academy because of its acoustics. His case was further buoyed recently by a study that ranked Philadelphia 15th out of 15 cities in terms of the number of performances, tickets sold and seats available for performing-arts events. Numerous local and visiting organizations must jostle for what little time is not taken up in the Academy by the orchestra.
"I am concerned that the future of the orchestra is based very much on its competition with other great orchestras through modern media," Mr. Muti explained. "Concerts will be a part of the future, of course, but already you have the possibility to see orchestras from all over the world by pushing a button on your television. Orchestras like Berlin and Vienna are working hard on high technology, and laser disks are a reality. If Philadelphia is not part of this group, the musicians will certainly start to feel frustrated. And it is possible that at some point the quality of their playing will suffer."
Complaints about the brutally dry acoustics of the 135-year-old hall date back to the days of Leopold Stokowski. But Ormandy did not complain, and Mr. Muti has had to fight against a local myth that this hall is an acoustic wonder. In a tradition-bound city, the Philadelphia Orchestra in the beautiful and ornate Academy of Music is one of the proudest traditions.
It has not helped Mr. Muti's cause that the orchestra was perceived as arrogant by local donors in its expectation of contributions and its domination of a plan that is supposed to benefit many local performing-arts groups. Nor has it helped that the city, like much of the country, is in an economic slump, although the Philadelphia Art Museum managed to raise tens of millions of dollars for its endowment at the same time that the orchestra raised less than $24 million toward its goal of $90 million. Now that the orchestra has agreed to share responsibility for a new hall with a civic group that is planning a large-scale arts complex, there is renewed hope that the project may yet be realized.
Mr. Muti becomes conductor laureate of the orchestra and will return next season for four weeks, including two concerts in New York. He says he does not seek to become music director elsewhere. "Philadelphia will forever be my orchestra in my heart," he insisted. "I feel I have done a lot here, but now it's time to do more for my own country."

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY VIEW;
Images of Catastrophe as Corporate Ballyhoo

BYLINE: By Vicki Goldberg; Vicki Goldberg is the author of "The Power of Photography: How Photographs Changed Our Lives."

 BODY:
As everyone over 5 must know by now, Benetton has been appropriating the news for its ads. In March, Vogue rudely slapped six pages of the company's ads between beauty creams and luxe: three double-page spreads of a bombed-out car ablaze in the street, Albanian refugees climbing desperately onto a packed ship, and a young man dying of AIDS in his father's arms.
In last month's issue of Interview, an Indian couple waded through a flood for Benetton; in Vanity Fair and Details, refugees scrambled into a boxcar and an armed soldier held a large bone behind his back. (In Italian publications only, a murdered Mafia victim lay in a pool of blood.) 
 Each picture is stamped with a small green logo saying "United Colors of Benetton." Subjects and locations are not identified, though the world is awash with different varieties of refugees, terrorism and illness. But the images do have tiny captions -- announcing that the latest issue of the company's magazine is available.
Opinion is noisily divided over the propriety of all this, with older age groups reported to be much more opposed than younger ones. Since Albanians, terrorists and bombing victims have no organized constituencies to argue their causes, the chief source of contention is the alleged exploitation of AIDS. Several European and British magazines refused to print the AIDS picture; the British Act Up, like its American counterpart, an AIDS advocacy and protest group, tried to organize an international boycott, but American Act Up was divided on the issue and decided this was not the place to take a stand. No American periodical has censored any of the new campaign, though some balked at earlier Benetton ads with photographs of colored condoms and of a newborn baby still attached to its umbilical cord.
No one fumed when the AIDS photograph was published in an article in Life a year and a half ago; the shock came when Benetton claimed ownership of today's most desperate news by branding it with the company name. The company, which sells clothing in 93 countries, swears that it is only trying to encourage awareness of social problems and of its own cutting-edge, concerned position. Yes, it contributes to charities, including some money for AIDS education in New York. But however pure or impure its motives (and though advertising keeps capitalism perking along, it has seldom been accused of purity), Benetton has given us what we should have expected and probably deserve: images of catastrophe as corporate ballyhoo.
In fact, news and advertising have been inching into each other's territory for years. Political advisers who set up photo ops already understand how photojournalism can be made to serve political ends amounting to unacknowledged public relations. All Benetton has done is to carry several current trends in image reproduction to their logical conclusions.
News photographs wander loose from their moorings all the time. This is partly because they really belong to everyone, copyright notwithstanding. This century's history is encoded in a set of photographic images filed in the mind: Jack Ruby shooting Lee Harvey Oswald, a Chinese dissident holding a hand up to stop a line of tanks. Whole populations have the same mental-image files, which constitute a large part of the common culture. Flashing the key images guarantees instant connection and social commentary; witness Andy Warhol's paintings from photographs of civil rights protests or of Jackie Kennedy mourning.
News imagery is so strong it does not entirely lose its meaning when radically displaced. Journalistic photographs have long been snatched out of journals to hang in museums. Some of James Nachtwey's war reportage from El Salvador at the International Center of Photography in 1989 was too bloody for most publications, but not for art audiences.
If art feels free to borrow news, so does entertainment. Billy Joel's music video "We Didn't Start the Fire" ran through a series of landmark news images. In the movie "Naked Gun 2 1/2," a nightclub that catered to miserable losers was decorated with pictures of events like the Hindenburg explosion and the execution of a Vietcong suspect on a Saigon street. Art, music, film -- Benetton asks, in effect, why not ads?
And indeed, advertising does feed on news photography. Political contests take to it like catnip. In 1964, Lyndon Johnson's Presidential campaign ran a television commercial with a little girl plucking flower petals and counting backwards -- to the image of a nuclear explosion. (Anti-nuclear groups like the explosion film, too.) Bad news also sells insurance and protective organizations like labor unions, which before the current recession used Depression-era pictures to indicate how things had improved.
Manufacturers can turn the familiarity of dire images to their advantage by spoofing them. Kenneth Cole, the shoe company, ran a picture of Gen. Manuel Noriega with the tag line "One heel you definitely won't see at our semi-annual sale." And good news sells anything. At Sherman Grinberg, a New York stock film company, the story is told about a drug manufacturer that ran a film of George Bush shaking hands with Mikhail Gorbachev; the pitch was about the end of the cold war. The White House snuffled a bit and said it was not amused; the drug company pulled the commercial. In December 1989, Pepsi showed video clips of the Berlin wall as it came tumbling down, with no text but "Peace on Earth" and the company logo.
Bad news might not seem like the ideal atmosphere for selling casual clothes of the sort Benetton produces, but fashion has long known how to cohabit with real-world horrors. Vogue published Lee Miller's devastating pictures of concentration camp victims at the end of World War II and, more recently, photographs on subjects like homelessness.
And for a period in the 70's, couturier-designed tragedies became high-fashion chic. Charles Jourdan advertised shoes with Guy Bourdin's photograph of the chalked outline of a body on the highway; a lone shoe lay forlornly beside the drawing. Helmut Newton's photographs of women murdering men illustrated a Oui magazine feature on men's suits -- the last word in drop-dead fashions.
Real news, fashion and advertising live in unnerving proximity anyway. A Benetton calamity is on a page by itself, but a page in a newspaper will have a headline like "Serbs Intensify Sarejevo Attacks; 'Pure Terrorism,' Bosnia Charges" next to a photograph of a sultry model asking you to admire her brassiere and panties. On the evening news, the anchor promises, in a sprightly voice, more information on the Lockerbie plane crash and nuclear dumps, followed by music fit for the Second Coming and a commercial for a miraculously responsive sports car.
More than 20 years ago, the photographer Robert Heinecken montaged opposites like these to make a political point. He superimposed upon ads for stockings and women's razors a picture of a Vietnamese soldier holding up two severed heads, then inserted the new images surreptitiously into fashion magazines on the newsstands. One aspect of Heinecken's message was similar to Benetton's: something terrible is going on out there while you're wondering whether your legs are sufficiently silky. But then he wasn't selling silk.
Most of our news is commercially sponsored; the alternative is government, which most Americans trust even less than advertisers. Unwritten laws decree there should be some separation, however thin, between current history and commerce. But reporting and advertising are becoming increasingly porous categories -- witness that new staple, infotainment -- and the independent identity of the news grows fragile. Sometimes, now, local newscasts include interviews with the condemned criminal whose crimes provided a plot for that evening's docudrama -- a public relations campaign masquerading as news.
Commercials, on the other hand, may camouflage themselves as investigative journalism. Last year, Joan Lunden, co-host of ABC's "Good Morning America," appeared in a Vaseline commercial masquerading as a news program. Behind what looked like an anchor's desk, she delivered what sounded like a soft-news report on skin care. The only meaningful difference between the Benetton campaign and such an attempt to fuse news and advertising is that Benetton is not pretending (except perhaps in its disclaimers). The bombed-out car, the ship and the illness are undeniably news, the logo indisputably an ad.
The photographs do not hawk sweaters, but consumers are quite accustomed to fashion ads that haven't much to do with clothes. In the promotional mini-magazine that Calvin Klein sent out with an issue of Vanity Fair last year, the models seemed much happier when they weren't wearing their Calvins at all. Supposedly the consumer aspires to the life styles: Klein's pouty, pumped-up rock-and-roll; Ralph Lauren's ersatz pukka British; Georges Marciano's bimbo western. Benetton abandons any pretense. This is it, kids: you really live like this, in the middle of an epidemic, with the news coming at you from all sides. Will people now think Benetton the proper apparel to wear to a terrorist bombing?
Many companies today link their products to controversial causes, counting on a newly active group of (mostly younger) consumers who prefer their corporations socially concerned. Their ads ask for money or say whom to call; Benetton merely plunks down its logo atop flood and fire. Abrupt and uncomfortable as this is, it is not really a departure, just a jamming together of goodwill-seeking and new sponsorship. News and brand identification are already only minimally separated every day on public TV when logos like Pepsi's and A.T.& T.'s round off accounts of scandals and collapsing republics on shows like the MacNeil/Lehrer report.
America is already afflicted with what might be called logolalia. Never mind the ads and packaging; people are also walking logos. Some years ago, women of a certain economic stratum stopped wearing their own monograms and started wearing other peoples' -- Chanel, Yves St. Laurent -- in large letters. The advent of the T-shirt as sportswear for the millions transferred a lot of brand-name product ads from the working man's back to others'. How many people have you seen lately whose chests hype the Hard Rock Cafe?
Now images also carry logos. A good number of newspaper photographs of the Persian Gulf war or the William Kennedy Smith trial were marked CNN in the lower right corner. On television, movie scenes suddenly and briefly sprout the letters TNT or TBS, and news clips occasionally bloom with a network trademark: name-brand clothes, entertainment and news.
Whatever its sales potential, the new Benetton campaign has sparked intense discussion about AIDS and about the company itself. The company estimates that with its ads running worldwide and the media covering the controversy, between 500 million and a billion people have seen the AIDS image, far more than ever saw it when it came out in Life. Conceivably, Benetton has created the most up-to-date news venue of all. A public that is reading fewer newspapers and believing fewer broadcasts might begin to swallow tiny doses of information between the ads for liquor and lingerie.
Name recognition counts. Luciano Benetton, founder of the company, ran for senator in last month's election in Italy, and won.

Rail and More In Europe

 BODY:
Passes that combine European rail travel with other forms of transportation are becoming increasingly popular.
One new pass, for travel in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, is called the Scanrail 'n' Drive pass. The pass provides 4 days of unlimited train travel and 3 days' rental of a Hertz car to be used within 15 days; the cost ranges from $225 a person, based on two people traveling together, for second-class rail travel and an economy car, to $295 for first-class rail and intermediate-size car. A pass for 9 days of rail travel and 3 car rental days to be used in 21 days is $319 to $419 a person. A Scanrail Pass, good for unlimited rail travel in the three countries, costs $145 in second class and $179 in first class for four days' use out of 15; $299 and $239 for 9 days out of 21, and $359 for 14 days out of a month. 
 Similar programs are now being offered for Portugal. Three days of rail travel can be combined with three days of car rental from Avis, to be used within one month, for $129 with first-class rail travel (no pass is available for second class) and economy car, up to $189 for a small car with automatic shift; extra days of rail are $20 a person, based on two traveling together. Additional car days are $85 for a small automatic or $40 for economy. Portugal also offers a Flexiplan rail pass, with 4 days' first-class travel out of 15 days costing $89, and 7 out of 21, $139.
The Scandinavian and Portuguese passes are available through Rail Europe, 230 Westchester Avenue, White Plains, N.Y. 10604; (800) 438-7245.
In Austria, a new pass called Bicycle Card for a Day entitles travelers to take their bicycles on some trains and hang them on special fixtures in the car in which they ride. The pass, which costs $3, is good for an unlimited number of uses during the day it is issued and can be used (along with a passenger ticket or rail pass) on regional trains marked in the schedule with a bicycle symbol. Bicycles can be rented for $4.50 a day at about 160 train stations in Austria and can be returned at any station.

HEADLINE: Grand Central Owner Seeks Broader Use Of Air Rights

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
WHILE travelers can no longer reach far-away points from Grand Central Terminal, the owners of the mid-Manhattan landmark envision some distant destinations for its unused development rights.
As the latest step in a real estate struggle that has lasted a quarter of a century, the Penn Central Corporation, which owns the terminal, has proposed a zoning subdistrict from Third to Fifth Avenue, 38th to 48th Street, within which Grand Central's air rights could be transferred to development sites. 
 Penn Central would expand by 29 blocks a smaller Grand Central subdistrict that was proposed last year by the staff of the City Planning Department. The official version is to be considered May 20 by the City Planning Commission.
Meanwhile, in the most obvious sign that the days of long-distance travel have ended at Grand Central, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which leases the terminal, is looking for a restaurateur, grocer or other retailer to take over the newly renovated 12,000-square-foot waiting room on 42d Street.
Separate as they may seem, the zoning and renovation questions are related. The M.T.A., which uses the terminal for its Metro-North Commuter Railroad division, has already spent $71.9 million on repairing and restoring the building and plans to spend $113 million more.
Because the value of these improvements currently accrues to Penn Central, the authority is also pursuing strategies to purchase the building, including possible condemnation. But a deal would depend on what happens to the air rights, which Penn Central calculates at 1.966 million square feet (the equivalent of two Chrysler Buildings). "If the air-rights issue were settled tomorrow, we'd probably be talking with Penn Central on Monday," said Donald N. Nelson, the president of Metro-North.
Penn Central is not satisfied with the city planners' proposal, which it says is too limited and cumbersome. The corporation said that if it cannot disperse the air rights more widely and easily, it will use them to build a tower directly over the terminal "as promptly as possible." The architectural and legal groundwork is already being laid for a tower that would be "in harmony" with the existing Beaux-Arts facade.
"The city and community should not misunderstand Penn Central's resolve," the Cincinnati-based corporation said, "and that is to realize the value of the air rights, which value has been denied it for so long." Given the magnitude of its holdings, and the desirability -- in a better market -- of office space around Grand Central Terminal, that value could be in the many millions of dollars.
IN 1968, Penn Central proposed a 53-story skyscraper over the terminal. That was rejected by the Landmarks Preservation Commission, leading to a 10-year legal battle that ended when the United States Supreme Court upheld the city's action and, indeed, the constitutionality of the landmarks law itself.
The court noted that Grand Central's transferable development rights "undoubtedly mitigate whatever financial burdens the law has imposed" on Penn Central and that Penn Central's "ability to use these rights has not been abrogated; they are made transferable to at least eight parcels in the vicinity of the terminal."
In the intervening years, however, a consensus has grown that the current arrangement, under which the air rights can move only to sites directly across from Grand Central or along a chain of lots in common ownership, does not afford Penn Central enough opportunities to sell these rights.
It also does not make any planning sense, in that it directs development by patterns of ownership, rather than patterns of existing land use, density and transportation.
(In 1989, the Planning Commission rejected Penn Central's attempt to transfer air rights along a chain of subsurface lots to a development site at 383 Madison Avenue, between 46th and 47th Streets.)
The City Planning Department has proposed a new zoning subdistrict from Madison to Lexington Avenue, 41st to 48th Street. Within the core of this subdistrict, air rights could be used to develop structures 21.6 times the size of their lots -- as high a floor-area ratio as the city has permitted anywhere in recent decades. Such dense buildings would only be allowed by special permit, however. On the edges of the subdistrict, the air rights could be used to raise the floor-area ratio from 15 to 16, as a matter of right.
"What's indisputable," said the chairman of the commission, Richard L. Schaffer, "is that right now you have a limited, arbitrary way of determining receiving sites. We have increased the number of opportunities to transfer these development rights. And we have done so with a strong planning nexus."
And with the survival of the landmark terminal itself at stake, Laurie Beckelman, the chairwoman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, said, "We wholeheartedly embrace the city planning proposal."
However, both Penn Central and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority believe that city planners have not gone far enough.
"We fear that the special-permit requirement for significant transfers could discourage developers from attempting such transfers," said Peter E. Stangl, the chairman of the M.T.A., in a letter to Mr. Schaffer. "The requirement increases the time and cost to accomplish a transfer and decreases the predictability of outcomes -- in terms of both timing and success."
"Second," Mr. Stangl wrote, "we question whether there are sufficient receiving sites within the proposed boundaries of the subdistrict. Our review of the inventory indicates that it may be inadequate."
Now, Penn Central has come forward with what amounts to a counter-proposal, devised by the planning firm of Buckhurst Fish Hutton Katz & Jacquemart and the law firm of Willkie Farr & Gallagher, both of Manhattan.
Penn Central would create a much larger subdistrict within which air rights could be transferred. As importantly, buildings with floor-area ratios of 21.6 would be allowed automatically in the core of the subdistrict, without need of a special permit. On three sides of that core would be areas in which buildings with floor-area ratios of 18 would be allowed, even in mid-blocks. At the edges of the subdistrict, the ratio would be 16.
Mr. Schaffer dismissed the Penn Central effort. "It's clear that this is a real estate proposal, not a planning proposal," he said. "There is only one subdistrict before the City Planning Commission. The document that Penn Central has produced is extremely short on planning analysis."
BUT the subdistrict proposed by the city has also come in for criticism on planning grounds. Community Board 5, for example, has unanimously called on the city to suspend its efforts to adopt the measure until further environmental analysis, according to Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the board's land-use committee.
"We're sympathetic to the creation of a special district," Mr. Rose said. "But what such a plan would look like has to be determined from considering environmental factors as well as economic ones."
City planners say that an environmental analysis of the Grand Central area -- particularly from the standpoint of traffic volume and air pollution -- would be virtually meaningless, except on a case-by-case basis through the special-permit process.
"Even if we were able to do a credible environmental review now," said Robert E. Flahive, director of the Manhattan office, "we'd be hard pressed in five years to point to a generic environmental impact statement and say, 'We analyzed this in 1992.' The background conditions may be very different."
At a public forum tomorrow, Mr. Flahive is scheduled to discuss the subdistrict with Frank S. Fish, a principal in Buckhurst Fish. The session begins at 6 P.M. in the Urban Center, 457 Madison Avenue, at 50th Street. A hearing by the planning commission is scheduled May 20, with a vote expected in June. The matter then goes to the City Council.
While the zoning saga plays out invisibly to the traveling public, another facet of Grand Central's unfolding future is far easier to notice: the restoration of the former main waiting room.
Although the room has not yet reopened to the public, it is possible to see through the enormous interior windows that the chamber is glowing as it has not since Grand Central opened in 1913. The luster seems to emanate from the Caen stone walls themselves.
The M.T.A. has spent $4.3 million to strip architectural accretions from the waiting room, remove and store the great oak benches, and restore the five 17-foot gold-and-nickel-plated chandeliers. It also has restored the sumptuous Bottocino marble wainscoting and the richly embellished ceilings more than 50 feet above the Tennessee Pink marble floor.
"We're plowing public money into the infrastructure simply because it must be done to maintain it for transportation purposes," Mr. Nelson said. "The waiting room was the location of most of the severe leaks, the most discolored marble and Caen stone and, we suspected, steel problems."
Metro-North's chief architect, Wayne D. Ehmann, said: "The waiting room has been an excellent way to find out how to restore the rest of the terminal. We saw this as an area we could use as a test bed without affecting ridership."
The architects for the restoration are Beyer Blinder Belle of Manhattan and the general contractor is George Campbell Associates of Flushing, Queens.
Originally designed for the comfort of long-distance passengers who sometimes had to wait hours for trains, the waiting room had become the "most altered, deteriorated and redundant space in the terminal," in the words of the architect John Belle.
It was closed to the public in the summer of 1989. A plywood tunnel was built through it to keep a passage open from 42d Street to the main concourse. Restoration work began in 1991 and is scheduled to be finished in July.
A new waiting area was created on the west balcony, overlooking the concourse. Accommodating about 60 people, the area has about one-tenth the capacity of the old waiting room. But with the disappearance of long-distance trains from Grand Central Terminal (the last ones rolled out in April 1991), travelers now spend minutes -- rather than hours -- in the building. "A small waiting room is more than enough for our customers," Mr. Ehmann said.
SO a search has begun for tenants to take over the space on a 10-year lease. Restaurants top the agenda because existing food services in the terminal, "while generally profitable, are both geographically and conceptually unfocused," stated the request for proposals by the M.T.A. "The goal of the waiting-room project is to provide station users and visitors with a variety of high quality meal options within a unified space and theme."
Ideally, the authority said, there would be a restaurant with table-service, a cafe and a specialty food store.
"Customers would be able to purchase food, either to eat while seated at tables, without service or to go," the document said. "The addition of ancillary retail sales, such as cookbooks, house or kitchen wares, single-item food stands or other complementary items is encouraged."
The room could logically be divided along the 25-foot-wide passageway that must be maintained between the concourse and 42d Street. Terms of the lease depend a great deal on who the tenant is, what the tenant needs and when the tenant signs.
Not yet resolved is the question of what will happen to the freestanding benches. That depends in part on who takes the space. In approving the restoration plan in 1991, the landmarks commission asked for the "replacement of, if not all, some of the benches" in "their original locations." And Ms. Beckelman said the commission still expects that "some of the benches will be re-used." In that way, the memory of the long-distance era at Grand Central will not be lost entirely.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: For Directors and Managers;
Co-op/Condo Seminar

 BODY:
With taxes and operating costs on the rise, the job of maintaining the financial health of co-ops and condominiums has never been more of a challenge for their boards of directors and managers.
For those charged with the task, help is available in the form of a daylong seminar on financial planning next Saturday at the Hotel Macklowe, 144 West 44th Street. The forum is being sponsored by the Council of New York Cooperatives, the Federation of New York Housing Cooperatives and N.Y. Habitat, a magazine covering co-op and condominium management issues. 
 Among the topics to be discussed will be how to get the most out of management companies, tax-planning strategies, raising revenue and avoiding unnecessary repairs. In addition to the sessions for board members there will be a special workshop for managing agents on how to assist client buildings with their economic strategies.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: $100 Million Rebuilding;
Ferry Terminal Contest

 BODY:
The fire that damaged the Staten Island ferry terminal last year provided what the stagnant economy could not: a spur to reconstruction.
Known formally as the Whitehall Ferry Terminal, the structure was supposed to have been renovated as part of the South Ferry Plaza commercial development, forming the base of a 60-story office tower. But that project fell through in January 1991. 
 Now, seeing an opportunity "to create a major civic statement" at the tip of Manhattan, the city's Economic Development Corporation will hold an architectural competition for the $100 million project to rebuild the terminal and its plaza, which is to begin in 1994.
The city is asking interested firms to submit their qualifications by May 29. Five firms will be asked to prepare designs, for which the city expects to provide a $30,000 stipend. These submissions will then go to a jury of city officials, community leaders, civic groups and architects.
Inquiries should be addressed to the Whitehall Ferry Terminal Competition, Economic Development Corporation, 110 William Street, New York, N.Y. 10038.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: New Housing in Chicago;
Where Bargains for Renters are 'Terrific'

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
THE good news, says Christine Williams, is that Chicago's residential developers appear to be holding their fire. None of the projected market-rate high-rise developments are moving into construction for the moment. The market neeeds time to absorb what is already built, she says.
Ms. Williams, vice president of the Real Estate Research Corporation, a consulting firm based here, has figures that show that new "luxury" residential construction has marched along at an average rate of 1,600 units a year over the last four years, recession notwithstanding. Five new projects with a total of 2,600 apartments have come on the market since the start of last year alone. 
 With few exceptions, these new buildings are rentals, not condominiums. And as they lease up steadily, with a nudge from a month or two of free rent, they demonstrate how a city with a fundamentally positive attitude toward new development has continued to sustain housing prices that are remarkably low by the standards of comparable cities.
Right now they are even low in relation to the cost of development. Too low, some specialists say, to sustain the mortgages that some have received.
"Chicago is a terrific housing bargain for the renter, relative to development costs and land costs, whether you're talking about San Franciso, New York, Los Angeles or Boston," said Jared Shlaes, a real-estate consultant and former developer himself. And in contrast with New York, no tax abatement program has beeen necessary to keep market-rate housing flowing.
What New Yorkers would define as middle- to upper-middle-income luxury high-rise apartments are on the market in new buildings for about $1.35 to $1.55 a square foot a month, Ms. Williams said. At $1.35 a square foot, or $16.20 a foot a year, an 800-square-foot one-bedroom apartment would rent for $1,080; at $1.55 a foot, or $18.60 a foot a year, it would rent for $1,240 a month.
Also at $1.55 a square foot, an 1,100-square-foot, two-bedroom, for example, would rent for $1,700 a month. In New York City, comparable new housing would rent for $27 to $30 a square foot a year; the 1,100-square-foot apartment would cost $2,000 to $2,500 a month.
How can the developers here do it?
One reason is that land costs are much lower than in New York City. Chicago is well endowed with well-situated vacant or nearly vacant land intended for residential or mixed-use developments. The bitter and lengthy New York battles over emptying old buildings of residential tenants with statutory rights to stay in place are unknown. The absence of rent regulation leads builders to hope that they will be able to take advantage of an eventually stronger market, whatever the level of initial rents.
In a word, development incentives are far stronger. But the competitive risks are greater.
In the mid-80's, Chicago developers were paying $12 to $20 a developable square foot for building sites. Even at the higher figure, the land cost embedded in an 800-square-foot one-bedroom apartment is only $16,000. In New York, rentals in new West Side buildings have a land cost of about $40,000 for a one-bedroom apartment. The developers paid roughly $50 a developable foot for ready-to-build land.
In addition, Chicago builders get a higher-density use of the land. Land is typically developed to a density of about 20 square feet of building for each square foot of site, a floor-area ratio of 20, under a "planned unit development" ordinance. Builders present a specific site plan for a project to the Department of Planning and Development. It is eventually voted upon by the Chicago Plan Commission and the City Council.
In the downtown area, at least, Chicago welcomes new development and favors density and height, as opposed to bulk, according to Jack Guthman, a lawyer with the firm of Sidley & Austin who represents many developers. With high-rise buildings appearing on broad swaths of vacant land, often near the Lake Michigan waterfront, residential towers 40 and 50 stories high, occupying about half their 40,000-square-foot sites, are not uncommon.
"They are generous on F.A.R. but strict about other things -- like loading docks and parking spaces," said Mr. Guthman.
For all these factors, the supply-demand situation appears to be the principal one holding prices down. Some experienced developers say that major new projects cannot even break even at current market rents. They need rents of $1.65 to $1.75 a square foot a month for that, or about $20 a square foot a year. Accordingly, the projects may be renting at figures that in the present market are "uneconomic." Time and an upward swing in the market may change that.
But default rates on post-1980 projects that were insured by the Federal Government show that a price has already been paid for overambitiousness. At the Chicago office of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Developmeent, 17 projects out of 27 built since 1980 with Government mortgage insurance have been taken back with an outlay of $510 million from the mortgage insurance fund. The largest is the $160 million mortgage on the 2,500-unit Presidential Towers project, which is four years old and 92 percent occupied.
With mortgage rates down, some of the projects may be candidates for refinancing at more favorable rates, said Joseph Garaffa, deputy regional administrator of the Chicago office of H.U.D. Meanwhile, the owners remain in possession, hoping that with time the value of the real estate will recover.
The Government insured about 9,800 housing units in Chicago during the period, but none after 1987. About 20,000 units have been built between 1980 and the present. Residential construction since 1987 has proceeded with uninsured financing.
In the Streeterville-Michigan Avenue corridor, just north of the Chicago River, major new projects include the 904-unit Cityfront Place, two midrise and one high-rise building on two-and-a-half acres of land owned by the Chicago Dock and Canal Trust. The Habitat Company, headed by Daniel Levin, is the developer. The trust owns the two 200-unit midrises for the trust, and Habitat with Northwest Mutual Life Insurance as equity partner owns the 39-story high-rise.
Cityfront Place has been offering two-bedroom apartments with cherrywood doors, Italian marble baths, built-in microwave ovens and garbage disposals for $1,650 a month, with two months' free rent. The building has a health club, a pool, a sun deck on each building, a party room and a parking garage for 600 cars. James Watts, the project manager, said the project is over 70 percent leased.
Closer to the Loop, at 440 North Wabash Avenue, the John Buck Company is on the market with the 50-story Plaza 440, consisting of 457 apartments in a mixed-use building with a 336-room Marriott hotel and a 400-car garage. Deluxe two-bedroom apartments can be rented for $1,400 to $2,000 a month. One-bedrooms are available for $1,200 to $1,300.
The John Buck Company is known mainly as a real-estate services company for corporate users -- it has taken over management of the 4.5-million-square-foot Sears Towers and will lease out 2.8 million square feet in it as Sears's merchants group moves to the suburbs -- but it took on the mixed-use project when it bought the 40,000-square-foot North Wabash Avenue parking lot four years ago.
"We're the last of the new stuff," said Bill Moody, the project manager. "There will be a pause in new investment now. Real estate is battered and everyone is cautious."
For the long term, the land is still available for substantial new high-rise growth near the glamorous Chicago waterfront and inland as well. But Chicagoans themeselves are unlikely to abandon the low-rise neighborhood housing that principally characterizes the city to the north, south and west of the central business district.
"Many people from Chicago want older-style properties," said John Supera, whose father, Michael, runs a company that manages 2,000 apartments in the Lincoln Park and DePaul University area. "They like to walk around the neighborhood, go to the cleaners, that sort of thing." His buildings are 99 percent leased, he said.

HEADLINE: Groundwater

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your article on Feb. 23 entitled "Protecting Groundwater and Open Space" about efforts to protect the region's groundwater while resurrecting the economy failed to address a critical point. 
 It will remain the responsibility of locally elected officials to recognize that the region is in economic crisis and that they, not Washington nor Albany, hold the key to how best create an environment for economic growth that protects the quality of life.
Those who call for the purchase of these properties instead have failed to see that there are no longer tax revenues available from a sagging economy and a growing unemployed work force to make the sale.
Against these realities and a state budget deficit that threatens to collapse our Long Island education system, there is a current proposal that would see state taxpayers spend $20 million to acquire a wish list of property throughout Nassau and Suffolk.
This plan does not include the dollars already gathered from a destitute Suffolk County for the purchase of Hampton Hills in Southampton for $17.8 million, Froelich Farm in Huntington for $12.4 million and Robins Island for $9 million.
At a time when we are fighting to preserve our schools, our police and our homes, we need to find radically innovative programs that will protect our environment and the people who live on the Island, without fleecing the taxpayers.
The answer is to create clustered development so that the public gains open space in perpetuity without having to pay a dime. Clustering, whereby developers are only permitted to use a portion of their property, is a device that sophisticated planners and astute community leaders can embrace that will allow economic pump priming to go forward under very strict guidelines.
Clustering has already been used successfully by the Tilles Organization, owners of the Underhill site in Jericho. At their Crossways International Plaza in neighboring Woodbury, they dedicated 87 acres to the Town for a park and a police station and they put 52 buildings on the remaining 224 acre site.
But Tilles, and Canon, need to operate under very specific guidelines set down by government that would allow clustering to proceed at Underhill and DeSeversky respectively. They would need to agree to covenants and restrictions that would guarantee the preservation and protection of existing natural resources on the site.
Can Oyster Bay Town, Brookville Village, or the people of New York State come up the tens of millions of dollars needed to purchase both sites? Or will we choose to allow the courts to dictate the ultimate use of our open space?

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Irvington Offices;
Converted Warehouses Offer 'SoHo in Westchester'

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD

 BODY:
WHEN Joseph M. Kessler was thinking about moving his management consulting business from midtown Manhattan to waterfront offices in the Village of Irvington in Westchester County, everyone advised him against it.
"The so-called experts said my clients would balk about my being out of Manhattan, but it never happened," Mr. Kessler said. "Nobody seemed to care and the move helped us out enormously with lower overhead. I also improved my life style by cutting my commute by two-thirds." 
 For Mr. Kessler and other tenants who moved from Manhattan to warehouse buildings in Irvington, their initial fears proved unfounded.
"I know I was attracted by the fact that it's a quaint old river town," said Mr. Kessler, "and as it turns out, the address seems to add a certain mystique that, I think, has actually helped business."
That kind of thinking is helping to turn Irvington's old industrial waterfront into a trendy relocation spot for small- to medium-sized businesses from Manhattan.
"It's kind of like SoHo in Westchester," said Terry Talley, who moved her advertising agency, Talley, Tabatch, from midtown Manhattan two years ago. "I mean with the loft atmoshpere and creatively minded people, it seems like the place to be."
For the last four years, Noble Van & Storage, a property management company, has been converting two turn-of-the-century warehouses into loft-like offices and light industrial space, attracting 40 tenants ranging from graphic arts and advertising agencies to laser research firms and clothing designers.
"We hope to eventually create a community of businesses that can complement and cooperate with each other," said Michael K. Lyons, a co-owner of Noble.
The project's biggest selling point, Mr. Lyons believes, is the Village of Irvington itself, which was named for the writer Washington Irving, who built his home there.
"I think the history and atmosphere here attract the kind of artistic and creative people we want," said Mr. Lyons, who sports a ponytail as well as a business suit.
To date, Noble has converted 140,000 square feet of warehouse space. The first building worked on, One Bridge Street, is now 90 percent occupied. And half of Two Bridge Street has been converted and leased.
"We'll convert the rest once we get a tenant," said William J. Thompson, Noble's other owner.
Last week, Eileen Fisher, a clothing designer, leased 12,000 square feet in Two Bridge Street, a building with a pitched roof, skylights and catwalks.
"We'll custom-build practically any kind of office space a tenant wants," said Mr. Lyons. The company will lease space as small as 250 square feet or as large as 40,000.
Mr. Lyons's own office, at One Bridge Street, is perched atop an old elevator shaft. Surrounded by windows, it has views of the Hudson River and the Tappan Zee Bridge. To the left of Mr Lyons's desk, on the ceiling, are the original elevator pulleys, now purely decorative and painted a bright red.
WHEN Steel Swift, co-owner of Tangram, designer and builder of trade-show exhibits, first looked at One Bridge Street four years ago "it was very raw," he said, adding that there were "dead pigeons on the floor."
His company now occupies a 1,500-square-foot corner office, with original brick walls and river views. It also has a 7,000-square-foot workshop and 3,000 square feet of storage space.
"When we were in Manhattan, our offices were on lower Broadway and the shop was in Fort Greene in Brooklyn," Mr. Steel said. "Consolidating everything was a big plus."
Tangram was unable to finance that much space in Manhattan. By contrast, riverfront leasing in Irvington costs $8 to $18 a square foot, depending on the location in the buildings.
Irvington isn't the only Westchester community developing office space on the river. About 20 miles upriver, in Peeksill, some old factories once owned by the Fleischmann distillers now house offices for artists, accountants and mortgage brokers. And on a much smaller scale, a 5,000-square-foot building in Cold Spring in Putman County was converted for use by artists and small business owners.
But Irvington is the only southern Westchester community that has successfully made use of its old warehouses. That is partly due to the fact that they were never really abandoned.
IN other communites, such as Hastings-on-Hudson, the riverfront has been vacant for almost two decades.
As a result, the buildings fell into desrepair and, in some cases, toxic waste has leached into the soil, forestalling any new development.
In Irvington, Lord and Burnham Company, a greenhouse manufacturer, occupied the waterfront from 1870 until 1986, when it disbanded the operation. Then Noble leased 220,000 square feet in the two main warehouse buildings and several auxiliary structures.
"We're now leasing with the intention to buy, and will probably own the properties within two years," said Mr. Lyons.
Noble still uses part of the property for its warehousing operation, but intends eventually to convert the entire space for tenancy.
In 1989, Irvington changed the zoning along the riverfront from heavy to light industrial use.
"The village wanted to gain control over the future of the waterfront," said Mr. Thompson. "And what we're doing fits right into their plans."
Also working in Noble's favor is the good relationship that Lord and Burnham developed over the years with the village government.
"Lord and Burnham was always good to the village," said Reginald Marra, who was Mayor from 1979 to 1989. "Whenever we needed something fixed, they would try to take care of it."
That beneficence has extended to Noble and the Bridge Street properties.
"With this project," Mr. Marra said, "they're proving that you don't have to tear down some of these old buildings. People in the village are used to seeing them, are not offended by them and like them being used in this way."
The properties are cut off from downtown by the Metro-North train tracks, which are only a few hundred feet from the office buildings.
Aidan Corish, a partner in Tangram, likes the proximity to the train into Manhattan.
"I can leave my office at 10 A.M. and be sitting in a client's office in Manhattan at 11," he said.
The disadvantage is that the rumble from the trains can be clearly heard, especially in the offices on the east side of the buildings, although nobody there seems to mind.
What some of the tenants who moved from Manhattan do complain about the lack of a social life in Irvington. "There's really no great restaurants where you can entertain clients and no health club I can go to during the day," said Joseph Kessler.
The developers are hoping to change that soon by building a restaurant and health club on the waterfront property.
Whether or not that comes to pass, Mr. Kessler is still happy he made the move. With the 20-minute commute from his home in Ossining, "I can now drop my son off at preschool and be back in time for work," he said. "I can even go home for lunch."

HEADLINE: 'The Kid' in Charge at Town Hall

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN

 BODY:
WHEN Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas visited Clinton, Conn., during the state's Democratic presidential primary campaign, he was forced to improvise on one of his standard talks to young people. He was at Morgan High School, saying to the students that everyone in government was middle-aged, when he glanced over at his chief host in the community. "Except your First Selectman," he added quickly.
The exception was 25-year-old Paul W. Austin, the youngest person now serving as head of a Connecticut municipality, and probably the youngest ever. During his own campaign last fall Mr. Austin was commonly referred to as "the kid" or "Doogie," for the adolescent doctor in the television show "Doogie Howser, M.D." 
 With his unlined face and shock of blond hair, Mr. Austin appears even younger than he is. At his desk in town hall, he looks as if he should be planning the senior prom, not running a town of some 14,000 people.
"I can understand some people coming in and see me sitting here, 25 years old, and have trouble dealing with that," Mr. Austin said. "But it means that I have to be well prepared to deal with them. I have to do my homework."
He does not mind the homework, or the long hours he puts in for the full-time, $45,000-a-year job, he said. "I'm here at 7:30 in the morning and go to about 8 at night. Sometimes, I bring dinner in." In addition to attending many evening meetings, Mr. Austin is at Town Hall on Saturday afternoons, for anyone who cares to drop in and talk.
Until 1988 Mr. Austin was more accustomed to spending his Saturday hours in the library at Connecticut College in New London, where he was studying for a degree in economics and political science. But his interest in politics goes back to his childhood, said Mr. Austin, the son of a Presbyterian minister "who moved around a lot."
 
The Boy Who Would Be President
 One of Mr. Austin's favorite stories is about one of his early motivators, a great-uncle, who told him that he would be President of the United States some day. "Then I found out later he said the same thing to my two brothers," Mr. Austin said. No matter. The germ had been planted.
After graduating from college Mr. Austin dove right into politics, as an aide to Richard J. Balducci, Speaker of the State House; as director of the Taxpayers Alliance to Serve Connecticut, a group that supported the state income tax, and as chairman of the Democratic Town Committee in Clinton.
He had selected the shore town very deliberately as his home in 1988, he said. "It's a town with an interesting mix of young and old," he said, "and from blue-collar workers to people who own big cottages on the beaches." With what appears to be an inexhaustible supply of energy, coupled with an inclination to talk to everyone, he quickly became well known in town.
"I never felt I was a real part of a community before," he said. "But here I am. This town has a work aspect, but it has a social aspect, too."
When Mr. Austin decided to run for First Selectman, he was very much a long shot. Despite his affability and his party post, he had only been in town three years. He was one of four candidates for the job, including a Republican twice his age, who had served more than Mr. Austin's entire lifetime on the Board of Finance or the Board of Selectmen. Nevertheless, at a time of general political discontent in Connecticut, Mr. Austin won the election, squeaking in by a margin of 42 votes out of 3,031 cast.
Since the victory he has been as much an inescapable presence as the stately brick Town Hall on Route 1. Unlike many first selectmen, who shy away from school affairs, Mr. Austin often wanders into that sacred territory, talking to teachers, administrators and students. One of his latest ventures is promoting a basketball game, pitting male and female high school students against people who work in town government, to benefit literacy volunteers. At the high school he seems to be about as well known as most teachers but regarded by students as more of a peer. The First Selectman, who is not married, gets a lot of giggles from some of the young women.
He also appears to get the respect from the older people who run neighboring towns. At a recent meeting to talk over his idea of buying municipal supplies jointly to save money, the older municipal leaders listened politely and seemed receptive. One of them, Paula C. Ferrara, the Republican First Selectman of neighboring Westbrook, later described Mr. Austin as full of energy and with some innovative ideas. She confessed to being old enough to be his mother and said meetings with him are like talking to her own children. "I think it's cute," she said.
 
Talking About His Plans
 Mr. Austin's chief booster is a local Democratic Selectman, James M. McCusker Jr. "He's a breath of fresh air to the community," Mr. McCusker said. "He's out and about. He makes himself available."
The most serious complaint about the young First Selectman is that in his exuberance he is likely to discourse too much about his plans, especially with reporters, without first informing other officials who might be involved. Mr. Austin's plan for making better use of town buildings was one that brought some criticism.
He makes no apologizes for thinking aloud, he said. He was talking about an idea for possibly using schools and other buildings for children's day care, he said, and the objections did not come until he suggested a committee to research it.
"This town has 880 single-parent families, with little day care before or after school," he said. "There's no recreational facilities for teens or seniors. I want to set up a program to address these needs."
When he ran for election, he promised to talk about his ideas openly, he said, and that is what he has done.
One of the questions about Mr. Austin has been whether the Clinton job is just a first, and very temporary, step on a political career.
"You never can tell when an opportunity comes up," he said. "So you've got to be flexible."
But he is that he is enjoying his first elected job so much, he said, that he is beginning to think it would be fun, and gratifying, to stay on to see how all the plans work out in 20 years or so. He said, he definitely planned to run again when his first term is completed.
And this spring he has found one group in town does not regard him as a youngster. The First Selectman is now an assistant coach of a Little League baseball team. Among these players he is a real elder, he said, adding, "All the guys on the Little League team call me Mr. Austin."

HEADLINE: Guard Fears Impact of Cuts

BYLINE: >By ALBERT J. PARISI

 BODY:
FOR 38-year-old Daniel T. Mahon of Warren Township, a technical supervisor at a Federal installation, the loss of his National Guard income, he says, would force him to sell the house he and his wife bought two and a half years ago.
For Donald Hartfield, 28, of Newark, who was laid off from his job as a maintenance man at Giants Stadium seven months ago, it would leave him broke, he says. State Guard officials say about 30 percent of their members are otherwise unemployed. 
 Throughout the state, members of the National Guard -- and, to a lesser extent, the Reserves -- are nervously awaiting the outcome of a Congressional debate over the Pentagon's plan to do away with some 140,000 positions nationwide, out of a total of 1.2 million, over a two-year period. The expected saving: $20 billion.
 
10 Armory Closings Seen
 The New Jersey cuts, if approved by Congress, could mean the loss of up to 6,300 full- and part-time jobs, officials say, and the elimination of 9 State Guard, 16 Army Reserve and 2 Naval Reserve units as early as June 1993. In addition, 10 of the state's 40 Army National Guard armories in 20 counties would be forced to close. (Only Passaic County has no armory.)
For Guard officials, the proposed reductions represent a threat to their mission. "We're talking about cutbacks here which will seriously hamper our ability to carry out the job we're assigned to do," said Maj. Gen. Vito Morgano, commander of the New Jersey Army and Air National Guard.
The missions of the Guard and the Reserves are different, and the impact of the cutbacks on the two would be different as well.
While both groups require members to attend a two-or-three-day weekend drill once a month and an annual two-week stint, and the pay is comparable, the Reserve units train to provide active military forces with medical, transportation and other support services in time of war or national emergency. The Guard's primary role is to help communities cope with floods or other natural disasters.
Under the proposed elimination of Reserve units, said Steven Stromvall, a spokesman for the Army Reserve Command headquarters in Atlanta, "we expect to lose very, very few people."
 
Cuts Through Attrition
 Attrition would cover most job reductions, he said, and most of the other reservists affected would be absorbed into units that had not been cut.
For example, there are no cutbacks planned for the 514th Airlift Wing of the Air Force Reserve, based at McGuire Air Force Base in Wrightstown, in Burlington County, said Art Covello, a spokesman for the unit. The 514th was responsible for ferrying troops and supplies during the war in the Persian Gulf.
In the case of the Guard, in which units are not expected to be combined, the cutbacks could reduce the New Jersey ranks to about 7,400 from today's 10,800 by 1993.
Units slated for elimination, General Morgano said, represent talents and skills not easily replaced. One such is the 104th Army National Guard Engineer Battalion, based in Teaneck, which, he said, is the state's only Guard engineering unit. It has aided communities damaged by floods in Wayne and along the Passaic River Basin.
Even limited reductions, he said, would produce a domino effect. They would end some $28 million in salaries for the 600 full-time employees and 2,750 part-time Guard members who would lose their jobs, which would trim tax revenue. In addition, businesses in the towns where Guard units are based would lose revenue.
 
Legislators Pledge to Help
 The impact of the announced cuts has led such legislators as United States Senator Frank R. Lautenberg and Representatives Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of Englewood, and H. James Saxton, Republican of Mount Holly, to pledge the Guard their help in minimizing the cutbacks.
Especially in New Jersey's cities, officials say, the curtailment of the Guard and the closing of armories would have a major impact. There the Guard pay is often a member's only source of income, and the armory itself is a community gathering place.
The Newark Armory, at 120 Roseville Avenue, is a case in point.
Maj. Paul H. Rutt of Hasbrouck Heights, who supervises the armory, said its closing would have devastating results both on the neighborhood economy and on those who view it as a "community anchor."
"For some of the people here, this place is the difference between a straight and narrow path and the mean streets," said Major Rutt, who also supervises Guard sites in Jersey City, Riverdale and Woodbridge.
Of the 290 Guard members assigned to the Second Battalion of the 113th Infantry Division, an armored unit, at the armory, nearly one-third are unemployed in civilian life, Major Rutt said. Guard officials in New Jersey say that some 30 percent of their members statewide fall into the same category.
While the 113th Infantry is not slated for cutting, the armory is, and the unit would be transferred elsewhere. For the many unit members without cars, demanding that they fulfill their Guard obligation elsewhere "is like asking them to travel to the moon," Major Rutt said.
"Asking someone who makes a couple of hundred dollars for the weekend to pay for bus fare out of their own pocket to, say, Fort Dix isn't exactly being realistic," he said.
 
Loss of Pension Benefits
 Those forced to leave the Guard, he said, face not only the loss of pay but also loss of pension benefits built up over many years as well as discounted privileges at the post exchange and commissary, which many Guard members rely on to feed and clothe their families, Major Rutt said.
For Douglas Zeigler, 29, a guardsman who lives four blocks from the Newark Armory in an apartment he shares with his mother, grandmother and sister, his $3,000 annual income as a sergeant "helps to pay our bills and is time away from the streets."
Mr. Zeigler, a former full-time security guard, said that he had lost his job 18 months ago and that he had filled out countless job applications. "Nobody calls back," he said. "Just too many people out there looking for work, and every place has a waiting list."
While Mr. Zeigler is paid only for scheduled weekend Guard drills, he spends most days at the armory, he said, "helping out where I can because in a way it gives me a feeling of belonging." He spends some evenings there, too -- he is the scoutmaster for a troop that uses the armory.
The armory is also the home of the Newark Drum and Bugle Corps and provides a staging area for food and clothing drives for local charities.
 
Guard- Sponsored Program
 Mr. Zeigler earned a high school equivalency diploma through a Guard-sponsored program and said he planned to take advantage of college courses at state schools -- up to 12 credits a semester -- available to him without charge through the Guard.
Mr. Hartfield said his yearly pay of some $1,800 as a Newark guardsman went directly toward "my half of the rent" of an apartment he shares with his sister. After losing his job at Giants Stadium, he said, he has been unable to find another.
"I don't know what I'd do if it wasn't for the Guard work," he said, adding that he cannot file for unemployment compenstation because his service constitutes earned income and disqualifies him by state law.
"I've got friends out there who are making money by selling drugs -- not because they want to, because they have to to make ends meet," said Mr. Hartfield, a high school dropout. "I don't say nothing to them, but I know that I'm not going to wind up in jail or dead somewhere."
He also earned a high school equivalency diploma through the Guard.
 
A Difference in Impact
 For those Guard members with full-time jobs, the impact of the proposed cutbacks tends to be very different.
Tony A. Howard, 30, of Parsippany is a captain and company commander of a State National Guard unit based at the Newark Armory. "With the way things are, I've come to count on that extra income," said Mr. Howard, a production supervisor for a tax preparation service based in Cedar Grove.
His Guard pay helps him keep up his monthly car payments and buy clothing for his 14-year-old son, who, he said, "gets bigger with each and every day."
Mr. Mahon, a Guard captain and personnel officer at the armory in Washington Township, said he subsisted on the $7,000 he earned with the Guard. His regular salary goes right back into the home that he and his wife, Debra, bought at a high interest rate.
"My mortgage every month is $1,600, and between that and all my bills, my whole paycheck is gone," he said. Without such extra income, he said, he would be forced to sell the house. What's more, he added, "if we were to put the house on the market tomorrow, it's a sure bet that I'd wind up losing a lot of money."
 
Relocation Termed a Hardship
 Aldwin Olivera, 37, of North Bergen is a full-time guardsman and the Newark Armory's supply sergeant. His Guard connection provided him with a safety net four years ago when the company he had worked for went bankrupt, and he was able to switch from part-time Guard duty to a $30,000 full-time post. The closing of the armory, he said, would create a hardship for him and his family if he were assigned to a distant unit.
"By the time my wife gets ready for work, and by the time we get my daughter ready for day care, we'd have to rearrange everything," he said. "My daughter's got to be picked up on time, otherwise that's more money I've got to pay, that and maybe tolls and upkeep on my car."
Staff Sergeant Olivera said the threat of the armory's closing had filled him with anxiety. "Like lots of people around here, there was a time that you joined up because Government service meant job security," he said. "But not any more. Forget the assurances."

'EVITA' IN YORKTOWN
 A production of "Evita" by the nonprofit Yorktown Regional Theater Company opens at the Yorktown Performing Arts Theater Friday for seven performances. The musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber traces the rags-to-riches story of Eva Duarte, the low-born Argentine dancer-actress-radio personality who became the First Lady of her country. 
 Manipulative and ambitious, she was a force to reckon with, engineering the rise of her husband, Juan Peron, to the position of dictator. The two ruled together for six years, adored by the public because of their apparent compassion for the poor, but by the time Eva died of cancer at the age of 33 the Perons had stripped the country of its economic and moral resources. Juan Peron was soon overthrown and exiled. Thirty years later Eva is still regarded by many as a saint.
Craig Schulman, who had the leading role in "Les Miserables" on Broadway, plays Che, the revolutionary; Angela DeCicco portrays Evita, and Jeff Scott is Juan Peron.
Performances are scheduled for Friday and Saturday and from May 14 through 16 at 8 P.M., May 13 at 1 P.M. and May 17 at 3 P.M. The theater is at 1974 Commerce Street in Yorktown heights. Tickets at $15 and $18 can be reserved by calling 962-6665. Tickets for children through 12 years old and adults 65 and older are $13.
 
MEDIA AND THE CAMPAIGN
 Tom Post, general editor of Newsweek Magazine; Kyle Crichton, an editor on The New York Times Magazine handling politics and foreign affairs, and J. R. Brandstrader, a financial writer for Barron's, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Daily News, will participate in a panel discussion about the media and its reporting on the current presidential campaign.
"Campaign '92: How the Media Shape the Issues" will follow a dinner at Guidas Restaurant in Ossining today at 5 P.M., organized by the League of Women Voters of Briarcliff, Ossining, Croton and Cortlandt. Questions from the audience will be fielded by the panelists following their discussion. The numbers to call for information and reservations are 941-6674 or 941-2662.
 
'RUN FOR YOUR WIFE'
 "Run for Your Wife," a British comedy by Ray Cooney, which ran in London from 1982 to 1991 and on Broadway in 1989, will be performed by the Company Players of Throgs Neck, the Bronx, in New Rochelle. Presented by Fate Productions, performances are on Friday, Saturday and May 16 at 8 P.M., and next Sunday and May 17 at 3 P.M. in Romita Auditorium of the College of New Rochelle, at Elm Street and Castle Place.
The show is a fund-raising event for Fate Productions, a community theater founded last year by alumnae of the college. Tickets at $8, $6 for children, students and people 65 and older are available by calling 636-7450.
 
BENEFIT AT RIVERCLIFF
 Rivercliff, a 25-room Georgian manor house built in 1910 in Upper Nyack, was once the estate of Anton H. G. Fokker, designer of the synchronized propeller-machine gun aircraft of World War I.
The current owner, Dr. William D. Hardy Jr., has lent the house for use as a designer showhouse for the benefit of the Nyack Hospital and the Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern. It will be open for viewing today through May 31 from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. and on Thursdays until 8 P.M.
Mario Buatta, the honorary chairman, will give a talk tomorrow at noon on "Decorating for Today With You in Mind," for which admission will be $50, including lunch, catalogue and a tour of the house.
Other noted interior designers who have redecorated rooms for the show are Jamie Gibbs, who will talk about window treatments on May 11 at 10 A.M., and Vicente Wolf, whose topic will be "Inspirations" on May 18 at 10 A.M. Admission to each lecture will be $25.
More than 35 interior designers, landscape designers and decorative painters have contributed their talents to transforming Rivercliff into the last word in the decorative arts.
A silent auction and raffle will produce prizes that include a trans-Atlantic cruise on the Queen Elizabeth 2, designer rugs, antiques and Oriental art objects. A gift shop will be open daily, and lunches prepared by restaurant chefs will be available for $10.
Admission is $15, or $12 for people 65 years older. The house is at 649 North Broadway, and the phone number for more information is 368-5151.
 
LONDONER IN RECITAL
 John Scott, organist and director of music at St. Paul's Cathedral in London, will give a free organ recital at the Reformed Church at Pondfield Road and Midland Avenue in Bronxville today at 4 P.M. Mr. Scott, who is in his late 30's, is also professor of organ at the Royal Academy of Music and assistant conductor to Sir David Willcocks of the Bach Choir in London.
In 1984 he won the international J. S. Bach Organ Competition in Leipzig. He was the youngest soloist to appear at the Proms (similar to the Boston Pops) concerts in Albert Hall, and in 1981 he performed at the wedding of the Prince and Princess of Wales. His American tours are booked two years in advance.
Among the works he will perform are two pieces composed by Mozart for musical clocks, transcribed for organ. Musical clocks were mechanisms that were pre-programmed and set off by clockworks. They produced a light, toylike sound. "The few that may still be in existence are probably in European museums," said Rodney Schuller, music director at the Bronxville church.
Also on the program are Bach's "Toccata and Fugue in F major," Mozart's "Fantasia in F minor," Franck's "Prelude, Fugue and Variations," an orchestral transcription for organ of Wagner's "Meistersinger" and the first movement of Widor's Fifth Symphony.
 
GARDENING WITH ROSES
 Everything will be coming up roses and rosarians when the Caramoor Garden Guild presents a symposium titled "Gardening With Roses" Friday from 9 A.M. to 3 P.M. The event will be held at the Caramoor Center for the Arts in Katonah.
The session, a mixture of rose history and how-to expertise, will reveal how to find and recover old varieties of roses, how to incorporate roses into any size or style of garden and how to overcome fear of roses as an intimidating plant to cultivate.
Stephen Scanniello, head of the rose department at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden; Michael Shoup, author and owner of the Antique Rose Emporium in Texas, and Lily Shohan, an accredited American Rose Society judge will speak on the various aspects of rose culture.
Tickets, which include lunch, are $65. The number to call for reservations or more information is 232-1253.
 
COURSE IN GARDENING
 The fundamentals of gardening will be taught in a six-session course at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx by Ralph Snodsmith, host of "The Garden Hot Line" on WOR radio and garden editor for ABC television's "Good Morning America."
The classes, which will cover many facets of gardening from planting to the relationship of plants to the environment, will be held in two sections, from 10:15 A.M. to 12:15 P.M. or from 6:15 to 8:15 P.M. on Mondays beginning tomorrow. The fee is $143. The number to call to reserve a place is (212) 220-8747.

HEADLINE: Coming to Aid of a Homeless Shelter

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
FOUR years ago, Andrew M. Cuomo offered to buy and renovate the once-proud hostelry that has become the rundown homeless shelter known as the Coachman Hotel in downtown White Plains. But Mr. Cuomo set a condition: the White Plains Common Council had to allow Westhelp, his nonprofit housing agency, to build 36 units of transitional housing as temporary quarters for families on welfare on city-owned land on Mamaroneck Avenue.
That, Mr. Cuomo discovered, was the end of that. 
 The plan ignited community opposition, and last September Mayor Alfred Del Vecchio and two supporters on the Council defeated it, sending the Governor's son back to his New York office amid a shower of angry words and raised fists in the Common Council chambers.
Now the County Executive, Andrew P. O'Rourke, has stepped in, proposing a plan to renovate the Coachman that seems likely to please White Plains residents. Many want better management for the shelter but oppose additional housing for the homeless in their city.
 
Westhab to Replace Westhelp
 Noting the many problems at the Coachman, including drug sales and other crimes, Mr. O'Rourke said, "The county's intention has always been to clean up the Coachman and to make a reasonable place for people to live temporarily."
Westhelp will be replaced by Westhab, another nonprofit housing agency, which will completely renovate the shelter and manage it as a Tier II complete-service operation. Westhab, like Westhelp, redirects the allocations of Federal, state and county money used to house homeless families in motels to temporary housing and comprehensive care for families.
Housing Enterprises for the Less Privileged, a statewide agency, is the largest private provider of housing for the homeless in the nation. Help, as the agency is known, and its Westchester division, Westhelp, uses available funds to build emergency apartments for homeless families in several locations, including a 108-unit complex in Greenburgh and 46 units in Mount Vernon. The now-defunct Mamaroneck Avenue project proposed in White Plains was intended to complete the Help plan for Westchester.
People in Tier II programs operated by Westhab and Westhelp stay in the temporary housing an average of six months before finding permanent housing, said Commissioner Mary Glass of the Department of Social Services, while motel residents need an average of 30 months to find permanent housing.
 
$20 Million Loan Expected
 The Westhab program, based in Elmsford, has used public money to renovate more than 400 substandard housing units in the county in the last decade.
Under the program Mr. O'Rourke has proposed for the Coachman, Westhab, with a $20 million loan from the New York State Housing Finance Agency, will lease the hotel and an adjacent parking lot from the owners, Universal Hotels, for $8.9 million and provide housing, special counseling and employment for tenants while helping them find permanent housing. The parking lot is to become a playground.
Under the plan, which must be approved by the County Board of Legislators and by the Board of Acquisition and Contract, the county will buy the hotel for $1.18 million.
"The Coachman Hotel has symbolized everything that was wrong with homeless care," Mr. Cuomo said at a news briefing. "To finally do what was set out to do, to clean up the hotel and to get families into mainstream society is a phenomenal achievement."
Westhab will use plans drawn up by Westhelp for the renovation, Mr. Cuomo said, adding: "Westhelp is not an operator. We develop and come up with model programs."
Community opposition to housing for the homeless recently flared in the Fulton Park section of Greenburgh, only a few miles from the Westhelp complex. Neighborhood residents and town officials are opposing a county plan to double the capacity of the 58-bed Kings Inn, a former motel converted to a men's shelter, which has been operated since February by Westhab.
Although Greenburgh officials have asked the county to comply with its building and zoning codes, the county has refused. Negotiations to reduce the size of the men's shelter are continuing, said Frederick Turner, the Greenburgh Town Attorney.
Mr. Cuomo will be the keynote speaker at the seventh yearly Hope for the Homeless Dinner scheduled for Tuesday, May 19, at the Rye Town Hilton. The dinner, which begins with a 6 P.M. reception, is the largest source of nonprofit funds for the homeless in the county, raising $95,000 last year. Tickets are $55. The number to call for reservations and more information is 949-3043.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
After the Riots, Washington May Be Helpless

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
As Los Angeles burned last week, it appeared that the nation might once again be prepared to look at the issues of economic growth and fairness and at the reality that the 1980's boom did not spread to the growing underclass of American cities.
There is no simple relationship between economic growth and inner-city rage. From 1963 through 1965, the year of the Watts riot, there was significantly better growth than in any similar period for almost a decade before. Now, the situation is reversed. Through the first three-plus years of his term, George Bush has presided over less economic growth than any President since World War II, even with last week's report of a mild revival in this year's first quarter. 
 Nonetheless, the sense of frustration and of hopelessness about escaping from inner-city poverty probably is similar now to what it was when Watts exploded. The statistics on such things as black teen-age unemployment are as horrifying as ever, and, to hear employers talk, many high school graduates now are less capable than their parents were three decades ago.
The market reaction to the riots in Los Angeles and some other cities was muted. The dollar weakened and a flight to safety pushed up prices of Treasury securities. But the stock market blissfully ignored the rioting on Thursday, and while selling increased on Friday, there was no panic exit. The Dow Jones industrial average finished the week up 11.63 points, at 3,336.09.
Whether that calm reaction was warranted remains to be seen. Conceivably, the specter of anarchy, and all that seems to say about this society, could deal a blow to consumer confidence, which had begun to rise because people have been feeling better about the future, not because they thought the present situation had improved very much.
The rising gap between rich and poor in this country has probably served as an aid to securities prices in the last few years, if only because it is the better-off who buy most of the stocks and bonds. Now it may serve to remind those who are well-off of the fragility of a modern society and of uncertainties much more fundamental than worries over next quarter's profits.
A generation ago, inner-city riots spurred the Government to huge efforts to address inequalities, with some positive effects. A similar effort seems impossible now. With the huge deficits that accompanied the Reagan boom and the Bush bust, a war on poverty will be difficult.
That the current economic slowdown has lasted so long has been due in part to the fact that fiscal policy was paralyzed. Investors, however, have been more than willing to believe that monetary policy, by itself, would eventually get the economy growing again, and have bid share prices up on that assumption.
It is hard, however, to see how Fed policy can do much for the problems now thrown into sharp perspective by the flames of Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
M.B.A. in Reality

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
B MINUS. That's the mark that B. Joseph White, dean of the University of Michigan Business School, gives other business schools for their efforts in preparing what he calls competent business leaders for tomorrow's challenges.
Dean White, a business school teacher and business executive who has been in his current post since July, sees some serious gaps in the education of M.B.A.'s. They may learn corporate strategy and finance, he says, but they don't learn operational effectiveness -- how to achieve world-class quality, for example. 
 That is where his new M.A.P. program comes in. It may have a dull name -- Multidisciplinary Action Project -- but it aims to corral all those new concepts about managing to regain competitiveness from the Japanese and others and teach managers how to act on the ideas.
"Business is not just an intellectual game, it's an action game," Mr. White said in a telephone interview last week.
The M.A.P. program is a business residency that places all Michigan M.B.A. students in companies like Xerox, Federal Express and Motorola for a period of real-world training. The first program began in March and ran through April.
The second part of Mr. White's thesis about M.B.A.'s is that they don't care enough about the nonbusiness systems of society -- education, health care, the justice system. He wants the executive mindset to include leadership on social, racial and environmental problems. To foster that ideal, the 420 students who entered the Michigan school at Ann Arbor for the current class were assigned to decaying neighborhoods and community service organizations for two days, an experience that led to year-long involvement for many.
The third part to Mr. White's thinking is to get students interested in helping to fill the economic void in the former Soviet bloc. The school has just set up the William Davidson Institute with a $30 million grant to assist emerging economies in eastern and central Europe. William Davidson heads Guardian Industries of Northville, Mich., a glass manufacturer with operations in Hungary. The grant came from Guardian.
Dean White, 45, says his value system was forged in a stint as a vice president at Cummins Engine, a company that he says stresses issues of corporate responsibility. He had been a Michigan faculty member in the 1970's before going to Cummins and returned to the faculty five years ago.

COMPANIES
 
Paying the Price for Violence in South-Central Los Angeles 

The riots in Los Angeles and elsewhere around the country are a profound human tragedy, with dozens killed and thousands injured. But they are also a business nightmare falling disproportionately on hundreds of small companies. "It's a mess. I can't believe they've done this," said Sonia Garcia, manager of a local food market in Los Angeles that had its windows smashed. County authorities estimate roughly that more than $200 million has been lost. "The only way to assess loss is to go in there and look at the damage, and it's not in the interest of our adjusters to go out there at this point," said Jerry Parsons, a spokesman for State Farm Insurance in Bloomington, Ill. Though more businesses are insured than during the Watts riots in 1965, "small businesses don't have the ability to make up lost time, lost money, lost production," said Ronald J. Lenney, president of a company that employs 75 people.
 
A Joint Step Toward Interactivity
 
Linking computers to television sets has long been a futurist's dream. It would enable customers to download customized entertainment from vast, centralized libraries. Last week that dream moved a step nearer to reality when the International Business Machines Corporation and Time Warner Inc., the nation's largest media company and No. 2 cable television operator, said they would join forces on an interactive TV project. The new system would allow cable subscribers to call up programs from libraries. Though it won't be ready for a decade, the companies have high hopes for the plan. "We see four industries converging: computers, consumer electronics, telecommunications and media and entertainment," said Lucie J. Fjeldstad, the vice president in charge of multimedia at I.B.M. Those industries will "form a new industry that will deliver a wide spectrum of digital goods and services to businesses and homes," she said.

Citibank's Perception Problems
 
Citicorp is like "Rashomon," the classic Japanese film. Deciphering its true nature depends upon whom you ask. For some, it is banking's biggest weakling. But for the analysts at Fidelity Investments, the nations largest family of mutual funds, it is banking's comeback kid. Last week, Fidelity disclosed that it had taken a 10 percent stake in Citicorp that it will spread among its various funds. That investment was worth about $645 million. "We're impressed with Citicorp's turnaround," said Bruce Herring, portfolio manger for Fidelity's Select Financial Services fund. Citicorp said last week it had earned $183 million or 37 cent a share, up 96.8 percent from 93 million or 17 cents a share in the first quarter last week.

No to Tarzan the Hunk Man?
 
Though Tarzan gallivants around the jungle clad in a loin cloth, the heirs of Edgar Rice Burroughs, his creator, say the ape man is really a very modest and moral character at heart. For that reason, they filed a $1 million suit against Conde Nast Publications for its 14-page "Tarzan, Meet Jane," spread in Vogue. The suit was filed in a Federal court in Manhattan. Even though the character's copyright expired long ago (he is 70 years old, after all), the suit charges that the layouts, which show a rock-ribbed, skimpily-clad Tarzan posing with a series of Janes, were too "sexually charged," and were "inconsistent with the good, wholesome and attractive images of Tarzan and Jane." In a statement, Conde Nast argued that the work was "an appropriate editorial use of public domain characters." Now it's up to the courts.

Nowhere to Run or Hide
 
A new telephone system, announced last week by A.T.& T., guarantees you can be bothered wherever you go. The new program, called Easy Reach, will assign subscribers their own "700" number. Call the number and you'll get the subscriber no matter where they are. The system, which makes use of A.T.& T.'s massive computer power, can route calls everywhere, including onto cellular networks. A "700" number will cost $7 a month with a one set-up charge of $25. But they are not intended for widespread use. Subscribers must approve would-be callers and put them on a list and can strike callers from their list whenever they wish.

Spared in the Nick of Time
 
The 990-foot luxury liner United States started its life in 1952. Its white-shoe crew set the record for crossing the Atlantic. The ship made 400 Atlantic crossings before it was retired in 1969. Last week, the United States escaped being turned into razor blades, but barely. The ship, which cost $78 million to build, was sold for $2.6 million to Marmara Investments, a Turkish shipping firm. A spokesman for the firm, said the new owners would invest $145 million, refitting it as a cruise ship.

 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Yeltsin Seeks No-Pain Gain
 
What the budding capitalists in Moscow don't realize is that a gift from the tooth fairy first of all requires the pain of losing the tooth. That much was evident last week when after joining the International Monetary Fund as a prelude to receiving up to $24 billion in Western aid, Boris N. Yeltsin, president of the Russian republic, said his country would not go along with the conditions the I.M.F. is famous for setting down. Some of those conditions -- reducing the budget deficit, reforming the farming and energy sectors and others -- can be downright painful as well as slow. "We do not intend to work under the direct orders of the I.M.F. We do not agree completely with this organization's viewpoint and we will stick to our point of view," Mr. Yeltsin said.

Olympia & York's Bad Times
 
It hasn't been the best of years for cash-strapped Olympia & York, North America's largest real estate developer. Not only has it missed payments on its $18.5 billion in outstanding loans, but last week its creditors threatened to seize the company's Toronto headquarters, the Exchange Tower. The trustees for Olympia's creditors set May 20 to discuss whether or not to take over the tower.

In Germany, Labor Awakens
 
Labor relations in Germany have been placid for years. In part, that is because Germany's labor unions, which often have representatives on the boards of the companies where their members work, have gotten a pretty good deal for their volk. Not only do they earn world-class wages, but their work week is the industrial world's shortest and their vacations are among the world's longest. But last week, that tranquility began unraveling. First the civil servants went on strike. They demanded a 9.5 percent pay increase; the Government offered 4.8 percent. Then IG Metall, the powerful metal workers union, staged a "demonstration" strike. About 130,000 of its 3.6 million members put down their tools. The metal workers want a 9.5 percent increase. Their employers offered 3.3 percent.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
A Little Economic Necromancy
 
Slow growth in the winter, getting stronger in the spring, might as well be a sentence in the fortune-telling book, the I Ching. But that is how the Government sees the economy. It is also how Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley & Company saw it. So far his forecast -- 2 percent growth in the gross domestic product in the first quarter -- is exactly in line with the figures released last week by the Commerce Department. But Mr. Roach believes this recovery will be different from those that went before it. "It will be a productivity-led recovery," Mr. Roach said. "It will be built on a more solid foundation than what's gone before it when recoveries were led by consumption," he said. Solid foundation, yes. But the problem with that kind of recovery is that it doesn't create jobs since the gains come from increased efficiency. "I see growth at 4.25 percent over the final three quarters," he said.
 
Broadway Bounce Back? Can Do
 
Tinseltown may be in the doldrums, but unlike Hollywood, Broadway is golden right now. Last week, 27 productions attracted 222,000 theatergoers. Those kind of numbers haven't been seen since 1981. Last week closed out a month which attracted 830,000 people to the shows and with box-office receipts the highest of any four-week period in New York history with a take of $30,108,322. "Guys and Dolls," which opened last month, was a major hit but "Miss Saigon," with sales of $705,154, led the pack. "The Phantom of the Opera" had $645,103 in sales. And theatergoers don't just go to see plays, they eat too. "The telephone hasn't stopped ringing for reservations," said Joe Allen, owner of Joe Allen and Orso, two theater district restaurants. "Our business is up 20 percent."

A Little More Necromancy
 
The Government's main forecasting tool the index of leading economic indicators, increased by 0.2 percent in March, the Commerce Department said last week. The indicator charts growth six to nine months hence, and those figures suggest it won't exactly be robust. But while everyone is looking ahead, Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities in Chicago, is looking in the rearview mirror. "The Commerce Department's lagging indicators were up 0.4 percent for March after declining for eight months," Mr. Kahan said. When those indicators -- which include exotica like the ratio of business inventories to sales -- are up, they signal that inflation may be in the offing. "The numbers sound a cautionary note on prices," he said.

New Homes Sales Drop Off a Cliff
 
Sales of new homes fell an astonishing 14.8 percent in March, the Commerce Department said last week. That was the steepest monthly decline in more than 10 years. Analysts said the drop was caused by rising mortgage rates and uncertainty over the attempt by Congress to enact a tax credit for some home buyers (it failed). They also said good weather in January and February lured people into making their purchases earlier. Even with those explanations -- or excuses -- analysts were worried. "It's a caution sign," said David F. Seiders, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders.

The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index jumped 8.3 points in April to 65.8, the highest reading in eight months.

HEADLINE: America -- Environmental Dictator?

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: CUMANA, Venezuela

 BODY:
Down by the docks here, where Caribbean accents mingle with a sharp scent of fish, more and more tuna boats are tied up, and more and more sailors and canners are out of work.
With American consumers inspecting tuna cans for "Dolphin Safe" labels, the United States has imposed a series of embargoes on imports of yellowfin tuna from Venezuela and Mexico. Boats from these countries kill dolphins at twice the rate of American tuna fishers. Sealed off from the world's largest tuna market since August 1990, Venezuela's tuna fleet has shrunk to 34 boats, from a high of 118 just four years ago. 
 "We are paying for the dolphins with a crime wave," Ramon Martinez, a leftwing congressman, said of the economic depression that hangs over this city, Venezuela's biggest fishing port.
Besides being responsible for Cumana's leaping jobless rate, the tuna trade embargoes have set off an international debate over an issue destined to bedevil commerce in the 1990's -- clashes between free traders and environmentalists.
"A country may not restrict imports of a product solely because it originates in a country whose environmental policies are different," it was argued recently by the world's trade umpire, the Secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Echoing this view, Laura Rojas, Director General of Venezuela's Institute of Foreign Trade, said in an interview: "The U.S. has passed domestic legislation that has jurisdiction outside of the U.S. Environmental protection can't be had at the cost of another country."
In February, Venezuela joined members of the European Community and 23 other nations in urging the United States to abide by a GATT ruling that the unilateral American ban on tuna imports from Mexico and Venezuela is illegal.
Resistance was the response from environmentalists, including Earth Island Institute, a nonprofit group based in San Francisco that initiated court action leading to the tuna ban.
"They are kidding themselves if they think that GATT can force the U.S. to abandon laws to protect the global environment," said David C. Phillips, Earth Island's executive director. "In the 1990's, free trade and efforts to protect the global environment are on a collision course."
He predicted that other conflicts lie ahead, citing plans by several industrialized nations to ban imports of ozone-depleting chemicals, plans by several European nations to ban imports of tropical hardwoods that are not cut from sustainably managed forests and a threat by Japan to submit to GATT mediation unilateral embargoes on trade in whale products and bluefin tuna, a staple for sushi cuisine.
According to GATT, such problems concerning "the global commons" should be solved through "international environmental agreements."
But with little progress being made on preparing global agreements in advance of next month's United Nations conference on the environment and development in Rio de Janeiro, many analysts believe that unilateral environmental protectionism by the world's wealthy nations may be a wave of the future.
"Tuna is the debut for a great debate between environmentalists and traders," said Oliver Belisario, a Caracas-based consultant for Venezuela's tuna industry.
Not only has the United States ignored the GATT ruling of last fall, but, in January, a Federal judge in San Francisco issued a secondary embargo against 20 nations thought to be engaged in "tuna laundering."
Suspected of purchasing Venezuelan and Mexican tuna for repackaging and marketing abroad, these nations are prohibited from selling tuna to the United States. Since February, five nations have been dropped from the list after formally pledging not to buy Venezuelan or Mexican tuna.
With Venezuelan and Mexican tuna now shut out of the United States, Australia and most of Europe, tuna landed here sells at a steep discount from world prices -- about $600 a ton, compared with about $1,000 elsewhere if it qualifies as "Dolphin Safe." A ship's tuna catch is rated "Dolphin Safe" under American consumer law only if an international on-board observer certifies that no dolphins were killed during netting operations.
"The canners used the embargo as a tool to play with prices," complained Giovanni Ombra, the owner of several tuna boats here. "Several Venezuelan ship owners had to give their boats to the bank."
Safeway Stores Inc., the largest American supermarket chain, and Star-Kist, Chicken of the Sea and Bumble Bee, the United States's top three tuna companies, only sell tuna certified "Dolphin Safe." Cans labeled "Dolphin Safe" account for up to 95 percent of the tuna sold in the United States, a nation which accounts for about half of world consumption.
"We don't even can tuna in Venezuela for Venezuelan consumption any more," said John M. Werner, president of the local subsidiary of the H. J. Heinz Company. Heinz owns Star-Kist, the world's largest tuna canner. "Heinz has a worldwide 'dolphin safe' tuna policy," he said.
Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, Venezuela and Mexico cannot export tuna products to the United States because their boats last year had a dolphin kill rate higher than the law's trigger point, which is 1.25 times the United States fleet average. Last year, American boats killed an average of 2.5 dolphins every time a mile-long purse seine net was set for a tuna shoal.
Venezuela contends that the United States has set standards that are impossibly high for third world fleets in order to protect the American fleet at a time, say the Venezuelans, when tuna demand is flat.
But demand is growing at an annual rate of 2 percent in the United States and 5 percent worldwide, according to Richard C. Atchison, executive director of the American Tunaboat Association, a trade group based in San Diego. The price of tuna has increased by an average of 6 percent worldwide since the secondary embargo was put in place earlier this year, he added.
Venezuelans claim they have reduced their dolphin kill by 75 percent in the last three years. According to varying estimates, Venezuelan boats accounted for one-quarter to one-third of the 25,000 dolphins killed last year in tuna nets in the main mortality area, the eastern tropical part of the Pacific Ocean.
To reduce the dolphin kill, Venezuela has banned drift nets, placed international observers on all tuna boats over 400 tons and required that all tuna boat captains take courses on new techniques in minimizing dolphin kills.
This month, Venezuela is scheduled to become a full member of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, a multilateral regulatory body. It has pledged $500,000 to the commission for research to find better ways to protect dolphins.
Venezuelans say that the Americans halved their dolphin kill ratios over the last decade by shifting their boats from the eastern Pacific to the western Pacific. In the eastern Pacific fishing grounds, in latitudes between California and Peru, dolphins congregate above schools of adult yellowfin tuna, a biological association which occurs less frequently in other waters of the world for reasons that are not clear to scientists.
Claiming to be prisoners of geography, the Venezuelans say it is too distant for them to fish in the western Pacific.
In addition, fishing in the eastern Pacific is largely in international waters. In the west, tuna captains have to pay royalties and access fees to governments of Polynesian island nations that control local marine resources.
"Under Venezuelan law, it is illegal to kill dolphins," said Eduardo Szeplaki, general coordinator of Fundatropicos, a Venezuelan environmental group. "Unfortunately, the profit motive leads them to violate the law."

HEADLINE: At Work;
When a White Collar Unravels

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
Most middle-class Americans -- and most Americans define themselves as middle class -- find it difficult to see the poor as anything other than objects of charity, pity or contempt. That sentiment makes all the more arresting the ramifications of a new historical study of poverty, "The Dispossessed: America's Underclasses From the Civil War to the Present."
Like the labor economists who argued in this space last week that white-collar workers should attend to the fate of their unionized blue-collar counterparts, Dr. Jacqueline Jones, Harry S. Truman Professor of American Civilization at Brandeis University, contends that the middle class has much to learn from the former slaves, migrants and sharecroppers who people her research. 
 The Civil War, she argues, so fundamentally altered social and economic relations in the United States that the changes continue to reverberate today, explaining much that goes on with respect to work, from unemployment to layoffs to affirmative action.
"The Dispossessed" traces the experience of people for whom "mobility" -- the term that when coupled with "upward" is the resonant image of the American dream -- had a literal meaning: movement from, say, one farm in rural Georgia to another, in search of another barely-living wage. The slaves and poor whites who worked the land of the antebellum South became in succession over the generations the sharecroppers, tenant farmers and migrant laborers at the heart of agriculture in the South. And when, after World War II, mechanization administered the coup de grace to a dying way of subsistence, many migrated North to become the driving force of America's postwar industrial expansion.
Today, as industry itself migrates, whether offshore or out of state, the descendants of sharecroppers might well be laid-off auto workers or waitresses at malls, either chronically under- or unemployed.
The destiny of these workers, generation in and out, was determined by economic forces far beyond their control -- dropping demand for cotton, say -- and therein, Dr. Jones says, lies the cautionary tale for today's white-collar workers, who tend to believe firmly that success or failure is a private matter between an individual and his or her will.
Second of two articles
on structural changes in work.

 "Several points," she said, summoning contrasting images of tractors and computers, link the 19th-century cotton field with the 20th-century office.
"One: The impulse to streamline and consolidate in all kinds of businesses is characteristic of American enterprise," she said. For years, "it displaced blue-collar workers. Now similar forces are affecting white-collar workers."

SHE compares the hard-bargaining attitude of Southern landowners toward the rural proletariat after the Civil War to the company consolidations, downsizing and cost-cutting measures endemic now. "Combined with computerization, they eliminate managerial positions," she said. "The banking industry is a good example. All businesses want to be more competitive. Whether they are or not, workers lose their jobs."
"Two: The fate of individual workers often rests on the sector of the economy they are in, not on how productive or hard-working they are," Dr. Jones said. "Americans must come to grips with the fact that unemployment is not a reflection of one's character. It's pegged to international transformations. This country has embraced the myth over the generations that if you're out of work, something is wrong with you."
Being in the right place at the right time -- namely, in a expanding sector of the economy -- is more important than being hardworking, she argues, chucking a poison dart at American beliefs about achievement.
"Three: No matter how secure white-collar workers are, they will be affected by the unemployment in their region," she said. Massive layoffs eventually will be felt in a deterioration in schools and police and fire services as the tax base erodes. Dr. Jones points to central Ohio, a once-robust industrial region now in decline.
The final counsel Dr. Jones offers is that historically most poor people have demonstrated a nimbleness at exploiting their meager resources that the more secure should admire: "The poor don't always do the kind of work that gets recorded, but their coping strategies belie the image of them as shiftless and lazy. They deserve credit."
 
 
 
THE CENTRAL ROLE OF RACE
 "The Dispossessed" is a history of poverty, but its central issue is race. Dr. Jacqueline Jones's elegant opening sentence -- "Poverty abides no line drawn by color or culture" -- challenges the widespread perception that poverty is a problem of urban blacks. That perception, Dr. Jones believes, is a function of the objectification of blacks by whites.
"Americans have always singled out a 'dangerous class,' especially in the cities," she said. "My work tries to point out that blacks want the same thing for themselves and their children as whites do."
Her research demonstrates that since the Civil War, whites, especially white men, have been successful at constricting black opportunity. Early in this century, inexperienced whites applying for factory work were given preference over blacks, creating an economic foothold denied to blacks. Discrimination continued to preserve opportunities for white men by protecting them from competition.
Dr. Jones is critical of the "capture" of poverty studies by social scientists obsessed with the "pathology" of urban black street culture, which, she says, represents only a small segment of the poor. "There's a notion that all whites are middle class and all blacks are poor," she said. She points out that many cities have a solid black middle class. "Nobody wants to hear about them," she said.

HEADLINE: Simplistic Formulas, Broad Generalizations

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Janine Wedel makes numerous and largely unsubstantiated critical comments regarding American assistance efforts in Eastern Europe, especially our aid to Poland ("Getting It Right in Aid to Russia," Forum, April 5). She takes highly complex issues, reduces them to simplistic formulas, then makes broad generalizations which do not stand up to closer scrutiny. 
 For example, she totally ignores the Polish-American Enterprise Fund, which has injected over $90 million into the Polish economy in the form of loans (more than 700 to small and medium-sized businesses) and equity investments. In fact, when questioned on this point during Congressional testimony, Ms. Wedel admitted she was incapable of even discussing the fund, the second-largest element of our aid to Poland. (The largest is the United States contribution of $200 million to the Polish Stabilization Fund, which Ms. Wedel admits is a success.) Similar investment funds have been formed for Hungary, Bulgaria and the Czech and Slovak Republic.
One of Ms. Wedel's many false allegations is that "United States policy insists on aiding the private sector and avoiding governments almost entirely." In Poland, the United States Government is providing assistance to government bodies dealing with finance, privatization, agriculture, energy and the environment, to name a few. The major emphasis of our program is on the private sector, but we do not shy away from assisting government institutions when it fits in with our overall strategy.

HEADLINE: The On-Time Record For PATH Trains

 BODY:
I would like to respond to several areas concerning PATH in a letter by Janet L. Grosso to the New Jersey editor on April 5.
PATH's on-time performance for 1991 was 90.4 percent. In December of that year and during the first two months of 1992, we did experience enroute delays in both our Journal Square-33d and Hoboken-33d services. These delays were caused by track conditions in several tunnel areas that required us to institute slow-speed orders in those tunnel areas. These problems did adversely affect PATH's on-time performance for this period. 
 During this period, every effort was made to minimize delays and inconvenience to our passengers. Public-address announcements and messages on our MetroVision monitors advised passengers to allow extra time for the daily commute. N.J. Transit was also advised of the problems and requested to hold connections whenever possible.
Temporary repairs have been performed to eliminate most of the track conditions that caused these problems. The slow-speed orders have been lifted, and our on-time performance levels have steadily climbed back to prior levels.
Another point raised by Ms. Grosso is incorrect. The 55 m.p.h. speed limit she refers to is the maximum attainable speed of the equipment, and PATH trains attain these speeds in the nontunnel area between Journal Square and Newark. The maximum speed for trains traveling in the tunnel areas is 40 m.p.h.
Further, PATH does have an agreement with N.J. Transit to guarantee connections. We notify N.J. Transit of all service delays and disruptions and request them to hold for connections wherever possible. N.J. Transit will hold trains upon request when operationally feasible and its schedule allows.
I want to assure Ms. Grosso and all our passengers of my personal commitment to providing consistent levels of quality services. PATH is a vital link in the total trans-Hudson network, which is essential to the economic growth of the metropolitan area. The Port Authority's mission is to improve on the levels of service and strengthen the region as a whole.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
The Russians Set Out Under Capitalists' Rules for Change

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
No other nation today seems to have Russia's natural potential to burst forth as a great economic power. It's got oil reserves, vast forests and mineral deposits, proud and capable people, rich culture and traditions. It could become a mighty producer and consumer of goods of the 21st century.
The problem -- the eternal Russian problem -- is how to get to there from here. Russia's centuries-old pursuit of wealth is a history of dead ends. In the Middle Ages, trade routes from the East that had brought prosperity shifted to the Mediterranean, and Russian towns withered. Peter the Great brought an 18th century revival by importing Western ways, but at the price of allowing an even more pernicious system of serfdom. And Communism in this century achieved huge breakthroughs in heavy industry and space technology -- until the Soviet economy collapsed. 
 Now the United States and the other industrial powers, through their agent the International Monetary Fund, are enthusiastically pushing Russia down a new road. As a condition for billions of dollars in loans, they are insisting upon a regime that drastically cuts back many of the enterprises and jobs that gave most Russians an income until the Soviet Union collapsed. It is part of a complex economic formula often applied in the West -- with so-so success, by the way -- but never attempted in a nation without a market economy. A hint of the difficulties that may lie ahead is that no one has any idea how much Russian money is worth.
"This is uncharted territory for the I.M.F.," said David W. Mullins Jr., vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who participated in talks last week with Russian officials at the I.M.F.'s semi-annual meeting in Washington. "In the end, the Russians will have to manage the transition to capitalism by themselves, and the question for us is, 'Can we play a role?' "
While the Russian Government announced last week that it will make the ruble freely convertible into dollars and other hard currencies by early summer, presumably opening the gate for trade and foreign investment, convertibility assumes prior steps that could mean upheaval and painful setbacks for what is now the Commonwealth of Independent States. "The I.M.F. formula could easily go wrong; in fact it is hard to make it go right," said Robert Heilbroner, an economics historian. "It is very hard to write a scenario in which magic happens."
First, inflation must be reduced from its present rate of more than 20 percent a month. Otherwise the ruble will keep losing value, prompting a run on dollars and quickly using up the $6 billion that the West is to make available.
But controlling inflation may be impossible now. For one thing, President Boris N. Yeltsin will have to keep reducing his Government's budget deficit so that the central bank no longer has to print new rubles to pay Government debts. This, in turn, means cutting subsidies and credits to state enterprises -- something that Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, who is Mr. Yeltsin's economics chief, promised last week to achieve.
The state-owned enterprises losing Government subsidies and credits have three choices. The one preferred by the I.M.F. and Mr. Gaidar is to make ends meet by selling, at fire-sale discounts, goods stored up in anticipation of more inflation. The more likely response, many economists say, will be widespread layoffs. And if layoffs and wage concessions don't work, the third choice, unhappily, is bankruptcy.
 
Puzzle: The Value of a Ruble
 Many problems are ingrained in decades of central planning. To figure out the ruble's value, for example, the Yeltsin Government and the I.M.F. have to determine how many rubles are in circulation -- a sum that has so far escaped calculation in a system that carries out many transactions without using money. A stable exchange rate, promised last week by July 1, also implies that products in Russia can be realistically priced. If similar shoes sell in Russia for 1,000 rubles and in the United States for $100, then an exchange rate reflecting the value would be 10 rubles for each dollar. But what price will a state-owned shoe manufacturer have to charge to cover costs once the company loses its Government subsidy? No one knows, but if the price rises to 10,000 rubles in the coming months, then the ruble's value will sink to 100 to the dollar, disrupting the I.M.F.'s efforts at stabilization.
Finally, the I.M.F. prescription assumes that the Russian economy will respond as a free market would. With price ceilings lifted for most foods, for example, Russian farmers should get enough new income to offset rising costs for fertilizer, tractors and fuel, says Russell Cheetham, who directs World Bank operations for the Commonwealth republics. But numerous monopolies, most state-owned, control the transportation, processing and retailing of food and keep the new income for themselves. "In fact, there is evidence that prices to farmers are deteriorating," Mr. Cheetham said. And the Russian Central Bank is advancing 200 billion rubles in special credits for the farm sector -- printing more money -- to finance spring planting.
Such complications made some Bush Administration officials reluctant to lift foreign exchange restrictions and declare the ruble convertible. Indeed, a convertible currency encourages giant corporations like Ford or Honda to sell cars in Russia, confident of payment in dollars or yen. Such competition could drive Russian auto makers out of business before they had time to adjust to capitalism and open markets.
Such misgivings gave way, however, largely because Mr. Yeltsin made currency convertibility a political goal, staking popularity on its early achievement. Mr. Heilbroner would prefer a Russia less locked into Western ways. "What we are watching is the birth of a new social order," he said. "It is not going to be capitalism or socialism but some combination of many elements. That takes patience and help on our part to alleviate the pain, and a willingness not to meddle while this new order is coming into being."
That is more like the Russia imagined by the novelist Nikolai Gogol at the end of "Dead Souls": "You Russia -- aren't you racing headlong like the fastest troika imaginable? The road smokes under you, bridges rattle, and everything falls behind." But, he wrote, "She doesn't answer . . . the air is torn to shreds and turns into wind; everything on earth flashes past, and, casting worried, sidelong glances, other nations and countries step out of her way."
That may have been just a touch hyperbolic when it was written, in 1842. Today, the Western diffidence is definitely missing.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
New, Virulent Strains of Hatred in the Balkans, and Beyond

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia

 BODY:
When the battle for Bosnia and Herzegovina reached Sarajevo last month, one of the first buildings damaged was the old block on the embankment of the Miljacka River beside which a 19-year-old Bosnian Serb nationalist stood on June 28, 1914, when he fired the shots that killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife Sophie. In those days, nobody doubted that events in the Balkans crucially affected the stability of Europe, and it was Gavrilo Princip's shots, prompting war between Serbia and Austria-Hungary, that led directly to World War I.
Now, with European security anchored in the diplomatic and military alliances that grew from World War II, the consequences of Balkan conflicts are less obviously dire, to all except those who suffer and die in them. Still, the artillery and mortar fire that Serb paramilitaries have rained down on Sarajevo, and the communal fighting that has killed at least 10,000 people and made 1.2 million others homeless elsewhere across Croatia and Bosnia, have broad implications for the stability of the modern world. The ghost of Princip is abroad, and those it threatens may include millions who know nothing of the historic grievances of Bosnian Serbs. 
 What is happening in Bosnia, with Serbs and Croats and Muslim Slavs killing one another with a ferocity not seen in Europe since 1945, is a measure of the potential conflicts that lie latent across Eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union now that the forces of ethnicity, religion and culture are no longer buried under the concrete of Communism. Farther afield, the events of last week in Afghanistan, with a coalition of guerrilla groups taking power from the disintegrated Communist regime, could prove to be just a pause before civil war breaks out again, this time between the various guerrilla groups and the rival ethnic, geographic and religious factions they represent.
 
'Only One Step Behind'
 Earlier this year, the belief that events in Yugoslavia were a contagion, not only within the republics of the old Communist federation but beyond them, helped to persuade Cyrus R. Vance, the United Nations' special envoy on Yugoslavia, that a United Nations peacekeeping force should be sent to Croatia. At a critical moment in the discussions in New York, Yuli M. Vorontsov, who once represented the Soviet Union and now speaks for Russia, intervened to urge that the plan proceed. "You must do this, for our sake," he said. "We are only one step behind Yugoslavia." His words apply as well to Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Romania, to cite only some of the former Communist countries that face challenges in accommodating large, restive ethnic groups. In Asia, though its Government would be the last to say so, China too is a powder keg of ethnic discontent.
Part of what doomed Communism was, of course, the Marxist-Leninist fallacy that ethnic, nationalist and religious hatreds were a product of capitalism, and that crushing the old ruling class would forge a brotherhood blind to distinctions of blood and religion. In fact, by trying to break the bonds that tied communities together, Communist repression forged the mutant strains that have now burst forth, most catastrophically in Yugoslavia. In Serbia and Croatia, what hope there was that old scores would be resolved peacefully vanished when leaders formed by the old regime rode to power in the first post-Communist elections by appealing to the most narrow-minded and vengeful instincts among peoples who had, in many cases, learned to live side by side with old enemies in a striking degree of harmony. Now, even the belated acknowledgement last week by the Government in Belgrade that Yugoslavia consists only of Serbia and Montenegro cannot stop the slaughter.
But to blame Communism for the malevolent resurgence of ancient currents is too comfortable a conclusion. While the Communists were brutal in their attempts to wipe the chalkboard of history, there was a nobility to the ideal of uniting peoples across the divides of culture and faith. In Afghanistan, what gave momentum to the small, conspiratorial Marxist party that seized power in 1978 were the country's woeful standards in education, economic development, health care, nutrition and the status of women. Now that the Kabul Government is in the hands of men who are committed to reinforcing the power of Islam, and whose political power rests in the country's maze of tribe and language, many Afghans fear that they will once more be denied the rewards of progress.
Nor is the challenge confined to countries that have thrown off the Marxist shackles. Vaclav Havel, the Czechoslovak President, has spoken of the shocks of the post-Communist era as "a long-forgotten history coming back to haunt us, a history full of thousands of economic, social, ethical, territorial, cultural and political problems that remained latent and unnoticed under the surface of totalitarian boredom." But he also says these shocks have had disturbing echoes in the West, ones that may eventually force the established democracies to examine whether their own universalist answers to the problems of human history -- political democracy, free economic markets, human rights, the elaboration of supranational accords -- respond adequately to human needs. "We must see the pluralism of the world, and not bind it by seeking common denominators or reducing everything to a single common equation," Mr. Havel has said.
Already, Western Europe has been shaken by visions out of its own past. The ethnic clashes in the old East Germany between neo-fascist groups and African and Asian immigrants, and the rising support for Jean-Marie Le Pen's anti-immigrant party in France, are only two pressing examples. And polls suggest that only a minority of Canadians believe any longer that the extension of French-language rights across all 10 provinces is an adequate response to the strivings of French-speaking Quebec for its own special degree of autonomy. In Britain, many politicians accept that something will have to be done to assuage the strength of nationalists in Scotland, and to a lesser extent in Wales.
And as soon as rioting in Los Angeles began last week, it renewed the debate in the United States about how minority rights and aspirations can best be secured, and whether there may be merit in approaches that give more leeway to the sense of a common fate among minority groups. Yugoslavia's most powerful lesson lies in the bloodshed and destruction that await when communities like the Bosnian Serbs are encouraged to believe that sectional rights rank above all others, and that in securing them no measures can be spared, not even those that inflict miseries on rival groups. But if there is another lesson here, it may be, as in Los Angeles, that no nation can rest easy as long as any community feels that it lacks guarantees of an equal spot in the sun.

Yugoslavia was born after World War I as a kingdom of the diverse south Slavs that was ruled from Belgrade, Serbia's capital. It was reconstituted after World War II as a federation of six republics. In the recent turmoil four have seceded, and Yugoslavia encompasses just two of the six, Serbia and Montenegro.

HEADLINE: CITY OF NIGHTMARES;
A Terrible Chain of Events Reveals Los Angeles Without Its Makeup

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Among the myriad layers of conflicting images that the City of Los Angeles conjures worldwide, none has been more cherished by its leaders than that of the vibrant fast-growing metropolis, the premiere world model of a harmonious and economically vigorous multi-cultural mix, a place built by optimists who came from other places to make a new life.
Last week that image turned into a different one, the kind offered up in the most terrifying of movies produced by the Los Angeles studios, a deadly mixture of "Blade Runner," "Die Hard" and "Grand Canyon." National Guard troops in full battle dress with loaded M-16 rifles stood sentinel in Pershing Square in front of a boarded-up Biltmore Hotel, Korean merchants with Uzi semi-automatic machine guns paced watchfully on the roofs of their stores, mobs of all races looted and burned not only in the heart of mostly black South-Central Los Angeles but also as far away as Koreatown, Hollywood and Beverly Hills. 
 White residents who had long thought they were remote and safe from the gang-ridden neighborhoods they knew only from television and movies cowered in their homes obeying a dusk-to-dawn curfew, bringing out hunting rifles and baseball bats for protection under a menacing pall of smoke that drifted out to the Pacific Ocean. President Bush sent in Federal police and troops. Foreign consulates issued travel warnings to their citizens. By yesterday afternoon, there were 44 dead, more than 1,765 injured -- 198 critically, some 3,767 fires in Los Angeles alone, more than 6,345 arrests and property damage in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
It was the worst possible outcome of the series of painful events that began on the night of March 3, 1991, when Los Angeles police officers were videotaped inflicting a prolonged beating on a prone black motorist, and that culminated Wednesday afternoon when an all- white jury in the conservative suburb of Simi Valley stunned the city and nation by acquitting all four officers charged.
The rage, pillaging and terror that followed the verdict brought home to Angelenos a realization that their city, with its superficial sheen of citrus trees, movie-star glitter and with-it restaurants and shops, had become a dangerous urban village where two decades of boom and growth appear to have widened the gap between rich and poor. Those looting last week were the children of blacks who rioted in Watts in 1965 or recent immigrants from Latin America for whom the Southern California dream has meant something other than pale blue swimming pools and big-fin convertibles. "We are experiencing the ugly reality of what Los Angeles has become," said John A. Arguellas, a former justice of the California Supreme Court who was vice chairman of the independent commission that investigated the police beating. "Everybody saw the videotape of the beating, but now everybody has been watching the reality of Los Angeles. It is a very, very ugly picture."
 
More Bad News for the Economy
 The events added to feelings of pessimism over the economically stricken Southern California region, already reeling from the combined effects of recession and massive cutbacks in defense spending. Tourism alone, which accounts for 360,000 jobs and generates $7 billion in economic activity annually, was devastated as hotels found themselves awash in cancellations from Japan and elsewhere. The ripples are expected to widen over the entire state, which has suffered a net loss of 690,000 jobs since the recession began in 1990 and whose government is struggling to overcome a budget shortfall that could reach $11 billion this year.
To fully comprehend the week's events was to feel a terrifying distance from those whose live out their lives on the economic and social margins of Southern California.
But the reality of the riots was much more complex than rich versus poor. South-Central Los Angeles and other minority communities from which the disorders sprang were badly divided. "There are those who feel a sense of attachment, living next door to people for whom the social contract does not exist, who are aware of how the privileged live," said Richard S. Weinstein, dean of the school of architecture and urban planning at the University of California at Los Angeles. "There is a point at which the coherence of the community is broken and anything is possible, at which those who have been marginalized act that way."
It was not the first time that the Los Angeles black community had rebelled against the police. In August 1965, years of frustration and resentment erupted into five days of rioting when a white policeman arrested a black man for drunk driving. Those disorders left 34 dead, more than 1,000 injured and a legacy of ill will so potent that the word Watts remains synonymous with black anger.
Eight years later, in 1973, voters in this predominantly white city elected their first black mayor, a former policeman named Tom Bradley. He was backed by a coalition that included the downtown white business establishment, affluent West Side Jewish voters and the black political leadership -- a diverse group united in the conviction that the city's future depended on putting aside its racist past. Mr. Bradley won wide admiration as a healer and conciliator, and under him the city truly came of age, its ports surpassing New York in volume, its downtown office space doubling over the last decade. Its proudest moment came when it flawlessly hosted the 1984 Olympic games.
The peace and harmony were only apparent. Over the last decade, powerful demographic forces began to change the urban complexion. Enormous waves of foreign immigrants arrived and began to push blacks out of Watts. Between the 1980 and 1990 censuses, the black population of Los Angeles County dropped from 13 percent to 11 percent of the population, while both the Hispanic population and the Asian population swelled. One of the most disturbing aspects of the disorders last week was the raw hostility between blacks and Koreans.
Meanwhile, older "Anglo" residents were moving farther out, to places like Simi Valley, just over the county line in Ventura County, where Los Angeles seems like a foreign country. Even the remaining Anglos mostly live in the San Fernando Valley, separated from central Los Angeles by a mountain range.
"We've got to come to grips with the fact that L.A. is segregated," said Dan Garcia, former president of the Police Commission who is now a vice president at Warner Brothers. "The distribution of power is uneven. We've got to figure out a new mechanism to talk to one another. In the San Fernando Valley the notion of the job of the police department is to protect the property and wealth of white people."
"This is a city with neighborhoods that are very distant," said Michael Woo, the city councilman who represents Hollywood, which was heavily burned and looted. "Below the cosmopolitan sheen on the surface, there is a lot of racial tension. It does not take much to lift the lid on the rules the city depends on. This is a city built by the dreams of optimists who left other places to make a better life. This is still a dream. My worst fear is that the middle class leaves and ethnic groups are pitted against each other."
 
Thoughts Turn to Rebuilding
 Yesterday, Craig Sasser, second vice president of the Los Angeles National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said profound change is possible only if black people look primarily to themselves. "We can't depend on white people to rebuild the community or wait for some handout from the government or the Los Angeles business association to make things right," he said in a telephone interview from his office in the South-Central section of the city. Mr. Sasser said he and a growing number of blacks are advocating that working blacks begin to pool their money to set up a fund to spur the return of businesses to the hardest hit areas of the city. Long before the unrest, he said, white-controlled banks demonstrated that they will not support blacks.
The question now is how Los Angeles responds to rebuilding. Many say the city needs more vigorous leadership than can be provided by the 74-year-old Mayor, whose office is so weak that he has not been able to remove Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, or by the rudderless, parochial 15-member City Council. "This is the alarm bell that if we did not respond in 1965, we certainly would be blind if we do not respond now," said Warren Christopher, the lawyer who headed the independent inquiry into the police beating. "With all our wealth and success we'd better take this second chance."
And as the events and their implications deepened, and disorder spread to San Francisco, Atlanta, New York and other cities, it was sobering to know that all this was not something confined to Los Angeles, or something that could easily be solved by local leadership. "We are the future," said Dean Weinstein. "What is happening to us here is already happening to other major cities. It is hard to imagine how these kinds of questions can be addressed without Federal attention. It means a whole reordering of domestic priorities."

Cars and VCR's Aren't Necessarily the First Domino

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Must commerce among nations always be a dog eat dog fight for absolute advantage? Economic Darwinians fear that America's loss of leadership in a few key industries is the beginning of an irreversible decline in competitiveness. A more sanguine school, which holds that industrialized economies will ultimately converge, maintains that Japan and Germany will catch up with the United States, but not surpass it.
As it turns out, reality isn't unfolding quite according to either script, some economists say. While the level of output per employee in Japan and Germany and the United States has converged since the 1950's, productivity in individual industries has begun to diverge. 
 Instead of catching up across the board, countries seem to be specializing in the things they do best. While Japan and Germany have surged ahead in some industries, the United States has widened its lead in others and stayed ahead, if by a narrower margin, in still others.
"If you lose one industry, there's no sign you'll lose them all," said Edward N. Wolff, an economist at New York University. "Just because Japan has taken over consumer electronics does not mean that Japan will triumph in mainframe computers or medical instruments."
A book by Professor Wolff and David Dollar, a colleague at the World Bank, called "Competitiveness, Convergence and International Specialization" will be published by M.I.T. Press this fall.
That pattern of specialization, which started to emerge after the early 1970's, said Dale W. Jorgenson, an economist at Harvard University, suggests that the United States still stands to gain from expanded world trade, but that it continues to face the possibility that trade conflicts will develop too.
"We can take some of their markets and they can take ours," said Professor Jorgenson. "So we will have to stamp out little moves toward protectionism and make sure our trading partners do too."
Productivity is a handy measure of an industry's competitive muscle. Industries with high levels of labor productivity tend to export a lot. "If you're the most efficient country in the world in making planes, you tend to dominate world aircraft trade," Professor Wolff said. "High productivity reflects how much investment you've poured into an industry as well as how sophisticated the technology you have."
 
'First Among Equals'

 For 25 years after World War II, the overall level of productivity among industrialized countries did converge. Productivity grew faster in Germany and Japan than in the United States during the 1950's, 1960's and early 1970's. "The U.S. was once the dominant economy," said Professor Wolff. "Now it's the first among equals."
Using output per worker as a yardstick for productivity, the United States is about 45 percent more efficient than either Germany or Japan, which are roughly equal.
Of course, using that measure instead of output per hour understates Germany's efficiency and overstates Japan's because German workers put in fewer hours on the job than Americans while their Japanese counterparts put in more.
"Many parts of Japanese businesses operate below United States standards," said Mr. Jorgenson. "Japan has world class factories in many industries, but getting things to and out of the factory is incredibly inefficient." Wholesaling, retailing and company departments like transportation and billing use methods that in the United States are considered archaic, he said. "The best example is Narita Airport -- logistically speaking, it's Idlewild 30 years ago."
But ever since the early 1970's, the gap in overall productivity has narrowed far more slowly. Why? After the first oil shock in 1973, Japan's overall productivity growth rate fell from 10 to 3 percent a year. United States productivity growth fell also, but only by 1 percentage point.
The fact that Japan was no longer catching up in overall productivity was masked, said Professor Jorgenson, by the vast appreciation of the dollar in the early 1980's. Even as Japan's domestic economy slowed, its exports exploded and the United States lost overseas markets and saw a flood of imports.
In any case, the United States and its main rivals have specialized in different industries. German bankers, it seems, are the world's most efficient. Small wonder. The United States has more than 12,000 banks, the Germans a dozen or two. Meanwhile, America's high-tech farms boast productivity 4 times as high as Japan's and 2.5 times as high as Germany's. Japan's electronics industry is twice as productive as Germany's and slightly ahead of United States electronics companies.
America's lead is actually growing in perhaps one-third of its industries including agriculture, wood products and food processing, which is really a clutch of industries that churn out everything from cigarettes to cereal to Coca-Cola.
Japan surged ahead in cars and trucks and, despite resurgent American competitiveness in steel and semiconductors, in metals and consumer electronics.
And in lots of industries, the United States is hanging on to its lead. That includes building materials, heavy machinery, computers.
Germany Slowing Down Suprisingly, the United States widened its lead over Germany during the 1980's, not only in overall productivity but in most manufacturing industries. Mr. Wolff attributes that reversal from earlier decades to the fact that German industry didn't face the same cold blast of world competition spurred by a too-strong dollar that woke American manufacturers to the need to boost efficiency.
A second reason, perhaps more unexpected, is that the United States invested more in manufacturing than Germany did in the 1980's.
Mr. Wolff is convinced that countries specialize and achieve leadership in those industries where they invest heavily in new plant and equipment. Investment not only gives each worker more equipment to work with but it also puts the latest technology in his or her hands.
And research and development is just as important.
"The U.S. is still the leader in aircraft because of heavy R. & D. spending, some of which came via the Pentagon," said Professor Wolff. "Likewise, medical equipment research is heavily subsidized by the National Institutes of Health."
In the 1950's and 1960's Japan and Germany mainly caught up by imitating United States technology. But Americans should take note that, since the 1970's, new investment has played the primary role.

Nostalgia and Need Conjure Up Thoughts of the W. P. A.

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

 BODY:
Works Progress Administration: Its bland, ungainly name was strictly Government-issue, but perhaps no other social program has left Americans so misty-eyed with nostalgic recollection. Speak the initials W. P. A., and the mind's eye turns to the bold posters of brawny workers and the grainy photographs of the things they built -- the bridges, schools, airports, culverts and courthouses that still line the American landscape.
But this is also the program that catapulted the word boondoggle into common political usage. It inspired two Congressional investigations, set off riots in New York City and brought accusations of Communist infiltration. 
 Now, 50 years after its demise, the W. P. A. is back in the news. Last month a handful of Congressional Democrats led by Senator David L. Boren of Oklahoma introduced legislation to create a new W. P. A. for people on welfare. Critics again cry boondoggle, but supporters say the poor would get the dignity of real work and the public, the tangible products of their labor.
The Boren plan would retain the current welfare system for mothers with young children and those enrolled in training programs. Others would have to take public works jobs for up to 32 hours a week.
The legislators acknowledged that with today's budgets, a pilot program might be all they can expect. But with welfare rolls setting new records every month -- more than 4.6 million families now rely on the system -- politicians from President Bush on down are seeking election-year advantage by calling, without specifics, for fundamental change. That, says Mr. Boren, is what his plan offers.
The trade-offs today are, in some respects, similar to the ones that Franklin D. Roosevelt faced: creating jobs has civic virtues, but mailing checks is cheaper.
Roosevelt tried it both ways. He mailed relief checks in 1933, then started and canceled a jobs program after recoiling from its costs. In 1935, concerned about the dole's demoralizing effects, Roosevelt gave jobs a second try, issuing his famous admonition that welfare not become "a narcotic." The phrase has been quoted often since -- most recently by President Bush -- but rarely in its original context of expanding government aid.
Harry Hopkins, the program's administrator, turned the W. P. A. into an undertaking of unparalleled proportions. It came to employ 3.3 million people nationwide. There were 200,000 in New York City alone, a work force larger than the national payroll of any private corporation.
Takeoff, not surprisingly, was bumpy. Work crews were said to spend the days moving leaf piles from one side of a street to the other. Unions struck over the program's refusal to pay wages equal to those of the private sector.
 
'Boondoggling'

 Exasperated after just four months, New York City's first program director sent Mr. Hopkins a confidential memo, calling the jobs strategy a "boondoggling" approach.
But in the view of Barbara Blumberg, a historian at Pace University and the author of "The New Deal and the Unemployed: The View from New York City," (Bucknell University Press, 1979), the surprising thing about the W. P. A. wasn't its initial difficulties, but the breadth of projects it bestowed. Nationwide about three quarters of its money was spent on construction, as workers built or improved 651,000 miles of roads, 39,000 schools and 464 new airfields, including New York's La Guardia. The program sent housekeepers to the sick, teachers to prisons. Ms. Blumberg calculates that by 1940 its dentists filled 1,000,000 New York City cavities.
The W. P. A.'s arts programs consumed only about 5 percent of its budget. But the guidebooks, poster art and theater productions contribute disproportionately to its elan. Here is a welfare program that claims among its alumni Saul Bellow, Richard Wright, Jackson Pollock, Orson Welles, John Cheever and Ralph Ellison.
Was it efficient? Ms. Blumberg said construction projects could run three to four times the cost of private work, in part by design, since they avoided cost-saving machinery in order to hire more workers. But, she noted, no number of welfare checks ever patched roads or fixed teeth.
Among the program's problems was its start-and-stop funding, with Roosevelt repeatedly having to seek appropriations supplements. It created jobs for only about a third of those who wanted them, and pay scales, which varied by skill level, were often meager. When 1936 cuts laid off 20 percent of the work force, New York City workers rioted.
 
Best and Worst
 In 1938, the House Un-American Activities Committee began looking for Communists, and indeed it found some. When the Gallup group asked Americans in 1939 what they liked best and least about the New Deal, the answer in both cases was the W. P. A. Congress then placed strict new limits on the scope of its work, and the program shrank for several years more. It died in 1943, rendered inessential by the war that had roused the American economy.
At its peak the W. P. A. spent $2.2 billion in a year. Ballpark estimates of what a similar program would cost today top $30 billion.
Could it work today?
The W. P. A. had at least one great advantage: a labor force vastly more skilled than most people now on welfare. A more relevant comparison might be the public employment effort undertaken by the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of the 1970's. Public employee unions, wary of low-paid competition, sharply limited the projects C. E. T. A. could undertake, and it foundered on familiar charges of make-work. Defenders say it raised skills, but it has left no romantic aura.
Not so the W. P. A., which brought rhapsodic tones, though no subsequent action, from none other a Big Government critic than Ronald Reagan in a radio interview a month before his election as President. "W. P. A. -- some people have called it boondoggle and everything else. But having lived through that era and seen it, no, it was probably one of the social programs that was most practical in those New Deal days."
And if someone were to propose a set of similar projects today? "I think it could be most helpful," Mr. Reagan told his radio audience.

HEADLINE: RIOT IN LOS ANGLES: Pocket of Tension;
A Target of Rioters, Koreatown Is Bitter, Armed and Determined

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 2

 BODY:
The nation's largest Korean-American community is grim, armed and determined to repel racial violence in its riot-scarred corner of the city.
A vigilante Korean security force, wearing white scarves, is patrolling the burned and looted shops of Koreatown, the economically vibrant enclave just north of the sad streets of South-Central Los Angeles, where black and Hispanic residents struggle with poverty and crime. 
 Today, with an uneasy peace settling over the city after hundreds of their businesses were destroyed, the Koreans stood armed inside their shattered store windows.
The shopkeepers voiced outrage at the slow response of the police when their community came under attack Wednesday night and Thursday. And they expressed despair over the sudden destruction of American success stories that had taken lifetimes to build.
"Why did it happen?" said Carl Rhyu, a member of the community's security force. "That's a good question."
He was among a group of armed Koreans on the rooftop of Lucky Electronics who, in a sign of the general tension and confusion in the area, held a brief standoff Friday night with crouching National Guardsmen that ended when the two sides figured out who the other was.
 
Lightning Rod for Anger
 "I think the black people are jealous of the Koreans," he said, voicing a gut feeling that many Korean residents express privately but are too careful to state in public. "They're lazy; we are working hard. They're not making money; we are making money."
In the South-Central area, where Korean shops have become the object of resentment even as they provide what is often the only retail service to residents, some shopkeepers climbed ladders to remove the Korean lettering from their signboards. At the Korean consulate, where National Guardsmen stood watch, an identifying plaque had been covered up by tape.
Yumi Park, the former director of the Korean American Grocers Association, said about 600 Korean-owned retail outlets had been damaged in the South-Central area and about 200 in Koreatown.
Lawrence Aubry, a member of the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission, said Korean merchants had become a lightning rod for the discontent of some black residents. Many blacks in Los Angeles have remained poor as, one after another, immigrant groups have arrived and climbed past them to prosperity.
"It's illogical, but it's convenient to target the Koreans," he said. "Why were they burning the businesses that serve them? Why has that anger not been vented at the educational system that has failed them? Why weren't the employment offices burned to the ground?"
In place of the scenes of rioting and burning today, more than 5,000 people, most of them Koreans, gathered in Koreatown for a demonstration and march protesting the violence.
 
On the Defensive
 Defending the armed response of the Koreans, Mr. Rhyu said, "If it was your own business and your own property, would you be willing to trust it to someone else? We are glad the National Guard is here. They're good backup. But when our shops were burning we called the police every five minutes; no response."
One of the most gripping and, increasingly, controversial television images of the violence was a scene of two Korean merchants firing pistols repeatedly from a military stance. The image seemed to speak of race war, and of vigilantes taking the law into their own hands.
But this morning, amid the empty shelves of the Western Gun Shop, the two men spoke in anger and despair of the failure of the police to protect them, of the collapse of their American dream, and of a sister and sister-in-law who are now hospitalized with gunshot wounds fired from a crowd of looters.
"I want to make it clear that we didn't open fire first," said David Joo, manager of the gun shop. "At that time, four police cars were there. Somebody started to shoot at us. The L.A.P.D. ran away in half a second. I never saw such a fast escape. I was pretty disappointed."
 
'Please Call Ambulance'
 The incident occurred outside Park's Wilshire Jewelry, which is owned by Richard Park, who also owns the gunshop.
More than 200 people had converged on the mall where the jewelry shop is situated, Mr. Park said, and the shots came just as his sister and sister-in-law were trying to flee. His sister was wounded in the leg and his sister-in-law in the kidney and stomach, he said.
"I scream: 'Please call ambulance. Please, somebody hurt. Somebody crying. Please call ambulance. Ambulance,' " Mr. Park recalled. "But when a lot of shots were fired, everybody left.
"I don't know if I am wrong or not. People say I am wrong. What am I going to do? Just sit down and die? I am going to protect my store and my family and myself."
Mrs. Park, the former director of the Korean American Grocers Association, estimated that there were about 6,000 Korean retail outlets in Los Angeles County, a main source of livelihood for the 300,000 to 400,000 Korean-Americans who live here. There are more than a million Korean-Americans in the nation.
When Jewish shop owners left the South-Central area after the Watts riots of 1965, Asian businesses began to move in, and over the last decade the Koreans have become overwhelmingly dominant there, while also developing the Koreatown enclave.
Across much of the poorest area of the city, the only shops to buy groceries or liquor or gasoline, or to have clothes cleaned or a car repaired, are owned by Korean immigrants.
The Koreans have become the focus of black resentment since the videotaped fatal shooting by a Korean grocer of a 15-year-old black girl, Latasha Harlins, last year. The resentment boiled over last November when a judge declined to send the grocer, Soon Ja Du, to prison after she was convicted of manslaughter.
 
Few Choices for Koreans
 Since then, some black groups have led boycotts of Korean shops. The owner of one of those shops, John's Liquor Store, closed the business and sought a black buyer as part of an agreement with the boycotters. The business remains unsold six months later, Mrs. Park said, leaving local residents with one less place to shop.
Bong Hwan Kim, co-chairman of the Korean American Alliance, which was formed to ease tensions in the community, said most Korean shop owners will have little choice but to try to reopen their businesses.
Without the English language or the resources to compete for business in more affluent areas, and with too much pride to return in failure to Korea, he said, they will go back to face the dangers of doing business in the South-Central neighborhood.
Cosmos Appliance was one of the first Korean stores to be smashed and looted on Wednesday night when angry demonstrators burst northward from the South-Central area after the acquittal of four white police officers who had been shown on videotape clubbing and kicking a black motorist, Rodney G. King.
The owner and a group of friends and relatives took up arms and barricaded themselves inside amid the shattered televisions and video machines. As the looters approached again in the morning, they followed their progress on a Korean language radio station, much as Los Angeles residents follow traffic reports on the crowded freeways.
 
'Nobody Showed Up'
 "We called the police and nobody showed up," Michael Kim, one of the armed defenders, said this morning. "There was a fire burning across the street for three hours and nobody came."
At mid-afternoon Thursday, with the store barricaded and guarded, several cars drove back and forth outside, firing at the windows, Mr. Kim said, "and we shot back at them."
Nobody was hurt, but Mr. Kim and his wife, J. Kim, remained angry this morning at the failure of their new country to protect them. "We took 15 years to build this up, and in two days it is gone," Mrs. Kim said.
At Western Gun Shop, Mr. Park said 20 years of struggle in America had crumbled around him.
"Why did they do it? Everything in my store is gone, even the ball pens. They've broken the empty showcases. Why? They burned all my papers. Why? Even the empty checkbooks, they threw into the street. Why?"
Mr. Park said he had come to America as a student and had since brought seven brothers and sisters to join him. "I love this country," he said. "America is a dream."
For 20 years, he said, "I am working, working, working. I work 10, 12, 15 hours a day, hard, hard working. My whole family is working," he said. "But that day that happened, nobody helped me. Everybody ran away. Now everything is gone."

HEADLINE: Sarajevo's Center Erupts in War, Weakening Yugoslav Truce Effort

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, May 2

 BODY:
A fierce battle involving tanks, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades erupted today in the center of Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, raising fears that efforts at achieving peace there may be swept away by Serbs fighting to consolidate gains made in a monthlong offensive for Bosnian territory.
For weeks, the center of Sarajevo, a city where Muslim Slavs outnumber Serbs, has been the scene of sporadic sniper exchanges and mortar and artillery attacks from the surrounding hills. But at lunchtime today, the cobbled streets and alleys erupted into what a Yugoslav Army spokesman in the city described as "all-out war." 
 The fighting pitted army tanks and armored personnel carriers backing the Serbs against heavily armed militiamen fighting for the Muslim Slav and Croat populations.
 
Vista of Destruction
 At dusk, with the fighting continuing, reporters on the scene described a vista of blazing government buildings, bodies of fighters and civilians lying in the street for hours after the fighting began, artillery and mortar shells pouring down from the hills used for the 1984 Olympic winter games, and of close-range fighting in the narrow alleys of the Bascarsija district, heart of the old Muslim city.
The European Community's 12 nations and the United States granted Bosnia and Herzegovina recognition as a state independent from Yugoslavia early last month, continuing the dismemberment of the nation.
Bosnia, home to an ethnic mix in which Serbs are heavily outnumbered, thus followed Croatia and Slovenia, two other former Yugoslav republics, out of the union despite efforts by Serbia and the remnants of the Yugoslav power structure in Belgrade to fight in Croatia and elsewhere to keep as much territory as possible.
Tonight, the Yugoslav press agency Tanyug reported that Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian President, who is a Muslim Slav, had been arrested by the Yugoslav Army at the Sarajevo airport when he returned from the Lisbon talks aboard a European Community jet. The report said Mr. Izetbegovic had been taken to the Lukavica army barracks outside the city, and it quoted him as having told a Yugoslav radio reporter: "I was brought to Lukavica by force. The army waited for me at the airport. I am virtually a prisoner."
Army commanders gave conflicting accounts of the incident, some saying that Mr. Izetbegovic was offered protection when it became clear that there was no safe way for him to enter the city, and others saying that he would be released when a cease-fire made it possible for the army to collect its dead and wounded.
In the confusion today in Sarajevo, there were conflicting accounts of which side started the battle, and each side blamed the other. There was also confusion late in the day, when a cease-fire was reported and the fighting abated somewhat. But shellfire and machine-gun fire continued into the night.
The political trigger for the battles came 12 hours earlier, with the collapse of peace negotiations in Portugal under European Community sponsorship.
The chief negotiator, Jose Cutileiro of Portugal, blamed the collapse on Serbian leaders' failure to honor important commitments that they gave under a cease-fire agreement reached in Sarajevo on April 23, including pledges to dismantle barricades around Sarajevo and to withdraw artillery trained on the city.
 
Sarajevo's Worst Nightmare
 European Community attempts to still the fighting received a further blow today, when a Belgian officer posted in Bosnia as an observer died from stomach wounds inflicted by an exploding shell near the town of Mostar, 50 miles southwest of Sarajevo. The officer, who was not named in the European Community announcement of his death, was the sixth community observer to be killed here this year. Five Italians died in January when their helicopter was shot down by the Yugoslav Air Force.
The battle in Sarajevo fulfilled many of the worst nightmares of those who have sought a peaceful settlement in Bosnia. The fighting from street to street, with few parallels in any European city since the 1956 uprising in Budapest against Hungary's Communist rulers, sent thousands of people who had been out shopping and relaxing in the spring sunshine scurrying for cover in doorways, hotels and basements. One major downtown hotel was hit by at least four artillery shells.
A BBC reporter said in a broadcast received in Belgrade that the fighting was the worst he had seen in nearly a year of civil war in Bosnia and Croatia, which broke away from Yugoslavia last year.
No reliable estimate of the number killed and wounded was available, but a spokesman for the Yugoslav Army said its units had suffered "terrible casualties" in fighting around an officers' club and the army headquarters, both in the center city district that lies a few blocks back from the Miljacka River.
The area is only a short walk from the site of the most renowned incident in Sarajevo's 500-year history, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria along the river embankment in 1914. The assassination led directly to the outbreak of World War I.
The fighting involving forces of the Serb-led Yugoslav Army and Serbian irregulars has scarred Croatia as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina. A fourth republic, Macedonia, has declared its sovereignty but has not won international recognition because of a dispute with Greece over its name, and the two remaining republics, Serbia and Montenegro, joined in establishing a new, truncated Yugoslav federation earlier this week.
 
Seizing Bosnian Land
 In Bosnia, Western diplomatic efforts have sought to persuade the three principal groups in the population of 4.3 million, Muslims Slavs, Serbs and Croats, to accept a Swiss-style constitution giving each group extensive autonomy within ethnic cantons.
Serbian leaders, backed by Serbian-based paramilitary groups and by the Serb-led Yugoslav Army, say that they will accept that, but their military offensive of the last month appears to have been aimed at seizing as much as 70 percent of the republic for the 31 percent of the population who are Serb.
The offensives, which have been accompanied by counteroffensives by Muslim Slav and Croatian fighters, have killed at least 300 people and created a tide of refugees not seen in Europe since World War II. According to United Nations figures, nearly 450,000 Bosnians, a 10th of the population, are already homeless.
Among Muslim Slav and Croatian leaders, the Serbian offensives have been seen as an attempt to consolidate Serb territories in the republic for later annexation to Serbia. After today's fighting broke out, those leaders asserted that the Serbs, emboldened by the failure of the United States and the European Community to follow through on threats of diplomatic and economic sanctions against Serbia if it did not halt the Bosnian fighting, have decided to make a final push for control of the Bosnian capital.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Europe Backs Greece on Name
 GUIMARAES, Portugal, May 2 (Reuters) -- The European Community yielded to pressure from Greece today and agreed to recognize the breakaway Yugoslav republic of Macedonia only if it changed its name.
 The community is "willing to recognize that state as a sovereign and independent state, within its existing borders, and under a name that can be accepted by all parties concerned," community foreign ministers said in a statement.
Greece, a member of the European Community, has strenuously opposed recognition of an independent state called Macedonia, saying that only the Macedonia region of northern Greece is entitled to the name.

HEADLINE: RIOT IN LOS ANGLES: At the Epicenter;
Decades of Rage Created Crucible of Violence

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 2

 BODY:
Large flakes of ash drifted to the ground as the basement of a church in the city's South-Central section began filling up Thursday evening with refugees from the fear and the fire sweeping through the streets.
Michael Ming, a 23-year-old college student, stood outside in the falling dusk and watched a building burn to the ground a block and a half away. It had been burning for 12 hours. Gunshots echoed through the dimness, and a little girl asked her mother if they could go home. Their home, her mother said, was in flames. 
 Mr. Ming had gone to the church that desperate and dangerous night to answer its call for aid, a call written on a banner draped across the face of its modern building: "Brothers, come help us stop the madness."
 
Ambivalence About Rioters
 "Yeah, it's madness," Mr. Ming said of the riots, touched off by the acquittal of four white Los Angeles police officers in the beating of a black motorist. "But it's also understandable. And if the social conditions don't change, it will happen again and again and not just in L.A."
Like most people here, Mr. Ming condemned the violence and mourned the dead and the newly homeless. But he and a broad range of others, from solidly middle-class blacks like Al Myles to young Hispanic residents like James Garcia, also expressed ambivalence and guarded admiration for the rioters' rage at "the system."
The explosive violence here had been smoldering for 27 years, said scholars, ministers, advocates and residents of the city's arson-scarred and riot-torn neighborhoods in more than two dozen interviews.
Many said the acquittal of the four police officers charged with using excessive force in the beating of the black motorist, Rodney G. King, was only a spark put to a tinderbox of anger constructed from years of deep poverty, governmental neglect, racism, charges of police abuse and high unemployment.
Warren M. Christopher, a Deputy Attorney General under President Lyndon B. Johnson who headed a commission that investigated the beating, said the acquittal "uncorked" the same resentment and frustration that burned through Watts in 1965 and this time spread its flames and death across a much larger swath of the city.
In an interview Friday, he said the city had made a crucial mistake after Watts, a mistake that has returned to haunt Los Angeles and other cities: when the fires were put out and the troops were gone, the problems and people of Watts received only half-hearted assistance in rebuilding their neighborhood and lives.
"This is a second opportunity to get at some of the underlying causes," Mr. Christopher said. "You don't get very many second chances."
 
Rainbow of Rage
 But unlike the Watts riot, which was largely within the predominantly black neighborhood, this week's violence and arsons were spread out, and the rioters included black, Hispanic and white residents, displaying a growing sense of despair.
The riot was a rainbow of anger.
"The police treat us very bad, too," said Mr. Garcia, a 17-year-old Hispanic high school student. "People want justice. They hit Rodney King; we hit them. It cost them money to do us wrong this time."
Although residents were quick to assail Chief Daryl F. Gates as part of the problem, they did not volunteer criticism or praise for the longtime black Mayor of this city, Tom Bradley, a former police officer.
On the surface, the history of tension and trouble between the police and black and Hispanic residents was at the heart of what happened here. For many, the riot was a simple message to the authorities and the larger society: Treat us right. We've been pushed too close to the edge.
"Almost everybody I know has been harassed and much worse by the police," said Ervin Mitchell Jr., 31, a design engineer from South-Central who was standing with Mr. Ming. "Young blacks and Hispanics have been persecuted, beaten and pulled out of our cars because of stereotypes. We're tired of being treated like garbage. We're tired of living in a society that denies us the right to be considered as a human being."
 
Disgust All Round
 Mr. Ming added: "But it goes way beyond that. The way the whole entire system is structured, the rich get richer, the poor get poorer. It provides almost no hope for most folks, especially black folks."
Not far away, and several hours later, Walter Thompson, 19, stood on a sun-soaked street corner with his friend Cindy Edwards, 16. Ms. Edwards said she was disgusted with the verdict, and with the looting. Which was worse was a tossup, she said.
"Now I don't have a store to go to," she said. "We had two. They burned one down. The other, they looted."
Mr. Thompson cut in and said the looting should have occurred in Simi Valley, the predominantly white suburb where the trial of the four officers was moved.
"That's where the enemy is," he said.
Then, like many others, he bitterly cited the slaying last year of a 15-year-old black girl, Latasha Harlins, as evidence that blacks are treated unfairly by what he called "the prejudiced criminal justice system."
 
Bullet in the Rubbish
 Miss Harlins was shot in the back of the head by a Korean merchant after a dispute in a grocery store. That shooting, like the beating of Mr. King, was captured by a video camera. The merchant was convicted of manslaughter and given five years probation.
"We're mad for a whole lot of reasons," Mr. Thompson said, raising his voice and stepping closer. "First that 15-year-old girl was killed and they got away with it. Then they beat Rodney King like a dog and the jury sets them free. The black people don't get no justice, nowhere, no time."
Telling him to be calm, Ms. Edwards gently pulled Mr. Thompson away. "This has really hurt us," she explained.
Across the street, a growing band of young people was led by the actor Edward James Olmos in cleaning up the riot-ravaged street. They swept up large piles of broken class, charred beer cans, green olives and even a bullet or two.
 
Joblessness and Anger
 The lack of decent jobs in the inner city, especially for teen-agers, was another reason given for the days of rage.
"I don't think it's very difficult to figure out" why the riots happened so intensely, said Ramona Ripston, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. "As far as I can see," she said, "we have a lot of young people, 15, 16 years old, no programs to keep them in school, no jobs, no health care, no stake in society. It's a form of civil war. America had better wake up."
South-Central residents said that while outrage about the verdict and lack of meaningful opportunity motivated many rioters, plain lawlessness pushed many more into stores for looting.
"Some people say this is because of Rodney King," said Yolanda Gnat, 33, as she searched for an open store in the area to buy milk for her baby. "Others are doing it just to be doing it. A lot of people probably never even heard of Rodney King. They're doing it because it's like Christmas in the springtime."
 
Refuge in a Church
 Steve D. Valdivia and his staff at the Community Youth Gang Services have been on the violent streets since the rioting began.
"The first-night reports from my staff were scary," he said. "They said they had never seen such hatred and despair in people's faces. We've seen this coming. Everything was building up to this. There have been a number of shootings of minority kids. And now everybody is upset about the verdict. Young people always act out the frustrations of a community."
The Rev. Cecil Murray has turned his church, the First African Methodist Episcopal Church, which Mayor Bradley attends, into a shelter from the riots and the fires burning in almost every direction nearby.
Thursday night, 100 men, women and children, mostly black and Hispanic, crowded into the basement, sleeping and talking on a forest of green cots set up inches apart by the Red Cross.
"Earthquakes is what we're trained for," a Red Cross volunteer said.
Many people watched the riots on two television sets, one tuned to a Spanish-language station.
"That's my house," a woman said, pointing to a building engulfed in flames on the television screen.
One television stayed on throughout the night. So did several babies.
Mr. Murray swept through the room, talking with the children and praying with an 80-year-old woman who had to be carried from her apartment building in a blanket.
 
Gang Cooperation
 That night, David Madise, 30, stood on a dark sidewalk, watching over First A.M.E. and its basement of scared strangers.
"I came out to help," he said. "I'm just making sure everything is cool."
He spent the worst nights of the riot in front of the church and saw two men struggling up the hilly street, pushing a big screen television set in the middle of the night.
They asked him to help but he refused.
"Since this started, I've seen Bloods and Crips working together like crazy, looting and carrying away everything they could get their hands on" he said, referring to the city's infamous and usually rival street gangs. "They didn't care about colors. That was a big change."
 
'Land of Crazy Folks'
 The next day, Mr. Murray said sending in the National Guard was "only a Band-Aid" approach to deep-seated problems.
"The War on Poverty became the war on the poor because it was poorly managed," he said. "America is creating a land of crazy folks. Crazy situations create crazy people."
The situation has been extremely crazy for Eddy Zapata and his family. They were burned out of their home on Wednesday and spent two days living with his sister-in-law in a small and overcrowded apartment.
On Friday, the 39-year-old freelance auto mechanic took his wife and two children, 6 years and 1 month old, to Mr. Murray's church. The riot took everything from the struggling family -- their house, clothes, tools and maybe their hope.
Holding his baby daughter in his lap, Mr. Zapata said he had no idea what the family would do now.
 
Everyone Lost Something
 "We lost everything," he said. "For the last three years I have been trying to make it on my own with my shop. Now it is gone."
The entire city has lost something during these days of violence: businesses, homes, sons and daughters and trust.
Al Myles, a 38-year-old businessman, lost another fragile piece of his faith in "people of color ever really winning our equal rights."
"To me, this feels like a complete duplication of the Watts riot," Mr. Myles said. "The verdict sent a clear message: that there's only one kind of justice and it doesn't apply to people of color in any way.
"I don't condone what's happening, but how else are you going to get the idea across that we're tired of this abuse?" he said. "They haven't listened to us in courts or the ballot. But this time it's not just blacks who are upset. I think everybody is upset with injustice, with the lawlessness of the law."
With that, he took a deep breath and looked sad.

HEADLINE: Medicad Plan Promotes Nursing-Home Insurance

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
In an innovative move affecting long-term care for the elderly, New York State plans to encourage middle-income residents to buy nursing-home insurance in a program that would exempt them from onerous Medicaid limits on personal wealth.
Those who buy the insurance, which would also cover care at home, would no longer be forced to impoverish themselves to qualify for state-financed care. State officials hope the program will help slow steep growth in New York's $6 billion-a-year Medicaid budget for long-term care. 
 Under the plan, people worried about Alzheimer's disease and other debilitating illnesses could buy insurance from private companies that would pay for up to three years of nursing-home care or six years of home care. If they required additional care, those who bought the policies would automatically be entitled to Medicaid without having to "spend down" their assets, said Mildred Shapiro, associate commissioner of the medical assistance division of the State Department of Social Services.
"Spending down" is the practice, common among older people, of transferring securities, real estate and other assets to trusts and relatives to qualify for Medicaid.
 
Dumping Assets
 Insurance companies have offered long-term care policies nationally for at least a decade, but only about two million have been sold, according to the Health Insurance Association of America, a trade group. Most people resist buying them until they are in their late 60's, when only the most expensive policies guarantee lifetime coverage. Those who buy less-costly policies still risk having to spend down to go on Medicaid when coverage runs out.
Federal Medicaid officials approved New York's plan in February. The State Legislature authorized the program in 1989 and is expected to approve "technical changes" that have been made since then, Ms. Shapiro said. Insurance industry executives said they were confident that the State Insurance Department would allow them to sell the long-term care policies by fall.
 
Who Qualifies Now
 Connecticut and Indiana recently started similar state-approved insurance programs, and California is awaiting Federal approval. Participants in those three states could keep a dollar in assets for each dollar of long-term care insurance they bought. New York residents would be allowed to keep all their assets if they bought a state-approved three-year policy.
Insurance executives predicted that thousands of New Yorkers would buy the policies. But several consumer advocates criticized the plan, saying that few elderly people could afford the insurance and that the Federal Government should develop a national program for long-term care.
To qualify for Medicaid now, a single person in New York must have no more than $3,050 in assets. The spouse of a nursing home patient is allowed to keep $68,700 in assets and the family home, under a Federal law that was passed at the urging middle-income people to protect the spouse. The plan would continue limits on income: $6,100 a year for a single person getting home care and $8,900 a year for couples on Medicaid. A nursing home patient would be allowed only $50 a month in income, but the spouse could have $20,616 in income.
Nursing homes in New York State charge private patients, on average, $62,000 a year, and in the New York metropolitan region, $69,000. The average stay in a nursing home is 32 months, Ms. Shapiro said.
The policies would provide at least $100 a day for nursing home care and $50 for home care, she said.
Ms. Shapiro estimated that annual premiums would be from $1,500 to $2,000 for people who buy the insurance at age 65 and $400 to $600 for those who do so at age 40. Insurers would need state approval to raise premiums, but benefits would increase by 5 percent compounded annually to protect against inflation.
 
Plan Has Its Skeptics
 Robert Freedman, a Manhattan lawyer who is vice chairman of the elder law section of the New York State Bar Association, said the program would allow middle-income residents to purchase the kind of insurance that only the wealthy can now afford. "If you have $8 million, you get insurance," he said. "If you have $100,000, you can't afford it unless you have a high pension."
Ms. Shapiro said the new long-term care policies were expected to appeal most to people 65 and older. They would need at least $20,000 in annual income to afford them, she said, adding that there are about 700,000 such New Yorkers.
But Mae Hall, an 80-year-old widow who is president of Seniors Helping Seniors, a Manhattan advocacy group, was skeptical. "I can't afford that," Mrs. Hall said of the new insurance, although she said her income was around $20,000 a year.
And Rose Zirolnik, 74, a registered nurse in New Rochelle, said she would have to see the fine print. "I would have to do some homework to see if what the state is going to do makes sense and fits my pocket," she said.
 
Savings Seen for State
 The program could eventually generate substantial savings in New York's $6 billion annual Medicaid budget for long-term care -- nearly one-fourth the national total of $25 billion, proponents said. Without it, the $6 billion is expected to more than triple, to $23.5 billion, by 2010 because of inflation of medical costs and growth in the number of elderly people who require long-term care, they said.
Medicaid now covers 85,000 nursing home patients in New York and 150,000 receiving home care. Half of the state's nursing home patients use up their savings and qualify for Medicaid within nine months of admission, she said. Many others "spend down" assets more than 30 months before they enter nursing homes so they can qualify for Medicaid as soon as they arrive.
At least six insurance companies -- Metropolitan Life, Travelers, John Hancock, Amex Life Assurance, CNA and Finger Lakes -- have told state officials that they are interested in selling the new policies in New York.
A vice president of Metropolitan Life, James B. Weil, said several large employers and labor unions in New York State hoped to buy the policies once they were approved.
An executive of the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, Linda Berg Maney, noted that New York State's "seal of approval will give a lot of people peace of mind."
But Gail Shearer, a policy analyst with the Consumers Union in Washington, maintained that the plan was not fair to poor people who could not afford the insurance and would still have to spend down their meager assets to qualify for Medicaid.
And Diane Archer, executive director of the Medicare Beneficiaries Defense Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group in New York, said, "What we need is a national health-care program available to all people."

HEADLINE: April 26-May 2: Red-Tape Agenda;
Ban on New Rules Renewed, Angering Conservationists

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

 BODY:
Sometimes those wounded in the Bush Administration's war on red tape wonder whether the red tape was ever the target. The Administration announced last week that it would extend a 90-day freeze on new Federal regulations for several months, saying it had done wonders for the economy. But conservation groups argue that most of the rules being held up are the ones that restrict strip miners, oil refiners, automobile makers, property developers and others that threaten the environment. Other rules get changed if the Administration feels like it, they say.
As an example, they cite an 85-year-old rule that lets anyone object to the sale of a stand of National Forest trees. The rule gives the public 45 days to object, and shuts off the chainsaws for another 115 days while the Forest Service responds. The Forest Service wants to make objectors go to court to stop any sales, but local conservation groups say that would break them financially. 
 The Forest Service and the timber industry say slowed-down sales are raising home lumber prices. Environmentalists reply that ancient trees on public lands are sold far too cheaply and that private tree farms can supply the lumber and preserve jobs.

HEADLINE: Planner Offers Russia as Open Market

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
In his five days of meetings here, Yegor T. Gaidar, Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister, sketched a sweeping yet detailed vision of Russia's economic future, including plans to make the ruble convertible by July 1 and to speed up privatization.
Mr. Gaidar, who is chief architect of Russia's economic reforms, said he would put an emphasis on increasing oil and agricultural production. 
 He said the transition to a market economy would last through most of the 1990's and would be "socially depressing," but he talked of Russia as a land of go-go capitalism, with huge opportunities for foreign investors.
"It is the country of the big possibilities," he said. "It is probably the most important market for risk and venture capital."
 
Polls Bring Confidence
 At news conferences and at meetings with American, European and International Monetary Fund officials, Mr. Gaidar vowed to speed reforms, although he said the Government would continue to face hostility from the Russian Parliament over its program.
The Cabinet sees a window of opportunity to press ahead, he said, because recent opinion polls have given higher ratings to the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin despite the pain brought about by removing price controls and adopting other reforms. Countering predictions, labor unions have for the most part backed the shift toward a market economy, he noted.
The 36-year-old economist made it clear that July 1 would be a pivotal date for Russia. He said he hoped that Russia would sign a reform agreement with the International Monetary Fund by then that would make billions of dollars in I.M.F. and World Bank loans available.
Echoing recent remarks by Mr. Yel tsin, Mr. Gaidar said Russia would not allow the I.M.F. to dictate its policy but that he hoped that his country's plans would easily gain the organization's approval. He and Michel Camdessus, the I.M.F.'s managing director, agreed that there would be disputes over some issues, like how many new credits can be allocated to sinking enterprises.
 
A Single Ruble Rate
 In a speech to the United States Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Gaidar outlined plans to create a single exchange rate for the ruble by July 1 to replace the varying and confusing rates that exist now. Different rates are currently in place for tourist and for business transactions.
Mr. Gaidar said that creating a single rate would essentially make the ruble convertible and would be a crucial step toward setting up the $6 billion ruble stabilization fund promised by 11 industrialized nations.
He said he would like to peg the ruble to the dollar, but allow the Russian currency's value to fluctuate within a range of 7.5 percent. Economists say that stabilizing the ruble against foreign currencies will help create an anchor for Russia's often-arbitrary pricing structure, by linking its prices to those elsewhere in the world.
Georgi Matyukhin, president of Russia's central bank, said in Washington this week that he expected the stabilization fund to take effect in the last three months of 1992. American, European and I.M.F. officials say that not only Russia, but other republics that use the ruble as well, will have to do more to reduce their budget deficits and money supply growth before the fund can be set up.
Mr. Gaidar said Russia was working closely with the former Soviet republics of Belarus and Kazakhstan to rein in their money supply, and the I.M.F. is expected to press the republics to do the same. He complained about Ukraine, which seems undecided on whether to create its own currency or stick with the ruble.
He seemed to be pressing Ukraine to keep using the ruble, saying republics that establish their own currencies would probably have to import Russian oil, not in rubles, but at world prices and in hard currency.
 
Quiet Pressure on Republics
 The Group of Seven leading industrialized nations and the I.M.F. are quietly urging republics to stick with the ruble. They worry that the establishment of new currencies in different republics will cause trade to plunge, just as Soviet trade with Eastern Europe declined after the countries stopped dealing on a ruble basis.
Impressing questioners with his knowledge of every nook of the Russian economy, Mr. Gaidar outlined a plan to begin privatizing big state-owned enterprises this fall.
He said privatization would at first be focused on several sectors, including building materials, construction, food processing, farming and light industry. The Government hopes to establish a voucher system enabling the cash-poor public to acquire shares in the companies, he said.
Most economists say privatization is vital because it forces management to care more about profits, efficiency and competition, and thereby helps hold down inflation.
Mr. Gaidar said the Russian Government privatized 20 times as many enterprises in April as in all of 1991, collecting 3 billion rubles in April compared with 200 million for all of 1991.
"The most important thing," he said, "is to try to privatize as rapidly as possible and to try to create a property structure that would be regarded by society as more or less just, that will not create a terrible redistributionary conflict that will undermine political stablity."
 
Workers Get a Stake
 Workers in many state-owned companies asked that ownership be turned over to them for free; to placate them, the Government plans to give workers 25 percent of a company's shares for free, but without voting rights, in major privatizations.
Workers will be able to buy an additional 10 percent of their company's shares, with voting rights.
Managers also often wanted to be given outright ownership of the enterprise, but Mr. Gaidar said managers would be able to buy 5 percent of the shares on a preferential basis.
The Government is also auctioning off stores, and workers are given a 30 percent discount in buying their shops.
In Mr. Gaidar's view, the decline in oil production is one of Russia's most critical problems because it has reduced oil exports, a crucial source of hard currency. He said the Government plans a vast increase in domestic oil prices to encourage conservation at home, to provide more money for the domestic industry and increase the amount available for export.
He said Russia was opening up the gold and oil industries to foreign investment, a move that should bring in new equipment and thereby help increase exports.
 
Lassitude on the Farm
 He said Russia had created 60,000 smaller units from huge collective farms but that much more must be done to privatize the farm sector and make it more efficient. One factor hurting farm production, Russian officials say, is that many of the brightest, most energetic young people from the countryside moved to the cities during the Communist era.
Mr. Gaidar said Russia would impose an import tax, not to protect its industries but to raise revenue and reduce the nation's trade deficit. He said that an export tax was also needed to raise revenue, though he admitted it might discourage some foreign companies from investing in Russia's natural resources.

HEADLINE: How Dinkins Strove to Keep the Peace

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
At 6:30 Wednesday night, Mayor David N. Dinkins received a telephone call in his private quarters at Gracie Mansion, his official residence. The message was urgent. A jury had just acquitted four white Los Angeles police officers in the beating of Rodney G. King, a black motorist.
The danger was obvious, recalled Leland T. Jones, the Mayor's press secretary. The King case had been a well-publicized symbol of police brutality to many, whites as well as blacks. The acquittal of policemen, often a flashpoint for violence in urban communities, had brought Los Angeles to the brink. Could New York be next? 
 For the next three days, Mr. Dinkins and his aides would struggle to prevent that. They cajoled, pleaded with and warned community leaders who were likely to lead demonstrations -- like the Rev. Al Sharpton and the Rev. Herbert Daughtry -- to keep them from turning violent. They also urged television news directors to use caution in their broadcasts, given the racially charged nature of what they were showing.
At the same time, Mr. Dinkins, elected as a conciliator at a time of racial tension, made numerous appearances in which he condemned the verdict. He urged restraint but also sent a message to those tempted to respond with rage: Violence would not be tolerated. He told Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown to prepare for the worst.
So far the Mayor's approach appears to be working, with only a few scattered incidents of violence Friday night, including a stabbing in Harlem. "I'm pleased that things are relatively calm in the city," Mr. Dinkins said yesterday after a walk along 125th Street in Harlem. During the walk, he said he had come to thank people, "especially the young people in our city, for the restraint they showed."
Administration officials, recalling their actions over these crucial days, said the Mayor's response had been refined by the experience gained in handling racial clashes last summer in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, after a car driven by a Hasidic Jew struck and killed a black child.
What follows is an account of the 72 hours after Mayor Dinkins heard of the verdict in Los Angeles.
 
Wednesday
 6:30 P.M.: After receiving the call at Gracie Mansion -- and despite his general practice of not criticizing jury verdicts -- Mr. Dinkins instructs his aides to draft a strong statement, expressing his outrage but appealing for calm.
Mr. Dinkins immediately calls Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch Jr., his chief political strategist, who handled racial conflicts in Crown Heights and Bensonhurst. They decide that the best way to stave off violence in New York City is with the help of religious and community leaders.
Despite his dislike for unplanned television interviews, the Mayor and his aides agree that he will make regular appearances on the evening news programs until the potential for violence is over. As he leaves a banquet for city education awards at the Equitable Center in midtown Manhattan, the Mayor holds brief on-camera interviews with reporters for the late television news programs on WCBS and WABC. His message is the same: The verdict in Los Angeles was unfair, he says, but there is no need for violence.
 
Thursday
 10:45 A.M.: The Mayor receives a call at City Hall from Vice President Dan Quayle, who is planning to visit New York later in the day. Mr. Quayle informs the Mayor that the President is planning to have the Justice Department and the F.B.I. review the King case with the possibility of bringing Federal civil-rights charges.
11:00 A.M.: The Mayor meets with his aides to discuss the rioting in Los Angeles and its impact on New York. It is decided that he will meet with clergy and community leaders at Gracie Mansion the next day to solicit support in keeping the peace.
11:30 A.M.: At a news conference to announce an economic development trip to Europe, Mr. Dinkins denounces the violence in Los Angeles. But says he understands the anger and frustation at the verdict. The Mayor also relates his conversation with Vice President Quayle and says he is encouraged by the promise of Federal action.
Noon:: Bill Lynch and Fritz Alexander, Deputy Mayor for Public Safety, arrange meetings with community leaders and law enforcement officials and monitor activities throughout the city.
5 P.M.: Mayor appears on each of the local evening news programs. His message is unchanged from the day before: He appeals for calm and expresses dissatisfaction with the Los Angeles verdict.
 
Friday
 8:30 A.M.: As the bloodshed, looting and destruction mount in Los Angeles, the Mayor holds a meeting at Gracie Mansion with 125 community and religious leaders to discuss how best to keep the peace. "Don't let this turn into another Crown Heights," says Mordechai Levy of the Jewish Defense Organization. Mr. Dinkins seeks to allay his concerns.
The leaders, including Mr. Sharpton, express their concerns about possible violence and how the police will respond. But they also agree to use their influence to calm the situation. Mr. Dinkins and the others then hold a news conference.
9 A.M.: The Police Department opens a telephone line that residents can call to get accurate information on trouble in the city. Later, the concerns of the police are borne out when a host of rumors, most unfounded, sweep the city, leading many businesses to close and thousands of commuters to head home early.
11 A.M.: The Mayor holds a meeting with law-enforcement officials to discuss the city's response. He relays the fears of community leaders that the police could overreact or use excessive force in handling disturbances -- thus worsening a tense situation. He also commends Mr. Sharpton for his cooperation in keeping the peace.
1 P.M.: The Mayor calls news directors at television stations to praise them for being responsible in their coverage of the Los Angeles riots.
3 P.M.: Panic begins to spread throughout the city that there will be rioting. A television station invites the Mayor to interrupt programs to issue another appeal for calm. Mr. Dinkins declines the offer, saying he will wait for evening news programs to avoid the appearance of a crisis.
5:30 P.M.: Mayor Dinkins goes on the evening news programs once again, commending New Yorkers.
6:15 P.M.: Mayor Dinkins holds a cabinet meeting at Gracie Mansion to discuss his strategy for the weekend. At the Mayor's invitation, community leaders are also there.
7:30 P.M.: Reports begin to circulate of scattered violence, and the Mayor stops by the command center at Police Headquarters.
10 P.M.: The Mayor appears on the late night news programs.
 
Saturday
 1 P.M.: Mr. Dinkins, accompanied by a police bodyguard, walked into the All Seasons Shoes store on 125th Street. "He was just talking about, 'Keep the peace, and no rioting,' " said Kang Lee, who works there. "He was checking on all of the businesses to see if they were O.K."
Mary Baker, owner of Mary's Hair Gallery, felt Mr. Dinkins "should have been doing this a long time ago, not waiting for something to happen."
"All the people shook his hand and spoke to him," Ms. Baker said. "I don't think they gave him a chance to discuss nothing, they were so busy shaking his hand, they were so pleased to see him."
As Mr. Dinkins walked through Harlem yesterday he could not help but remind many New Yorkers of another Mayor, John V. Lindsay, who at a very different but also difficult time had walked the streets of the ghetto and urged calm.
But this time the voice was of the city's first black mayor, who had some claim to understanding the pent-up frustration he had been trying so hard to contain. "Remember," the Mayor said, "no matter how frustrated and distressed we all are over what has occurred, violence and destruction are not the answer."

HEADLINE: U.N. Chief's First 4 Months: Red Tape Cut, Feathers Ruffled, Funds Exhausted

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 2

 BODY:
After four months on the job as the United Nations' sixth Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali of Egypt has acquired a reputation as an active and formidable diplomat not afraid of ruffling feathers in an organization with a legendary resistance to change.
He moved swiftly in his first eight weeks to overhaul the senior levels of the secretariat in New York. And he helped push the Security Council into new, high-risk peacekeeping operations in Somalia and Yugoslavia in addition to the demanding and expensive missions it had already taken on in the Western Sahara and Cambodia. 
 At the same time, he promoted peace efforts in Afghanistan and boldly threatened to pull the 28-year-old peacekeeping force out of Cyprus if feuding Greeks and Turks do not patch up their differences this year.
But the paradoxical consequence of all that activity is that Mr. Boutros-Ghali now finds himself presiding over an organization that seems exhausted. It has run out of money to pay for new peacekeeping operations just as demand is soaring for what many see as its most useful functions in the post-cold-war world. It even lacks staff to mediate fresh disputes.
With the United Nations peacekeeping bill expected to quadruple this year, from more than $700 million to about $3 billion, and the Bush Administration unwilling to ask a reluctant Congress for more funds in an election year, Mr. Boutros-Ghali has been forced to call a halt to new operations.
"It is not realistic for us to accept any new peacekeeping operations this year," the Secretary General said in a recent interview. "We haven't got the money, so they would be at the expense of other operations. Also our own staff is overloaded."
 
U.N.'s Full Plate And a Tight Budget
 The issue came to the fore during United Nations efforts to halt the civil wars in Somalia and the former Yugoslav federation. Before he took office, Mr. Boutros-Ghali called it "a disgrace" that the United Nations had watched Somalia disintegrate into bloody anarchy without lifting a finger and vowed to intervene.
Similarly, he pushed the Security Council into intervening in the Yugoslav civil war, saying it was necessary to risk a peacekeeping operation in Croatia even though the factions might go on fighting.
But in Paris this week, Mr. Boutros-Ghali told President Francois Mitterrand that France's request for a second Yugoslav peacekeeping operation, to stop the latest civil strife in Bosnia and Herzegovina, was unrealistic unless the Europeans find a way to pay for it.
At the same time, he is also backing America's demand that oil-producing Persian Gulf states pay for most of the proposed Somali operation because the Bush Administration is unwilling to ask Congress for extra money.
The United Nations is not even seeking to play the role of mediator in those conflicts. It is ceding the task in Somalia to the Organization of African Unity and the Arab and Islamic organizations it belongs to. In Yugoslavia the European Community has taken on the job.
"Our plate is full," Mr. Boutros-Ghali said. "The United Nations Charter specifically gives regional organizations first responsibility for mediating disputes. They may not have our experience but they have more resources and they can learn."
 
Personal Liberation And Decisive Moves
 The fast initial pace the new Secretary General set himself generally has drawn plaudits in the northern industrial world, though the reaction among third-world countries has been more mixed.
"His early actions have been received very positively, though we still haven't seen his long-term vision for the organization," said Edward C. Luck, head of the American United Nations Association.
Sir Brian Urquhart, former Under Secretary General in charge of peacekeeping and now at the Ford Foundation, said, "It has been rather an impressive start."
A fast start also distinguishes him from his more cautious predecessor, Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former Peruvian diplomat who stepped down and retired at the age of 70, the age at which Mr. Boutros-Ghali took over the post.
The Secretary General says he has acted decisively because the changing world climate gave him the chance to do so and "decisiveness is the best way to get things done".
He insists his administrative reforms reflect a belief that such changes are unavoidable if the organization is to take advantage of the opportunities the cold war's demise has given it.
But some of those who know him well suspect his surprising outburst of energy also reflects the sense of personal liberation the top United Nations job has finally given him.
 
France's Choice Has Rocky Start
 A small man with immense charm as well as a keen and irreverent wit, Mr. Boutros-Ghali comes from one of Egypt's most prominent Coptic Christian families with a long tradition of public service. His grandfather was Prime Minister and his father Minister of Finance.
Fluent in English, French and Arabic, he also represents that fading strata of cosmopolitan Egyptian society, equally at home in Cairo and Alexandria or the capitals of Europe, that was immortalized in the four novels of Lawrence Durrell's Alexandria Quartet.
Educated at universities in Paris and New York, Mr. Boutros-Ghali enjoyed a highly successful career in the Egyptian foreign service, playing a key role at the Camp David negotiations that led to Egypt's recognition of Israel and eventually reaching the No. 2 spot in the Foreign Ministry before becoming Deputy Prime Minister.
But Egyptians say his Christianity and his Jewish wife have always denied him the very top posts -- until now.
"Tariq Aziz, another Christian Arab, could became Iraq's Foreign Minister, but that's not the Egyptian way," said Richard E. Murphy, a former Assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs who is now with the Council on Foreign Relations.
Mr. Boutros-Ghali was far from being the Security Council's unanimous choice as Secretary General. France, which had backed him from the outset, engineered his selection, in the process outwitting the United States and Britain, which had shown only lukewarm support.
And although the choice satisfied the third world's demand that an African get the job, the light-skinned Egyptian was not quite what Sub-Saharan Africa had in mind.
Neither was his arrival at the United Nations entirely smooth. A close Egyptian aide he brought with him had to flee the country almost the next day after being charged with sexual harassment by a maid at a New York hotel.
 
Posts Are Filled, Bureaucracy Yields
 Nevertheless, the new Secretary General set himself a 60-day deadline to streamline the upper ranks of the Secretariat along lines largely recommended by the United States and a group of other countries.
Defying those who said the organization's intractable bureaucracy would never yield, he ended a chaotic system under which some 28 Under Secretaries General reported directly to him, dividing the United Nations work into eight departments, each headed by an Under Secretary General, with two more in charge of its offices in Geneva and Vienna.
But he also left many veterans of the organization gasping with disbelief by ignoring the usual careful regional sharing of top jobs.
Half the No. 2 posts went to citizens of the five powers with permanent Security Council seats and another four to citizens of other European countries. As a result, James O. Jonah, a respected long-serving staff member from Sierra Leone, ended up as the third world's sole representative among the organization's second-ranking officers.
The Secretary General even invited President Bush to nominate an American of his choice to the organization's top budget and management post in deference to Washington's complaints about inefficentcy.
Not surprisingly, many third-world governments were irritated by the job allotments and the apparent diminishing of United Nations economic and social activities in favor of its peacemaking role.
 
Putting Emphasis On Prevention
 But there was little they could do about it, since the author was a third-worlder member whose candidacy they had supported.
The new appointments are only for a year, so early 1992 is likely to see further streamlining at the top of the Secretariat as well as compressions at lower levels.
In the meantime, Mr. Boutros-Ghali is pushing for another administrative reform of considerable potential significance.
He wants to start consolidating the separate information and other offices the United Nations and its agencies maintain across the world into single units that he calls "United Nations Embassies."
Not only would that cut wasteful duplication, but such offices could serve as his "eyes and ears" in sensitive areas, he said, reporting to him on emerging disputes before they erupt into conflicts and helping him resolve them.
But not everything has gone well for Mr. Boutros-Ghali since taking office. His first news conference, delayed until March, was a disaster.
With nothing new to announce, he was ignored by the Western press but still managed to infuriate Muslims by suggesting that Israel has no obligation to surrender occupied Palestinian lands and refusing to intervene in the Kashmir dispute.
 
Management Style? 'More 19th Century'
 Subsequently, the Security Council's decision to impose an air embargo on Libya exposed him to further criticism from the Arab press.
The organization's staff unions are also becoming increasingly suspicious about his long-term administrative plans, asserting that he is failing to keep them informed of his intentions.
Earlier this month, Edward Freeman, head of the largest union, which represents 32,000 of the United Nations systems 54,000 employees, called Mr. Boutros-Ghali's secretive management style "more 19th century than 21st century" and accused him of planning new staff cuts next year.
Such complaints seem unlikely to affect Mr. Boutros-Ghali, who says that where administrative change is concerned, his experience in the Egyptian bureaucracy taught him "stealth is essential."
The Secretary General is equally frank about his biggest challenge -- money -- and particularly American money since the United States is currently almost $1 billion behind in regular and peacekeeping dues.
"Resources could cause this organization to fail just when it should succeed," he said.

From the Louisiana bayous to the arid plains of Texas and Oklahoma, thousands of oil and gas wells, abandoned at the end of their productive life, have become conduits for noxious liquids that bubble up from deep below the earth's surface to kill crops and taint drinking water.
For state governments in America's oil patch, these abandoned wells have become an expensive legacy left by a fading industry. 
 The Federal Environmental Protection Agency estimates that there are about 1.2 million abandoned oil and gas wells nationwide and that some 200,000 of them may not be properly plugged. In Texas alone, officials calculate there are 40,000 to 50,000 abandoned wells that could pose pollution problems.
Often drilled to depths of a mile or more, oil wells typically tap into sandy formations permeated with a brine that is up to four times saltier than sea water and that is laced with radioactivity, heavy metals and other toxins. Without extensive and costly plugging, that brine can flow up the well shaft and seep into fresh water aquifers or sometimes reach the surface.
Occasionally the brine from abandoned wells hits the surface with explosive force. In the last few years it has erupted through a parking lot in San Angelo, Tex. Mixed with natural gas, it spewed into the backyard of a home in Bartlesville, Okla., and oozed onto a freeway construction site in Tulsa.
 
Slow, Insidious Process
 But the damage is usually slower and more insidious. A single unplugged exploration hole in West Texas leaked brine for 22 years before being discovered, polluting the ground water beneath 400 to 600 acres of land, a 1990 study by the Bureau of Economic Geology at University of Texas found.
Many of the problem wells date to a freewheeling time before the oil business kept records or was regulated. In Texas, state records indicate that the sites of some 386,000 wells were never registered.
And it was not until the mid-1960's that the oil-producing states enacted regulations to protect fresh water supplies by requiring that hundreds of feet of cement be poured into the wells at different levels in the process of closing them properly. A majority of the wells listed as plugged in Texas records were plugged before the rules were in place.
 
Plugging Style of Past
 "We've found leaking wells from the old days that were rock-plugged, bucket-plugged, tree-stump-plugged and even one plugged with nothing more than a glass jug because back then they didn't give a darn and they just stuck whatever they had down the hole," said Wayne Farrell, director of the San Angelo-Tom Green County Health Department in West Texas.
Oilfields are primarily the province of state, rather than Federal, regulators. They have usually been overseen by agencies like the Texas Railroad Commission or the Oklahoma Corporation Commission whose primary purpose is to promote the oil industry rather than protect the environment.
The dangers posed by abandoned and improperly plugged wells began to attract attention from state officials only in the mid-1980's. The oil industry was a cherished source of revenue, and there was little research to distinguish contamination in oil fields from the naturally occurring salinity common in places like West Texas.
Since 1990, both Texas and Oklahoma have created funds specifically dedicated to plugging abandoned wells by imposing new taxes or fees on companies drilling or operating oil wells. Louisiana, which has 1,493 abandoned, unplugged wells listed as awaiting action, eliminated money in its budget for plugging wells this year because of a state budget shortage.
With exhausted fields and low prices driving down production, the number of wells abandoned by bankrupt operators has increased rapidly since the mid-1980's. Last year, Oklahoma began plugging 260 wells that were orphaned when a single company went bankrupt. The average cost is $4,000 a well.
Lena Guerrero, chairwoman of the three-member Texas Railroad Commission, said: "In a very short time Texas has gone from denial, to saying maybe there's a problem but there's no money to fix it, to now where we're saying there's a real problem and we can find the resources."
Declining production has brought other problems as well. In depleted fields, wells commonly pump more than five barrels of brine for every barrel of oil, and those vast quantities of brine are often forcefully injected back into the ground. The goal is to dispose of the brine and increase pressure in the oil-bearing formation so that more crude can be extracted from a nearby active well. But if an improperly plugged well has penetrated the formation, the added pressure helps push the brine up that shaft.
 
Threat to Wildlife, Too
 Ken Kramer, director of the Texas Sierra Club, said that abandoned wells "pose the most extensive and most critical environmental problems caused by oilfield activities, but they are not the only ones." The storage of brine and other wastes in open pits is another source of water pollution as well as a hazard to wildlife, he said.
"But among those problems," he said, "the seepage of brine from unplugged wells into fresh water aquifers can be the most difficult to identify and clean up because it is hidden pollution, taking place underground."
In the oil patch of Oklahoma and West Texas, brine formations lay at depths of 1,000 to 8,000 feet, where they are under tremendous pressure. Many strata of virtually impermeable rock lay between the brine and the fresh water aquifers, which are near the surface down to depths of 500 feet. Water moves laterally across the aquifers, slowly but across great distances, to streams and creeks.
The future health of these aquifers is a growing concern in Texas because they feed big river systems like the Colorado and the Brazos. Major cities, ranches, farms and electric power plants all the way to the Gulf Coast depend on these rivers.
The short-term problems are visible on Ralph Hoelscher's West Texas farm, where there are patches of land so salty that even weeds will not grow.
Last year, Mr. Hoelscher planted salt-tolerant Bermuda grass in a field his family has farmed since the turn of the century. But after a heavy rain all the plants in a quarter acre patch were dead. Months later their roots still looked as if they had been burned by acid and the ground was caked white with salt.
Mr. Hoelscher thought he had found the cause in 1989, when a plow knocked something below ground and brine started flowing. It was a well, listed as properly plugged, that had been simply capped with a steel plate and covered with dirt.
Then he discovered that there was a row of 10 unplugged exploration wells along one side of his property. The 1990 study by the University of Texas found 1,000 of these wells in Tom Green County, where Mr. Hoelscher farms.
 
Legal Solutions Difficult
 With so many potential culprits, seeking recourse through the courts is often impossible for someone like Mr. Hoelscher. Even if the source of contamination can be identified, the companies responsible for the problem well often ceased to exist long ago.
Having the evidence and knowing some companies responsible still does not mean a legal solution is at hand. When the freshwater aquifer that supplied the central Oklahoma town of Cyril, population 1,200, was declared unsafe because of brine pollution in 1989, there was little doubt that the oilfield below it was at fault.
Brine pumped up with oil had been disposed in open pits from the 1920's to 1960, when that use of pits was prohibited. There were at least 44 abandoned, unplugged wells in the field, and since 1972 brine had been pumped through injection wells at high pressures.
But the town's $11 million Federal suit brought against two oil companies was dismissed this week when a judge ruled that the statute of limitations had expired.
For now the sole remedies lie with state efforts to plug problem wells with money collected from current operators. But there may be a time limit on this strategy.
Last week there were 623 drilling rigs exploring for oil and gas in the United States. That was the lowest number since Baker Hughes Inc., the Houston-based oilfield service company, began keeping count in 1940.
Under current plans to plug 200 wells a year, it could take Oklahoma a century to take care of its estimated 15,000 to 20,000 abandoned or improperly unplugged wells. And Texas, with the most ambitious oilfield cleanup program of any state, intends to plug 1,000 wells a year. Under that schedule, the job could be done in 50 years, presuming that no more wells are abandoned.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Centrist Council Exults In Success of a Member

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, May 2

 BODY:
In some quarters, the Democratic Leadership Council has been denounced as a reactionary group of white, male, Southern politicians who would ruin the Democratic Party by rejecting its traditional constituencies and embracing Republican thinking.
But when Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas returned here today to speak to his old colleagues, it was as the leader of a newly matured movement that has now all but hijacked the rest of the party, forcing it onto a centrist policy track that its leaders hope will take the Democrats back to the White House this year. 
 Along the way, the council has broadened its base somewhat, gained some black members and forced the rest of the Democratic Party, which has lost five of the last six Presidential elections, to take it seriously.
It has been a swift change for the group, which held a somewhat fractious convention in Cleveland last year that left liberals uncomfortable and some black Democrats complaining that they had been muscled out of the process.
 
The Politics of Success
 The change results from the politics of success. As Mr. Clinton, one of the group's founders and a former chairman, has emerged as the likely Democratic Presidential nominee, other party members have fallen in line. And now the council, considered an insurgent rump group little more than a year ago, has significant influence over Mr. Clinton's policy agenda.
In his speech at the council's annual meeting here today, Mr. Clinton credited the group with his success, but then began a treatise on the subject that has made the group most uncomfortable: race.
"I know we have been hurt by a leadership without a strategy to restore our economic strength," he said of the Bush Administration. "I know that we have been hurt by a leadership that was irresponsibly divisive, denying of America's problems."
Some of the fiercest critics of the leadership council have now endorsed Mr. Clinton, including Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio, who formed the rival Coalition for Democratic Values, which takes more liberal positions, and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, who spent much of his Presidential campaign criticizing Mr. Clinton and his wing of the party as phony Democrats.
He now says that was all posturing, but Mr. Harkin, who withdrew from the race in March, is perhaps the best example of a liberal Democrat who has shelved his differences with Mr. Clinton to take a stab at party unity. At a rally in Pittsburgh last week, Mr. Harkin conceded that he "took some good shots at Clinton myself" during what he called a primary process of "constructive debate."
"But that constructive debate is over and past," he added.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the two-time Presidential candidate who once said D.L.C. stood for "Democratic Leisure Class," is the notable exception. He has refused to endorse Mr. Clinton and had another squabble this week with council leaders who had invited him to address their convention.
But many of the party's other old-school liberals, including Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, have climbed aboard the Clinton bandwagon, signing onto a set of policies that are nearly indistinguishable from the platform of the leadership council they once viewed as suspect.
 
Uniting Two Positions
 Mr. Clinton took a long step today toward melding the traditional Democratic approaches to racial issues with the more centrist ones advocated by the council, calling national service programs, beefed-up community policing and tenant participation in management of public housing as examples of ways to head off future problems like those in Los Angeles and other cities this week.
A 19-page document distributed as a "discussion guide" at the group's meeting, titled "The New Choice: Draft for a Democratic Platform," read like a Clinton campaign document. Its introduction declares, "We are prepared to offer America a new governing agenda that expands opportunity, rewards responsibility and fosters community."
Mr. Clinton's own policies, as embodied in the standard speech he delivers on the campaign trail, are nearly identical to the positions set forth by the council, in part because many of Mr. Clinton's closest advisers are affiliated with the group.
"Bill Clinton is the person who told me that change is never easy," said Al From, the executive director of the council. "Some of the ideas that we proposed went against the old orthodoxies of the Democratic Party. We wanted to change the status quo and you take hits along the way when you do that."
The centerpiece themes of Mr. Clinton's standard speech, including his discussion of personal responsibility, are lifted almost entirely from the council's manifestoes. He and the council also agree on allowing parents to choose public schools, enforcing child support orders, allowing capital gains tax breaks for original investment, tying welfare benefits to education or job-training goals and starting national service and apprenticeship programs for young people.
Mr. Clinton has won warm approval for many of these ideas as he campaigns. Indeed, some of his most reliable applause lines seem borrowed from the council's speech writers.
"His argument carried the day," said Robert J. Shapiro, vice president of the Progressive Policy Institute, the research arm of the leadership council, said of Mr. Clinton. "When the campaign began, a lot of people thought this was a debate we had been through before between left and center. The Progressive Policy Institute and the D.L.C. spent the last three years thinking through this debate, which is not left-right but old-new.
"One of the reasons Governor Clinton succeeded and everyone else fell very quickly was some people were in a debate that the country wasn't listening to anymore," he added.
 
Claiming Victory
 As if to shore up that impression, the leadership council, never shy about self-promotion, asked the poll-taker Daniel Yankelovich to study on how well its ideas were working. The study assembles information drawn from national polls and concludes that most Americans favor demanding more from welfare recipients and instituting a national service program, and they share an underlying anxiety that the country is headed in the wrong direction.
The euphoric organizers of the group are confident their message will play best with voters in the fall general election, who tend to be more independent and less liberal than traditional Democratic primary voters.
"Our assumptions had always been its greatest strength was against Republicans," said Doug Ross, a Democratic organizer. He helped Mr. Clinton win the Michigan primary by testing themes of racial unity and personal responsibility with black voters in inner-city Detroit and white voters in suburban Macomb County.
"The challenge always was, 'How do you get through Democratic primaries dominated by traditional Democratic activists?' " he said. "How do you get it past the primaries?"

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Social Policy;
Clinton Blames Bush and Republicans for Racial Turmoil

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, May 2

 BODY:
Using his sharpest language yet on the nation's social ills, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas today placed the blame for the failures in race relations with President Bush and preceding Republican administrations.
Citing the rioting in Los Angeles and violence in other cities, the Democratic Presidential candidate turned a speech before the Democratic Leadership Council here into a treatise on America's cynicism and racial division that he said threatened the nation's future. 
 And late today, Gov. Clinton announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Sunday night. Mr. Clinton, accompanied by Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, will meet with black, Hispanic and Korean leaders before leaving the city Monday night.
 
An Incomplete Message
 In his speech, Mr. Clinton said Mr. Bush fell short of the message he should have delivered when he called for an end to the civil disobedience on Friday, and announced plans to Federalize the National Guard and begin a Federal investigation of the Los Angeles police brutality case.
"The Republicans, when they needed to prove Michael Dukakis was soft on crime, brought out Willie Horton," he said. "The Republicans, when they needed to cover up for their senseless economic strategy that is driving income down for most American families while they work harder, blame it on quotas so there can be racial resentment instead of honest analysis of our economic falsehoods."
He said Republicans urged unity but "send their Vice President out across the country to talk about welfare in a way that makes it clear they intend to use it as a wedge to divide the American people instead of an instrument to liberate the poor."
Mr. Clinton, who had resisted attacking President Bush on civil rights as the Los Angeles riots were growing, dropped all pretense of being apolitical on the matter today. But he also criticized Democrats who complain of having too few choices, do not vote and allow the Government to become "paralyzed and divided."
Mr. Clinton took pains to contrast his message to the one delivered by the President on Friday night, urging special attention for black Americans who have been victims, not just the perpetrators, in the Los Angeles violence.
"After all, more than any other racial group in this country, it is their children who are shot on the streets, their neighborhoods that are savaged by crack cocaine, their businesses and dreams who are crushed," he said.
 
Mainstream and Undertow
 Mr. Clinton's speech today represented a full synthesis of his typical speeches on racial issues and his thinking on the race riots in Los Angeles. Troubled communities, he said, must be rescued through individual as well as Government commitment.
"We have made a great deal of progress for those of us who live in the mainstream of America," he said. "But what has happened beneath that? Beneath that, there are those who are not part of our community, where values have been shredded by the hard knife of experience, where there is the disintegration of family and neighborhood and jobs and the rise of drugs and guns and gangs."
Mr. Clinton said he supported a waiting period for the sale of handguns and an increased reliance on community-based policing and prison boot camps as a way to curb urban crime over the long term. But most of his message today, delivered to a rapt crowd of 1,000 conference participants who had come to hear Mr. Clinton deliver a traditional campaign speech, focused on the underlying social causes for the violence in Los Angeles.
 
Fear Born of Isolation
 "White Americans all too often fear that violence has only a black face," said Mr. Clinton, who spoke from notes but without a prepared text. "They see it on the news. They see it in their movies. They are gripped by the isolation of their own experience where, especially in many of our larger areas, too many white Americans still simply have no friends of other races, and do not know any differently. Blacks fear that too often violence has a black face and no one cares."
Mr. Clinton added, "We should be afraid, my fellow Americans, but we must face our fears and stop running from them."

HEADLINE: RIOTS IN LOS ANGELES: World View;
Europe Is Aghast, Fearing Unrest There; Japan Takes Moral High Ground

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, May 2

 BODY:
The terrifying images of racial violence in Los Angeles have hit people in both Europe and Japan with an intensity that similar scenes in the Balkans, Afghanistan and South Africa never did.
Europeans had persuaded themselves that those places were in a different world, but America and American mass culture are not. They know that what has gone wrong in the United States could go just as wrong in Europe. Racial, ethnic and social tensions have erupted into violent conflict in Britain, France and Germany, though on a lesser scale, and could do so again. 
 So Europeans were as rapt before their television sets as millions of people in Japan, a society that regards the multiracial character of the United States with fear and, at times, undisguised contempt. Prominent Japanese politicians have tried to explain the decline of American industrial and trading power, in part, as a result of tangled ethnic strains that, they say, make Americans less well educated and far less motivated than the more homogeneous Japanese.
 
Guns Have Shock Value
 No other country in the world except possibly Afghanistan has more guns per capita than the United States. The pictures of store owners in Los Angeles firing randomly at crowds with shotguns and rifles have a shock value all their own because when people die in European riots, they usually die from beatings or knife wounds, not gunshots.
Even before Los Angeles, many European and Japanese politicians and commentators had begun thinking of the United States as a country in decline, pointing to the advantages of their own social and economic systems and rejecting American criticisms of their policies.
President Bush "is a generous man who is coming from an extremely conservative political philosophy," President Francois Mitterrand of France said on Friday, adding that American society was conservative and devoted to the free market. "Now we see some of the results of that," he said.
What effect the riots, and Mr. Bush's response to them, will have on the American Presidential campaign is no clearer to Europeans at this stage than it is to Americans.
But for Mr. Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, both in somewhat shaky political condition themselves, one lesson is that continental Europe's expensive welfare-state safety nets are well worth the cost, despite frequent American criticisms that they are unsustainable in the long run.
 
Embassy Guard Increased
 In South Korea, concern for Koreans caught up in the destruction led the National Assembly today to urge the United States to offer compensation to those who had suffered damage. The Foreign Ministry in Seoul even said that it would send a senior official to survey the situation.
The United States Ambassador said the guard was increased around American installations and military housing areas in Seoul, evidently aimed at preventing conflict between Koreans and black American soldiers.
Asylum-seekers have been flocking to Germany at the rate of a thousand a day this year from the Balkans and elsewhere to find safety and economic security, but many Germans seem likely to take Los Angeles as one more reason to resist letting more immigrants settle there.
"I could not believe the violence," Ali Kaynak, a resident of the Kreuzberg district of Berlin, told the Reuters news agency after the annual May Day protests there on Friday.
The Mitteldeutsche Zeitung of Halle, in the eastern part of Germany, wrote: "In America's cities, a social time bomb is exploding. The boom in the 80's benefited only the rich. Over 33 million U.S. citizens, 13 percent of the population, are considered impoverished. In the ghettos of the big cities a generation is growing up that can expect hardly any support from welfare in the future."
 
The Verdict Shocks
 The Neue Presse, in Hanover, observed: "What has to happen is a radical attempt to correct fundamental American injustices. Whether U.S. politicians are prepared or able to do this remains to be seen."
Everywhere, people who saw the videotape of the Los Angeles police beating Rodney G. King, the black motorist, and almost everybody with a television set did, have been shocked by the jury verdict that acquitted the officers, an outcome Mr. Mitterrand described as "scandalous."
In Japan, intense newspaper and television coverage had even stronger overtones of moral superiority, confirming Japanese in their view that their exclusionary society and legal system, which does not have juries in criminal cases, were better than their American equivalents.
"This Los Angeles jury could not have done more damage to their country's image abroad if they had tried," wrote the English-language Japan Times today.
Since the Los Angeles jury reached its verdict on Wednesday, the world's front pages and television screens have been dominated by the pictures of the consequences on the streets of Los Angeles: blacks beating whites, Asian shop owners shooting at black looters, white police officers and soldiers with rifles pinning blacks to the ground.
"God Help America" was the headline on the mass-circulation Daily Mirror in London this morning, but the subliminal message was really "God help us all."
The Guardian wrote in an editorial: "Afghanistan is quaintness from another era. The nationalist tumult of Europe is the Balkan problem of school history dressed in T-shirts and unfathomable passions. But here, from Los Angeles, is something we are all conditioned, every watching day, to relate to; something coming to get us."
The conservative Le Figaro in Paris said this morning: "The United States has not yet succeeded in economically integrating all its blacks or all its Hispanics. That, nothing else, is the problem. And what is happening there today could explode here tomorrow."
 
Ghettos in Europe, Too
 Paris and London also have their ethnic and racial ghettos. Paris has mainly Muslim quarters full of immigrants from its former North African colonies; the streets of Brixton in London are now filled with black people from the Caribbean, while Bradford, Manchester and Birmingham have many neighborhoods populated by people from South Asia.
When Brixton and the Toxteth district of Liverpool erupted in violence in 1981, the British Prime Minister of the day, Margaret Thatcher, reminded each citizen of "his duty to obey the law," much as Mr. Bush warned the "mob" in Los Angeles Friday night that the violence had to stop.
Mrs. Thatcher's successor, John Major, has not commented on the Los Angeles riots, but his Government plans to start an Urban Regeneration Agency next week to signal its determination to try to prevent a repetition of the violence here, something that newspapers warn could happen any warm day.
"As our own lesser riots and the rise of neo-fascism in Europe have shown," The Independent wrote today, "the danger of racial conflict is ever present. We are in no position to throw stones."
But as many Europeans and Japanese see it, the problems of Los Angeles are as much economic as racial in nature. For El Pais, the Spanish daily, the violence showed that, after the passing of Communism and the end of the cold war, the free market was not the answer to everything if it meant that the law of the jungle prevailed.
A South African tabloid newspaper that reflects white opinion there, The Citizen, had this to say today: "Our advice to the United States is: Sort out your own racial problems and leave us to sort out ours. As L.A. has shown, you are not a great example to us."

HEADLINE: Fresh Air Fund Provides Summer Relief

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
Nine-year-old Charles Aviles usually spends steamy June afternoons playing football on the sidewalks of the South Bronx, but last summer he left his hardscrabble neighborhood for two weeks on a Pennsylvania farm. He rode horses, golfed and hooked his first baby flounder.
The family Charles was staying with treated him to carnival rides and baseball games and walks in the woods. 
 "I saw a deer, the one with the horns," Charles said. "It looked like Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, but it was big."
This year, Charles will return to Pennsylvania. He is one of thousands of poor city children who will spend two weeks with families recruited by the Fresh Air Fund, which starts its 116th annual fund-raising campaign.
 
More Working Women
 The Fresh Air Fund, a nonprofit agency, has provided free summer vacations to underprivileged children from New York City since 1877, but it has struggled in the last two decades as more women have gone to work outside the home and fewer families have volunteered to host inner-city children.
In 1971, 16,000 children boarded buses to escape heat-baked neighborhoods for small towns across the region. But by 1989, the number of children had fallen to its low of 6,700. In the last two years, the numbers have begun to creep back up. About 7,200 children participated last year.
The Fresh Air Fund has improved recruitment in part by finding new ways of tapping the volunteerism of working women, students and retired people who may not be able to take a child into their home, said Jenny Morganthau, the Fund's executive director.
Volunteers from the 316 communities in 13 states that host the children help publicize the program, interview prospective families and visit their homes, and escort children on bus rides from city to country.
"Women still volunteer," Ms. Morganthau said, "they just volunteer differently."
This year, the people who run the Fund hope they will be able to give more children a respite from the city, where fearful mothers often keep their sons and daughters inside to protect them from the dangers of the street.
"Because of the recession and government cutbacks, there are fewer things for the kids to do in the summer," Ms. Morganthau said. "You read about kids getting shot. They need places where they can be safe."
Charles Aviles's mother, Deborah Washington, said she is nervous about letting her sons out of her sight. "A lot of people like to fight," she said. "It's just a bad neighborhood. They like to be shooting and stuff."
Charles said the South Bronx is nothing like the farm in Pennsylvania.
"I hear gunshots here every night," he said. "There I heard crickets. I saw stars. We went jumping on the trampoline and they got a new swing set. When I get back this summer they're going to have a family picnic for me."
Host families can invite children from 6 to 12 years old, for a two-week visit. The children come from poor families and register through 54 community and social-service organizations in the city's five boroughs.
 
No Pay
 Host families are not paid and there are no financial requirements to participate. About 60 percent of the children are invited back by the same families summer after summer, Ms. Morgenthau said. Children can be invited back until they are 16.
The Fresh Air Fund also sends 2,500 inner-city youngsters, ages 8 to 15, to camps on 3,000 wooded acres of the Sharpe Reservation in Fishkill, N.Y. This year, the fund is raising money for a new camp for 12- to 15-year-old youths that will focus on education and literacy. The camp will help 300 disadvantaged teen-agers study and plan for careers. So far, the Fund has raised $4.4 million toward its $6 million goal for the camp.
The Fresh Air Fund relies primarily on private donations to support its work. It costs $314 for the Fund to send a child to a family and $819 to send a child to camp. The Fund has raised $1.7 million of the $3.5 million it needs this year to support its programs.
"The main goal is to serve more children," Ms. Morganthau said, "and to do that we have to recruit more families and raise more money."
Tax-deductible contributions may be sent to The Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y., 10018. Families who want to be hosts may call (800) 367-0003. To volunteer for other duties, call (212) 221-0900.

HEADLINE: RIOTS IN LOS ANGELES;
California Governor Facing Tough Time

 BODY:
In a difficult time for governors, Pete Wilson of California may be having the toughest time of all. He came to office 16 months ago as a rising star in the Republican Party, with a reputation as a pragmatic conciliator and consensus builder who could change a troubled state and a virtually paralyzed state government. 
 But economic and political realities have constrained Mr. Wilson, and his job performance rating has plummeted. High unemployment and severe fiscal problems have burdened him, and so have natural disasters: earthquakes, fires and drought. Now the rioting in Los Angeles presents yet another challenge for the Governor. [Magazine, section 6. The rioting broke out after the magazine had gone to press.]

HEADLINE: Purnell H. Benson, 78, Stock Market Expert

 BODY:
Purnell Handy Benson, a professor emeritus of business at Rutgers University and an expert on the fluctuations of stock prices, died on Monday at Morristown Memorial Hospital in Morristown, N.J. He was 78 years old and lived in Madison, N.J.
A family spokesman said that Dr. Benson died of a bone marrow disease. 
 Dr. Benson joined the faculty of the Rutgers University Graduate School of Management in 1967, teaching marketing and price theory. After retiring in 1984, he lectured at the graduate business schools of New York University and Columbia University.
In the early 1980's, Dr. Benson traced "disturbances" in the normal supply and demand functions in stock prices to the growing use of computerized trading programs. He became a vocal advocate of regulations to control program-induced stock market trading, lecturing at economic conferences and publishing his views in various newspapers.
He is also author of a college textbook, "Religion in Contemporary Culture," published by Harper & Brothers in 1960.
Surviving are his wife, Mary A.; a son, John C. of Wilton, Conn.; two daughters, Alice V. of Brooklyn Heights and Janice Sabky of Madison; two brothers, Jack of Fairfield, Conn., and George of Laconia, N.H., and six grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Job Recovery In New York Called Slowest

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Amid scattered signs that the nation is beginning to recover from the recession, the states in the New York region remain mired in such a deep slump that economists say they will not regain their previous peak employment levels until much later in the decade.
"Morale is very bad among business people," said Irwin Kellner, chief economist for the Chemical Bank Corporation, who does not expect the New York region to reach the bottom of its slump until late this year. He said prospects for recovery were dim. 
 "The engines of growth are just not there," he said.
In one of the gloomiest appraisals, DRI/ McGraw Hill, an economic consulting and forecasting concern in Massachusetts, said New York and Connecticut were the only states that had yet to hit bottom in the recession. It said New York would not hit its trough until summer, and Connecticut in the fall.
 
Catching Up by 1996 and Later
 Besides California, it said all 10 states hit hardest by the recession were in the Middle Atlantic and New England regions. In each case, it said the states had entered the recession before the rest of the nation and would take longer to recover.
The study, comparing the severity of the recession in different states, found it to be far worse across the New York region and New England than in any other section of the nation. It said the job losses over the last three years would not be recovered in New York and New Jersey until 1996, and not in Connecticut until the end of 1999.
Employment losses across the region have been huge. Federal statistics show that New York State has lost 500,000 private jobs since the beginning of 1988, roughly half the gains that it experienced in the prior eight years. That loss is 6.5 percent of the total private employment in 1988 in New York State, 7.7 million.
Most of the cuts came in New York City, where the Federal Government said 337,000 jobs were eliminated out of a total of 3 million, an 11.2 percent loss, wiping out all of the employment increase between 1976 and 1988.
 
Computers Rely on Variables
 In New Jersey, employment has been reduced by 287,000 out of 4.1 million since 1989, about a 7 percent loss, according to Government statistics. The losses amount to 44 percent of all employment growth in the state in the prior nine years.
In making its forecasts, the group entered a host of variables into its computers, including labor and housing costs, population growth, taxes, school standards, past profits and other business conditions. The data provided assumptions for what would aid or hinder economic growth.
It said Connecticut, having hit its peak of employment in the first three months of 1989, would not recover to that level until the last three months of 1999. New York and New Jersey both reached their peak employment in the first six months of 1989, it said, and will not fully recover until the first three months of 1996.
In contrast, it said the nation had reached its peak of employment in the third quarter of 1990, experienced 15 months of decline until the end of 1991, and would fully recover its losses by this September.
"We've had relatively mild recessions in the past, but this is what the Rust Belt went through in the 1970's and 1980's," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in New York.
 
Things Look Good Elsewhere
 The forecasts come amid mounting evidence that recovery, albeit slow and uneven, has begun in most of the nation. The National Bureau of Economic Research, a private agency in Washington that determines for the Government when recessions begin and end, said this one began in July 1990 and ended in April.
Other indicators offer guarded cause for optimism. People's confidence in business conditions, job security and their family finances, as measured in a monthly survey by The Conference Board, jumped in March and April.
The Conference Board, a business research group in New York City, does not report its results for each state, but said the April gain in consumer confidence was even sharper in the Middle Atlantic states, including New York and New Jersey, than in the nation as a whole.
"This is classical," said Fabian Linden, director of the monthly consumer confidence study. "People begin to feel things are getting better even before they really do."
 
Broadway May Be Indicator
 Hints of an upturn can be found on Wall Street, where brokerage firms are awash in heavy stock trading, huge profits and rich executive bonuses, and on Broadway, where theater attendance is at its highest levels in years.
But analysts say the isolated glimmers pale amid the New York region's deep, abiding economic woes.
"Somebody has to be the last one out of a recession, and the numbers here don't bode well," said William A. McEachern, a professor of economics at the University of Connecticut.
"The contours of this recession are different than anything in the past," Mr. Ehrenhalt said. Because the downturn has carved deeply into the business of military contractors on Long Island, high-technology electronics companies in Westchester and New Jersey, and banks, advertising agencies and other service concerns across the region, it has undermined the same industries that have fared best in past recessions.
In its study, DRI/McGraw Hill said some states had been bypassed entirely by the current recession, while a few had sustained damage as severe as that in the New York region and New England. It said six Western states, Idaho, Utah, South Dakota, Montana, Arizona and Colorado, had experienced no employment losses.

HEADLINE: An Airline That Failed Still Helps Candidates

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
One of Senator Kent Conrad's last campaign contributions before he announced his retirement last month was a $3,000 check from Eastern Airlines.
Eastern Airlines? 
 Yes, the same airline that has been out of business for more than a year.
"I'm surprised that nobody has noticed it and asked any questions before because it is unusual," said John Sicilian, the general counsel for the bankrupt airline.
The airline may be bankrupt, but its political action committee still has about $50,000, and the carrier's management is looking for candidates to give the money to, Mr. Sicilian said Friday.
 
Unemployment Is Concern
 The political committee is not part of the airline's estate, Mr. Sicilian said, so creditors have no claim on it.
The officials who oversee the committee decided to write a check to Senator Conrad, a North Dakota Democrat, because of his support last year for extending unemployment benefits, an issue important to the carrier's thousands of former employees, Mr. Sicilian said in an interview from his Miami office.
Eastern's political action committee has given $29,000 to eight senators, all Democrats, and House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, since the beginning of 1991, according to Federal Election Commission records. The airline went out of business in January 1991.
Corporations are prohibited from giving money to candidates for Federal offices, but many form political action committees to which officers and other employees contribute.
 
Returning the Check
 Senator Conrad's campaign received the check from Eastern on March 30, just four days before the North Dakota Senator announced that he was going to honor a campaign pledge and not seek re-election.
Senator Conrad, who had more than $1 million in his campaign fund at the time, is returning the contribution to Eastern, said Laurie Boeder, a spokeswoman for the Senator.
The Senator's North Dakota contributors were given the option of having their contributions returned to them or given to the Democratic Party in the state, she said.
Out-of-state contributors, like Eastern, are being contacted to see what they want done with their donations, she said.

HEADLINE: Lock Step With New York City Economy, Budget Treads Path of Booms and Busts

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
The $29.5 billion budget proposed last week by Mayor David N. Dinkins left some New Yorkers with the impression that the city government had finally turned a corner after more than three years of fiscal distress.
But upbeat developments -- including a $455 million surplus this year that will allow the city to avoid borrowing and pay for some new programs next year -- obscured a more enduring problem, many fiscal monitors say. For at least two decades, they say, the city's financial structure has been fundamentally out of balance. 
 Each year since the late 1970's, mayors have managed to balance the budget, as they must by law. But in good times, new services and thousands of city workers have been added, while in bad times, many of those same services and employees have been lopped off.
What successive city administrations have been unable to do, the fiscal experts contend, is create a stable long-term balance between the size of the government and the size of the economy on which it rests.
 
Altering How Business Is Done
 Experts call that relationship "structural balance," and they say it is the cornerstone of fiscal stability. Many fiscal monitors say they are afraid that the relatively sanguine budget proposed by Mr. Dinkins could derail discussion, and perhaps action, on the administration's fledgling efforts to confront the underlying imbalances in the municipal government's finances.
"Basically every expert I know believes that the city hasn't changed the way it does business for over 20 years of recurring fiscal crises," said Elinor B. Bachrach, the deputy state comptroller for New York City.
While many factors, from the city's tax structure to its wide array of services, have helped create the imbalance, in many ways the problem boils down to one overriding point: The city is required by law to spend all the money it takes in each year, and that leaves it hostage to the volatile swings of the local economy.
When the economy is robust, tax revenues pour in. Municipal officials must spend any surplus. When the economy contracts, so does the city government, usually through the kind of painful layoffs and service cuts that Mr. Dinkins has been forced to impose since he took office.
 
Off the Roller Coaster
 "From the perspective of structure, New York City government has not changed very much in the last 20 years," said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group financed by businesses. "It just tends to get bigger and smaller in cycles, in waves. Unless we address the structural issues, we will just get a repeat of what we had before."
For the last 20 years, New York City's economy has ridden a roller coaster. In the deep recession from 1969 to 1977, the city lost more than 600,000 jobs -- nearly one-sixth of all jobs in the city -- and one-tenth of its population. The size of the local government was slashed; more than 60,000 municipal workers lost jobs during the fiscal crisis of the 1970's.
Then, beginning in the late 1970's and through most of the 1980's, the local economy soared. More than 50,000 additional workers were hired.
By 1989, the city was in recession again. Last year, the local economy lost more jobs -- 195,000 -- than in any year since the Depression. Once again, tax revenues fell and the municipal government began shedding workers through layoffs and attrition.
 
Between Boom and Bust
 Since taking office two years ago, the Dinkins administration has reduced the size of local government by eliminating about 12,500 municipal jobs financed with city money. The Mayor proposed cutting another 1,100 jobs in the budget he released on Monday.
The veering between boom and bust has been compounded by New York's tax structure, which depends heavily on taxes highly sensitive to the local economy, experts say.
Most cities and towns raise about 75 percent of their tax money from the property tax, according to a report last year by the Financial Control Board, the state agency that monitors the city's financial affairs. The property tax is considered among the most stable and predictable. About 20 percent of most local governments' revenues are raised from sales and consumption taxes and about 5 percent from income taxes, according to the report.
But in New York, the tax mix that has evolved over years is quite different. Partly to capture more of the business and personal wealth in the city, government relies much more heavily on income and sales taxes, which are more sensitive to the swings of the economy. Personal and corporate income taxes produce 29 percent of New York's tax revenues, and sales and consumption taxes provide 27 percent, the control board said. The property tax accounts for 44 percent of the city's tax base.
 
Striving for Stability
 Fiscal experts say that the combustible mix of a volatile economy and a reliance on economically sensitive taxes has left the city doomed to repeat the pattern of expanding and contracting unless it makes fundamental structural changes.
They say the city must begin stabilizing tax revenues and expenses, so that the size of government does not grow too much during good times or shrink too much during bad. Independent fiscal monitors, along with the Dinkins administration, have proposed many solutions, all intended to make the government more resilient to the cycles.
Several fiscal monitors say state law should be changed so that the city would be permitted to save during growth periods. Many also say that the city should continue to reduce its work force and re-think what services it provides.
Many fiscal experts say that the city should aggressively change how manages its workers, obtaining more productivity from a smaller work force. Some experts also contend that the state should take over the city's cost of welfare and Medicaid, a total of more than $2 billion.
 
Trying to Overcome Tradition
 There are huge obstacles to such fundamental changes, including state laws, municipal bond covenants, Civil Service rules, union contracts, tradition and, of course, politics.
Philip R. Michael, the city's budget director, said he supported the idea of a rainy day fund to protect against busts. He and other fiscal experts said the city must also practice restraint in booms. In particular, they said, it should avoid spending so much on new city workers.
Alair A. Townsend, a deputy mayor and budget director under Mayor Edward I. Koch, said the city should consider spending surpluses on "one-shot expenditures" that do not create recurring expenses, like painting city bridges or buying library books.
But politics and pressing needs -- from fighting AIDS to sheltering the homeless -- make restraint difficult. "It is a very difficult political exercise to engage in," Mr. Michael said. "We all know the needs are immense, the real needs, so to hold back is a very difficult thing."
 
Long-term, Good Politics
 Fiscal monitors, whose roles were created during the city's flirtation with bankruptcy in the 1970's, contend that creating a financially stable government would have substantial political rewards.
"Radical abrupt budget cuts are not good for any politician," said Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the Financial Control Board. "These ups and downs that lead to quarter after quarter of budget cuts make the life of a politician more difficult, make the lives of city workers more difficult and make the lives of most citizens more difficult."
"Trying to come to terms with volatility really will make everyone happier," Mr. Proctor said. "It's not a pointy-headed notion."
The Dinkins administration has proposed many steps to alter the city's fiscal landscape, including trimming capital spending to decrease long-term debt, consolidating several city programs, closing some city jails and reducing the number of apartments the city owns and manages.
 
Taking Baby Steps
 Mr. Proctor described those efforts as modest, but moving in the right direction. Some other fiscal monitors said the city should become much more aggressive. It is not enough, they said, to simply make government smaller by reducing the work force. The city also has to rethink its mission, jettisoning some traditional functions and obtaining significant concessions from municipal unions to obtain more productivity.
Mr. Horton of the Citizens Budget Commission said, for example, that the city should consider eliminating the Department of Mental Health because a state agency performs a similar function. Other fiscal monitors said that many other municipal operations should be reconsidered: Should the city be in the business of financing and managing housing? Should it continue to subsidize cultural institutions? Can it afford to own and operate 11 municipal hospitals?
Mr. Horton dismissed the city's efforts thus far to manage its labor force better. "Inroads into municipal productivity have been very elusive," he said. "We just don't see a scintilla of evidence that the city is serious about this."
Mr. Michael, the budget director, acknowledged that there was "a chorus out there who say we ought to do more about restructuring."
 
'Bumps Along the Road'
 "The problem is that some do not have ideas on how to do it, and others have ideas that have been tried and have failed," he said.
Mr. Michael said he was hopeful that steps laid out by the city would start addressing the long-term imbalance in its finances. "We think we have a plan that does it," he said. "Clearly, there will be bumps along the road. Head counts are coming down, restructuring is going on and we have a plan that tries to bring the budget into balance over four years."
Mr. Proctor said that Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Michael had at least made a beginning. "The city has started to do the very things they have to do to achieve structural balance," he said.
"The administration very courageously is running an experiment that has never been tried before," he added. "I hope it succeeds."

HEADLINE: Alas, We Had the Hype Right Here

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky.

 BODY:
THE wonder horse always looked somewhat delicate to carry racing into the millennium, skinny legs and all. Arazi was surprisingly small for such a macho star, Paul Newman encountered on the street, but then after all the hype we did see the finely tuned muscles appear under the vibrant skin and the clear eyes shine. He did have an easy grace.
"He's almost feminine," said D. Wayne Lukas, the trainer, who enjoys being provocative. He won this race in 1988. "Secretariat and Seattle Slew looked like stud horses, big, arrogant. If you didn't know it was Arazi, you would never say, 'Who was that little chestnut horse?' " 
 But everyone came to know that it was Arazi, and only Arazi, who would matter here, despite some lip service to the cultural and economic presence of the rap star-horse owner, Hammer. Arazi, it was hoped, would lead the $2 bettor out of the OTB parlor and into the sunlight of the rail, would lure the bored millionaire into the barn area, and, most important, would induce the world's movers and sheiks to spend their play dough at the American yearling sales.
Arazi flew here last week on wings of hype. His success in France under markedly different conditions, and his one overwhelming American victory -- at the Breeder's Cup Juvenile, said Lucas, he "looked like a Ferrari with its accelerator stuck" -- have been mythologized for the good of the game. Purists are uncomfortable with comparisons to Secretariat -- Big Red's 1989 death still occasions a moment of silence -- but had Arazi fulfilled his destiny, he would have been Little Red.
"We need to refocus on the horse," said Thomas Meeker, the president of Churchill Downs. "When I first came here in 1985, the big Kentucky Derby celebrity was Don Johnson of 'Miami Vice,' not a very nice fellow, and last year it was General Schwarzkopf, which was great, but still not a horse."
Not just any horse, of course, but one we can think of in human terms.
"We can only anthropomorphize so far," warned William Nack of Sports Illustrated, who wrote a passionate biography of Secretariat. "But Secretariat was bright, a ham. He had courage when he was a baby. Arazi seems to have a sense of himself that shows glimmers of that."
Everyone here seems to agree that people need heroes even if the heroes aren't quite people. But no one seems to have a clear idea of why this should be, other than the race for money.
One of the livelier middle-class trainer-owners, the working heart of the industry, is Shelley Riley, a large, handsome blonde from northern California who favors bold floral print dresses and an earthy style. This was her first visit to a prestige race. She had originally purchased her entry, Casual Lies, for $7,500. He came in a surprising second.
"They love Casual Lies in California," she said. "They chant Cas-U-Al, Cas-U-Al, Cas-U-Al. A hero. A people's horse. But when it comes time to bet, they put their money on the Japanese horse, which I guess was financially smart."
That Japanese horse was A.P. Indy, scratched early yesterday with a bruised hoof. A land developer, Tomonori Tsurumaki, bought him for $2.9 million. A.P. stands for AutoPolis, a Japanese leisure center. A.P. Indy would have been the second favorite.
The morning's scratch lost its sting by late afternoon when Arazi simply never turned Red. That ignominious eighth place will sire a hundred reasons, all true. Arazi had jet lag, he was too small, too delicate, too unused to dirt tracks and left turns. He should have stayed in America, to be raised in roughhouse American ways, like the third-place Dance Floor, owned by Hammer, and trained by Lukas, Mr. Sound Bite himself, who said he thought celebrity owners were good for the game and that Hammer being black was a plus. "And he's making a profit, he's in the black, no pun intended."
Hammer is considered a fortuitous hero at Churchill Downs, whose management admits having been slow to reach out to the blacks. Hammer responded to the Los Angeles riots by saying "people are more important than horses," but he seemed caught in an odd promotion with his Kentucky Fried Chicken sponsors. The fast-food chain "bet" Hammer 50,000 pounds of chicken that Dance Floor would not win yesterday. If Dance Floor did win, they would donate those tons of chicken to "the nation's hungry."
Alas, because Dance Floor didn't win, some poor people will be a little hungrier. Because Arazi didn't win, some rich people will be a little sadder. Maybe next year, we'll have human heroes again.

HEADLINE: Give Shape to Summer

 BODY:
The tickle of warm grass under bare toes . . . The taste of lemonade sipped in the shade of a tree . . . The heft of a ripe, red tomato just plucked from the vine . . . A secret wish on a shooting star.
The summers of childhood are never forgotten. As much as schoolbooks and spinach, they shape the adults we become. This summer, as it has for 115 summers, the Fresh Air Fund hopes to give shape to summer for children who have no other outdoors than New York City's meanest streets. 
 How many children can briefly escape the polluted air, trash-strewn sidewalks, blistering asphalt playgrounds, the drug pushers and gunfire? It all depends on how many adults help.
At a minimum, the fund wants to help nearly 11,000 children this summer, 7,200 of them to stay with volunteer families in rural and suburban communities from Virginia to Canada. There's room for 2,500 children to spend two weeks hiking, fishing and learning to swim in campgrounds in Fishkill, N.Y. Plus 1,200 teen-agers could participate in the fund's year-round camping program, which includes educational activities and career preparation.
The host families open their homes and hearts without charge but transportation, insurance and administration cost $314 per child. Sending a youngster to the two-week camp costs $819. All told, the fund, which is building a new campsite and seeking more host families, hopes to raise $3,512,000.
Even in this recession, millions of New Yorkers find ways to break free of the city each summer, to enjoy cherished quiet with family and friends, old and new. The city's poorest children need such escape, too. Tax-deductible contributions and inquiries about becoming a host family may be sent to the Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018, (800) 367-0003.

HEADLINE: U.S. vs. Needy Students

 BODY:
One would think the Administration of the self-styled Education President would embrace ways to help needy students get through college. Instead, the Bush Administration has gone to court to block the way the Massachusetts Institute of Technology spends $20 million a year on scholarships. Why? Because the Justice Department thinks M.I.T. is violating antitrust laws.
It's a destructive claim, unworthy of litigation. At least it warrants being contested. But Justice now wants to deny even a fair hearing; it asks for summary judgment. That risks turning the unwarranted into the outrageous. 
 The Justice Department says M.I.T. and eight other premier universities have been engaged in a conspiracy. They agree to offer students only enough aid to meet their need. Justice thinks that's price-fixing -- despicable, automatically illegal and therefore undeserving of a trial.
M.I.T. admits that an agreement existed. The purpose was to prevent a bidding war that would deplete the funds available for needy students. But so what, according to the Justice logic; the letter of the antitrust laws should be upheld.
The argument fails on the merits. The antitrust laws are designed to stop price-fixing by commercial enterprises that exploits consumers. They are not intended to stop nonprofit organizations from cooperating in charitable endeavors. Giving scholarship aid to needy students is surely a charitable activity. At the very least, the Government is obliged to prove the cooperative agreements somehow aided a commercial purpose.
At the crux of the dispute is a simple question: What did M.I.T. do with the money it saved by avoiding a bidding war? The Government assumes that it went to improve faculty salaries. If that were so, the suit would be justified.
But the assumption appears to be dead wrong. Dennis Carlton, a University of Chicago economist, in a study commissioned by M.I.T., shows that the universities that agreed to provide aid only to meet financial need used the savings for more financial aid. Needy students, not faculty, benefited. Indeed, Congress uses the same policy to dispense Federal financial aid.
Meanwhile, the very filing of the suit in May 1991 has done grievous damage. Colleges, under threat of suit, have abandoned cooperation. Forced to bid for students, many can no longer afford a "need-blind" admissions policy -- the practice of admitting academically qualified applicants regardless of need.
Several M.I.T. trustees grew up on the wrong side of the tracks themselves and owe their scientific education to generous scholarships. They believe in need-blind admissions, which is why they have refused to capitulate to Justice and are fighting this bizarre case. They deserve the support of all who care about scholarship and scholarships.

HEADLINE: Routine Wastelands

 BODY:
The smoke has drifted away and the sirens have stopped in Los Angeles, but there and in every big city a high-pitched alarm still pierces the air. Until Americans heed it, there will be more fires and more next times.
This time, New Yorkers shivered with relief that the rumors of trouble for their city were mainly wrong. Other cities were not so lucky, and in Los Angeles, site of vast, new barren wastelands, people numbly count casualties and costs. 
 In his immediate responses to the rioting, President Bush skillfully gave equal weight to order and justice. He did not hesitate to express his own shock at the acquittal of the Los Angeles policemen shown on videotape brutally beating Rodney King. Federal forces now help maintain order.
But even as the explosion dies down, it exposes a frightening tear in the social fabric. The King beating videotape ignited obvious horror in whites and blacks. What was not so obvious to white America was why the acquittal hit blacks with such locomotive force.
They know, better than most people, that it was a perverse manifestation of an even deeper wrong. Injustice is one thing; what's worse is a systematic lack of justice, of protection. America consigns great numbers of young black men to lawless lives. It writes off great stretches of urban landscape as routine wastelands.
Officials alarmed by the fiery rioting last week were right to appeal for people to live by the rule of law -- a rule of law nowhere evident among the policemen who beat Rodney King so savagely, and not perceptible on the jury that acquitted them.
Nor is the rule of law much evident in South Central Los Angeles, or in Chicago's Cabrini-Green or in New York's Bedford-Stuyvesant. The public has largely ceded these places to criminals. Neighborhoods have become wastelands, governed by random violence -- if not that of drug dealers with machine guns.
In Los Angeles notably, the revealing icon of the rule of law is the helicopter, droning ceaselessly overhead, watching to see that crime does not spill out of the sectors of sanctioned lawlessness.
People who live in the crime-ridden inner cities already know the rest of America thinks them unworthy of protection. The King verdict pushed their noses deeper into the disrespect, implying that the social contract does not apply to them at all.
Last month Senator Bill Bradley, in a courageous speech, reminded the public of the danger in thinking of the inner cities as islands unto themselves: "The future of American cities is inextricably bound to the issue of race and ethnicity . . . That means the economic future of the children of white Americans will increasingly depend on the talents of nonwhite Americans."
The smoke in Los Angeles last week showed just how tenuous that future can be. It will remain so until society insures that the social contract applies to all its citizens. The most obvious requirement is to protect people from police who have gone out of control. The larger requirement is to protect against the day-to-day horrors of life in the wastelands, the routine wastelands.

HEADLINE: RIOT IN LOS ANGLES: The Overview;
CLEANUP BEGINS IN LOS ANGELES; TROOPS ENFORCE SURREAL CALM

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 2

 BODY:
With 13,000 police and troops patrolling the streets of the nation's second-largest city, life in Los Angeles assumed a surrealistic sense of the normal today after one of the deadliest and most destructive racial disorders in American history.
As the night curfew ended at dawn, cleanup crews began spreading through the hard-hit South-Central area to salvage what they could from some of the 3,767 buildings burned in the three days of arson and looting. 
 On Crenshaw Boulevard in the heart of a mostly black area, a racially mixed band of volunteers picked up brooms and shovels at the office of State Senator Diane E. Watson and moved through the charred rubble as the police and troops protected gas stations and food stores. Post offices in the area opened for the first time since Wednesday, and residents stood in long lines for their mail.
 
A Night of Fewer Fires
 As they did so, 4,500 Army and Marine troops assembled in nearby bases in case of further trouble, and special weapons teams from the Federal Bureau of Investigation waited in hotels and other locations.
But they were not needed today.
There were only 47 building fires overnight, only a few more than normal in this city of 3.5 million, and just sporadic gunfire on this third day of trouble after rioting began Wednesday when a suburban jury acquitted four white Los Angeles police officers in the beating of a black motorist last year.
A Federal grand jury began hearing evidence today and has issued subpoenas in an effort to determine whether civil rights laws were violated in the beating of the motorist, Rodney G. King, Associate Attorney General Wayne Budd announced.
 
The Riots' Toll
 By the time the grand jury hearings got under way this morning, the local authorities had put the death toll at 44, including 7 people shot by the police, making it one of the deadliest riots in the United States in this century. In addition, there were 1,765 injuries, 198 of them critical, and 6,345 arrests. In July 1967, racial violence in Detroit left 43 people killed, more than 2,000 injured and 7,000 arrested. Hundreds of people were killed in draft riots in New York City during the Civil War.
The office of Mayor Tom Bradley estimated property damage at $500 million.
This evening, the Mayor announced that he had appointed Peter Ueberroth to head the reconstruction effort. As chairman of the Los Angeles Olympic Committee, Mr. Ueberroth, a former Baseball Commissioner, was in charge of the 1984 Olympic Games here.
At a news conference attended by Gov. Pete Wilson, Mr. Ueberroth called for cooperation from government leaders, as well as Presidential candidates, the ethnic communities in the city, foundations and volunteer groups and private companies, including foreign ones. He gave no details of any proposed recovery measures. He said the results could provide a blueprint for other cities facing urban blight.
Governor Wilson, meanwhile, announced that President Bush had signed a declaration of disaster, activating Federal relief efforts for victims of the looting and arson. Such aid typically includes grants and low-cost loans to cover property losses.
At City Hall this morning, Mayor Bradley expressed relief that the violence had abated and urged merchants to reopen their stores if possible. In areas unaffected by the violence, stores were doing business as normal, and the Mayor said the police would provide protection for stores and gasoline tankers coming to supply service stations.
"The Police Department has assured us all the stores that want to reopen, that want to distribute their products, that they can do so," the Mayor said, adding that contributions of food to the Salvation Army and Red Cross were also needed.
Mr. Bradley also said Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York telephoned Friday "to commiserate and to offer any help that he could provide."
 
Criticizing the Response
 As residents tried to restore their lives, questions arose about the week's events and the official response to them, questions about why it took so long to deploy National Guard and Federal troops and about the long-term economic consequences for this recession-wracked region.
"The response of the National Guard is slow," said Deputy Mayor Mark D. Fabiani. "In the 60's, Federal troops saved several cities from destruction. The numbers of National Guard troops on the street were not the number that were promised at any time."
If there was insufficient force at first, the military presence was smothering today. California National Guard troops in black and green camouflage and Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies surrounded the county Hall of Justice and the county court house downtown. Nearby, Los Angeles police in riot gear had cordoned off City Hall. Armored vehicles in desert camouflage were positioned at major intersections in the Civic Center area.
President Bush ordered in the Federal troops on Friday to supplement 6,000 National Guard members activated earlier. The Federal troops were not immediately sent into the streets today, but were dispatched to military bases in southern Los Angeles County and northern Orange County late Friday night as backup forces. They included 2,500 Army infantry soldiers and 1,500 marines.
"What we are doing is positioning our forces in a contingency mode in case something is needed in the future," said Lieut. Col. Stan Kensic, spokesman for the military command center at the Los Alamitos Army Reserve base near Long Beach, 15 miles south of downtown Los Angeles. The Army and Marine forces, as well as the National Guard, were put under the command of Maj. Gen. Marvin Covault, commander of the Army's Seventh Infantry Division (Light), based at Fort Ord, Calif., near Monterey.
The National Guard troops at the downtown Federal Building and the Hall of Justice were drawn from the 649th Military Police Company, which spent five months in Saudi Arabia last year and was assigned to control prisoners of the Persian Gulf war. "This is just another mission, and they don't have Scuds," said Sgt. Michael O'Brien of San Luis Obispo, Calif.
 
Businesses, Closed and Open
 The dusk-to-dawn curfew remained in effect this weekend. On Friday night, Los Angeles's normally glittering nightlife ceased. The rock music palaces, dance halls and bars along the Sunset Strip, on Hollywood Boulevard and Santa Monica Boulevard were silent and dark, some of them boarded up against vandals. County beaches were closed.
Yet today the Universal Studios tour, a major tourist attraction in the eastern end of the San Fernando Valley area of the city, was open and, a security guard said, "operating normally." And 45 minutes south of South-Central Los Angeles, there was a 45-minute wait at the most popular rides at Disneyland in Anaheim, in Orange County. The amusement park has been operating normally every day.
But it was anything but normal along Crenshaw Boulevard. Amid piles of charred litter, a line of about 50 people waited at a check-cashing store, one of the few business operating. Traffic moved fitfully, with half the signal lights out. Utility crews fanned out to restore electricity, under heavy police and military guard.
At Senator Watson's offices, Jackie Trost, a white woman from Beverly Hills, helped supervise cleanup activities. "I just came out to help the community," she said. "This is not just a black community. This is everybody's community. People want to help."
Estrellita Braddic, deputy press secretary to Senator Watson, said: "The ones who were doing the burning the looting are not here today. These are the ones who want to reclaim the community. We are all equals today. Hopefully, this will be a trend."
With donations from a bank, Senator Watson hoped to open a trailer to dispense free food and medicine beginning Monday.
 
An Official's Account
 At City Hall, an official who participated in organizing the city's response to the rioting said today that Mayor Bradley and Governor Wilson had grown increasingly concerned over the past three days about the posture of the city's police chief, Daryl F. Gates, feeling that he lacked a sense of urgency. Chief Gates initially resisted calling the National Guard on Wednesday night as the riots widened, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, but by Thursday morning the Chief agreed that troops were needed.
By early Friday, however, largely as a result of forces beyond Chief Gates's control, only 500 of the 2,000 activated troops were in the city. The other 1,500 were assigned to help the county sheriff, Sherman Block, to police outlying areas.
"The Governor was as frustrated as the Mayor was," the official said, adding that they began considering other options, including intervention by Federal troops, which would take control out of Chief Gates's hands. The official said the two men enlisted the help of Warren M. Christopher, who was chairman of the independent commission that investigated the black motorist's beating last year and who decades earlier had worked to quell riots as a deputy attorney general in the Johnson Administration.
From his home in Beverly Hills, Mr. Christopher telephoned Bush Administration officials, including Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, to discuss which military units to call in, the official said.
"At that point," he said, "the Mayor decided that you can't show enough force."
At 11:30 A.M. Thursday, the official said, the Mayor and the Governor met in the Emergency Operations Center in the basement of City Hall, where 3,500 more National Guard troops were promised by Friday afternoon. But by 6 P.M. Friday there were still only 3,000 Guard troops in the city. Then, over the objections of Chief Gates, Mr. Bradley and Mr. Wilson asked the President for the Federal forces.
 
Views on the Street
 Senator Watson also faulted Chief Gates. "A man of his cunning should have known there would have been this kind of reaction to this acquittal," she said in an interview today.
But on the streets there was disagreement over the police and military response. "It takes time to assess," said Conyers Brown, a retired television repairman who was in front of his Bronson Avenue home washing his 1986 Continental near some of the worst burning. "You don't just rush in. If you move too fast, you could have aggravated the situation."
Nearby, Larnel Harris, also black, said that while he could understand why the police hesitated, given the circumstances of the trial, the troops should have been brought in immediately. "I understand the reluctances by the Police Department because that could have started a shooting battle between the police and the community," said Mr. Harris, who served 10 years as a police officer with the Navy. "But the troops are more neutral."
The jails of Los Angeles County, the city and nearby cities, meanwhile, were crowded with the 6,345 people arrested by 5:30 this morning. The state Supreme Court extended to 96 hours the normal 48-hour deadline for charging defendants.
 
Special Court Sessions
 The Municipal Court planned special weekend sessions for arraignments, one courtroom for felonies and another for misdemeanors.
At the Los Angeles County Coroner's office, the task of identifying the 44 dead and notifying the next of kin proceeded.
"We're using fingerprints, driver's licenses and dental records to try to learn who these people are," a spokesman for the coronor's office, C. Scott Carrier, said Friday night. "One of the hardest things is to get to some of these people, their next of kin, who live in South Los Angeles. We can't get down there."
It was impossible to assess the economic consequences of the violence, but higher unemployment was a certainty. Of most immediate concern was the Los Angeles region's huge tourism industry, which accounts directly for 360,000 jobs.
Joel Kotkin, a writer who has long been a booster of Los Angeles as a place to do business, said: "It's a terrible blow. We could have withstood an 8.5 earthquake better than this."

HEADLINE: OUT THERE: GUANGZHOU;
Let a Thousand Lipsticks Bloom

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KRISTOF

DATELINE: GUANGZHOU, China

 BODY:
Few Chinese houses have doorbells, but that has not stopped the emergence here of a growing army of 10,000 women who are called "elegant and fragrant ladies."
That is what the Chinese call their Avon Ladies, and they are peddling cosmetics with a determination that has made Avon one of the most successful and best-known companies here in southern China. 
 If rampaging Red Guards symbolized the revolutionary spirit of China in the late 1960's and early 1970's, then the equally tenacious "elegant and fragrant ladies" capture the bourgeois spirit of China in the 1990's. Avon opened for business here in September 1990, sold what was to have been six months of inventory in the first four weeks, and has been booming ever since.
"We came at the right time," said Samantha Kong, sales director of Avon's office in Guangzhou, also known as Canton. "People here aspire to look good, as they do anywhere, but they have no one to teach them how."
In many ways, Avon is a perfect fit with the local culture. Incomes are rising rapidly, local women are showing increasing interest in makeup, consumers have a strong preference for American products, and there is an enormous pool of entrepreneurs who are eager to earn extra money by selling cosmetics part time.
"I use myself as a model," said Tian Ruihua, a 25-year-old hotel secretary who began selling for Avon just a month ago. "So when my friends ask how I make myself up, I tell them that I use Avon products."
In her first month, Ms. Tian sold the equivalent of $278 worth of cosmetics to her friends and earned a 30 percent commission worth more than $83. That sum, which would be an excellent monthly salary in China for a full-time job, represented three hours of work.
One-third of Guangzhou's Avon ladies earn monthly commissions of more than $275, and the star saleswoman, Zhao Lizhen, earned $6,600 in her best month.
"When some Avon ladies sell a lot of cosmetics and make a pile of money, then other people notice," said Li Qilan, a 25-year-old whose self-confidence has turned her into a super saleswoman. "Then the others want to sell for Avon, too."
For now, Avon operates only in Guangdong Province, the southern Chinese region that for the last dozen years has enjoyed some of the highest economic growth rates in the world. Guangzhou is the capital of Guangdong Province.
The number of Avon ladies is expected to double to 20,000 within a year.
In China, far more than in the United States, Avon has cachet; indeed, most American products do. Many Chinese manufacturers now try to come up with foreign-sounding brand names and English-lettered packaging to lure customers.
Avon's image has been bolstered by the company's Chinese name, yafang, meaning elegant and fragrant. Calling the Avon representatives "ladies" (there are no Avon men, although husbands can help unofficially) also helps impart sophistication, because the Chinese word that is used for lady or Miss, xiaojie, was rarely used in China until recent years and still sounds cosmopolitan and exotic.
Part of Avon's appeal, and of cosmetics generally, is that they tap a widespread yearning among Chinese to shed backward customs and enjoy the sophistication for which Hong Kong is widely envied. One successful pickup line in Guangzhou might be: "Miss, are you from Hong Kong?"
Cosmetics have reappeared in China only gradually since the early 1980's. Consequently, many women have to learn on their own how to use eye shadow instead of being taught by mothers or elder sisters. This need for tutoring gives Avon ladies, who offer beauty tips as well as mascara, a special advantage over department stores.
While Avon encourages its saleswomen to go door to door, this almost never seems to happen. Instead, the "elegant and fragrant ladies" typically bring their supplies to the workplace and offer products and advice to fellow workers. Some factories welcome such beauty classes as a kind of cultural program that will make employees more educated and sophisticated.
"We sell mostly to friends and to people in our 'work units,' " said Chen Jianhong, a 37-year-old government worker who moonlights for Avon. "I once studied a bit about beauty and makeup, so now I show my friends how to look better and also sell them some cosmetics."
Avon targets only the relatively prosperous consumers who can afford nearly $4 for a lipstick or face cream -- two of the best-selling products. By comparison, a typical monthly income for a factory worker is $40 or so. This makes Avon one of the handful of American companies to have cashed in successfully on the Chinese consumer market.
Avon is trying to expand sales of baby products to go along with cosmetics. It could be a large market. Most urban Chinese families are not allowed to have more than one child and consequently often fawn over their "little emperors" and buy them almost anything available.
"I'm going to focus on selling baby products," said Ms. Tian, the hotel secretary. "People will just gobble them up."

HEADLINE: Talking: Down Payment;
Saving To Buy a First Home

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
SAVING for a down payment when living expenses seem to constantly outstrip income is one of the perennial problems facing young couples eager to buy a first home. Moreover, interest rates on savings are now so low that a small nest egg is unlikely to grow into anything usable for a long time.
 "You get nothing from leaving your money in the bank," said Stuart Richardson, a graphic designer who will be married in Glen Cove, L.I., in October. Even worse, he added, "there are always so many bills coming in." 
Nevertheless, financial counselors and mortgage specialists insist there are still ways to make a saving plan work. Some believe part of the problem facing many young couples is lack of knowledge about managing personal finances, not lack of wherewithal.
 "I see couples coming in with a combined income of nearly $100,000 telling me it's impossible to save," said Susan Blevins, sales manager with Prudential Connecticut Realty in Madison, Conn.
 Marilyn Ashley agrees. She is a budgeting couselor for the Philadelphia office of Acorn, a national advisory and advocacy service for low- and moderate-income families that specializes in home purchase issues. The acronym "acorn" stands for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now.
 "They're always so sure they'll never have enough," she said. "But once we start working with them they are amazed."
 A good way to start, say these professionals, is with a meticulous accounting of every penny spent. Ms. Ashley has her clients make up a four-week cash-flow chart that records all expenditures and income in detail.
 The charts have shown expenditures of as much as $120 a month on dry cleaning. Or the grocery receipts may show that the couple is not buying food and household supplies in a cost-effective manner. In such cases, Ms. Ashley will suggest ways of budgeting more carefully. If the couple is drawing cash too frequently with automatic teller cards or going on credit-card binges, she will recommend that they leave the cards at home.
 "If you write down every single thing you spend you can see immediately what's really going on," she said. Many of these young people are having a particularly difficult time, Ms. Ashley said, because they are imbedded in a culture that fosters instant gratification. For this reason she has her clients continue the financial log for several months, sending it to her for review.
 Couples who have managed to buy a first home agree that spending discipline is the key, along with a willingness to compromise living standards.
"You have to make the house your top priority, otherwise it will never work," said Paul Petro, an electrician from Milford, N.J. He and his wife, Maureen, took three years to save $20,000 for a down payment. "It was a question of no vacations, no new car and a lot of cutting down," Mr. Petro said.
 Other couples, in which both spouses work, agree to live on only one salary while banking the other. That can be difficult, particularly in high rent areas like New York.
 But what the issue really comes down to is the couple's priorities. If they have their hopes focused on a high-rise condominium on Third Avenue or a suburban town house town near a golf course, they may be willing to live temporarily in a cheap walkup railroad flat to build their down payment fund faster.
Since self-control seems to be part of the problem, some couples might use a savings plan that makes it hard for them to binge. One solution, said Ms. Ashley, is to open a savings account and have a fixed sum transferred into it each month automatically.
 An even more attractive modification was begun in March by Arbor National Mortgage of Westbury, L.I. Aware that many bridal couples are being showered with appliances and household items they really don't need and may already own, Arbor started its Home Bridal Registry to which friends can make cash contributions.
 THIS starts a couple on a down payment savings plan. Arbor contributes the first $100 to a savings account, which can be opened at any Chase Manhattan branch. It also provides cards that can be folded into wedding invitations saying the couple would be delighted with contributions to the account in lieu of another gift. Guests are told how and where to send the money.
 The couple is free to withdraw the funds at any time and is not compelled to buy a home with an Arbor mortgage (although Arbor is combining the idea with special incentives to encourage them to do so). The account can also be tied into an automatic monthly or quarterly transfer arrangement from their checking account. (For more details, call 800 272-6791.)
 "It's a classy way to help motivate the guests," ssid Diane Kuzma, a sales representative from East Northport, L.I., who will use the registry for her wedding in October.
 The plan could be easily set up independently, as could the one devised by Maria and Eric Callahan of West Milford, N.J.
 They were paying for their own wedding but were also eager to buy a home, so they decided to scale back, holding a wedding that was not as lavish as first planned.
 "We made a nice profit on the gift money that way," said Mrs. Callahan, an advertising manager. To avoid the temptation of spending it on other things, they also set up a special savings account.
 However, there may soon come a time when the interest being generated by a savings account may seem too paltry. When that happens, the couple should look for investments with higher earning power that will not jeopardize the principal.
 So many are now being offered that the couple may be overwhelmed by the possibilities. Their best course is to seek expert counsel, from parents, older siblings, colleagues at work, their bank manager or a professional investment specialist.
 The key fact to remember, is that higher returns usually meanhigher risks. Only government bonds and federally insured bank deposits are considered absolutely safe.
 Another alternative is to look into special home-loan programs that allow first-time buyers to get a mortgage with only a small down payment. Conventional loans require a down payment of 20 percent, a hurdle many young couples cannot leap no matter how carefully they save. Some programs offer loans with only 5 percent down. They are available through Federal and state agencies and even some private lenders. Infomation about these programs is available at most banks.

HEADLINE: Bare-Fisted Violence or Subtle Threats?

BYLINE: By MARTIN GOTTLIEB with DEAN BAQUET

 BODY:
John Gotti's taste in clothing runs to what might be called the full Broadway look -- expensive double-breasted suits and silk ties of bright, bleeding colors complemented, of course, with matching pocket squares.
 Thomas Gambino dresses with the tailored restraint of the English or Milanese aristocracy, in dark, demure suiting made all the more understated by deep, monochromatic ties and French-cuffed white shirts. 
Mr. Gotti's most prominent charitable donations are the fire crackers he buys for the annual Fourth of July picnic in the Howard Beach, Queens, neighborhood where he maintains a simple split-level house.
 Mr. Gambino, who lives in a converted 19th-century mansion in the East 60's off Fifth Avenue, is president of the Gambino Medical and Science Foundation, which donated $2 million last year to Long Island Jewish Medical Center for bone marrow transplant work.
 At the heart of Mr. Gotti's enterprises are murder and bare-knuckle violence; at the heart of Mr. Gambino's, domination of a lucrative industry -- enforced, prosecutors say, by threats implied rather than executed.
 The group Mr. Gotti leads, the Gambino crime family, was molded by and named for Mr. Gambino's father, Carlo. Now with Mr. Gotti's conviction and likely lifetime imprisonment, the family faces a critical question: Will its new leader come from the "blue collar" wing of the family, led by Mr. Gotti, or the "white collar" wing of Mr. Gambino.
 In pure economic terms, the issue of who controls the family is significant for the New York metropolitan area and could ultimately affect some of the city's biggest legal businesses, including construction, garbage disposal, and garment manufacturing, as well as a host of illegal enterprises. The Gambino family, made up of 400 "made men" and thousands of associates, is a major force, with annual income that has been estimated at between $300 million and $500 million.
 Both Mr. Gotti and Mr. Gambino have not yet given up the struggle with prosecutors. Mr. Gotti's lawyers have vowed to appeal his sentence, and Mr. Gambino, who until pleading guilty in February to illegally gaining control of garment center trucking had never been convicted of a crime, steadfastly denies law-enforcement assertions that he is a long-standing captain in the Gambino family.
 The Gambino family is also fighting for its life. After years of successful state and Federal prosecutions, it faces the emergence of tough drug and street gangs made up of members of ethnic groups newer to the city, and the constant competition of the second largest old-line mob, the Genovese family, which has been relatively unscathed by a half decade of mob prosecutions.
 "I think the new leadership and how we handle it is critical as to whether there will be a powerful mob in the year 2000 or whether there will not be," said Michael Cherkasky, whose investigations unit of the Manhattan District Attorney's Office prosecuted Mr. Gambino.
 With the guidance of Mr. Gotti's turncoat underboss, Salvatore Gravano, law-enforcement officials are now trying to figure who is likely to take over after Mr. Gotti's sentencing in June -- one of the family's 21 captains or a particularly powerful soldier. But beyond the selection of one relatively unfamiliar name or another lies the underworld version, however sordid, of a corporate changing of the guard, with men representing different sides of the corporation's personality and vision vying for control of its future.
 Nowhere are these conflicting cultures personified more vividly than in these two men -- Mr. Gotti, 52 years old, the foul-mouthed dropout from Franklin K. Lane High School who became the erstwhile "Teflon Don," and Mr. Gambino, 62, the college-educated connoisseur of Italian wines whose assets include at least $75 million in cash, bonds, and blue chip stock.
 Prosecutors have not been as successful in determining Mr. Gotti's wealth, but on the witness stand Mr. Gravano said he turned over $1.2 million a year in proceeds from construction shakedowns.
 Testimony and evidence from the recent trials of Mr. Gotti and Mr. Gambino, who have long had dealings with each other, starkly underscores the differences between the two wings of the Gambino mob, differences shaped by organizational history, environment, family upbringing, and personality in much the same way as the differences between the business school graduates and the engineers that might vie for control of a major industrial corporation.
The United States Attorney for the Eastern District, Andrew J. Maloney, whose office successfully prosecuted Mr. Gotti, said he came from the family's "roughest wing" .
 "They were the shooters and the hijackers," said Mr. Maloney, describing the faction headed by Mr. Gotti's mentor, the family's late underboss, Aniello Dellacroce.
 
Gotti's Management Style
 The bottom line of Mr. Gotti's business philosophy came in one particularly chilling comment recorded and transcribed by Federal agents: "And every time we got a partner that don't agree with us, we kill him. You go to the boss and your boss kills him. He kills 'em. He O.K.'s it."
 It is a philosophy that often seemed to have other priorities than profits. Laura Ward, a Brooklyn Federal prosecutor who helped try Mr. Gotti, said the most surprising information that came out at his trial about the workings of the family was that loan sharks were allowed to keep all of their money rather than sending a sizable proportion up to the boss.
 Mr. Gotti's violent tendencies contrast with Mr. Gambino's creation: an elaborately detailed business cartel based on what one economist referred to as "the importance of being unimportant."
 In the trial of Mr. Gambino, which received far less national attention, a remarkably different view of business, one in which the limelight was to be shunned, in which 9 to 5 hours took the place of the all-night schmoozing of the Gotti faction, and in which physical force gave way to what prosecutors said were threats implied by the name recognition that accompanied "Gambino."
 As prosecutors outlined it, mob trucking companies took claim to every sweatshop in the city, even going so far as to divide Chinatown loft buildings floor by floor. Any piece of any garment going in or out of any shop would have to be carried by the trucker assigned to it by the mob.
 A manufacturer or sweatshop owner who used another trucker, or a taxicab, to handle pick-ups of piecework and finished garments simply received a bill from his assigned trucker anyway and was expected to pay for services not rendered.
 Nothing offered at this trial was as lurid as the 19 murders of which Mr. Gravano spoke in Brooklyn. The "salesmen" who worked for the garment trucking companies would merely tell customers that "the Gambinos" wanted things done a certain way, and customers would get the picture, according to prosecutors.
 As Elliot Spitzer, the lead prosecutor in the Gambino case, put it in his opening statement, "These defendants are businessmen. You'll hear that and you'll see it. But these are businessmen with a powerful partner, organized crime. It wields an iron fist inside a velvet glove."
 For Mr. Gambino, whose family controlled 60 percent of this trucking business, the profits were enormous, according to prosecutors.
 Mr. Gambino and his brother Joseph, also a defendant, each received an annual salary of about $2 million. Additionally, the Gambinos shared in the proceeds of a consortium of trucking companies whose profit margins were an astronomical 40 percent, according to Mr. Cherkasky.
 From 1989 to 1992, the Gambinos' four trucking companies had a gross revenue of $35 million. When the Government raided the operations, the largest of these companies, Consolidated Carriers, had $12 million in its company bank account.
 Prosecutors contend the scheme added as much as 7 percent to the price of each article of clothing. But they said manufacturers would not complain because of the Gambino name. Moreover, the cost of trucking is relatively small, compared to labor and material.
 Prosecutors said that Thomas Gambino wanted to avoid going to prison at all costs. In the middle of the trial, he and his co-defendants reached a deal with the Government: they admitted to an illegal scheme to monopolize trucking in the garment center, agreed to pay a $12 million fine, and to gradually get out of the business. They did not acknowledge threats, or mob involvement. Mr. Gambino still faces a Federal racketeering prosecution .
On tape, Mr. Gotti is remarkably stoic about the prospect of spending the rest of his life behind bars.
 Despite their differences, the two Gambino factions have much in common, according to prosecutors, including involvement in such crimes as gambling and loan-sharking.
 Mr. Gambino's uncle and mentor, Paul Castellano, who headed the family until he was murdered on Mr. Gotti's orders, in some ways bridged the gap between the two factions. He freely used thugs to enforce a web of illegal activities, said
 Mr. Maloney. But, he said, Mr. Castellano was also a businessman.
 "He wasn't a tough guy," said Mr. Maloney. "In some tapes he talked of how he wasn't really meant to be in this kind of life."
 Yet some prosecutors say that rather than deal with relatively sophisticated mob infiltration of legitimate business, they would rather tackle a crime family headed by a boss in Mr. Gotti's mold. The white collar faction is more of a long-term problem because it filters into the fabric of legitimate society and is much harder to prosecute, they said.
 The blue-collar wing, on the other hand, tends toward simpler crimes that are clearly illegal. "If you're dealing with drugs, you can catch them in one conversation and put them away for life," said Mr. Cherkasky.
 Ms. Ward was more dubious. More violent factions may commit simpler crimes, she said, but witnesses may be too afraid to come forward.
 The timing and circumstances under which Mr. Gotti's successor will be chosen are unclear. Mr. Gotti himself was selected with the approval of all the mob's captains after the murder of Mr. Castellano. When or where a similar succession meeting will take place this time is something that investigators are unsure about, adding that the mobsters themselves may be unsure at this point.
 Ronald Goldstock, the deputy attorney general in charge of the state Organized Crime Task Force, said that regardless of which faction the new boss comes from, he will be chosen from a stock depleted by years of successful prosecutions and a steady withering of quality in the family's ranks. The strongest candidates for the job may be smart enough not to want it, he said.

Recession Snips a Hotel Off a Complex

BYLINE: By CHERYL KENT

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
WHILE it is not exactly what the developer had in mind, a building is finally going up on North Michigan Avenue at Chestnut Street. Delayed for a year, the steel and concrete framing at 840 North Michigan outlines a structure less than a quarter the size of the one first planned.
Until late in 1990, the developer, U.S. Equities of Chicago, had envisioned a 28-story, 400,000-square-foot building with four stories of retail space topped by a 288-room Park Hyatt hotel. But Japanese financing from the Mitsui Trust and Orix was withdrawn in 1990 and other lenders refused to consider a project including a hotel in Chicago's overbuilt and under-occupied market. 
 Thus last October, with a new financing package in place from two European banks, U.S. Equities broke ground for a four-story 90,000-square-foot retail structure with spaces leased to international retailers, the Dutch-owned F.A.O. Schwarz, the German-owned Escada women's clothing stores and the British-owned Waterstone Booksellers.
"In the 1980's we would have built to the max," said Camille Julmy, a U.S. Equities vice president in charge of the project. "Now, maybe small is better, and being fully leased is best."
The property, with a seven-story building on the site, was bought in 1979 by the developer and two Chicago lawyers, Marshall Holleb and Robert Gerstein, who are joint-venture partners in the new development. They had to wait until 1990 to begin redeveloping the site because of two long-term leases in the old building.
By June 1990 the building had been vacated and demolition began. When the project was halted, the site had been cleared, two retail tenants were committed, working drawings by architects for the building were 80 percent completed and city permits for the foundations had been issued.
But Mr. Julmy said the hotel project was abandoned because "lenders didn't want to touch a hotel in Chicago." Recently published occupancy figures for last year showed a slump to 54.5 percent from 58 percent in 1990. BDO Seidman, an accounting firm, said an occupancy rate of 60 to 64 percent is considered the breakeven point for most hotels.
Mr. Julmy revised his plans, and he began outlining to lenders a smaller-scaled retail building that was already 80 percent leased to F.A.O. Schwarz and Escada.
But the conversations were renewed at a bad time. In 1990, many American banks, like Chase Manhattan, with whom U.S. Equities has had a long-time relationship, were reducing financing and the U.S. Equities project was refused several times.
Mr. Julmy said the creditworthiness of the project's tenants ultimately helped persuade Barclays Bank of England and Hypobank of Germany to provide construction financing. Indeed, Wolfgang Ley, founder and chairman of Escada, became an equity partner in the development.
Real estate professionals said it is notable that any development project obtained financing recently and they cite the robust health of retailing on North Michigan Avenue to explain why U.S. Equities' building was financed while others were not.
Retail experts routinely put Michigan Avenue in a class with Madison Avenue in New York and Rodeo Drive in Los Angeles. With 2.3 million square feet of retail space along what is called the "Magnificent Mile," the avenue is one of the most concentrated retail strips anywhere in the country.
THE site now under development stands in the heart of it. Directly across the street is the 610,000-square-foot Water Tower Place, the second-highest revenue-producing mall in the country, according to a retailing consultant, Howard Green of Troy, Mich. Last year's sales there were $640 a square foot.
On the mile-long North Michigan, total sales in 1991 were $965 million, according to the Greater Michigan Avenue Association, an increase of 3.5 percent over the previous year.
Such major stores as Bloomingdale's, Lord & Taylor, Marshall Field, Henri Bendel and Saks Fifth Avenue are represented on the avenue along with Gucci, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, and Tiffany.
In this company, competition for shoppers' attention is high. All three retailers leasing space in the U.S. Equities project will have high-visibility ground-floor space to capture the attention of strolling shoppers, in addition to space on one or more of the upper floors.
Instead of an entrance off a common lobby, each store will have a street entry with ground-floor display windows and an independent internal circulation of stairs or escalators.
At one time, the developer considered cooperating with I. Magnin's, the retailer next door, to create a mall with Magnin's as the anchor tenant. But that plan was abandoned in favor of the current configuration.
Now, Magnin's has announced it will be closing its 130,000-square-foot store, which is owned by Inland Real Estate, this June. Magnin's is owned by Macy's, which is in bankruptcy proceedings.
Tony Casasio of Inland Real Estate and local retail brokers say the space is unlikely to remain vacant for long, given the desirability of its location.
When the hotel was eliminated, the building was redesigned by Lucien Lagrange of this city's Lucien Lagrange & Associates. Large portions of service area, including below-grade parking for about 40 cars, some loading docks and all the tower elevator cores, were done away with, leaving more area for retail space.
The third tenant, Waterstone Booksellers, is a British chain that recently opened its first American store in Boston. It will have the less prominent entry on Chestnut Street and will occupy space on the ground-floor and second-floor levels as well as in the basement.
Waterstone will lease 20,000 square feet.
The developer would not disclose per-square-foot construction costs or rents for the project, but brokers with leasing experience on North Michigan say ground-floor rents are roughly $100 a square foot. For stores with ground-floor and upper-story space, blended rents are roughly $55 a square foot.
The common wisdom among brokers is that there are two kinds of shoppers on North Michigan, those who stay inside and shop the three vertical malls and those who stay on the street to shop the storefronts.
Belief in that theory would explain why retailers are willing to open stores with the same merchandise within blocks of one another. The Gap, Banana Republic and now F.A.O. Schwarz will all have stores on the avenue and in Water Tower Place.
F.A.O. Schwarz will retain its 3,000-square-foot store in Water Tower Place even after it opens a 32,000-square-foot space in the U.S. Equities project with space on the first, second and third stories. The toy retailer, which is owned by KBB, a Dutch retail group, has been expanding in recent years, opening stores in Union Square in San Francisco in 1989 and on Boylston Street in Boston in 1991. The new store in Chicago will be second in size second only to New York City's Fifth Avenue outlet.
Escada's 38,000-square-foot store in the new building will bring the clothier's dozen product lines under one roof. While several department stores on North Michigan already sell Escada products, the company has opened its own stores and expects to have nine open by the end of the year, including the flagship store at 7 East 57th Street in New York. The retailer is taking the premium space, with a corner entry and retail space distributed over all four stories of the building.
Completion of the building is planned for next fall, in time for the beginning of the Christmas selling season, when many retailers make as much as half their annual sales and profits.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
Immigrants' Tales

BYLINE: By LEAH D. FRANK

 BODY:
"VAGABOND STARS," a musical at the Queens Theater in the Park in Flushing Meadows Corona Park, takes a look at the Yiddish immigrants of the early part of the century and chronicles their trials and tribulations.
It is a well-worn theme, but like the "boy meets girl, boy loses girl" plot that propels so many stories, its retelling is satisfying in part because it is so well known. 
 Since 1607, when the first English settlers pushed the Indians out of Jamestown, more than 42 million people have migrated to the United States. The journey itself was difficult enough, and for many it involved economic hardship and physical and emotional trauma. Yet, getting into America was frequently as hard, if not harder, than getting to America in the first place.
One result of human conflict is the synthesizing of real-life drama into theater, film, art and literature. In this country, 70 percent of the immigrants who arrived between 1890 and 1910 were refugees from Eastern and southern Europe, and when they came they brought with them centuries of music and drama that they had incorporated into an expression of their emotions about their adopted land.
The vast multicultural movement gave rise to vaudeville, Yiddish theater, contemporary musicals like "Fiddler on the Roof" and even recent movies like "Moonstruck." A simple listing of the artistic legacy of the vast immigration would fill volumes.
"Vagabond Stars," a musical by Nahma Sandrow, Raphael Crystal and Alan Poul, and adapted from Ms. Sandrow's book "Vagabond Stars: A World History of Yiddish Theater," nestles comfortably into the theatrical body of immigrant tales.
In a series of sketches and songs, "Vagabond Stars" looks at the excitement and the loneliness of being a stranger in a strange land, where the only connection to the old country is a series of letters that form tattered, fragile links to former lives.
The creators of "Vagabond Stars" have adapted material from turn-of-the-century New York Yiddish theaters, and the show has the flavor of the pulsating Lower East Side with its romance, dreams, yearnings, hard work and bittersweet memories.
As directed by Christopher Catt, the numbers flow easily between song and sketch and between pathos and humor, and the five-member cast exudes an infectious aura of good will. In fact, if there is a problem with this production, it is that everything about it is too nice. The passion of a transplanted people is turned into something as insubstantial as spun-sugar candy. It is pretty and sweet, but completely umemorable.
The two women, Cynthia Firing and Guylaine Laperriere, have voices that carry all of the nuances within the songs. Eugene Flam, Fred Goldberg and John Patti are also capable vocalists. The five of them, designated points of a shining star, do their best to convey a sense of the diversity within the major influx of Jewish immigration. That they never manage to be anything more interesting than cute is a production flaw rather than a performance failure.
The stage is small and narrow, but the designer, Sarah Lambert, has pegged the flavor of the material by using scraps. They include bits of photographs of the Lower East Side with its crowded streets, posters from the Yiddish theater and headlines in Yiddish from The Jewish Forward. She has turned the curtain into a huge section of a passport, with its stamps and "official" signatures.
"Vagabond Stars" is pleasant, mild entertainment. In the comfortable cabaret setting of the Queens Theater's small downstairs space in the New York State Pavilion, it turns into a mellow evening of reminiscing. It will continue through May 24.

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY Q & A: KEVIN MORIARTY;
How to Raise Funds in Difficult Times

BYLINE: By TINA TRASTER

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
IT is not the best of times to be raising funds for a charitable organization. The recession has squeezed the foundations and individual donors who support charities. The scandal that has shaken the United Way, involving the forced resignation of its national president, William Aramony, has produced public unease and tightened purse strings.
But Kevin Moriarty, the executive director of the Fund for Educational Advancement, has learned optimism and the need to find new and creative solutions in his 20 years of fund raising. The fund raises money to send children to parochial schools in the Archdiocese of Newark. 
 Mr. Moriarty, a slim 46-year-old man whose hands move with the verve of a symphony conductor, said in an interview in his office here that creativity was the key to successful fund raising. "Candy and paper drives are being replaced by more sophisticated methods," he said.
He described some of these methods, which ranged from tree plantings to insurance policies; offered cautionary tales of fraudulent fund-raisers, and described how fund-raisers go about their business.
Mr. Moriarty joined the fund in 1988, four years after it was founded. In 1991, the organization gave $400,000 in tuition assistance to nearly 1,900 students in 200 schools throughout Hudson, Bergen, Union and Essex Counties that are part of the archdiocese.
Earlier, Mr. Moriarty spent 10 years at St. Mary's Hospital in Orange as a fund-raiser and director of community relations and did fund raising in the development department at St. Peter's College in Jersey City, his undergraduate alma mater. He also has a master's in business administration from Rutgers. Mr. Moriarty, who was recently widowed, lives in Verona.
Q. How would you define fund raising?
A. It is a form of selling. You need to sell your organization, sell the need. And the best way to do that is to translate the need on the human level, to define your need in terms of individuals. For example, the Jerry Lewis telethon does this successfully by making kids visible.
At F.E.A., students who are funded with scholarships stay in contact with their donors. They send handmade Christmas cards. They see their donors at an annual dinner.
Q. Is fund raising an art or a science?
A. It's both. Initially, it's a science. Before you are a fund-raiser, you are a matchmaker. You have certain needs, and you have to find the people who are interested in the needs. The art is the ability to communicate, to speak and write well.
Q. What is the best matchmaking method?
A. There about 30,000 foundations in the United States, and they all have tight guidelines as to where they give money, or what kinds of organizations they support, or amounts they give.
Q. Do you always rely on precedents?
A. Seldom do we spend time sending up trial balloons. The research materials available to fund-raisers are quite good and accurate. From these you can determine whether or not an organization will even entertain a request. Same on the corporate level. In fact, professionals at foundations or corporations will be offended if you come in and start asking for money for causes that do not remotely interest them.
Then you try to meet with someone, because you have a much better chance of asking for a grant in person than through the mail. The foundation or corporation will probably expect a formal proposal, which should include why you're asking for money, how much, what is the need, your operating budget.
Q. It seems fund-raisers are omnipresent. Is there a danger of burdening donors to a point of excess?
A. There are a lot of people out there looking for money. And it makes it more difficult for professional fund-raisers because people are bogged down with fancy direct-mail pieces and they are blitzed with phone calls around dinner time.
Q. What does that mean for professional fund-raisers?
A. We have to become more creative in our approach. A lot of fund-raisers send people little incentive gifts, a book, for example. So the mentality is 'You owe me something.' Except the person that receives something didn't ask for it.
Q. Where are the most innovative fund-raising ideas coming from?
A. Locally, it's from the hospitals. Recently, Hackensack Medical Center raised $170,000 during a one-night fund-raising event. They brought together 50 restaurants and created a taste of New Jersey, with different ethnic restaurants each presenting a top dish. They opened it to the public and charged $150 a head. Now other hospitals are organizing a similar event.
Q. Isn't insurance being used as a tie-in?
A. Absolutely. And it's being used more and more by universities. They get their alumni to take out life insurance policies in which the college or university is the beneficiary. The premium is tax deductible. There's also another way. If a donor makes a major gift to a university, the donation is tax deductible. He can then take the money he saves on income tax and use it to buy a life insurance policy.
Q. What new kinds of drives has the Fund for Educational Advancement undertaken?
A. One is called "Greening of the Garden State," a tree planting program that students from the Catholic schools participate in. Students solicit $5 donations for four trees. The schools keep $2.20; the F.E.A. keeps 50 cents. It's a lot more profitable than candy drives, where schools keep about 45 cents per bar.
We're also exploring a program that turns the students into "business executives." There is a health food company from Fairfield, Conn., that wants to launch a line of health snacks. The company wants to send professional marketers to the high schools to teach students how to distribute the product. If the students are successful, the schools will get a 10 percent cut of the profit.
Q. How is technology changing fund raising?
A. Television has dramatically impacted fund raising, both in good ways and bad. For example, the advent of cable, with its ability to target audiences, lets organizations like hospitals run localized telethons.
On the other hand, television has been exploited by disreputable evangelists. They have pulled off significant scams that take advantage of religious faith, for example, by promising people they will receive material benefits in this lifetime commensurate with what they donate.
Computer technology has also changed fund raising. It has refined direct mail. There may even come a time when requests for charity are sent via modem. This might be very effective to a targeted group.
Q. Are there other common scams?
A. Yes. One involves telemarketers who call and say they are with a newspaper for policemen or firemen or disabled veterans and they are selling ads. They use groups like the police, because every normal American has an affinity toward them. And they convince you to buy a $100 ad. They even come over and collect the check. But many of these so-called newspapers are bogus. They have no circulation. I've researched it.
Q. Given the recent scandals associated with fund raising, are donors becoming more careful?
A. There is good reason for anyone who is giving money to be concerned that it is going where it should. They should ask. Fund-raising organizations should be an open book, their operating expenses and budgets should be publicly accessible. Charities should be willing to show how much of the donation goes to administrative costs.
United Way always said 84 cents of every dollar went to community service. Whether it did or not is something a donor should be able to find out.
Q. What fund-raising methods are fruitless?
A. It's not worth wasting a lot of time and money on drives that will not produce a significant amount of income. For example, an organization decides to have a luncheon or flea market, and it mobilizes 50 people who form committees and work on the drive for four to five weeks, and in the end, they raise $5,000.
Well, you could say it's a success because it raised $5,000. But for all the time and manpower invested, you could mobilize 50 people much more cost effectively. Amateurs tend to gravitate toward projects that require a lot of work but do not produce enough income to address the need. And then it becomes hard to gear up people to have another drive.
Q. What motivates individuals and corporations to give to charity?
A. Except for some tremendously wealthy individuals who look for places to get tax relief and for some who desire positive public relations, I believe it is the human spirit and a social conscience that drives people to give.

HEADLINE: White Poor, Black Poor

BYLINE: By Orlando Patterson and Chris Winship; Orlando Patterson, professor of sociology at Harvard, is author of "Freedom in the Making of Western Culture." Chris Winship is professor of sociology, statistics and economics at Northwestern University.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
That racism remains a horrible blight on this society has been made painfully clear by the sadistic police gang beating of Rodney King, the mindless insensitivities of Daryl Gates and the shamelessly immoral verdict that has ignited rage in the nation's second city. That a significant minority of African Americans face a chronic economic crisis, with 40 percent of their children in poverty, is a national tragedy. And that a much smaller proportion -- perhaps no more than 10 percent -- is trapped in a life style of criminality and self-destruction, we all know and dread.
Though historically linked, these three problems have evolved as different social cancers that, while disproportionately harming the African American part of the nation, increasingly threaten its entire body politic. Combining them confuses the issues, worsens racial divisions and thwarts sound policy. 
 The best analysts on the subject, the sociologists Christopher Jencks and William J. Wilson, have shown that while the pathologies of the underclass are a menace to itself and to other Americans, especially the working poor, it constitutes a small, declining fraction of the black population. What's more, the immediate causes of anarchic behavior are hardly racist; the symptoms of moral and social chaos increasingly apply to the less visible, predominantly rural and suburban white underclass.
We hear next to nothing about this group, although it is greater in absolute numbers, because of its great inaccessibility, the less observable nature of its vices (such as wife battering, incest and alcoholism) and the media's pandering to their audience's presumed conviction that only blacks behave pathologically.
The problem of the black working poor is simple, and it is identical to that of the growing white poor: they do not earn enough and their low wages are declining as a result of structural economic changes and the heartless policies of the 80's that substantially widened income inequality. African Americans have been disproportionately hurt by these changes and as a result the racial differentiation in income has grown. It is a distortion, however, to neglect the convergence of this group with the white poor.
By dividing the poor along racial lines and making poverty a black problem, we obscure the growing chasm between rich and poor in this country. By further identifying the black poor with the underclass, we reinforce the myth that poverty is a moral problem that only the poor themselves (or, failing that, a long prison term) can solve.
Nothing plagues analyses of the African American population more than the misuse of averages and the tendency to regard all 30 million as a single, monolithic group. Andrew Hacker's recent book, "Two Nations," is typical.
In stark contrast with many statistics he later presents, Mr. Hacker patronizingly imagines a late 20th-century prototypical black who wanders on the margins of the white world, overwhelmed by his blackness, a slug on the salt of America's obsessive whiteness. "Separate, hostile and unequal," brutalized, victimized, the black passes his joyless existence without hope, secretly cursing his genetic destiny for placing him in "so disconsolate an estate."
This insulting travesty tells us a great deal about ultra-liberal thought on the subject, and why it has failed so dismally to come up with a viable response to conservative divisiveness, moral posturing and neglect. Some blacks, like numerous whites, may feel marginalized; most do not.
Blacks fail the so-called telephone test mentioned by Mr. Hacker (you can tell it's one of them, even on the phone), not because they can't talk "white," like the invidiously compared Asians, but because they enjoy talking "black." Much racial tension in recent years has had to do with African Americans' unwillingness to be "white" as the price of greater equality and opportunity. They live separately from whites for radically different reasons, most because they choose to. This, in itself, is no problem; it's a free country.
Equally patronizing and confusing is the growing tendency to conceive of whites in monolithic terms, as a chronically racist majority that is hostile to black advancement and benefits from oppression of blacks. In the U.S., unlike South Africa, whites outnumber blacks by 9 to 1. This means that the racist behavior of a small proportion of whites, or a small amount of discrimination by a majority, can result in significant harm to blacks.
This is the permanently bad news about minority status, as any Jew or Northern Irish Catholic will attest. For a few whites, the economic and psychological gains from oppressing blacks may be considerable. For the vast majority, however, there is nothing to be gained; it is hard to see how any group gains from the drug abuse, violence, irresponsible parenting and AIDS epidemic of the underclass.
Racial problems remain intractable because it is just as important to get the majority of whites to stop discriminating in the little ways that they do as it is to get the outright racist few to stop discriminating a lot. Lumping the two groups together, along with genuinely unprejudiced whites, is as misleading as identifying all blacks with the underclass.
Nor should we underestimate the degree to which the vestigially prejudiced majority may be changing, and may genuinely want a culturally and racially diverse society, as repeated opinion polls indicate. Reinforcing the poll data on changing white attitudes is a growing body of cultural evidence: the enormous popularity of "The Cosby Show," the hero-worship of a large number of African American athletes and entertainers, the idolization of Anita Hill, the celebration and deep respect for artistic giants like Toni Morrison, Miles Davis and Alvin Ailey.
Indeed, not since ancient Rome conquered and then surrendered to the culture of its Greek slaves and freedmen has the culture of a dominant world civilization been so enormously influenced by so small a minority of people. It is elitist and obtuse to discount the significance of this influence on white attitudes; it is egregious to suggest, as Mr. Hacker does, that love for a Michael Jordan is mere gladiatorial dehumanization.
Insisting that whites are responsible for black problems leads to a stalemate, for it only alienates the majority of whites, themselves barely coping, who may be only marginally racist or not racist at all. Worse is the failure to separate the question of blame from what is required to change the situation.
Even if it were true that whites are to be blamed for the problems disproportionately faced by blacks, it is disastrous strategy to insist that whites are responsible, qua whites, for solving their problems. However disquieting to moralists, majorities everywhere are moved to solve fundamental problems only when they find it in their interest to do so.
The Civil War was fought to abolish slavery, not primarily in response to the moral exhortation of abolitionists, but mainly because Northern whites became convinced that slavery threatened their individual, and the national, interests. The same holds even more in these selfish times.
The trials of the growing ranks of the poor, the anarchy of the underclass -- visible and invisible, black and white -- threaten us all, as does the perversion of justice by racist jurors. We must solve these problems together by insisting that analysts and the media report on them unsensationally and unpatronizingly. And we must demand that our frivolously distracted leaders, black and white, stop playing self-serving games of racial blame, denial and division, and address this national tragedy at once.

HEADLINE: World Leaders: Mickey, et al.

BYLINE: By TODD GITLIN; Todd Gitlin, a professor of sociology at the University of California in Berkeley, is author of "Inside Prime Time" and the forthcoming novel "The Murder of Albert Einstein." This article is adapted from an essay written for an American Enterprise Institute conference in March.

 BODY:
A few years ago, an amazed Japanese girl asked an American visitor, "Is there really a Disneyland in America?"
That should be music to the mouse ears of Euro Disneyland's management, beleaguered by charges that they are defiling the Frenchness of France. Ah, to convince the French that Mickey and Donald belong to Marne-la-Vallee as they do to Anaheim, Orlando and Tokyo. Sensitive to the charge that Euro Disneyland amounts to what the theater director Ariane Mnouchkine, in a widely quoted assessment, called a "cultural Chernobyl," the company tried for months to persuade Europeans that, in the words of a Disney spokesman, "It's not America, it's Disney." 
 On opening day last month, Disney's chairman Michael Eisner stressed, like a guest too eager to please, that the company had repackaged original European characters: the French Cinderella, the Italian Pinocchio, the German Snow White. More truculently, a Euro Disneyland spokeswoman said: "Who are these Frenchmen, anyway? We offer them the dream of a lifetime and lots of jobs. They treat us like invaders."
Beyond the cultural battle of the moment, both sides can agree on one thing: American popular culture is the closest approximation there is today to a global lingua franca, drawing urban classes in most nations into a federated culture zone. In one month, "Terminator 2" sold five million tickets in France. It is possible to see a Donald Duck decal on a wall in a village in the middle of a Greek island, hear country-western music on the radio in Ireland, buy a Woody Guthrie tribute tape at a gas station in Norway. Charles Bronson, Clint Eastwood, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Coke are, thanks to the multinational corporation, the icons of a global semiculture, helping to integrate at least the plugged-in classes of most nations into a single cultural zone. Entertainment is America's largest export -- after weaponry. The question is what this means.
Protectionists, such as the French Minister of Culture, Jack Lang, fear that America's marketing clout will succeed in paving over the profuse variety of global cultures. Once it is overstated, the fear is easy to sweep aside. Obviously, American popular culture does not erase all the vernacular alternatives. The new semiculture coexists with local cultures more than it replaces them.
As the Norwegian media researcher Helge Ronning suggests, it is plausible to suppose that global, largely American popular culture is becoming everyone's second culture. It doesn't necessarily supplant local traditions, but it does activate a certain cultural bilingualism. People from Australia to Zimbabwe acquire a second cultural membership, switching with ease from local news to the American Oscar ceremonies, and back again.
As his Americophile enemies love to point out, even Jack Lang recently conferred France's highest honor in the arts on Sylvester Stallone.
Why were "Dallas" and "Dynasty," at their peaks, on television in 100 countries -- popular in all but Japan and Brazil? Indisputably, economies of scale are one reason. The United States can simply undersell other suppliers. A programmer in Copenhagen can lease an hourlong episode of "Dallas" or "Miami Vice" for under $5,000, less than the cost of producing one original minute of Danish drama. American formulas have also helped establish the conventions -- the slickness, the melodrama, the cuteness, the glibness, the uplift -- that imitators around the world aim to match.
There is evidence that if Europeans had a choice, they would prefer programs produced in their own countries. But in the end, no one is forcing the Danes to watch American shows. In "Dallas" and its ilk they must be attracted by a range of pleasures comparable to those Americans find.
Scholars have demonstrated that when people watch the same program they see the program they are disposed to see. For instance, studies of "All in the Family" in Canada and Holland showed that the audience was divided between those who thought Edith, Gloria and Meathead won the arguments and those who believed that Archie regularly gave them their comeuppance.
Likewise, Tamar Liebes and Elihu Katz, sociologists at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, have shown that Israeli families of Russian, American and Moroccan provenance interpret the same "Dallas" episode in different ways and like it for different reasons. Indeed, the commercial strength of many American television programs in particular lies in their capacity to speak out of several sides of their mouths at once, enabling, to cite an example, teen-age girls to watch "Beverly Hills 90210" for both its good-looking guys and its "relevance."
Another explanation for the success of American culture is that it has been driven by a single overriding purpose: to entertain. For this reason, it is easy to see why American series have outdone British programs developed in large part for cultural elevation and erstwhile Soviet programs developed for didactic purposes. As a Euro Disneyland official protested last fall, "We're not trying to sell anything but fun, entertainment."
Moreover, as the British sociologist Jeremy Tunstall has observed, by the time it leaves our shores, much American popular culture has been pre-tested in a large internal market that incorporates elements of foreign tastes. America's music derives from the rhythms and songs of African slaves and their descendants. Its comic sense comes principally from English settlers, East European Jews and, again, blacks. By the time commercial work comes out of Hollywood or New York or Nashville, it has already been certified as widely marketable to a diverse population. No competitor from the monocultures of Europe and Asia can make this claim.
In popular music, where production costs are low, multinationals, ever thirsting for novelty, frequently import and reprocess styles from abroad, replenishing the stock of American music and giving something back to the global mix.
 
First the Bad News
Cultural Fast Food Goes Global
 Frequently in movies and television, global semi-Americanization has the effect of withering much of the foreign competition. Hollywood's principal style has narrowed the cultural repertory of film makers and audiences alike. America's so-called high production values, often mechanistic and mindless, have become the fast food of global culture.
The pressure to make films exportable further degrades them into entertainment machines. Many of today's major films are made to open in Paris and Peoria simultaneously and to sell on videocassette everywhere else a few weeks later. "Terminator 2," with its Austrian-born star, its French co-financing and its Spanish-language gags, might as well come from the moon or the Cayman Islands.
The English language, with its vast ready-made market on every continent, boosts the export prospects of these hybrids. Monosyllables help, too, because they are easily grasped and dubbed. To appeal to crowds from Copenhagen to Calcutta, "Terminator 2" and other mainstream Hollywood movies today use words as captions for pictures, which in turn are stripped to their most banal common denominators. Not only is American politics dragged down to the level of "Make my day," "Read my lips" and "Hasta la vista, baby," but many literate young screenwriters in America and elsewhere aspire to write at the primitive level of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.
Melodrama and comics have long been American specialties, of course, and one could argue that crude cartoon style is America's most potent export. Euro Disneyland may not be all-American -- there are European grace notes -- but it is Disney, with its squeaky-clean appeal to innocence. Last summer, the author and illustrator Maurice Sendak protested that Disney's cartoon version of Hans Christian Andersen's "Little Mermaid" was "a total contradiction of the original . . . the tale is about sacrifice. The little mermaid doesn't even get what she wants . . . that's a hard lesson. This movie is about getting married, having cupcakes for bras and going to live in White Plains somewhere."
The flip side of Disney cuteness is Hollywood brutishness. In the name of improving the balance of payments, Hollywood sends its most primitive goods abroad. The "Diehard" and "Lethal Weapon" movies reportedly brought in $1 billion worldwide. The glitzier the technology, the more American movies acquire a reputation for speed, savagery, ethical emptiness and smug surface. Fueled partly by the promise of global markets, the industry is in the grip of inner forces whose cynicism is so deep as to defy parody. Driven by economic incentives and a perverse pride in what they consider craft, movie makers concentrate on new ways to savage and kill. Once hooked, viewers everywhere require steadily increasing doses.
The predilections of financiers, directors, writers, makeup artists and teen-age audiences come together to ratchet up the frequency and magnitude of violence. Directors draw pride from their ability to surpass the previous round of abominations. Studio bosses, bankers and distributors see no reason to temper the cycle as long as it pays off. Everyone takes the loop of least resistance, doing more of what they already know how to do.
The secret of the global box-office success of these films is that they evoke a forbidden pleasure in the victim's pain and paranoia. The viewer is not drawn to identify with the victim, who is barely on the screen long enough to warrant a second thought. Instead, there is a delirium of delight in the perpetrator's ability to get away with murder. Freedom becomes another word for no one left to kill.
In the movies, Gresham's law, that most relentless of free-market principles, comes into play. Primitive entertainment drives out the local and complicated, which don't travel well. Local film industries usually cannot compete with Hollywood, much as they may try. Producers in central Europe are in a state of collapse. Small countries like Norway and Switzerland, which make a handful of films a year, drown in American movies, and young film makers in Europe and the third world find it hard to make careers amid the pressure of American imports.
Indeed, the ascendancy of Hollywood exports, along with most Americans' dislike of foreign films and television shows (Americans are allergic to subtitles, and barely 1 percent of American prime-time television comes from abroad), helps explain why the great European film-making generation of Bergman, Fellini, Antonioni, Godard, Truffaut, Rohmer and Resnais seems largely barren of successors.
As for Hollywood importing foreigners to make its movies, this does not represent so much an openness to foreign styles as the capacity to buy film makers into submission. The usual American mode is to take promising film makers from around the world and process them into banality. The Hollywood-financed work of the Australian Fred Schepisi ("A Cry in the Dark") and the Indian Mira Nair ("Mississippi Masala") is the exception. Closer to the rule, unfortunately, is the more-Hollywood-than-Hollywood Americanization of film makers like the Dutch director Paul Verhoeven ("Total Recall," "Basic Instinct") and directors with excellent credits abroad, like the New Zealander Roger Donaldson ("White Sands"), the Englishman Roland Joffe ("City of Joy") and the Australian Peter Weir ("Green Card").
 
Now the Good News
We're Not So Bad After All
 Fortunately, American entertainment has another side. About 10 years ago, a Hungarian media researcher, asked what were the most popular shows on Hungarian television, answered "Kojak" and "The Streets of San Francisco," because Hungarians had good reason to appreciate, even love, the casual, approachable American cops.
Five years ago, with much fanfare, a galaxy of rock stars including Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen recorded "We Are the World." Hip critics said it was arrogant and sentimental. Then a multicolored group of South African protesters marched into an all-white neighborhood singing "We Are the World."
Two years ago, the American historian Paul Buhle, visiting East Berlin just after the wall came down, was told by a student: "Last night I dreamed of Route 66." The route she dreamed of, of course, was the one immortalized on the television series of the early 60's.
A year ago, according to an account in The Observer of London, several Serbian students arrested by the Belgrade riot police after an opposition rally were beaten with truncheons, fists and walkie-talkies, "then forced to stand with their hands up against a wall for the next four hours. When anyone dropped their hands, they were kicked in the knees. Then the policemen forced them to stand on tiptoe. Students who disobeyed were beaten. The tiptoe torture was followed by a mockery of a trial. When one student asked for a defense lawyer, he was told: 'You have been watching too many American films!' "
It's all American pop culture: the coupling of irreverence and brutality; intimations of freedom alongside the worship of power; the exaltation of the proverbial little guy alongside technological elephantiasis; the love of the road alongside the degradation of dialogue; the lyrical spunk of R.E.M. alongside the racket of Megadeth. This curious compound will continue to flow into the world for worse, and for better. It will invite immigration, emulation, amusement and revulsion.
Meanwhile, outside our vision, Mexican and Brazilian tele-novelas, Hong Kong kung fu, Finnish-English comedy, Senegalese drama, Polish-French existentialism and the world's other currents swirl into the leftover niches. No other super culture has the capital, organization and ambition to break the world into interchangeable parts. Americans may not feel the need to know what the rest of the world is imagining, but we would do well to open our eyes and see what's happening outside our theme park.

HEADLINE: Bristol-Myers Has Worked to Improve Syracuse Environment

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Statements by members of the United States Attorney's office following the April 24 plea by Bristol-Myers Squibb to four Clean Water Act misdemeanors raise concerns for us in the Syracuse business community (news article, April 25).
We favor swift and strict enforcement of environmental laws in the community where we live and work. The United States Attorney's office sought to characterize the misdemeanors for which the pharmaceutical maker took full responsibility as more than they were, thus overshadowing the company's positive and responsible environmental programs. 
 The company admitted negligence in causing waste-water and storm-water permit violations. The Government accepted this as settlement of a nearly four-year investigation into the company's Syracuse facility. Despite this investigation, during which many employees were called before the grand jury and thousands of documents were subpoenaed, the facility continued to develop and produce lifesaving drugs, and accelerated its environmental programs.
Bristol-Myers Squibb has invested more than $35 million in seven years for environmental improvements. The United States Attorney's comment that the company knew it was breaking the law and did nothing seems inconsistent with this record.
The settlement included a $3.5 million fine, which the company agreed to pay to get this matter behind it. However, the company paid this amount on the condition that $3 million would be suspended and directed to state environmental programs. The United States Attorney's office sensationalized the fine by likening it to the $150 million paid in the Exxon Valdez disaster. This insults the company's 1,100 employees and implies much greater environmental harm than could have resulted from the violations. The Government did not report any resulting environmental harm to Onondaga Lake.
In the plea agreement, Bristol-Myers also agreed to construct a waste-water pretreatment facility for $10 million to $30 million. The company's waste-water discharge is directed to and treated by the Onondaga County waste-water treatment plant. The treatment plant was designed to handle the company's waste stream, and Bristol-Myers pays the county almost $3 million a year for the service.
We believe the company's management and employees demonstrate a responsible corporate attitude toward the environment. It has invested in equipment and technology, and has established policies and programs to prevent and detect environmental problems at its Thompson Road site. Bristol-Myers has established a partnership with New York State and the Metropolitan Development Association of Syracuse and Central New York to insure that its environmental programs will be more effective and compatible with future economic development.
The company's efforts to be environmentally responsible should not be overshadowed by the United States Attorney's characterization of the plea.

HEADLINE: RIOTS IN LOS ANGELES: The Overview;
Calm Endures With Grief in Los Angeles

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 3

 BODY:
The streets of riot-weary Los Angeles were calm for a second day today, as Federal troops joined law-enforcement patrols, and cleanup efforts accelerated. Mayor Tom Bradley said he hoped to lift the city's dusk-to-dawn curfew on Monday.
Across the city, many grocery stores and gas stations shuttered during the riots were open but with added and armed security, and longer lines. Basketball courts and soccer fields were crowded for the first time in days, and the Los Angeles Unified School District announced that classes would resume Monday at the district's nearly 700 schools. Pastors at churches in South-Central Los Angeles, and indeed throughout the country, spoke of the need for healing and compassion. 
 But the calm was broken this evening when National Guardsmen shot and killed a man who drove his car at them, the police said. It was the first instance in which guardsmen had shot anyone since taking up positions on the city's streets on Thursday.
 
Head of Political Agenda
 As the immediate crisis in the city seemed to abate, the deeper underlying problems seemed to rise to the surface of the political agenda. Aides to President Bush said that he would travel to Los Angeles on Thursday for a long-scheduled visit and that he would use the opportunity to talk about economic and social justice in American cities.
His likely challenger this fall, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, flew to Los Angeles today, with plans to meet Monday with the leaders of black, Hispanic and Korean-American organizations. [Page B8.]
The Mayor has appointed Peter V. Ueberroth, who organized the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, to head a commission charged with overseeing the restoration of the riot-damaged neighborhoods.
With almost 9,500 people arrested since rioting erupted Wednesday night, the Los Angeles County Municipal Courthouse was one of the busiest places in town today. Judges, prosecutors, defense lawyers and other court employees planned to work through the night, hoping to complete felony arraignments for at least 750 defendants.
"It's pretty chaotic," said Marcia Skolnik, a spokeswoman for the courthouse. "From what I understand, the district attorney's office has never faced a caseload like this."
Officials at the coroner's office also stayed on constant duty today, as the death toll reached 50, of whom 21 people were black, 16 Hispanic, 7 white, 2 Asian and 4 of unknown ethnic origin, according to the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office. Some of the injured died in hospitals, and new victims were added to the list when their bodies were recently discovered in burned-out buildings.
In addition, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said 2,116 people had been injured, 226 of them critically.
The latest shooting occurred at 7:40 P.M. after the man drove his car toward two guardsmen posted just north of the South-Central neighborhood, and then, ignoring demands to stop, returned a second time, Detective Andrew Cicoria of the Los Angeles Police Department said.
"The car went around the block and made a second attempt to run over them," Detective Cicoria said. "At this time, they fired in self-defense and the individual was struck several times." The man, described as Hispanic but not identified, died less than three hours later at California Medical Center-Los Angeles.
One of the two guardsmen in the street and two others posted nearby fired 14 rounds at the car, he said.
Within three hours of the shooting, large numbers of troops arrived at the scene to take up positions in the mostly empty street.
The curfew, in effect since Thursday, had turned this city into a near ghost town as soon as the sun set. Almost the only movements through the streets were caravans of black-and-white police cars and armored vehicles carrying soldiers armed with rifles and shotguns.
The first of 556 marines stationed in the city arrived on Saturday, said Bill Frio, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department at the emergency command center. Together with 4,385 National Guards troops and 321 other law-enforcement officers who are patrolling the city, they are under the command of Maj. Gen. Marvin L. Couvalt of the Army. Other marines and soldiers under his command are nearby and prepared to take positions if needed. Mr. Frio said the number of Guard troops stationed in the city was about 10 percent higher than on Saturday.
 
Anger Lingers Like Haze
 The sight of so many armed men has been both reassuring and disturbing.
"I think the occupation is complete," said Representative Maxine Waters, a Democrat whose district includes South-Central Los Angeles. "They've got the National Guard and God knows who stationed all over the place. People are being contained with this security, but they are still just as angry. The problems won't just go away."
Churches across South-Central Los Angeles, the urban patch hardest hit by the murderous riots, were full today as this wounded city tried to clean its soul as well as its streets of the despair that hovered like the haze.
"We go from mess-up, to mop-up, to the make-up," said the Rev. Cecil Murray, the pastor of the First African Methodist Episcopal Church, which he turned into a shelter for dozens of riot refugees -- people who were burned out of their houses or have been afraid to return to them.
Property damage is still being assessed, but the Mayor estimated it at $500 million.
Robert Lee, a black man who runs his own small contracting business, said he saw opportunity in the ashes. "I see a lot of hope," he said today as he sat on his stoop in South-Central, sipping a root beer. "I'm a contractor, and there's going to be a lot of jobs for me. A lot of small businesses have been burned down and they want people to reconstruct them. It's going to be great. I'm going to expand my business."
Five of those killed were shot by Los Angeles police officers. The department is trying to investigate the shootings, but progress has been slow, as it is every time a civilian is killed by the police.
The city was a checkerboard of relief and worry today.
After mass at St. Vincent Roman Catholic Church in downtown Los Angeles, Everardo J. Garcia, a 20-year-old, unemployed immigrant from El Salvador, sounded shell shocked by the events of the last few days.
He said when he came to the United States, he "thought it would be calmer here, that I wasn't going to see things like this. It was like a war."
And like a war, the survivors in the hardest hit areas found novel ways to cope. The riots knocked out electrical power to thousands of residents, among them, William Jeter and his neighbors in South-Central Los Angeles.
Today, Mr. Jeter, a mechanic, said he had rigged up a car battery and headlight in his home and was the only person on his block with light at night.
But he said there was no power for his refrigerator, causing special problems for people like him who now have no place nearby to buy groceries.
 
Now a Tourist Attraction
 The intersection of Florence and Normandie, where much of the trouble began, was transformed today from a battlefield to a tourist attraction as passing motorists got out of their cars to take pictures.
The calm on the streets belies the powerful emotional aftershocks still being felt by people like Lorey Battle, a 53-year-old school clerk who has lived in the South-Central area all of her life.
Today, with bus service restored, she waited for transportation. Asked what she thought about the military presence in her neighborhood, Mrs. Battle said: "I think it's very sad to see our city torn up like this. I hate to see them. But it's the only way we can be safe now."
She said the neighborhood had been on its way back, ever so slowly recovering from the fires of the 1960's. "It was growing," she said. "People had businesses. There was a black business over there and a Korean business over there."
Today there were ashes.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Front-Runner;
Clinton Lays Plans for November With Survivor's Calm Confidence

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
Bill Clinton says he will not be another Michael S. Dukakis. If President Bush's press secretary wants to throw around slurs like "Slippery Bill," as he did last week, Mr. Clinton says, he will counter.
Very quickly, he demonstrates: Mr. Bush could be the "poster child of 1992 on slickness." 
 But in an interview on Saturday, the Arkansas Governor and likely Democratic nominee talked of bigger challenges than holding his own in partisan sniping. Before he can translate discontent into Democratic votes, he said, he must overcome a powerful distrust of politics and politicians.
He said he needed to make people believe that he, not Ross Perot, the Texas businessman who is considering an independent candidacy, was the best vehicle for change. He said he needed to connect with people who know nothing about him and are inclined to believe the worst about any politician, including one dismissed by his critics as "Slick Willie."
Still, interviewed in New Orleans near the mid-point of this election year, Mr. Clinton looked back on a brutal primary season, and ahead toward what is expected to be a tough general election campaign, with the gritty calm of a survivor. He even talked of the onslaught of personal charges last winter, like the draft and marital infidelity issues, as a learning experience.
 
The Republican Attack
 "I hate to say it, because it's been so painful, but all this stuff has been very educational to me," he said. The most important thing he learned, he said with a slight smile, was "that I'm tough enough to be President; if I ever doubted it, I don't now."
The Republicans, Mr. Clinton acknowledges, are almost certain to attack him in the fall as being too risky, too untested to lead, as they campaigned against Mr. Dukakis, the Democratic nominee in 1988. But Mr. Clinton says he has a simple counter-message about the risk of four more years of Mr. Bush.
"They are presiding over serious economic decline and social disintegration, and they have no plan to do anything about it, and they don't even believe that they should," Mr. Clinton said. "They are basically people who have an idea of governing and leading that in my view is totally out of step with the times."
Mr. Clinton talked of a second Bush Administration with barely disguised contempt. "He would give us a little more of this, a little more of that, he'd tack around this issue and that issue," he said. "America will continue to lose ground, but as painlessly as possible. He'll sort of give us an anesthetic as we continue to slide."
 
Difficulty of Being a Politician
 The difficulty for a Democratic challenger, Mr. Clinton suggests, is that many Americans no longer believe that another politician can halt the slide. "That explains, in large measure, the popularity at this time of Perot," he said. "People want to vote. You've got a large group of people at this point who want to vote. They want to be good citizens and they want somebody to fix things. But they have been so disappointed for so long that they can't believe anybody who's a politician can do it.
"Because they believe that both parties are to blame for the problems of America, which I believe, too."
Mr. Clinton seemed reflective during the interview, still mulling over the lessons of a rugged primary season.
He talked several times of wanting to take his campaign back to its beginning, back to the issues of "a forgotten middle class," like programs for college loans and apprenticeships, and back to his vision of "reinvented" government efforts to move the poor into the economic mainstream.
 
Repairing Negative Image
 The American people, he said again and again, "don't want this election to be about me."
But the strategist in Mr. Clinton acknowledged that he had to "fill in the blanks" on his life and record; he also had to repair the damage of the primary campaign, which left him with higher negative than positive ratings among registered voters in the most recent New York Times/CBS News Poll.
"When you start in a national campaign, it takes forever to really get known," Mr. Clinton said. "And all the avalanche of essentially either good or at least fair and balanced publicity may not pierce the consciousness of a reluctant electorate in the same way that one bad thing did."
He knew this intellectually at the start of the campaign, he said, but added that living it was hard, particularly for a politician from a small state, where "people have a sort of rounded picture" and a "context" for whatever news comes along. At times, he said, he felt absolute "bewilderment" at how he was viewed. "I just had to say sometimes, 'that is not me. Even if everybody in America believes it, it still doesn't make it me.' "
The general election campaign is only beginning, but Mr. Bush's allies clearly intend to use the "slickness" accusation against Mr. Clinton. The assertion helps raise the issue of trust, always a critical threshold for a Presidential challenger. Mr. Clinton said: "If they want to call me names, they can do it, but they should realize, I won't be like Dukakis. It won't be a one-way street."
To wit, when asked about the use of the expression "Slippery Bill" made by the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, Mr. Clinton shot back of Mr. Bush, "If there's a fair reading of his record and mine, he comes off a lot more slippery than I." He added: "The civil rights bill was a quota bill while David Duke was running like a house afire. Then David Duke disappeared, thanks to the people of Louisiana, and he signed the civil rights bill.
"He worked for 11 years with Reagan to minimize the availability of college aid to middle-class kids, and then right before the Pennsylvania primary, when it looks like I'm going to be the nominee, he all of a sudden is a convert to middle-class college aid."
 
Believing in the Message
 Still, Mr. Clinton says there is a tendency to overlearn the lessons of the last war; in the case of the Democrats, given Mr. Dukakis's pummeling by Mr. Bush in 1988, to believe that toughness is everything.
"The problem is, every time you get in one of those fights, the election becomes more and more about the politicians and less about the people," he said. "It looks like two people who desperately want to be in power instead of someone who wants to fight for the interests of other people and their lives."
Mr. Clinton added: "I still think in the end the most important thing is to have a message and to make people believe that you desperately want to do what you say. Because there's so many people who basically just see this as a sideshow."
The Arkansas Governor, a politician for most of his adult life, sometimes seemed to be struggling to understand how politics could have become so alienating to so many people. He argues that it is a moment in history when his generation in particular, the baby boomers, should be "throwing ourselves into the future."
As for himself, he seems unplagued by doubt. "I have always believed that at this moment in time, I can do more for the American people than anybody else who was running," he says with great calm.
He spoke, for example, with considerable passion in recent days about the crisis in Los Angeles. He said in the interview that his background as a Southern Governor gave him a special perspective on the issue, on the need to "establish a dialogue across racial lines in this country," to rebuild the cities and the depressed rural areas, to work on re-instilling values and "literally re-connect millions of Americans to the society in which we live."
He added: "I think I understand that. I understand that because I grew up in a segregated Southern society as a supporter of integration. I understand it because I live in a neighborhood that is integrated and my daughter goes to a majority black school in a majority black school district. I understand it because I've been the governor of a state that includes the Mississippi Delta, which is and always has been the poorest part of America."
At moments like that, Mr. Clinton seems to be back to the beginning, as he puts it, of his campaign, back to issues, away from the rough challenge of the character issue and making people believe in politics again.

HEADLINE: Guarantees Sought for Russian Ventures

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Many American companies, convinced that it is too risky to invest in the former Soviet Union, have appealed to the Bush Administration for greatly enlarged Federal investment guarantees to protect them from losses.
Without such guarantees, Corporate America appears to have decided that it will not go forward now with extensive ventures in the Commonwealth of Independent States -- despite the potential for big profits in the future. 
 "The risks in Russia are greater than in any other part of the world," said Dexter Baker, chairman of the National Association of Manufacturers and also of Air Products and Chemicals Inc., a multinational company based in Allentown, Pa. "So if American industry is to do business there, it needs special Government protection, and that can be done by expanding investment insurance and export guarantees."
The Bush Administration has responded favorably because it regards large corporate investments as crucial to a foreign policy that seeks to give the United States a leading role in shaping the Commonwealth's transition to capitalism. The Administration has begun scrambling for money, including the possible diversion of general foreign-aid appropriations.
The money would guarantee not only huge American investments in factories, oilfields and the like, but also payments to American companies for products exported to the Commonwealth. So far, American companies have invested only $400 million in Russia and the other republics. Last year, they exported about $10 billion in goods to the Soviet Union.
While numerous American companies are starting to operate in the Commonwealth, no American or European corporation has yet spent $200 million on a factory, an oilfield operation or other single project -- the scale of investment that would give a company's home nation an important presence in the economy. The largest single investment so far is less than $80 million and most are under $10 million.
To encourage bigger outlays by businesses, the Administration included special provisions in a bill to authorize some contribution by the United States to a $24 billion international-aid package. One provision would channel more than $1.2 billion now earmarked for general foreign aid -- road building in Africa, for example -- into money to guarantee American ventures in the Commonwealth.
"We regard it as important to take whatever steps are necessary to help promote the role of United States trade and investment in developing the private sector in the former Soviet Union," said a State Department official who insisted on anonymity.
The bill's prospects in Congress are uncertain. Some Democratic leaders have urged opposition until the President has a more effective domestic policy. And in an age of huge budget deficits, neither the Administration nor anyone in Congress has called for new money to support private-sector operations in the Commonwealth.
Mr. Baker of the manufacturers group and a dozen other chief executives, along with representatives of the United States Chamber of Commerce, pressed their case with Mr. Bush at a White House meeting in late April. A Commerce Department survey of American companies, released in late April, uncovered the same desire for help.
 
'We Are Used to Taking Risks'
 "We are used to taking risks, but risks that we can see and quantify," said Willard A. Workman, vice president for the chamber's international division. "But in the Commonwealth countries you cannot learn enough or find out enough in the available time. You have to make assumptions and you have to be responsible to shareholders. So you look to Government for help."
The Administration's initially favorable response to the unusually explicit corporate request for Government help constitutes what many economists describe as de facto industrial policy -- with the backing of giants like I.B.M., Coca-Cola, Texaco, Cummins Engine, Archer-Daniels-Midland and Dresser Industries. The term refers to a collaboration between the Government and the private sector that the Reagan and Bush Administrations, with their free-market orientation, have publicly opposed but privately permitted.
 
Effect of Military Spending
 Military spending and the technologies it has generated represent the granddaddy of industrial policy, of course. But as military spending has declined, other programs have appeared, one recent example being Commerce Department grants to companies engaged in developing high-technology products, like special ceramics used in electronic products.
Now, by publicly supporting Federal guarantees for private-sector investments, the Administration could fuel the debate over the need for a more comprehensive industrial policy, one that would explore other areas that could benefit from Government help and presumably rank them by importance.
"Do we want to go piecemeal from one case to the next, or do we want to step back and look at the broader objectives of industrial policy?" asked Stephen S. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "Is investment in Russia more important than a business-government partnership to clean up the environment in the United States, or infrastructure spending here, or who knows what else?"
 
Corporate Change of Heart
 Others note that many corporations are altering or reversing their policies. Now, they are underscoring their American identities. During the 1980's, a period of rapid expansion abroad, they argued that their global interests were not always those of the United States.
Among other things, the Administration and Corporate America agree that European governments, particularly Germany's, are giving more support than the United States is to exports and to the investments of their corporate sectors in the Commonwealth republics.
Such ties between business and government, in turn, are now considered an essential tool in the competition among the biggest industrial nations -- chiefly the United States and Germany -- for influence over the Commonwealth nations as they develop their rich natural resources and open their markets to the West.
Apart from the Government's foreign-policy goals, American corporations subscribe to the proposition that the payoff for early investors could be large by the 21st century. But they also argue that doing business in a land that banished capitalism for so long presents risks that are almost impossible to assess.
The problem, then, is to get through the early, risky years without too much loss, and the solution, American companies say, is Federal guarantees that go far beyond those now offered by the Export-Import Bank, which lends money to foreigners to buy American exports, and by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a Federal agency that guarantees foreign investments. Separately, the Federal Commodity Credit Corporation finances food exports.
"There is a recognition developing on both sides that the private sector and Government need to pull together to assure that we have a fair chance to be successful in the emerging Commonwealth market," said Thomas J. Duesterberg, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for international economic policy.
 
Requests Outweigh Resources
 The Overseas Private Investment Corporation, more commonly known as OPIC, has sufficient money today to insure nearly $8 billion in private-sector investment throughout the world, mostly against losses resulting from political upheaval. American companies, however, have applied for $12 billion in investment guarantees for the Commonwealth states alone, OPIC reports, including requests that exceed OPIC's $50 million limit for a single investment.
"No one right now is pushing for a higher ceiling," said Howard L. Hills, OPIC's vice president and general counsel. "But that is a political question that is very pregnant."
While OPIC has not yet guaranteed Commonwealth investments, the Export-Import Bank has issued $172 million in financing for exports to these republics. The bank pays the American exporter directly and then collects the loan over a period of years from the buyer in Russia or another Commonwealth republic.
The bank has requests for more than $2 billion in export financing, and it has money to provide $11 billion in export financing worldwide in the current fiscal year. But the bank says it will proceed cautiously in the Commonwealth states, unwilling to take greater risks than Corporate America would take on its own. The caution reflects the bank's mandate from Congress.
"We are not suspending good business judgment; that is not our game," said Thomas Moran, the bank's vice president for Europe and Canada. "We operate under a Congressional charter that specifies that we must find reasonable assurance of repayment."

HEADLINE: RIOTS IN LOS ANGELES: Challenger;
Nation Needs Healing, Clinton Says

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 3

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton arrived here tonight to survey the damage from riots that devastated wide areas of America's second-largest city.
Mr. Clinton immedidately set out for the First African Methodist Episcopal Church, a command post for volunteer efforts to clean up the city and aid victims of the riots in South-Central Los Angeles. 
 Mr. Clinton's visit here concluded a day in which he said repeatedly that the riots showed the need for a new President who could bind up and reunify a nation drifting apart along lines of race and income. He planned to meet Monday with leaders of black, Hispanic and Korean-American organizations.
The day began with visits to two black churches in Washington, D.C., and included a trip to Jeffersonville, Ind. Mr. Clinton was following his own recommendation for a national day of prayer and healing after the riots.
Indiana and the District of Columbia hold Presidential primaries on Tuesday. California's primary is on June 2.
In Washington, Mr. Clinton got a warm reception from clergymen and churchgoers, who agreed with his plea for more attention to race relations and the problems of cities.
 
Prayers for the Nation
 Mr. Clinton said he prayed that the nation could recover "a spirit of genuine community" after the riots prompted by the acquittal last week of four white police officers accused of beating a black motorist in March 1991.
Speaking in rhythmic cadences like those of the Baptist clergymen who introduced him, Mr. Clinton said today: "We have neglected and denied our problems for too long as they have festered. We have refused to confront our differences. We have refused to sit down in a room together in common conversation, black and white together, to discuss our honest fears, our honest differences and our common interests. And for this neglect, we have all paid."
Standing outside the Israel Baptist Church in Northeast Washington, Mr. Clinton said he had no criticism of the steps taken by President Bush in response to the riots: sending Federal troops and law-enforcement officers to Los Angeles and stepping up a grand jury investigation to determine if Federal civil rights laws had been violated in the beating of the black motorist, Rodney G. King.
But Mr. Clinton said the events were "a reflection of more than a decade of denial of responsibility and of manipulation of political symbols" by Republicans in the White House.
Officials of the Bush and Reagan Administrations have often criticized Democrats in Congress, saying they have tried to exploit economic divisions and incite class warfare. But Mr. Clinton sounded a very different theme of healing and reconciliation today, even as he chided the Bush Administration.
"We are not honestly confronting problems of race and poverty and differences among the American people," Mr. Clinton said. "People have got to begin to talk to each other across the great racial divide and pull together to turn this country around."
In the pulpits of the Israel Baptist Church and the First Baptist Church in Northwest Washington, Mr. Clinton, who is Baptist, blended politics, Scripture and sociology into a sermon on the need for new leadership. Mr. Clinton promised to "make an effort to bring us together to overcome those lines of racial division that savaged the South."
The Governor did not criticize Mr. Bush by name, but by talking about moral and economic decay, he seemed to be reproaching the Reagan and Bush Administrations.
"Just below the mainstream, there is another stream of Americans living apart from our values, apart from our institutions, apart from the warm embrace of a church like this, with no connection to a society or a higher power," Mr. Clinton said at the First Baptist Church.
"We must not allow this country to drift apart further by race and income," he said. "Let us pray for the United States, that somehow, some way, we will learn the deeper lesson of the last few days: that we are drifting apart when we ought to be coming together."
Mr. Clinton said many of the rioters in Los Angeles had used the acquittal of the four police officers as an excuse for looting and burning. The reaction, "while understandable, is still unforgivable," he said.
"I was raised by a grandfather with a fourth-grade education who taught me that segregation was wrong even in the Deep South in the early 50's," the Governor said. "I can't help but think how much better off we would have been if all those people who were richer and better-educated had the simple wisdom of my grandfather."

HEADLINE: RIOTS IN LOS ANGELES: The President;
Bush Moves to Respond to Strong Test From Riots

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
Deep into a difficult political campaign and facing what some aides now call a domestic Persian Gulf crisis, President Bush will meet with his top domestic advisers Monday morning to begin mapping his response to the civic and physical wreckage of the Los Angeles riots.
Mr. Bush is being pressed to quickly address the broader social ailments underlying last week's upheaval, some senior Administration aides said, adding that the most likely forum for unveiling such a prescription was a long-scheduled visit to Los Angeles on Thursday. Mr. Bush had planned to speak about free trade, but the address will almost certainly now be devoted to the themes of economic and social justice, said the aides, all of whom insisted on anonymity. 
 But they added that there was still no clear idea of what broad proposals the President should or even could offer to bridge the racial and economic divisions that the riots laid bare.
 
Test of Leadership
 "You can look at Thursday in California as a test of how Bush is going to play this: Is he engaged, or does he do the conventional speech and try to get out quickly?" one top official said today. "That's being debated now, and will be over next few days."
Much of the debate on Monday and the days ahead is likely to focus on the proposals of Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp, who with Vice President Dan Quayle has long been a vocal advocate of a more forceful anti-poverty agenda. Mr. Kemp has urged reducing Federal dominance of social programs and giving the poor more control over their own lives.
Mr. Bush is under considerable political pressure to prove his leadership on the issue. The likely Democratic presidential nominee, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, arrived in Los Angeles tonight to offer his own recommendations.
 
Search for Solutions
 Ross Perot, the Texas businessman who is an undeclared independent Presidential candidate, also attacked Mr. Bush during a network television interview on Sunday for remaining in Washington during the riots. One Administration adviser acknowledged today that the attack "strikes a chord" with some voters, and that many of Mr. Bush's aides believe he must offer more than a usual response.
That political urgency is expected to give fresh momentum in Monday's meeting to a search for solutions to poverty and social fragmentation that even Mr. Bush's top aides concede has gotten half-hearted support during his tenure in office.
The participants are to include Mr. Bush's senior White House aides, including the chief of staff, Samuel K. Skinner, and Richard G. Darman, the budget director; Labor Secretary Lynn Martin, Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, an aide to Education Secretary Lamar Alexander, who is traveling, and Mr. Kemp.
 
Time for Kemp's Ideas?
 Mr. Kemp's proposals, some of which have become law, include such innovations as allowing poor families to buy apartments in public-housing projects. They also seek to give individuals and businesses financial incentives to develop the inner cities and improve their own station in life.
One White House official, a senior adviser not aligned with Mr. Kemp, said today that that may begin to change in the wake of the Los Angeles riots. Mr. Skinner and his top aides, including his deputy, Henson Moore, and the domestic policy chief, Clayton K. Yeutter, are more open to considering Mr. Kemp's ideas than was John H. Sununu, Mr. Skinner's deeply conservative predecessor, he said.
Many of Mr. Kemp's proposals have the added attraction of requiring little or no additional Federal money, a requirement in a year when a gaping budget deficit precludes more than a token offering of new Federal programs for the poor.
On the other hand, Mr. Kemp's plans have been consistently opposed by Mr. Darman, a powerful figure in shaping Administration policy, and by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, one of Mr. Bush's closest and oldest friends.
 
Campaign Considerations
 Nor is it clear whether Mr. Bush's political strategists, led by his campaign manager, Robert M. Teeter, would favor an election-year agenda studded with high-profile proposals to assist the disadvantaged. Administration officials interviewed today were themselves divided over how Mr. Bush's natural constituency, largely middle- and upper-class voters, would react to such initiatives.
Mr. Bush himself has seemed ambivalent about the problem until now. The President's last major address on social issues, a speech this spring on the American family, branded the disintegration of urban society an "urgent" crisis that cried for solutions, but proposed no solution beyond letting states conduct experimental welfare programs.
Similarly, Mr. Bush's White House domestic staff has debated several dramatic reforms in anti-poverty programs for more than two years, but has endorsed none.
Some Administration officials already have argued that the Los Angeles riots present Mr. Bush with a unique opportunity both to do good and to gain political advantage by proposing a comprehensive and largely new Federal attack on social problems.
Besides projecting himself as a national leader, they said, such a move would present the White House with an opportunity to begin recapturing the support of blacks and other minorities that was lost in the 1950's and 1960's, when the Democratic Party took the lead in civil-rights issues.
However, Mr. Bush's staff made no systematic effort over the weekend to consider its options for Thursday's visit to Los Angeles, a fact that some aides called revealing by itself.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Primary;
North Carolina Seems Ripe for Bush and Clinton

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RALEIGH, N.C., April 30

 BODY:
As the Presidential primaries move back to the South with voting here on Tuesday, President Bush seems poised to get strong endorsement from Republicans while Gov. Bill Clinton is likely to reinforce his image as someone who can bring together conservative whites and black voters.
Few surprises are expected in the voting here in spite of extensive campaigning by Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative columnist who is challenging Mr. Bush. Jack Hawke, the state Republican chairman, said that while Mr. Bush's support in the state was not as strong as it was four years ago it would be strong enough to keep Mr. Buchanan from winning more than 25 percent of the vote. 
 Meanwhile, Mr. Clinton's main opponent, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, scheduled only one campaign appearance in the state. By contrast, Hillary Clinton, the candidate's wife, spent several days in the state recently, and the Arkansas Governor himself arrived today to campaign.
Democrats and Republicans alike say that in spite of the largely foregone conclusion of the Presidential primaries here, there was sufficient interest in contested races for Governor, the United States Senate and House and several statewide offices to generate a substantial turnout.
The circumstances of voters here are significantly different from those in many of the states where primaries have been held so far: they are better off economically, which suggests that Mr. Buchanan faces an uphill battle in the Republican contest, as does Mr. Brown in the Democratic race.
James F. Smith, a professor of finance at the University of North Carolina, said that for all but two months in the last 11 years North Carolina has had the nation's lowest unemployment rate. The rate is currently 6.3 percent, while the national average is 7.3 percent. The state's diversified manufacturing economy runs the gamut from heavy equipment to cigarettes and depends heavily on exports -- consequently frowning on Mr. Buchanan's brand of trade protectionism.
The state also has several military bases, and one in four veterans of the Persian Gulf war lived in North Carolina, Professor Smith said, adding that buttressed support for Mr. Bush.
Mr. Buchanan has nevertheless been trying to awaken a protest vote among conservatives, speaking out against things like multi-culturalism while also courting the religious right with support for school prayer and opposition to abortion. More pointedly, he has criticized the President for signing the civil rights bill last year and has charged that the Justice Department's approval of two eccentricly shaped North Carolina Congressional districts with black majorities was a move "toward American apartheid."
John Hood, the executive director of the Locke Foundation, a conservative research organization here, said Mr. Buchanan had also been evoking the glory days of the rightwing forces when Senator Jesse Helms, in 1976, directed the campaign of Ronald Reagan in the state. Mr. Helms guided a stinging surprise defeat of the incumbent President, Gerald R. Ford, in the Republican primary.
Mr. Buchanan has made no secret of his hope that such a development could occur again this year. But Mr. Hood said there were problems with that expectation. Mr. Buchanan is no Ronald Reagan, he said, and Senator Helms and his backers are supporting President Bush, although tepidly. More moderate Republican figures, led by Gov. James G. Martin, whose term is expiring, also support Mr. Bush.
In the Democratic race, Mr. Brown faces similar obstacles, and Christopher J. Geis, a spokesman for the North Carolina Democratic Party, said he saw little support for the Californian. The name of former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts is still on the Democratic ballot, but he has asked his supporters not to compete for North Carolina's 98 national convention delegates.
"We think the state is an ideal one for Clinton to show that he can create a coalition of blacks and rural white conservatives," Mr. Geis said. "That is the coalition that wins statewide for Democrats here."
In his appearance in North Carolina today, Mr. Clinton participated in a video conference at the University of North Carolina that hooked him up with university students, teachers and businessmen in other parts of the state. The event was intended to highlight the candidate's support for education and education's impact on economic development.
Barlow Herget, a Raleigh councilman who was an early Clinton supporter, said it was the kind of issue-oriented event that he and others have longed for as they watched Mr. Clinton dodge one flare-up after another over his personal life and finances.
"Since the meat grinder of the New York primary and the tabloid headlines, he has been more deliberate with his message," Mr. Herget said, "and that has helped him here in North Carolina. It is important for him to be here and for people to see him talking about real issues. They respond positively to him when he does that."


GRAPHIC: All figures are for 1990 except where indicated. North Carolina's population in 1990, excluding people living abroad, was 6,628,637 or 2.6 percent of the U.S. total. It ranks 10th among the states in population.

HEADLINE: New Fight Starts on Unemployment Aid

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
The Bush Administration and Congressional Democrats are battling again over extra unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless, with Congress apparently determined to make permanent changes in the law and the Administration preferring only another short-term extension.
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee, and Representative Thomas J. Downey, the Long Island Democrat in charge of the issue on the House Ways and Means Committee, conducted hearings this week on the extra benefits. 
 Both men said they would press for permanent statutory changes that would make extended benefits available in recessions much more readily than they are now. Such changes, they said, would be fairer and would keep Congress from having to pass emergency extensions every few months.
But the Secretary of Labor, Lynn M. Martin, told both committees that the Administration opposed making any permanent changes now. She said these were "complicated, costly issues" that would delay action on another emergency extension.
 
Difficult to Qualify
 She said that the Administration was always willing to discuss changes, but that it might be better to wait until an advisory commission reports on the subject in 1994. The commission has yet to be appointed.
The basic law, last changed in 1982, makes it difficult to qualify for an additional 13 weeks of benefits beyond the basic 26 weeks. Workers in only six states -- Alaska, California, Maine, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont -- and Puerto Rico would qualify under that law today, although the national unemployment rate is 7.3 percent.
President Bush killed two Congressional efforts to legislate emergency extensions last year before agreeing to a plan in November. Another extension was passed in early February. Under those measures, an unemployed worker who remains jobless after exhausting the regular 26 weeks of unemployment insurance benefits can collect an additional 26 to 33 weeks of benefits.
That Federal program has aided about two million people, said Isaac Shapiro, an analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities and one of the capital's authorities on unemployment benefits. "If the emergency program were not in effect, only a very small fraction of people exhausting their state benefits would be receiving additional aid," Mr. Shapiro said. "Moreover, they would be receiving additional benefits for a much shorter period of time."
Both Mr. Downey and Mr. Bentsen want to continue the program of 26 to 33 weeks of benefits until at least next February. Ms. Martin refused to say how many weeks of benefits the Administration wanted. She did say the program should continue only until Dec. 31.
 
Calls for Leadership
 At the Senate hearing, Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, called that "an extension that sort of limps everybody by the election," but would leave the jobless in the lurch, waiting for a new Congress to organize itself if a further extension was needed.
Ms. Martin also refused to say how the Administration wanted to pay for an emergency extension. Senator Bentsen complained in an interview on Friday, "They just don't want to take a leadership role."
At the House hearing, even Republicans grew exasperated with Ms. Martin's unwillingness to take a position. Representative Fred Grandy of Iowa chided her for lacking the courage that Mr. Downey showed in proposing to pay for his proposals by raising taxes. "Match the committee's attempt to provide some leadership," he said.
Mr. Downey's proposal includes raising income taxes on some high-income individuals and raising the existing tax used to pay for extended benefits, which now is limited to $56 a year no matter how much an employee is paid.
Mr. Bentsen said on Friday that there were several possible sources of revenue that could be taken from the tax bill that Mr. Bush vetoed in March, including changing procedures for taxing securities held by brokers and raising the fees charged on chemicals that release fluorides.
There seems little question that another temporary extension could be passed and various revenue sources tapped to pay for it.
But Democrats want to seize the opportunity to make more fundamental changes. Mr. Downey complained Thursday, "During a period of recovery, nobody wants to deal with the extended benefits program because it is not needed."
 
Pressing for Changes
 Mr. Downey and the Democrats on his subcommittee on human resources have been pressing for permanent changes in the extended benefits system for more than a year. Their efforts have gained increasing support from Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, from Mr. Bentsen, and even from some Republicans.
Mr. Grandy and Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., Republican of Florida, have proposed taking the unemployment trust fund out of basic budget accounting and have discussed offering 39 weeks of benefits instead of 26 weeks if people wait three weeks before collecting.
Mr. Bentsen pointed out at Wednesday's hearing that because of the formulas in the current basic law, total unemployment in his state would have to reach 13.5 percent before Texas workers became eligible for extended benefits. In March, 7.6 percent of the workers in Texas were unemployed.
Mr. Bentsen also focused on another national question that he said had proved difficult in Texas. The Federal extended benefits law excludes almost 10 percent of those who have exhausted their basic 26 weeks, either because they are deemed not to have searched adequately for other employment or because of interruptions in their work history. He said that if workers had qualified for and exhausted regular state benefits they should automatically be eligible for extended benefits if they were still unemployed.

HEADLINE: RIOTS IN LOS ANGELES: The Suburbs;
In Simi Valley, Defense Of a Shared Way of Life

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SIMI VALLEY, Calif., May 3

 BODY:
The very layout of the streets in this well-to-do suburb speaks volumes about how unwelcome strangers are here, about how much safety means to the 100,000 people, most of them white, who have crossed the mountain range and then the Ventura County line to escape the chaos and discomfort of the city.
Each subdivision of Simi Valley, which now claims a place on the map of American race relations along with Selma and Howard Beach because of last week's verdict here, is a little world onto itself: a maze of dead-end streets easily navigable by residents but sure to baffle and trap any outlander who is up to no good. 
 "There is no question, in this community, that somebody out of the ordinary sticks out quickly," said Gregory Stratton, Simi Valley's Mayor, who longs for the days when his city was known as the home of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library rather than the scene of the trial that ended in a sweeping acquittal of four white police officers accused of beating of a black motorist. "And people are very quick to report anything suspicious, very quick to call the police and expect them to be there."
The people of Simi Valley, Mayor Stratton first among them, do not see themselves as racists and mightily resent that characterization, which has been uttered all over the nation since last Wednesday's verdict and the unrest that followed.
Instead, in a weekend of interviews here -- around backyard pools, at golf courses, swim meets and yard sales -- dozens of men and women spoke of the peace and pleasure of living among people with attitudes and aspirations that match their own; of sharing their community with others who own houses, work for a living and obey the social contract.
 
'Conservative, but Not Stuffy'
 "The people who live here share my values," said Arend Collen, a manager of a McDonald's, who passed a sunny Saturday beside a neighbor's pool in Wood Ranch, a planned community with 3,000 housing units, shops, schools and golf courses within its secure perimeters. "It's a good socio-economic climate -- conservative, but not stuffy. It's one of the few communities left where you can go shopping and not get hit up by people wanting money."
Doug Baker, hitting golf balls at a nearby driving range, agreed. Mr. Baker, a circuit installer for the telephone company, works and used to live in the adjacent San Fernando Valley, the first stop on the suburban migration, but increasingly an extension of the city rather than an oasis of calm. Mr. Baker moved here because he could not afford a house closer to Los Angeles, but has come to be grateful for his "dumb luck."
"I'm happy to live away from that kind of atmosphere," he said, citing "gangs, homeless people who don't work and don't have money because they don't work."
Mr. Baker, and most of those interviewed here, said that the proliferation of beggars, vandals and vagrants in many nearby urban and suburban neighborhoods had nothing to do with race. "These places that go downhill," he said, "it's not because black people or brown people or yellow people move in. It's because of people who don't care."
 
Pride in Low Crime Level
 The day the verdict was rendered in the beating trial, in a county courthouse here, Simi Valley (pronounced SEE-me valley) was congratulating itself in the pages of the local newspaper for once again being near the top of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's list of cities with the lowest crime rates.
"As we look over the hill," the editors of The Enterprise boasted, "we are proud of the society we have built here."
Within hours, the world saw it otherwise, with news commentators and demonstrators making disparaging references to this largely white, conservative city, labeling Simi Valley a racist place and comparing it to Mississippi in the 1960's. City officials said that in the wake of the verdict they received anonymous, and unfounded, telephone threats that the police station, courthouse and local hotels would be burned or bombed.
This hostility directed at their city wounds Simi Valley residents, who are quick to note that only two members of the jury actually live here, with the rest from cities and towns throughout Ventura County.
Mayor Stratton said that holding Simi Valley responsible for the verdict was as unfair as "blaming the host city if your team loses the Super Bowl." The Mayor wondered why similar criticism was not being leveled at the town of Camarillo, for instance, which he said was home to three of the jurors.
"It wasn't our trial and a lot of people here don't agree with the verdict," said Phil Nielson, the director of a life insurance company, who organized a dozen friends and neighbors for a weekend trip into South-Central Los Angeles, about 35 miles away, with brooms, rakes and shovels to help in the cleanup effort. "But now this town's got a black eye and that hurts."
Mr. Nielson said that when he called State Senator Diane Watson's office offering help in the cleanup, her aide expressed surprise that people from here, of all places, would want to come. "Why were they shocked?" he asked, angrily. "We're people. A lot of us were raised there. It's our city, too."
John Leslie, a billing manager at Blue Cross and one of those who joined the cleanup effort, said that stereotyping residents here as bad people was no better than doing the same to those who live in the inner city. "All the people downtown are not looters," he said, "and we're not all racists."
While it is an accident of venue that the trial was held here, the demographics of Simi Valley fueled the widely held notion that racism played a part in a verdict reached by a jury that had no black members. This city, which grew rapidly after the opening of the freeway to Los Angeles, is more than 80 percent white and only 2 percent black.
Residents insist that what binds them is not their common race or ethnicity, but a shared middle-class life style. "We like living in a place with educated people, people who believe as we do," said Brian Arkin, who strolled Wood Ranch this weekend with his wife and 6-month-old son. "But I don't believe skin color is a criteria.
 
'Like He's a Normal Person'
 "There's a black person up our street and we say "Hi' like he's a normal person" Mr. Arkin continued. "This isn't about race. It's about whether you let your property run down."
"Or whether you sell drugs out of your house," his wife, Valerie, interjected.
Greg Burge, a Simi Valley real estate agent, noted that more than three-quarters of the city's residents own their own homes. "When you have something to protect, that mitigates anything but civilized behavior," he said. And, Mr. Burge added, virtually everyone has a job, attends one of the city's 47 churches and is involved in activities at Simi Valley's 25 highly-regarded primary and secondary schools.
With a large tax base, Simi Valley also can afford a model police department, Mayor Stratton said, with 111 officers who are summoned "at the drop of a hat" by citizens with high expectations about safety in the streets.
"I get angry calls if Johnny is chasing Mary and a car doesn't come in a minute," Mr. Stratton said. "In a lot of communities, the department would say, "Come on, don't bother us with that stuff.' But we encourage people to call."
 
Hard to Escape
 The geographic configuration of the 12-mile-long valley, and its carefully planned street grid, makes a safe place safer. Just as each subdivision in Simi Valley is a self-contained web of cul-de-sacs -- easy to enter and hard to exit for anyone who does not know the way -- so the whole city can, in effect, be cordoned off simply by blocking four highway exits.
"You'd be stupid to commit a big crime here because you can't get out," Mr. Arkin said. "The police can seal this place off in 15 minutes."
People living here predicted that the disturbances last week, like the Watts riots two decades ago, might encourage residents of Los Angeles County to press deeper into the valleys, to places like Simi Valley, seeking domestic tranquillity.
"I'm sure a lot of people are rethinking where they're living," Mayor Stratton said.
Mr. Burge agreed. "Historically, that's a given," he said. "If my family was in an area that didn't feel safe, I'd leave. For anybody with the option, that's just a survival instinct."

HEADLINE: North Korea to Drop First Veil From Nuclear Sites

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PYONGYANG, North Korea, May 3

 BODY:
Senior North Korean officials said today that they would hand over to the International Atomic Energy Agency on Monday a list of nuclear-related sites ready for inspection, but that the list would not include a plutonium-reprocessing installation that the United States suspects is at the center of an effort to build nuclear weapons.
The announcement today by Song Rak Un, who handles United States affairs for the Foreign Ministry, appeared to represent a direct challenge to the Bush Administration to prove its charges that the Government is only a few months to a few years away from producing a crude nuclear bomb. 
 American officials have said that satellite photographs clearly show a building that they believe will process spent nuclear fuel into weapons-grade plutonium. Pyongyang has denied that any such installation exists, though only in recent weeks has it formally agreed to let international inspectors enter the country -- a step it held off taking for six years.
"We have made clear several times that we have no intention or need or capability to build nuclear weapons," Mr. Song told American and Japanese reporters who are completing a weeklong tour of North Korea, which is usually closed to journalists. "We have nothing to hide from any people, including you, and our intention is to allow inspection of all facilities we have."
He also said the accounting to the international agency, part of an "inspection regime" approved by North Korea about three weeks ago, would include a list of "all nuclear materials we possess."
But he warned against the application of more political pressure. "There are some people who have suspicions about our following up, and who even speak of military measures against our country," he said, which he said grew from "an arrogance of domination over other nations."
The report is being submitted several weeks ahead of its deadline, an indication that North Korea may speed a process it has delayed for years.
But officials declined to release the list being sent to the international agency. Nor would they permit journalists or a separate delegation from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, also here this week, to visit the installation at Yongbyon, 60 miles north of Pyongyang, that has become the centerpiece of the nuclear dispute.
The director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Hans Blix, is expected to arrive here in several weeks to make final arrangements for the first inspection, perhaps including a tour of the sites, officials say. The inspectors are expected to bring with them photographs and other documents supplied by the United States showing which buildings are suspect.
Officials of the agency say they have been pressing to have the inspections under way by June 15, when the board of the international inspection group, part of the United Nations, next meets. They have said in the past that if no progress is evident by then, they will ask the Security Council to take action to force inspections.
 
Three Bits of Speculation
 But in recent weeks North Korea's tone has changed considerably: a videotape that was said to show the interior of some of the reactors was released in April. And now some experts question whether they will find much when inspectors finally arrive.
United States and Japanese officials have offered several theories about Yongbyon, the site that is thought to be a reprocessing center:
*That North Korea has held off inspections long enough to move or conceal its reprocessing ability.
*That it failed to get the technology running, and has used the past several months to destroy evidence of its work.
*That under increasing pressure from the United States and Japan, which have said they would not consider upgrading relations or economic links with North Korea until the issue is resolved, the Government simply abandoned its project.
"There is always the possibility that we were wrong, and that there really is no reprocessing center," on State Department official said recently. "But I don't think that is the case."

HEADLINE: RIOTS IN LOS ANGELES: The Nation;
Pleas for Peace and Justice From Pulpits in Dozen Cities

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
After the storm of rioting and bloodshed in Los Angeles and four days of sometimes violent protests in a dozen other cities, Americans paused yesterday to pray for peace and to hear impassioned pleas from the pulpit for justice and racial harmony in a troubled land.
Across the New York area and in cities and towns across the country, bells tolled for the dead in Los Angeles, and spiritual leaders expressed sorrow for those who lost their lives or homes or jobs in the orgy of arson, looting and gunfire that followed the acquittal last Wednesday of four white Los Angeles police officers in the beating of a black motorist, Rodney G. King.
Many condemned the acquittal as a miscarriage of justice, but said violence was not the answer to racial injustice. Others called for radical change in a society infected with institutionalized racism. And amid the grief, some spoke of hope, calling the verdict and its aftermath a turning point, perhaps the harbinger of a new civil rights movement in America.
"There is a new kind of shame and pain in the white community," the Rev. Cecil A. Williams told his racially diverse parish at the Glide Memorial United Methodist Church in San Francisco. "It is time to put that to work, to stop watching the television in pain and get off the couch and take some action."
And in Manhattan, the Rev. Dr. James A. Forbes Jr., senior minister at Riverside Church, made an impassioned plea for a new commitment from his racially mixed congregation, just as the church threw itself into the anti-nuclear movement a decade ago. "Could we take this one on?" he asked.
It was a golden Sunday over much of the nation. The fresh grass, the new leaves, were apple green in the spring sun, and the day's gentle beauty offered stark contrasts with last week's images of burning and looting, of people running in the glare of flames, of smoldering fires in the half-light looking like the approaches to hell.
Except for gunshots fired at a police car in Los Angeles, calm prevailed yesterday in the riot-affected areas and in other cities that had been wracked by anger and violence in recent days, and many Americans took advantage of the respite to attend church services, to hear spiritual leaders and reflect again on the causes and possible responses to the country's racial divisions.
 
'We'd Like It to Be Over'
 In Los Angeles, services at the Greater Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church were just ending when gunfire erupted outside. Congregants waited briefly until the danger passed, then filed out. "We'd like it to be over," said Willie Tagger, a 54-year-old aircraft mechanic. "I don't think it will end until Chief Daryl Gates is gone and the four police officers are gone."
Nearby, at St. Vincent's Roman Catholic Church, the Rev. Michael Crotty's voice broke as he told his parish of black, white, Asian and Hispanic members that there was no turning back from what had happened. "People are saying, 'Oh, good, we're returning, little by little, to normal,' " Mr. Crotty said. "We cannot accept what was normal before the violence because what was normal was never that. What was normal was never acceptable."
President Bush, at Camp David, Md., for the weekend, proclaimed the first Thursday in May as a national prayer day, and urged Americans on that day "to pray for reconciliation and healing." He scheduled a White House meeting with several Cabinet members for today to discuss "long-range solutions for some regional and economic problems."
In Boston, 300 parishioners at the Union United Methodist Church, who wore black ribbons to protest the acquittals, applauded loudly as their pastor, the Rev. Charles R. Stith, blamed the President for the verdict and exhorted them to reject Mr. Bush at the polls in November.
 
'Bush Must Go!'
 "The jury didn't see Rodney King -- they saw Willie Horton," Mr. Stith declared. "George Bush must go!" Mr. Horton, a black man who raped a white woman after being furloughed from a Massachusetts prison, was mentioned in a commercial used by the Bush campaign against his Democratic opponent in 1988. The commercial was widely viewed as politically effective, but many believed that it appealed to racial fears.
Mr. Bush was also criticized at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem by the Rev. Calvin O. Butts, who said the President had reassured whites that law and order was being restored but had failed to take steps to address the underlying injustices that had led to the rioting.
Mr. Butts also criticized the Reagan and Bush Administrations for "12 years of neglect" of the inner cities and urged his congregants to join a May 16 march on Washington.
"I want you to take off from work and go down," Mr. Butts said. "We should be nonviolent, but we should stand up to Washington and say, 'Enough is enough!' "
Elsewhere in New York, at great cathedrals and small churches, there were prayers for an end to violence, calls from pulpits for renewed efforts to fight racism and praise for Mayor David N. Dinkins and community leaders for helping to avert a major explosion of violence in the city.
John Cardinal O'Connor, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York, expressed relief that New York was spared widespread violence and credited Mayor Dinkins and Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown for "the sensitivity and the prudence of their response to the understandable fear that began to pervade this city."
A largely Korean-American congregation at St. Paul Chong Ha-Sang, a Roman Catholic chapel in Flushing, Queens, heard the Rev. Joe Veneroso refer to the attacks on Korean-Americans and Korean-American businesses by rioters in Los Angeles last week. "Koreans and blacks looked at each other and saw not their brothers and sisters, but their enemies," he said. "The rioting may have stopped, but the racial problems have not."
In Atlanta, two ministers told congregations at black churches that their anger over the verdict in the beating case was justified, but that violence was neither the proper response nor the solution to problems of racism.
"Violence gets attention, but not lasting change," said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and pastor of Cascade United Methodist Church.
And at Mount Moriah Baptist Church a few miles away, the Rev. Orlando K. Winters said: "Be angry, but sin not. Be angry, but don't let the sun set on your anger."
As she left the Mount Moriah services, 81-year-old Beatrice Cook shook her head and said she did not think the rioters knew what they were looking for in the streets. "All I know is that they were looking in the wrong direction," she said. "As for the verdict, it was wrong, but it didn't make me angry. It just made me hurt."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Undeclared Candidate;
Perot Admits Deficit Fix Is Imprecise

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, May 3

 BODY:
Ross Perot, the Texas businessman and likely independent candidate for President, conceded today that his plans to erase the Federal budget deficit were based on casual and perhaps flawed analyses that would require more study.
Mr. Perot had said the Government could save $100 billion a year if wealthy people did not accept Social Security and Medicare payments and another $180 billion by eliminating fraud, waste and abuse in Government. 
 But when presented with analyses indicating that such cuts would affect more than 10 million people on Social Security and Medicare and would probably require deep cuts in research for AIDS and other scientific pursuits, including an $8.2 billion atom smasher being built in Texas, Mr. Perot said he would not support those consequences.
The Bush Administration estimates the budget deficit for the current fiscal year at $399 billion, the highest in the nation's history.
Interviewed on the NBC News program "Meet The Press," Mr. Perot grew testy during a protracted exchange over his budget-paring views. He eventually distanced himself from past statements on cutting the deficit, saying they were based on information provided by others.
 
Impatient With Reporters
 The 61-year-old billionaire and former Navy officer also displayed what has become a growing impatience with reporters seeking a clearer outline of his views. He said his associates informed NBC officials before the program that he was not prepared to discuss several topics in detail.
As he did last Tuesday on the cable television program "Money Politics," Mr. Perot complained today about not being notified in advance about certain questions he would be asked.
The Dallas Morning News reported Thursday that Mr. Perot did not respond to a written questionnaire on campaign issues. The newspaper reported that Mr. Perot's top adviser, Tom Luce, stated in a letter, "If and when he becomes a candidate, we will be happy to consider your request."
Mr. Perot said today that virtually all of his energy was devoted to helping volunteers meet requirements for his name to be placed on the November ballot in all 50 states, not formulating policy positions. He had declared on "Money Politics" that voters would know his positions on dozens of issue long before the election.
Today after questions about his deficit-cutting views, he said, "Give me a little time to get all of this nailed down, and I will give you very specific ways we will do this."
On the Los Angeles riots, Mr. Perot declined to criticize President Bush's response but said that as President, he would have flown directly to the city. "I cannot make good decisions remotely," he said. "I'm not criticizing the President. We all have our own styles."
 
Breaking the Melting Pot
 He said the rioting demonstrated that racial and urban economic problems are fundamental issues for national leaders. "We've just split the melting pot," he said. "We've got to put it back together again. As a country, we will lose if we let the melting pot break again and again and again."
When he first saw the videotape of the beating of Rodney G. King by four police officers last year, Mr. Perot said, "the thing that just leaped at me was the shock that a group of men could do that. Second, I couldn't believe that the other guys didn't stop it."
He added that he favored pursuing Federal civil rights charges against the officers.
Mr. Perot said he would attack problems of the inner cities, in part, through programs that enroll children shortly after birth and support and teach them at least through the third grade. "I can prove they work," he said. "Graduates of those schools, typically into the third grade, wind up in Harvard, Yale and Princeton. In one generation, we can change the world."
 
Tax and Welfare Changes
 He endorsed tax incentives to encourage business investment in impoverished areas and the concept that able-bodied people on welfare should eventually be required to find work.
Mr. Perot indicated he would not sign a bill imposing a national waiting period to buy handguns because criminals could still get such guns through illegal channels. He suggested that much stronger action than a five-day waiting period was needed to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.
But he strongly supported the right to own a gun. Referring to the riot-damaged sections of Los Angeles, he said, "God bless the honest people in that part of town who live by the rules. If they didn't have a gun, they couldn't survive right now."
Affirmative action laws have "pluses and minuses," he said, saying they address inequities for minorities but stir racial prejudice among others who are better qualified. "There is only one long-term solution, and that is education, education, education."
Mr. Perot, who has a personal wealth of more than $2.5 billion, said he would consider making public his tax records for the last 10 years.
"I think the American people will say, 'Boy this guy has paid more than his share,' " he said. "You know what my frustration is? I didn't get much for it. I think that's their frustration, too."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Press;
Newspaper Industry Begins To Show Signs of Recovery

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
"I mean, this baby was going down," Vance C. Brown said of his family's newspaper, The Herald in New Britain, Conn., where New England's economic decline hit especially hard.
For instance, The Herald's classified advertising revenue last year was about a third that in 1987. 
 But in April, after 30 consecutive months of declines in total advertising revenues, The Herald showed an improvement from a year earlier, said Mr. Brown, who is the paper's associate publisher.
Indeed, as newspaper operators gather in New York today for the start of the annual convention of the American Newspaper Publishers Association, the newspaper business is beginning to show new strength, especially compared with its doldrums of a year ago. Many newspaper companies have reported first-quarter earnings that are considerably higher than those in the 1991 quarter, which was one of the worst in memory.
"The bottom line is that the worst is definitely behind the industry," said Kenneth T. Berrents, an analyst who specializes in newspaper companies at Alex. Brown & Sons Inc., a Baltimore brokerage firm.
Mr. Berrents said that newspapers were generally showing signs of recovery in improved classified advertising, but that retail advertising still lagged, especially in the New York City area and California.
He said that New England was generally recovering somewhat faster than the New York area and that the Midwest, Northwest and South seemed to be setting the recovery pace.
But that pace, even where the recovery is greatest, is far from a blistering one. A spot check of publishers around the nation reflects optimism, but newspapers are scrambling hard to replace advertising revenues that have been lost because of the recession and the financial difficulties of some big department stores.
For many papers, the solution to cutbacks by big advertisers has been to become far more aggressive in courting small advertisers.
At The San Diego Union-Tribune, where retail advertising is down about 3 percent from a year ago, Gerry Wilson, director of advertising sales, has restructured its advertising department to attract new advertising from small accounts. For instance, advertising salesmen now make most of their income from commissions, rather than salary.
The Wichita Eagle, a Knight-Ridder paper in Kansas, has begun charging for some classified ads based on the price of what is being sold. For instance, a three-line ad for a used car priced under $500 costs $6.25 for four days; a similar ad for a $4,000 car would be $26.
Reid Ashe, publisher of The Eagle, said that the special pricing applied only to car ads now, but that he was starting a similar plan for low-priced real estate classifieds.
The Eagle, like many papers, is willing to experiment with novel revenue-building schemes.
For instance, the paper has begun publishing books, including "Beargrease, Builders and Bandits," a regional history, and "Guide to Fishing in Kansas."
Mr. Ashe said the paper would soon expand into mail-order retail sales of Kansas-oriented books of all kinds, from "The Wizard of Oz" to books published by the University of Kansas Press. The initial catalogue, which will list 90 titles, will also include recordings of old prairie ballads and cowboy songs.
"And if it doesn't work, we can just quit," said Mr. Ashe, in the tone of firm practicality that has become commonplace at newspapers after years of tight budgets.
Mr. Ashe, like many other publishers, said he would not make the trip to the publishers' convention this year, though he normally attended it.
"In the course of trying to budget for this year, I told everybody, 'no conventions,' and I had to start with me," he said.
New York has been a popular site for the convention of the publishers association, which will change its name on June 1 to the Newspaper Association of America. For instance, the best-attended convention was in New York in 1987, when more than 3,000 people registered.
Less than half that many people attended last year's convention in Vancouver, British Columbia, and an association spokesman said attendance this year would probably show only slight improvement.
The availability of heavily discounted newsprint has been the one silver lining for newspapers during the recession.
Newsprint accounts for roughly 20 to 25 percent of a newspaper's costs, but as demand for advertising has dropped, the size of newspapers has also declined, creating less demand for newsprint. Newsprint manufacturers, swimming in newsprint, have been offering discounts of 40 percent or more to top customers to maintain market share.
Thus far in 1992, the discounts are holding, to the great pleasure of newspaper publishers.
"It remains to be seen how long it will last," said George N. Gill, publisher of The Louisville Courier-Journal, a Gannett newspaper.
Almost inevitably, when advertising returns, so will much higher newsprint prices.
Publishers say that even with a jump in newsprint costs, newspapers stand to be very profitable in a recovering economy.
With lean operations, a host of new -- albeit small -- advertisers, and old advertisers who need to move merchandise, publishers say they are hoping a rising economy will be a time of great prosperity for them.
Bruce E. Thorp, a communication stock analyst for the PNC Financial Corporation in Philadelphia, said the second quarter should demonstrate whether the recovery would be fast and strong, or tepid and slow.
And after several disappointing years, he is keeping his expectations under close control.
"I'm afraid to predict too much on the upside," Mr. Thorp said. "I've been burned too badly before."

A Magazine Is a Magazine, But a Good Cigar Is a Smoke

BYLINE: By HOWARD G. GOLDBERG

 BODY:
At a time when tobacco is out of fashion and some new men's magazines have gone up in smoke, Marvin R. Shanken is betting on a projected life-style quarterly for the well-to-do called Cigar Aficionado.
Mr. Shanken, chairman of M. Shanken Communications and editor and publisher of the semimonthly Wine Spectator, the nation's largest-circulation consumer wine magazine, plans to distribute the first issue of Cigar Aficionado in September. 
 Cigar company executives say they know of no glossy consumer publication in the United States or abroad focused mainly on premium cigars.
 
Favorable Responses
 Mr. Shanken said he was bucking the trend and the recession primarily because he received thousands of favorable responses to advertisements for Cigar Aficionado in the Spectator, whose circulation has grown to 109,521 from 1,200 since 1979, and in some of his other publications, which include Food Arts, a magazine for food professionals, and Market Watch, Impact and Impact International, for the wine and spirits trades.
If Mr. Shanken goes ahead with his plan, Cigar Aficionado will become the second new men's magazine started this year. The first was Men's Journal, an outdoors-oriented sister publication of Rolling Stone that has a larger circulation than Cigar Aficionado would and a different audience. In the last two years, Men's Life died after one issue and Smart for Men never got off the ground.
Mr. Shanken said two-thirds of the projected 100-plus pages in the first issue of Cigar Aficionado would be devoted to articles on cigars and health, restaurants that permit cigars, cigar ratings and information on buying, storing and smoking cigars. Other articles will discuss wine and spirits, travel and collectibles.
Mr. Shanken, who estimated the magazine's start-up costs at $1 million, is guaranteeing an initial print run of 100,000 copies, most of which will be given away. The magazine is to be sold at newsstands, tobacconists and airports. A subscription will cost $12.95; an issue, $3.95.
Martin S. Walker, president of Periodical Studies Service, magazine consultants, said 20,000 to 40,000 subscribers would probably attract sufficient cigar and related advertising. But, he added, "That may not be enough for mainstream advertisers who look for rich people and have other places to go like Esquire and Town & Country."
 
Declining Sales
 The cigar market has declined over the last few decades, largely because of health concerns, smoking restrictions, objections to cigar smoke and, in some states, high taxes.
Norman F. Sharp, president of the Cigar Association of America, a trade organization, said the high point for cigar sales was 1964, when nine billion large cigars were sold, partly as a result of consumers' switching to cigars after the Surgeon General's report that year linking cigarettes and lung cancer. In 1991, 2.2 billion large cigars were sold.
Mr. Sharp said sales of large cigars totaled $629 million in 1991; in 1980, they totaled $641 million. About 4 percent of all cigars are premiums -- handmade cigars that contain long filler tobacco and cost $1 to $12 each.
"The number of Americans who smoke premium cigars is relatively small -- about 400,000," said Dick DiMeola, executive vice president of the Consolidated Cigar Corporation.
Mr. Shanken said the typical smoker of fine cigars was 46 years old, had an average household income of $194,000 and net worth of $1.54 million and smokes about 10 cigars a week, for which he spends $25.90.
He said 1,848 answers to a market-research questionnaire showed that 14 percent of the respondents smoked cigars that came from Cuba, even though Cuban cigars have not been imported by the United States since an economic boycott began in 1962. "Obviously, a lot of smuggling is going on," Mr. Shanken said.

HEADLINE: New Yorkers Girding For Washington March

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
Outraged over crime and violence in New York City, Ralph Torres and some 50 other residents of Williamsburg in Brooklyn are planning to march on Washington on May 16.
"The Federal Government has got to give us an alternative and can start by restoring the unfair cuts in youth employment, substance abuse, counseling and other social programs," said Mr. Torres, the chairman of the Neighborhood Alliance for a Drug-Free City. 
 Mark Zink is organizing two buses to take members of Staten Islanders Against Nuclear Weapons to the march. Mr. Zink said the group wants "to wake up the President and Congress and get them to stop spending so much money on defense."
This week, Keith Brooks and members of the New York Unemployed Committee, an advocacy group, will visit employment offices around the city. They expect to recruit hundreds of the jobless to march in support of a major jobs program and emergency health coverage for the unemployed.
 
'Save Our Children'
 These three organizations are among dozens in New York and other cities planning to take part in the march under the banner of "Save Our Cities, Save Our Children."
Osborn Elliott, the chairman of the Citizens Committee for New York and a former deputy mayor, said he first thought of staging a march two years ago. He was prompted, he said, by "the brutal cuts in Federal money to the cities" and the very visible increase in New York's homeless, jobless, random killings and crumbling streets and bridges.
Last August, the United States Conference of Mayors endorsed Mr. Elliott's plea for "a huge parade of protest by the cities of this country against the indifference of our Federal Government."
Mr. Elliott and the conference president, Mayor Raymond L. Flynn of Boston, are the march's co-chairmen. It will be the first time, Mr. Elliott said, that so many mayors and citizens "will rise up against the Federal Government -- a Republican White House and a Democratic Congress -- and demand new priorities in education, jobs, housing and health care."
Mayor David N. Dinkins will attend the march, Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch said. "I have been designated to help coordinate this for the Mayor's office, not just to show my support for the community but to be an integral part of the effort," he said.
Mr. Elliott said Mr. Dinkins was among more than 120 mayors from as far as Miami, Seattle, Honolulu and San Juan, P.R., who have endorsed the march, along with a wide range of civic, religious, labor and civil rights organizations, including the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the Children's Defense Fund, the National Education Association and the Gray Panthers.
Since the outbreak of violence in Los Angeles, there has been a rush of people and organizations to join the march, Mr. Elliott said. Speakers are to include Mayor Sharon Pratt Dixon of Washington, Mayor Dinkins and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
In New York City, organizations have reserved 330 buses so far, said Mae Ngai, the march coordinator for the city. Individuals and groups without buses will be able to board buses in all five boroughs, she said. A round-trip ticket will cost $25.
Elderly residents of Penn South Co-op in Chelsea are selling Save Our Cities buttons for $1 to raise money for marchers. In the Bronx, jars have been placed in local grocery stores to collect coins for the march.
In the East New York section of Brooklyn children and parents in the United Community Center's day-care program have organized candy sales to raise money to send five or six busloads of marchers to Washington.
"We'll demand more investments in education and job training," said Mel Grizer, the center director, who links rising violence in the neighborhood "to the sense of many young people that they have no future."

HEADLINE: Mayor Plans Crackdown For Fulton Fish Market

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins announced plans yesterday to hire up to 20 managers and inspectors for the Fulton Fish Market, described by law-enforcement officials as a Mafia stronghold where extortion, violence and other crimes have led to higher retail fish prices.
The Mayor said he was reacting to a two-year investigation by city agents and confidential informants that found "continuing criminal activity and improper business conduct." Mr. Dinkins said undercover agents had witnessed violations of city regulations and sales of guns and drugs at the market, which handles more than 125 million pounds of seafood a year. 
 "The market has been plagued by unscrupulous individuals who have sought to profit not through that time-honored New York business principle -- competition -- but through criminality," he said. "When this kind of behavior prospers, everyone loses."
The Mayor announced the plan in a statement sent to news organizations yesterday morning. Later, City Councilman Kenneth K. Fisher, a Brooklyn Democrat, accused Mr. Dinkins of trying to pre-empt a news conference and Council committee hearing today at which, Mr. Fisher said, he was going to recommend everything the Mayor announced yesterday.
 
'Not a Coincidence'
 "It's not a coincidence," said Mr. Fisher, a member of the Council's economic development committee, "because if this was such a good idea the Mayor would have included it in his preliminary budget when he released it two weeks ago. The only thing that's happened in the last two weeks that's changed is the administration became aware of what we intended to show at the hearings."
Leland T. Jones, the Mayor's press secretary, said City Hall released the report "to provide the Council and the public with the context" in which the hearing was being held.
"This is an issue not of public relations but of public policy," Mr. Jones said. "We're glad to see that the Council member shares our recommendations and we'll be looking forward to any additional recommendations the Council may have."
The report on the two-year inquiry, by the city's Investigation Department said undercover agents had worked as truckers, retailers and sanitation inspectors. The investigation concentrated on wholesalers and unloaders -- workers who take fish off delivery trucks -- and gun sales at the market in lower Manhattan.
The report said investigators had bought 37 guns at the market. Serial numbers on the weapons had been defaced. Among the sellers was Salvatore Fianchino, who was arrested last year on weapons charges, the report said, adding that some guns sold by him had been traced to John Zodda, a federally licensed firearms dealer. The report, which said Mr. Zodda was one of the largest illegal gun traffickers ever arrested in New York, said he was indicted last year on weapons charges that are pending.
The report also said the Fulton market was a center for loan sharking, extortion, insurance fraud and drugs. It said that between April and August 1989, one market worker sold undercover investigators more than seven ounces of cocaine. And in 1990, the report said, investigators bought more than 15 ounces of cocaine from David Crusco, identified as the former cook in the Peck Slip Social Club in the market. The report said Mr. Crusco and his father, Louis, were arrested and pleaded guilty to cocaine distribution charges.
Other elements of the report dovetailed with what Mr. Fisher said was on the agenda for today's news conference and hearing, at which he said he would be joined by the chairman of the economic committtee, Jerome X. O'Donovan, and Councilwoman Kathryn Freed.
The report also described how retailers who do not follow rules set by market loaders risk having fish stolen from their trucks.
Mr. Fisher said witnesses at the hearing today would include a restaurant food buyer who was beaten after he refused to move his car and a truck driver who was threatened with a gun when he tried to collect for fish he had just delivered.
 
Atmosphere of Fear
 Mr. Fisher said there had been an "almost complete absence of law enforcement in the market, which has resulted in an atmosphere of violence and fear."
"The results of that are that people don't want to do business at the market and the city agencies are not enforcing the extensive powers that they have over the market," he said. "The city itself is being ripped off to the tune of almost $2 million a year by businesses which are operating in the market but not paying rent to the city or other fees. What happens is the city rents a stall to a wholesaler, and he sublets a piece of it to someone else for more money, but the city has no record of it."
The report mentioned one wholesaler who rents his space for $17,400 a year and sublets a part of it to two other merchants for $54,000 a year. The report said rent that the wholesalers pay has not changed since 1982 and ranges from $2 to $6 a square foot, "well below market rental."

HEADLINE: A Stumbling Economy Absorbs Another Blow

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 3

 BODY:
California, already mired in a recession that was exposing jagged cracks in its Golden State facade, now faces an even bleaker economic future.
The violence, looting and arson that swept wide areas of the nation's second-largest city last week, killing at least 49 people and causing hundreds of millions of dollars of damage, destroyed thousands of small businesses. That disaster will cause the direct loss of more jobs and tax revenues from a state already enduring a hemorrhage of both, economists say. 
 And the stark image of a city out of control is likely to do little for the state's efforts to persuade companies not to leave and other companies to open factories. Tourism, one of California's most vibrant industries -- providing 360,000 jobs and generating $7 billion annually -- seems certain to fall off, at least in the short run. And foreign investment in real estate and local industry is at risk.
 
'Implications Are Not Good'
 "The implications for the L.A. area are not good, and the implications for the state of California are not good," said Jack A. Kyser, the chief economist for the Economic Development Corporation of Los Angeles, an industry-financed group formed to promote economic growth.
As it debates how best to get moving again, California, where growth always seemed a natural state of affairs, is being forced to confront some painful consequences of its own policies during its decades-long boom.
Last year alone, California lost 333,000 jobs, or 2.6 percent of total non-agricultural employment, and in 1990, at least as many.
 
Rampant Unemployment
 Unemployment has long been high among the state's black and Hispanic populations, especially in the inner cities. But now the rest of the state is feeling the pain of hard times as well, with unemployment in the state at 8.5 percent in March, the most recent month for which statistics are available (well above the national rate of 7.3 percent). The rate among young black and Hispanic men is far higher.
And the growth in per-capita income last year was 1.3 percent, far behind the national average of 2.1 percent.
Even before last week's devastation brought a new urgency to the question of how far California was willing to go in changing its approach to its underlying economic problems, it was clear that an uncharacteristic period of introspection had begun.
"In California, wholly apart from the recession, our jobs climate is unacceptable," Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, said in a speech to a group of business executives here last month. "Our economic engine is broken, and it needs fixing."
California is far from alone in having economically blighted inner cities, or in having a large population of working people barely above the poverty level. And certainly some of the state's problems, like the painful contraction of the aerospace and military industries in the wake of the cold war's end, are beyond its ability to fix by itself. But among the policies it must examine are these:
*Officials here say more and more frequently that the state must spend more on education, job training, roads, mass transit and the other underpinnings of a healthy and growing economy. But California, where the anti-tax revolt began in the 1970's, has long been unwilling to accept a broad-based tax increase to achieve those ends. Now, with its population growing and its economy shrinking, the state's fiscal problems continue to mount, creating further pressure for spending cuts by state and local governments.
*California has for years had a reputation as the nation's strictest regulator of air quality and for being on the cutting edge of other environmental issues, and it has made considerable progress in cleaning up the smog in the Los Angeles area. But the cost of complying with environmental regulations has been a major reason companies are moving out of state, taking jobs with them. So, Californians must consider how much economic pain they are willing to absorb in the name of the environment.
*The state has long welcomed legal and illegal immigrants and workers from the rest of the United States, and its economy has become addicted to their labor and the money that some bring with them to start their new lives. But some officials say they fear that the state's finances, its social services and its economic health will soon by swamped by its rapidly growing population, and they are calling for measures to stem the flow of immigrants.
 
Welfare Question on the Ballot
 Last week, Governor Wilson announced that he had gathered enough signatures to place on the November ballot a measure to overhaul the state's welfare system. Among its provisions is a measure that would put limits on welfare payments to those who have been in the state for less than a year, which would make California less of a welfare magnet.
"The recession in '82-83 was a rough deal, but this is a different kind of downturn, because we're not so much in a depressed economy as in a changed economy," said Bill Pechstedt, the owner of Sanford Lussier Inc., which makes hardwood moldings. The company, in the Los Angeles suburb of Huntington Park, has lost 25 percent of its business in the last few years.
"I don't see it turning around in the immediate future or any time in the near term, because there are too many underlying problems in the state," Mr. Pechstedt said.
The economic woes in California, the nation's most populous and economically productive state, pale before the painful recessions that ravaged the oil states during the last decade, and they are no more severe than those that have beset much of the Northeast in recent years. But by the standards of California, the downturn, now in its third year, has been traumatic.
 
Depression in Major Industries
 The residential construction business, a major component of the state economy, remains deeply depressed despite some signs of improvement. Other industries will not rebound even when the overall economy improves. The aerospace and military industries, which supported hundreds of thousands of high-paying engineering and manufacturing jobs, are rapidly shrinking because of the end of the cold war.
The downturn has reverberated powerfully and created support in many quarters for steps that would aid the economy, even at the cost of other social goals.
The state's initial step has been to recognize -- belatedly, many economists say -- that it must compete actively with other states and nations to retain and attract jobs that for years have been going elsewhere. It is now stepping up its efforts to persuade companies to remain in the state or to move here, reminding them of California's -- and Los Angeles's -- advantages as a financial and trade center, with a large, well-trained work force and a climate and resources that make it a nice place to live.
The state is also financing programs to help small and medium-size businesses develop export markets and improve the quality of their products and the skills of their work forces.
On some issues, like changes in workers' compensation insurance, there is widespread agreement on the need for action. A report issued last month by the Council on California Competitiveness, a bipartisan panel of business executives, labor leaders and elected officials, said overhauling workers' compensation and streamlining the state's regulatory bureaucracy should be high priorities.
The findings of the council, which was led by Peter V. Ueberroth, the former baseball commissioner, reflected widespread feelings in the business community that California has become hostile to industry and ambivalent about economic growth.
"I could set the world on fire," said Rosemary Ruiz, an owner of Independent Forge, a company in the city of Orange that makes metal parts for airplanes and other uses, "but the state could douse it out."
 
Deeply Divided Opinions
 But in debating knottier issues like immigration and regulation, Californians are deeply divided over what steps to take.
With California's population growing by 600,000 a year and the number of jobs shrinking, there is a growing consensus in the business community that the state needs to do more to check the flow of illegal immigration. Some economists, however, believe that any steps to discourage immigration would hurt the state badly in the long run because recent immigrants provide a highly motivated work force and strong links to important trading partners like Mexico and Asia.
"Immigration is clearly the lifeblood of the state," said David Friedman, an economist who has studied changes in the California economy.
Equally contentious is the growing debate over whether the state can afford to continue imposing strict environmental regulations. Officials of the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the regional air-quality regulator for the Los Angeles basin, said their recent decision to adopt a more flexible, market-based approach to pollution-control rules resulted in part from pressure to minimize the harm to the economy of cleaning up the air.
That new approach has environmentalists, among others, uneasy.
"When we talk about cutting through regulatory red tape, we ought not to turn away from the importance of environmental quality and environmental cleanup as an incentive for people to come and live in our state and to do business in our state," said Kathleen Brown, the state Treasurer, who is a Democrat.
In the wake of the Los Angeles riots, it is also clear that California has done little to address the deep-seated economic problems that have been festering in its inner cities, as in those of most other states.
Late Saturday, Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles appointed Mr. Ueberroth, who is something of a local legend for having run the 1984 Olympic Games here without a hitch, to head a commission charged with rebuilding the neighborhoods ravaged by the rioting. Mr. Ueberroth offered few specifics but said the emphasis would be on bringing businesses and jobs to the areas worst afflicted by the unrest.
"Jobs are what have been looted, thousands and thousands of jobs that won't be there tomorrow because there's nowhere to go to work," Mr. Ueberroth said. "It's just a downward cycle that's added a sharp load to these communities, and we've got to reverse that as soon as possible."

HEADLINE: Riots Raise Concerns About Insurance Redlining

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
As damage estimates rise to hundreds of millions of dollars, consumer advocates and some insurance regulators say they fear the Los Angeles riots could aggravate a problem that has plagued America's inner cities for more than 25 years: the abandonment of the poor by insurance companies.
After race riots in six American cities between 1965 and 1967, a Presidential commission found that the redlining of businesses and homes in poor neighborhoods by private insurers grew by an "intolerable degree." Officials later reported the sudden cancellation of property policies in New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis and other cities that experienced riots after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in April 1968. 
 Redlining, the systematic refusal of insurance companies to sell policies in poor neighborhoods, is illegal, but officials say it is extremely hard to monitor or prosecute.
 
Essential to Business
 The industry generally denies that it engages in redlining, and companies with many customers in Los Angeles say they will respond efficiently and unemotionally to civil disturbances.
A lack of property insurance can strangle a neighborhood's economy. Banks usually refuse to give mortgages on uninsured property, and small businesses find it next to impossible to lease equipment or order goods on consignment if they are unprotected against fire, theft or civil disturbances.
"I'm afraid these disturbances could increase insurers' reluctance to do business in poor neighborhoods across the country," said Robert Hunter, a former Federal Insurance Administrator who was responsible for inner-city insurance programs during the Carter Administration. "I think we have seen a bit of improvement on redlining in recent years, and these new events could prove a setback."
But spokesmen for major insurance companies say such worries are both speculative and unfair.
 
States Offer Plans
 They point out that in contrast to the situation in the 1960's, 28 states now sponsor Fair Access to Insurance Requirements, or FAIR plans, that provide at least minimum property insurance to businesses and homeowners in high-risk urban areas.
"I just don't think you are going to see a withdrawal of business from the inner city," said Richard G. Donegan, the regional underwriting manager for Allstate Insurance in Los Angeles and the chairman of the governing committee of California's FAIR plan. Customers in riot-torn areas, he said, should see modest increases at most in their premiums.
Although Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles this weekend estimated that property damage may exceed $500 million, Patty Lombard, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute, an industry trade group, said it would take weeks for companies to assess the damage and the companies' obligations. California officials said last week that they believed that many of the burned or looted businesses had no insurance.
 
Urban Policies Cancelled
 In January 1968, a Presidential commission headed by Gov. Richard J. Hughes of New Jersey surveyed 3,000 homeowners and businesses in six large cities in the wake of the riots of the mid-196o's. The commission found that 40 percent of businesses and 30 percent of homeowners in poor areas found it unusually difficult to get or keep insurance, and that 14.4 percent of the uninsured businesses had lost their polices after the riots.
Later that year, officials in New York City, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Detroit said they had found evidence of companies canceling policies after the April riots. Repeated government studies since then have concluded that redlining of poor neighborhoods by insurers continues.
Last year, more than a dozen insurance agents and customers in minority communities testified in a hearing held by the California Insurance Commissioner, John Garamendi, that insurers redlined poor neighborhoods in California by charging exorbitant rates, keeping sales forces out of the areas and, in some cases, refusing to sell policies to people who do not speak English.
Steven Miller, California's deputy insurance commissioner in charge of rate regulation, predicted that the riots "will be used by insurers to justify continued discriminatory practices and possibly the withdrawal of business from some areas."
"It is something we will have to monitor closely," he added.
As a result of the Hughes Commission report of 1968, most industrial states, including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and California have enacted FAIR plans. The policies, which are sometimes expensive and limited in coverage, are sold to people who live in high-risk areas and cannot get private coverage.
To discourage companies from redlining, the Federal Government originally provided riot reinsurance to companies that sold FAIR policies. Under the plan, the Government would reimburse the companies for most of their losses from riots, whether or not they involved FAIR customers. The program was ended during the second Reagan Administration.

INSPECTORS FOR FULTON FISH MARKET
Mayor Dinkins announced plans to hire up to 20 managers and inspectors for the Fulton Fish Market, described by law-enforcement officials as a Mafia stronghold where extortion, violence and other crimes have led to higher retail fish prices. The Mayor said he was reacting to a two-year investigation by city agents and confidential informants that found "continuing criminal activity and improper business conduct" at the market, which handles more than 125 million pounds of seafood a year.

MARCHING ON WASHINGTON
Outraged about crime and violence in New York City, Ralph Torres of the Neighborhood Alliance for a Drug-Free City and 50 other people from Williamsburg are planning to march on Washington on May 16. Mark Zink is organizing members of Staten Islanders Against Nuclear Weapons. Keith Brooks and members of the New York Unemployed Committee will recruit hundreds of the jobless to march, too. Dozens of such groups are preparing for the "Save Our Cities, Save Our Children" march on May 16. B3.
 
DEFINING THE PROBLEM OF RACE AND RIOTS 
 The six or so people who die violently on an average day in New York City, a rate insufficiently lower than the toll in Los Angeles last week, routinely constitute a quiet riot in some New York neighborhoods. While well-meaning people of all races have preached reconciliation, the lessons of Los Angeles will be short-lived unless black rage and white fear are reconciled, or at least acknowledged. Metro Matters, B3.
 
PROJECT COMES TO A HALT ON 14TH STREET
The chief contractor overseeing the rebuilding of 14th Street at Union Square has staged a partial walkout over pay in the latest snarl in the troubled project. The contractor, Robert Perez, owner of Perez Interboro Asphalt, pulled some workers off the project last week after the city temporarily withheld $400,000 in payments for additional work, a spokesman for the city's Department of Transportation said.

BUDGET STALLED IN CONNECTICUT
In an unusual Saturday night session that staggered into Sunday, the state Senate rejected the budget agreement reached in the House of Representatives last week. Instead, the Senators passed a modified plan that brings to a full boil some of most divisive issues at the Capitol: slot machine gambling, aid to distressed cities and the financing of the state pension fund. The standoff leaves the legislature with three days to make peace and craft a budget that Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. can sign before the regular session ends at midnight Wednesday. B5.
 
FIRE SNARLS TRAFFIC IN NEW JERSEY
A fire that raced across hundreds of acres of dry scrub oak and pine woods forced the evacuation of an adult residential community, shut down a nuclear power plant and closed Garden State Parkway and other North-South routes connecting Atlantic City with the New York Metropolitan area. State and volunteer firefighters in Ocean County battled the blaze that burned an estimated 1,500 acres in the vicinity of Forked River. No injuries were reported, the state police said. B5.
 
LEGISLATIVE DEADLINES NEAR FOR CUOMO
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said he has still not decided whether to sign or veto the State Legislature's redistricting bill. The Governor, who is given 10 working days to sign or veto any piece of legislation, must by law make a decision by midnight today. He may well press up against that last-hour deadline on a day when the Assembly and Senate must decide whether to enact election-law changes that they agree to on Friday and whether to make last-minute amendments to the legislative bill the Mr. Cuomo had requested.

REBUILDING MORE THAN A COVERED BRIDGE
One of the few remaining covered bridges in New York State has been saved from destruction by a great-grandson and a great-great-grandson of the men who built it.

HEADLINE: Northwest Takes On Gypsy Moth

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, May 3

 BODY:
For the last two weeks, a fleet of helicopters has been flying low over port cities in the Pacific Northwest, trying to eradicate a forest villain that could be more destructive than all the logging and forest fires of the last decade.
The target of the $10 million aerial spraying program is the Asian gypsy moth, an insect that has destroyed vast stretches of forest in Russia and is now making what scientists believe is its first appearance in North America. 
 Like its cousin the European gypsy moth, which has defoliated millions of acres of trees in the Northeast over the last century, the Asian variety has a voracious appetite and reproduces at an astonishing rate.
But the female Asian moth, unlike the female European moth, is capable of flying, which allows it to spread quickly. It has been known to eat coniferous trees like larch, in addition to maples, willows, oaks, cottonwoods and other deciduous hardwoods. Officials do not know if the Asian moth, which does the most damage in it caterpillar stage, will eat other coniferous trees, like Douglas fir, pine and hemlock, which are vital to the Northwest's economy, but they are taking no chances.
 
Killing by Starvation
 Although only a handful of the Asian moths were found near the ports of Tacoma, Wash.; Portland, Ore., and Vancouver, British Columbia, last year, officials decided to wage a swift and major war against them. For the next three months they will spray more than 120,000 acres in the Northwest with a naturally occurring bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, that causes the moths to lose their appetite and die of starvation.
If unchecked, the moths could cause up to $4 billion in damage to trees in the next 40 years, a recent Forest Service study estimated.
"There is a high potential that an explosive population of the moths will, at the very least, destroy our hardwoods, and at the very worst destroy a lot of coniferous trees as well," said Dr. Robert Gara, a forestry professor at the University of Washington. Dr. Gara is the head of a panel of scientists who are advising the United States Department of Agriculture, which is conducting the spraying program.
The European gypsy moth, which first appeared in North America in 1869, has defoliated up to 12 million acres in a single year in the East. It has established itself in 16 states, most recently Michigan, where 626,689 acres were defoliated last year -- double the previous year's damage.
Nationwide, the European moth chewed up 4.1 million acres last year, down from 7.3 million in 1990. Years of insecticide spraying and other measures appear to have curbed the population explosion, Federal scientists say.
But the appearance of the Asian moth, which measures about three-and-a-half inches from wing to wing -- slightly larger than the European variety -- has been been treated like the arrival of a science fiction monster.
The moths were first discovered last year on board a cargo ship taking on a load of grain in Vancouver. "The ship was covered with what looked like gypsy moth egg masses; thousands of them," two Federal scientists wrote in The Gypsy Moth News, a newsletter. "The egg masses were hatching. Tiny caterpillars were blowing everywhere, even into the hair of the inspectors."
Scientists trace the moths to the Russian Far East, where, they believe, the moths were drawn to the lights of docked ships and laid their eggs in the cargo bays. The eggs hatched after the ships tied up for grain in Vancouver, Tacoma and Portland. Each female moth lays 600 to 1,000 eggs and can fly up to 25 miles from its nesting site.
The spraying is concentrated around the three ports, with most of it in the Tacoma area because that is where more moths were found. Scientists say they hope to eliminate most of the moths while they are still caterpillars.
 
Spray Kills Similar Insects
 Although officials insist that the insecticide is harmless to people, animals, fish and birds, it kills butterflies and other insects that are similar to the gypsy moths.
Much of the aerial spraying has been directly over heavily populated areas around Portland and Tacoma. A few residents have complained that the spraying has caused teary eyes and respiratory problems, said Dr. Marcia Goldoft, who is monitoring the spraying for the Washington State Health Department. Dr. Goldoft said that the insecticide, known at B.t., has been used for 30 years and is approved for use by organic farmers, with little documented health hazards.
At the same time as the spraying, the authorities have begun an aggressive inspection program to prevent new eggs from coming into North America. Two months ago, after finding additional evidence of moth eggs, Canadian officials forced 13 Russian vessels out of the Port of Vancouver. Even after the spraying ends in June, Federal agriculture officials say they will set traps throughout the summer to make sure the moths have been eradicated.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Rioting Causes Jitters Over Auctions' Success

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Some credit market analysts say the disorders in Los Angeles and elsewhere last week may be felt in the financial markets for weeks if not months.
The analysts look to this week's $36 billion Treasury refunding auctions as one area where the anxiety may be felt. 
 "To the extent that foreign participation in these auctions matters, the fact that foreigners are looking at a place that is not as politically secure as it seemed even a few days ago" will not help the debt sales, said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International.
 
A Shaken Image
 Now that serious questions have been raised for the first time in at least a decade about America as a model of political and social stability, it remains to be seen how enthusiastic overseas investors will be to buy the new 3- and 10-year notes and 29 1/2-year bonds that will be sold.
Other analysts expect to see fallout in Washington from last week's riots. They say Congress and the Federal Reserve Board may feel more pressure to try to stimulate economic growth for fear that the nation's fragile recovery could stumble.
"Alan Greenspan has to be awfully nervous about this situation," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential Securities, referring to the Fed chairman. "Both Wall Street and the Fed favor a slow recovery. But this social unrest creates a lot of pressure to generate something more substantive because the fundamental underlying problem feeding the unrest is the recession."
Even before the riots, market participants viewed this week's refunding auctions as more speculative than most, in part because for the first time in years a crucial set of economic data -- employment statistics for April -- will be released on Friday, the day after the auctions end.
 
Foreign Involvement
 Any lack of enthusiasm about this week's refunding that foreigners might display would come on top of several years of diminishing foreign participation in the quarterly auctions. In that period, domestic institutions like commercial banks have filled the void.
Despite all the publicity surrounding Japanese purchases of Treasury securities in the late 1980's, foreign ownership of marketable Government debt has remained fairly steady since the mid-1970's.
In a recent report, Susan Hering, an economist at Salomon Brothers, noted that at the end of last year, foreigners owned less than 19 percent of all marketable Treasury issues. And the bulk of those securities are held by central banks, institutions whose decisions to buy or sell are not known to rest on alarmist tendencies.
While a lack of demand from overseas may be a negative at the auctions, the possibility of another easing in monetary policy by the Fed in response to the social crisis could be positive in the short term for the market, analysts suggested.
Last week, weaker-than-expected money supply figures and a report from the nation's purchasing managers heightened expectations that the Fed might move on economic grounds alone. If Friday's employment report shows that growth in the labor force remains sluggish, the Fed may decide to lower short-term rates again.
Analysts' estimates for growth in the non-farm work force range from as high as 165,000 to as low as 25,000, with most forecasts in the range of 50,000 to 75,000.
Job growth of more than 100,000 would be a welcome relief from the scant gains recorded so far this year, but even a gain of that size would be well below the levels seen in the early stages of previous recoveries. Looking forward, the riots could affect future hiring and spending plans.
 
'Everybody Loses Here'
 "Civil unrest is not conducive to economic growth," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Corporation. "It is too early to draw many conclusions, but what we have seen is not going to help the nation's psyche, or boost consumer confidence. Everybody loses here."
Analysts agreed that the riots increased the chances that Washington would reconsider ways to increase domestic spending.
Such talk made inflation-wary bond market investors nervous earlier this year, and it would probably do so again. But the odds of a substantive package being produced before year-end seem remote, the analysts said.
"There is going to be a lot of pressure to pour money at these problems now," Mr. Resler said. "But there will be less inclination to spend money this time, I think, for a few reasons.
"First, problems of this nature don't have easy solutions. Second, we did spend a lot of money in the 1960's, without much success. And now, due to the budget deficit, we just don't have much money to spend."

HEADLINE: As Convention Nears, Uncertainty Clouds Impact

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
With the Democratic National Convention to open in Madison Square Garden 10 weeks from today, just what it will mean to New York City remains unclear. Even as the preparations shift into high gear, estimates of the impact on the local economy say more about the art of financial projection than about the count-the-dollars precision of an audit.
No one is sure, for instance, how to assess the official estimate that the city will somehow get between $200 million and $300 million worth of "media coverage" from a few days of international absorption with what goes on inside the Garden. 
 The first wave of coverage will begin this week when 1,000 out-of-town journalists arrive for a tour of out-of-the-way spaces inside the Garden that are being turned into meeting rooms where delegates can gather and press rooms where reporters can set up their portable computers. A similar tour for Democratic state chairmen is scheduled for next week.
 
Fiscal Forecast
 One question as the convention approaches is how much money it will bring to New York City. Roughly 20,000 Democratic delegates, alternates, guests and staff members are expected, along with 15,000 reporters, editors, producers and technicians assigned to cover them on and off the convention floor.
The city estimates that each of them will spend $353 a day. Factoring in everything from balloons and confetti to hotel renovations that are being rushed through in time for the delegates' arrival, the city is predicting that the convention will make the local economy $473 million richer, including $27 million in tax revenue. But forecasting how much the delegates will spend is like betting on sunshine for the Fourth of July.
Compounding the uncertainty is something that San Francisco discovered when it played host to the Democratic National Convention in 1984: political conventions are different from other kinds of conventions.
"I remember merchants saying they didn't see the numbers in the cash registers they were expecting," said Sharon Rooney of the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau, who at the time was working in Ghirardelli Square, an indoor mall with boutiques and restaurants near Fisherman's Wharf. "It may have been because the attendees were in so many free parties."
Still, the Democratic National Convention Committee says the convention was worth $55 million to San Francisco, and the 1988 convention pumped $70 million into the economy in Atlanta.
As for New York, economists who have reviewed the city's figures for this year say the assumptions behind the numbers are not unreasonable. But even John Altschuler, the economist who arrived at the $353-a-day figure the city used, said anticipating spending patterns is "metaphysical" -- more art than science.
 
Some High, Some Low
 The city's Finance Commissioner, Carol O'Cleireacain, who was not involved in preparing the estimates, found some figures on the city's four-page economic prospectus for the convention high. But she said they were offset by other numbers that seemed low. "As the British say, what you gain on the turns you lose on the roundabouts," she said.
No one expects those attending the convention to be working from "New York on $70 a Day." But preparing estimates for the city, which has some of the country's most expensive hotels, is tricky. The International Association of Convention and Visitors Bureaus says the nationwide average for convention delegates last year was $688 for a four-day gathering; the city is figuring on about $1,400.
The uncertainty does not end there. One figure that Ms. O'Cleireacain said should probably have been higher was the amount that journalists would spend. The city's estimate is $37.06 million, based on 15,000 reporters and technicians spending at least seven days in New York. She said that about half of the journalists covering the convention would spend at least a week in town before it began, for a total of two weeks, twice as long as the city estimated.
She also said the city's figures assumed that news organizations spent money "as if they were regular tourists" -- in other words, the figures did not take into account big-budget items like equipment rentals and satellite fees for television and radio.
Rosemary Scanlon, an economist with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, questioned the way that the city tallied the $189.8 million cost of renovating two midtown hotels, the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers and the Sheraton Manhattan. She said the full cost should not have been included, since some renovation work would have been done even if the Democrats had not chosen New York for the convention.
 
Pricing the Spotlight
 Other benefits of playing host to the convention are not so easy to quantify, even though the convention planners have tried. One such benefit, mentioned often by convention planners and city officials, is the psychological bonus that comes from being in the spotlight. This applies only if everything goes according to plan, as it did when the Democrats met in Madison Square Garden in 1976.
This time around, the city is counting on the four-day convention to provide between $200 million and $300 million worth of favorable publicity in the form of live national television coverage and newspaper articles.
"Assuming there are no major disasters while the convention is going on and it doesn't become like Chicago in 1968," said Louis Masotti, an economist who teaches at the University of California at Irvine, "the long-term effect could be revisits from people who had crossed New York off their list."
Marshall Murdaugh, the executive director of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, is already concerned that tourists will be frightened away by what he calls "the big-event syndrome." At the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and the 1984 World's Fair in New Orleans, he said, attendance fell far short of expectations, as was the case during the Bicentennial celebration in 1976.
"In Philadelphia, Boston, Washington," he said, "on July 5 you could have shot a cannon through hotel lobbies and not hit anybody because a lot of people, fearing the promise of crowds, just stayed home."
The city now has 70,000 hotel rooms. Noting that the convention is going to use only 22,000 of them, Mr. Murdaugh said: "We don't want people staying away because they think the city is sold out."

HEADLINE: Store Chain In Bankruptcy

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CANTON, Mass., May 3

 BODY:
The convenience store chain Cumberland Farms Inc. has filed for bankruptcy court protection from its creditors.
Hurt by the recession and slumping real estate values, the privately held company had been trying for several months to work out a new arrangement with its lenders, said Foster Macrides, vice president for human relations. 
 The effort collapsed when the biggest lender, the Industrial Bank of Japan Trust Company, balked at the plan, Mr. Macrides said. Cumberland's 70 other real estate lenders and trade creditors had supported the plan, the company said.
Cumberland made its filing on Friday in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Worcester, Mass.
"We wanted to restructure to give us some breathing room," Mr. Macrides said. "We've been operating in a recessionary economy, especially here in the Northeast. And real estate values have suffered some declines."
The Chapter 11 filing gives Cumberland time to rework its finances while protected from meeting obligations to creditors.
"It's business as usual during this period," Mr. Macrides said.
Cumberland operates 973 convenience stores and gas stations in 12 states and employs 8,000. It also owns and operates Gulf Oil in the Northeast, and sells gasoline to some 2,500 service stations.
Mr. Macrides said the company did not anticipate any layoffs or store closings.

HEADLINE: AUTO RACING;
Lights, Action, Nascar: Charlotte's New Nightspot

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO

 BODY:
You could refer to what will happen at Charlotte Motor Speedway two weeks from now as the dawn of an era in stock-car racing. But considering the schedule of events on May 16, it's more of a sunset on the age when racing lasted only as long as the daylight.
On that date, Charlotte Speedway, a 1.5-mile superspeedway in the heart of stock-car country, will turn on the switch of a $1.7 million, 1.2 billion candlepower lighting system and at about 8:58 P.M. Eastern time, the Winston, a 105-mile series of sprint races, will be held under those lights. 
 This will not be the first time that an event on Nascar's most prestigious circuit will take place at night. Bristol International Raceway in Tennessee and Richmond International Raceway in Virginia hold a Winston Cup race at night each year.
 
Trend for Long Tracks?
 But Charlotte is longer than those two tracks combined, and if its owners can prove that a superspeedway can successfully and economically be illuminated, it could light the way for other long tracks on the Winston Cup circuit to do the same.
And that could open up room for new tracks on the crowded 29-race Winston Cup schedule.
Most of the hundreds of tracks in the United States are small ovals of less than a half-mile in length, said Humpy Wheeler, president and general manager of Charlotte Motor Speedway, and just about all of them run weekly programs on Friday and Saturday nights, featuring local heroes on the bottom rungs of the sport. "So it's just a logical extension of the grass-roots of racing," Wheeler said, describing Charlotte's decision to go to lighting.
By being able to race at night, Wheeler said, his track could hold a race in summer, normally too hot for a daytime event.
 
In Case of Rain
 Charlotte's main race is the Coca-Cola 600, run on Memorial Day weekend. "If we ran into problems, say, with the 600 and we only had 210 miles in and it rained, we could finish the race under the lights," Wheeler said.
"And track rentals near urban areas are a big source of revenue," he said, adding that last year the track was rented for 254 days, close to its limit. "This will literally be able to double our track rental," Wheeler said.
Even though Charlotte's 600-mile race draws more than 100,000 spectators, it exists in the shadow of a certain race held that weekend in Indiana. But the lights could help eliminate that shadow.
"We might look at moving back the starting time," Wheeler said, referring to the 600-mile race. With the Indy 500 starting at noon and ending about 3 P.M., a later start in Charlotte could eliminate much of the conflict in television scheduling.
 
Extensive but Inexpensive
 There are 1,200 fixtures -- each with a 1,500-watt bulb -- in Charlotte's lighting system, which was designed and installed by Musco Lighting, an Iowa firm that also lit the movie "Dances With Wolves" and the Statue of Liberty rededication.
Despite all that illumination, needed to be so bright because the cars don't use headlights, Wheeler estimated his electric bill would be only $200 per hour. "We knew that going in," said Wheeler. "That's the first thing we checked." He credited the efficiency of Duke Power, the local utility, for the low cost.
Paul Sawyer, president of Richmond Raceway, spoke about the benefits of night racing last September, a few hours before the lights went on for his Winston Cup race.
"I'm not saying I'm setting a trend," Sawyer said, "but the way I look at it, I've never been in favor of Monday rain dates."
He had to use one in 1988, and it caused traffic nightmares because the track is on one of the main highways linking Richmond to its suburbs. "I had people sitting in line three hours, and they never could get in the raceway because of the traffic," Sawyer said.
Now, by being able to schedule a race Saturday night, Sawyer has a Sunday rain date to fall back on.
He thinks that if more Winston Cup tracks light up and go to Saturday race dates, some of the weekends kept open as rain dates could be used for events at new tracks.
Sawyer rebuilt the Richmond track in 1988. Between his race in February and the one in September, he tore it down completely and replaced it with a modern three-quarter-mile track that now has about 60,000 seats.
His isn't the only first-class oval track in the country. At least two others -- Pennsylvania International Raceway in Nazareth and New Hampshire International Speedway in Loudon -- want a Winston Cup race, but Nascar can't find room on the schedule.

HEADLINE: Freezing Government, Cont'd.

 BODY:
Is President Bush interested in making government more efficient? Or does he aim to paralyze it? Those questions arise now that he has extended for an additional 120 days a 90-day freeze on new Federal regulation.
The first 90 days suggest an answer: The moratorium smacks of an election-year conversion to improve Mr. Bush's standing with conservatives and business interests that abhor regulation. Having presided over three years of increased regulation by regulators of his own choosing, he suddenly decided in January that they were doing their jobs too well, and ordered them to stop. 
 It's difficult to say what the first 90 days achieved; officials concede as much. Mr. Bush claims the moratorium already promises savings of more than $15 billion a year in reduced regulatory costs to businesses and consumers. He makes no mention of the added costs of dirtier air, less information for investors and watered-down consumer protection.
No doubt justified savings will be realized. But Mr. Bush's billions include speculative benefits, disputed even by some businesses that stand to benefit, and pure flim-flam. Example: Under the Clean Air Act, fumes at gas stations in cities that have smog problems must be contained. By killing a proposed rule that new cars be fitted with a canister to capture the fumes at the gas pump, the Administration placates the auto industry -- but transfers the cost to gas stations and oil companies.
Mr. Bush says he aims only to eliminate regulations that are unnecessarily burdensome -- and, goodness knows, there are plenty. During the 90-day pause, agencies were told to review all existing regulations while they halted work on any new ones that block economic growth. There is nothing wrong with revisions to meet changed conditions. But that should be constant, not a crash program in the fourth year of a floundering Administration.
Going far beyond useful review, eager executors of Mr. Bush's stop order are using it to sabotage law that the President is sworn to uphold, most notably the Clean Air Act, which he has trumpeted as his main environmental accomplishment.
A key provision of that act requires industries to get new permits before they increase air pollution, with "opportunity for public comment" before permission is granted. But the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed regulation has been stalled by Vice President Quayle's defiant attempt to insert a loophole that would bypass the requirement for public review.
Far from streamlining regulation, such efforts produce paralysis, which hurts industry planners as much as anyone. By the end of the new extension, the regulatory process will have been frozen for seven months. It's hard to see how that serves the public interest. It's easier to see how it fuels Mr. Bush's campaign for re-election.

HEADLINE: Toyota Plant in Kentucky Is Font of Ideas for U.S.

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GEORGETOWN, Ky.

 BODY:
The ideas about factory work that the Toyota Motor Corporation was promoting around horse country here at first seemed too simple to be significant, the formulations of people who had only just noticed that thoroughbreds thrive on bluegrass.
But as Toyota rules were tested -- as the company installed cords for workers to pull for help, which they do an average of 3,500 times a day, and systems were developed to improve efficiency and prevent assembly line mistakes -- the brilliance of their simplicity was difficult to deny. 
 As more and more Camrys were built, accolades for the car poured in. Experts from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology came and concluded that Toyota's methods could help a factory make everything more efficiently, from cars to copiers, jet engines to dishwashers.
In the four years that Toyota has been making engines and cars here, tens of thousands of manufacturing executives and production engineers have journeyed here. Indeed, 20,000 came last year alone, convinced that what is happening here can change the American way of mass production.
"The principles of the Toyota production system apply everywhere," said Gary McClimans, a partner in Arthur Andersen & Company's manufacturing consulting practice. "Virtually every U.S. manufacturer is trying some elements of the Toyota system."
Not that the Toyota plant is perfect. Critics charge that its employees are overworked and that its cars contain relatively few American-made parts.
But by now, the terms of Japan's production techniques -- just-in-time inventories, zero defects and continuous improvement -- are familiar to American manufacturers. And the pressing need to make America a more efficient producer has heightened interest in the plant.
"Anybody who competes with the Japanese has to come and see this," said James P. Womack, a Boston manufacturing consultant who was involved in the M.I.T. study.
Richard Delott, a longtime engineer at the Whirlpool Corporation, came to Georgetown last February. He had first studied the Toyota system in the mid-1980's, when Whirlpool started adopting Japanese manufacturing principles in its factories. Mr. Delott marveled at several things, including the elaborate programs that teach workers and supervisors to learn multiple tasks.
"Without a doubt, Toyota has become the benchmark of the world," said Heinz Prechter, chairman of the ASC Corporation, a Southgate, Mich., supplier that makes sunroofs and convertibles for Toyota, the Big Three and several European auto makers. "They truly have the vision, and what we need in this country is to find a way to be as good or better."
In this election year, the General Motors Corporation is searching for efficiencies by closing plants and preparing to eliminate more than 70,000 jobs, and politicians are debating whether Japan has captured -- perhaps unfairly -- nearly a third of the American car market. But what is often overlooked is that Japanese auto makers have successfully transplanted their work habits to America, hired tens of thousands of people here and built showcase factories.
 
'Lean Production' Eliminates Waste
 Toyota has succeeded by turning the mass-production principles behind Henry Ford's assembly line on their head. The result is what an M.I.T. researcher has dubbed "lean production."
Where Ford believed that the cheapest way to build Model T's was to churn out huge numbers by having workers repeatedly perform a single task, Toyota discovered in the early 1950's that a smaller number of workers, each capable of doing several jobs, can turn out cars with less inventory, less investment, and fewer mistakes.
Predictably, Toyota's biggest impact so far has come in auto making. The manufacturing ethic of Toyota has rippled from its own plant to its 174 suppliers in the United States and to hundreds of other suppliers.
For example, when a United Technologies Corporation plant in Morganfield, Ky., won the job of making the Camry's plastic center console, which divides the front seat, Toyota asked workers to scrutinize their tasks by calculating how many seconds each movement took. The aim: to eliminate every bit of "muda," the Japanese word for waste.
Under Toyota's watchful eye, ordinary line workers held stopwatches, analyzed videotapes and proposed improvements that yielded startling efficiencies. The time it took to change dies in some plastic-injection-molding machines dropped from an hour to less than half an hour. Encouraged to pitch in with their own ideas, workers invented a heating process that eliminated costly minutes of down time for the presses.
"Since I arrived here in 1983, nothing has changed our plant as much as the way Toyota taught us to look at all the little things," said Ken Franklin, the plant manager.
Critics, including the United Automobile Workers union, some Big Three executives and important lawmakers, however, have charged -- and Toyota has denied -- that Toyota's American operations add little value or domestic content because the plant merely assembles kits made in Japan.
 
Amount of U.S. Parts In Camrys Is Disputed
 "What's happening at Georgetown is the final assembly of cars and engines and not much more," said Sean McAlinden, a senior researcher at the University of Michigan. "No more than 25 percent of the car's value is added at Georgetown."
Toyota says nearly 75 percent of the parts in its Camrys are American made and points to a growing number of supplier plants that employ workers in a more effective, creative manner than do many American factories.
The union also says it believes that the Toyota system is a well-disguised plot to make the 4,125 employees here work faster. Specifically, the Toyota production system has been opposed by an advocacy wing of the union, which represents workers at three joint-venture plants between Japanese auto makers and Detroit. The U.A.W. has never tried to represent Toyota workers here, but it was thwarted at the Nissan Motor Company and the Honda Motor Company.
Classic mass production tries to maximize output by running machines with as few interruptions as possible. Each worker has one or two tasks, repeated over and over. Skilled specialists set up and maintain machines, but the goal is always the same: to keep machines running.
By contrast, workers in a lean-production environment learn numerous jobs and shoulder broader responsibility, including maintenance, inspection and machine setup. With a flexible work force that can perform a variety of skills, Toyota and other lean producers are able to stop machines often. They must do so to keep batches of parts or partially completed cars small.
As workers change the type of part each machine makes, they also note and record every minor glitch, no matter how slight. If necessary, they can stop production to get help to correct a problem.
By making relatively small batches of parts that are delivered only as needed, inventory costs are kept small. Moreover, if a defective part is spotted, the manufacturing error is corrected instantly.
To encourage immediate reporting of problems, managers constantly praise workers who pull the "andon" (the Japanese word for "lantern") cord. The cord causes a light to flash, signaling a team leader that a worker needs help; if the problem cannot be resolved in one minute -- as most problems can be -- the assembly line stops automatically. About 93 percent of the time, the line keeps moving.
"The cord is a team member's communication device to make sure a problem is taken care of," said Mike DaPrile, Toyota's assembly plant manager.
The Georgetown plant, with its network of suppliers nearby, more closely matches how Toyota operates in Japan. By shortening the distance between supplier and assembler, the amount of inventory cost is reduced. Parts arrive constantly.
 
Pressure on Suppliers To Make No Mistakes
 "If we ship 601 parts when the order calls for 600, we get gigged," said Michael Sherman, a manager of Braun Engineering in Detroit, which makes a part for the Camry's disk brakes. "If parts arrive early we get gigged. Every mistake is a demerit. When we started a few years ago our score was 62 percent. Within 18 months it was 99 percent and it stayed that way. If your score is low and doesn't improve you can lose the business."
By contrast, Mr. Sherman added, Braun routinely built tens of thousands of extra parts for Detroit auto makers -- increasing costs enormously.
By way of criticism, many American supply companies that have not landed contracts with Japanese companies -- Toyota in particular -- say that the Japanese qualifications for suppliers exclude most American companies and that the Japanese companies tend to favor their "keiretsu," the family of suppliers with which they are affiliated in Japan.
Nowhere does lean production differ more boldly from mass manufacturing than in its philosophy toward workers.
To insure that no job is too difficult -- or too easy -- a team of workers calculates how many seconds each task should take. Then, according to the speed of the assembly line, red lines are drawn signifying where the car should be when work begins and where it should be when the work is done.
Workers are trained not to start work before the car reaches the first line and to complete the job before it reaches the second line. If the task can be completed in less time or cannot be completed in the time allotted, then the job is redesigned.
Last October, the members of Toyota's team A-110 threw a party to celebrate staying within the red lines. They were rewarded with red cream soda, red chewing gum and red-hot candy, and names were drawn for two tickets to a Cincinnati Reds game.
The Toyota system has spread to the company's suppliers. "Our associates operate machines, set them up, inspect for quality, perform minor maintenance, clean up, offer suggestions," said Carl Lay, vice president of corporate relations for the Ambrake Corporation in Elizabethtown, Ky., a joint venture between the Akebono Brake Industry Company, a Japanese brake maker, and G.M.
In some American plants, union work rules would make such a system impossible.
Ambrake operates no time clocks, and it enjoys an absentee rate of less than five-tenths of 1 percent. Absenteeism of 10 percent or more is not unusual in United States auto plants.
"Here it's more like a family," said Diana Hobbs, 40 years old, of rural Hardin County, Kentucky, who assembles brakes. "Supervisors listen to you and everyone works together." At textile plants where she worked previously, she continued, "if I had a problem, there was no one to discuss it with."
Not all American workers have flourished in Japanese-owned auto plants. For example, Dennis Pawley, now executive vice president for manufacturing at the Chrysler Corporation, worked for two years as manager of the Mazda Motor Corporation's plant near Detroit. He left because, he said, his Japanese superiors ignored his contributions.
 
Low-Tech Tricks By the Thousand
 Since the 1950's, Toyota and Japanese manufacturers that studied Toyota have perfected thousands of little low-tech tricks, like visual markings or cartoon sketches that are posted everywhere to prevent almost every conceivable factory floor foul-up.
Toyota suggests, for example, that all dies needed in a set for making a particular part should be painted one color. That way it is easy to see if the wrong die is being used. A machine operator knows the safest and most efficient place to stand because yellow foot-prints mark the spot.
Instead of laser inspection used in some American plants, Toyota has introduced "poke-yoke" fixtures that prevent defective parts from fitting into a machine or moving on a conveyor. The Japanese word "poke-yoke" roughly translates as "fool proof."
Toyota's assembly and engine plant has been an economic godsend to a region hurt by falling farm employment, particularly in tobacco, and cutbacks in areas like coal mining. Toyota jobs, with average pay of about $17 an hour, are highly prized. Workers from 111 of Kentucky's 120 counties commute by car, a few almost three hours each way.
"I'm one of the fortunate who have been able to stay in central Kentucky," said Gene Murphy, who had worked for Clark Equipment until the plant closed in the mid-1980's. He is assistant plant manager of the Vuteq Corporation in Georgetown, a subsidiary of Chuba Industries of Japan that makes sunroofs and rear windows for the Camry. He has many Japanese friends and a son who studies Japanese at school, and he named his bassett hound Inu -- Japanese for "dog."
"It's easy to be a manager for a Japanese company," Mr. Murphy said, "because you are striving for common goals with the people you manage. The work is oriented toward them and toward customers, not just making production schedules."

HEADLINE: RIOTS IN LOS ANGELES: The President;
WHITE HOUSE LINKS RIOTS TO WELFARE

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4

 BODY:
The White House said today that the riots last week in Los Angeles were a result of social welfare programs that Congress enacted in the 1960's and 70's, but it refused to say publicly whether President Bush would offer any detailed alternative to those "failed" policies in coming weeks.
Other senior officials said that Mr. Bush favored an extensive lobbying campaign to enact and expand conservative social legislation that Congress has not enacted. 
 While the White House may also propose some additional programs, they are likely to be small, and the Administration does not contemplate "dramatic" new Federal spending should they be put into effect, the officials said.
 
Plans for Visit May Change
 One official also said Mr. Bush may now travel to California on Wednesday evening, a half-day before he had been scheduled to go there, to create time for a "hands-on" tour of areas affected by the Los Angeles riots.
After a meeting this morning with several Cabinet members, the President ordered the Deputy Secretary of Education, David Kearnes, to go to Los Angeles to coordinate Federal relief efforts.
The White House said today that it would supply $100 million in Federal disaster aid to riot victims and an additional $200 million to rebuild damaged areas and that the Small Business Administration would provide up to $400 million in loans to rebuild businesses. Property damage is still being assessed, but Mayor Tom Bradley has estimated it at $500 million.
Mr. Bush told reporters this morning that his Administration had "some very good proposals out on the table right now, proposals who clearly have come of age," and said that he would consider them in detail later this week.
"I'm very pleased that it has calmed down out there," he said.
But the main thrust of the White House response was political, which is the way it was described by the President's spokesman.
 
Taking Aim at 60's Programs
 "We believe that many of the root problems that have resulted in inner city difficulties were started in the 60's and 70's and that they have failed," the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said. Pressed for examples, he said, "I don't have a list with me."
Mr. Bush and other Republicans have often asserted that the Great Society programs fostered by President Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat, in the 1960's, at the time of the last major urban riots, made poverty and other social problems worse instead of better.
Mr. Fitzwater contended today that "liberal Democrats" in Congress had prevented Mr. Bush and his Republican predecessor, President Ronald Reagan, from winning approval of many changes in welfare policies and social programs that might have helped avert last week's disturbances.
The remarks placed the White House response to the Los Angeles disturbances squarely in an election-year political context, only days after Mr. Fitzwater had berated Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the likely Democratic Presidential nominee, for criticizing Mr. Bush's initial reaction to the riots.
On Thursday, Mr. Fitzwater had called Mr. Clinton "Slippery Bill" and accused him of playing politics with a national tragedy. This weekend, Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, said that Mr. Clinton's comments "stooped to partisan demagoguery" on the issue.
But today, Mr. Fitzwater said that he was trying to show reporters "what our direction is" by creating a stark contrast between "destructive" social programs supported by past Democratic Congresses and Mr. Bush's "conservative agenda that creates jobs and housing and home ownership and involvement in the community."
"This is a political year, and there's no doubt about it that everybody is going to have their own solutions," he said. "And so, it's time to hit it head on, so here's how we look at it."
Many of the social programs of the 1960's and 1970's, especially the most expensive and comprehensive ones, have become part of the fabric of American life. They include yearly increases in Social Security retirement benefits to keep pace with inflation; Medicare health insurance for the elderly and disabled; Medicaid medical care for the poor; aid for schools pegged to the number of poor children who attend them, and food stamps, which subsidize grocery purchases for about 1 in 10 Americans.
Mr. Bush criticized some of those programs, without explicitly naming them, in a commencement speech one year ago today at the University of Michigan. In it, he called the Johnson Administration's Great Society a noble crusade that backfired, addicting welfare recipients to Federal checks, breeding lassitude and weakening citizens' "moral sensitivity" to their families and fellow men.
 
A Conservative Agenda
 By contrast, the conservative proposals that Mr. Bush said today that he would push for generally couple Federal aid to the poor with programs that stress self-reliance and provide financial incentives to work and learn.
The proposals include ones to give Federal tax breaks to businesses that invest in inner cities, give tenants greater control of public-housing projects and give parents education vouchers that could be used to place their children in private schools.
"Bush believes, and we believe, that those proposals are basically sound," said an official who would speak only if he was not named, adding that the President plans a "reinvigorated" effort to secure their enactment.
A few programs, like one that allows poor tenants to buy apartments in public-housing projects, have become law in pared-back form. But even Mr. Bush's advisers agree privately that most have received only tepid support from the President.
In recent weeks, the Bush Administration has sought to reduce one major social-welfare program, proposing on March 20 to eliminate from the budget for the 1993 fiscal year $547.7 million to build new public housing.
The Administration argued that public housing would cost more to build than equivalent private housing and that low-income tenants could be provided housing through other programs that are less wasteful.
The proposal was part of $3.6 billion in Federal programs that Mr. Bush is seeking to wipe out of the budget as part of an effort to depict the Democratic Congress as free-spending and irresponsible. Mr. Bush proposed the cuts after Congress refused to enact the complete version of an economic-growth package that he proposed in his State of the Union Message in January.

HEADLINE: After the Cold War -- Views From Japan;
Tokyo in the New Epoch: Heady Future, With Fear

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 4

 BODY:
No country prospered more during the cold war than Japan, and perhaps no country is more wistful for that era's comforting certainties. While the United States and Europe were preoccupied with throw weights and satellite photographs, Japan was able to focus almost entirely on building an economy that became the envy of the world, largely undistracted by, and often profiting from, the superpower rivalry.
For several years now the Japanese have known that those heady days were coming to an end. Nonetheless, the cold war's demise caught this country strangely ill prepared, forcing it to recast its dealings with its main ally, the United States, and break out of a four-decade stalemate in its diplomatic relations with its most powerful Asian neighbors. 
 Though still bound to be dominated by economic issues, the 1990's will also be a test of Japan's ability to overcome its reflexive isolationism, to become an independent political power without arousing those who are already deeply anxious about its economic might.
 
New Security Rationale Sought
 For the United States, Japan's search raises a question that officials on both sides of the Pacific are just beginning to discuss publicly: What is the new rationale for a security alliance intended to give Japan protection in return for America's biggest, strongest Pacific outpost against Communism?
Though the Bush Administration insists that it remains deeply committed to a forward deployment here, especially as long as tensions remain on the Korean Peninsula, many here believe that it is only a matter of time before America's 56,000 troops here are reduced to a largely symbolic force.
"What we are concerned with is an America turning inward, politically and economically," said Takakazu Kuriyama, a former Deputy Foreign Minister and now Ambassador to the United States.
Others share his fear, not least because America's presence reassures Japan's neighbors.
 
Is Japan Next U.S. Rival?
 But the prospect of a reduced American role in the Pacific is only part of what leaves the Japanese uneasy. In the Japanese press and on television it often seems the conventional wisdom that America has a psychological need for a rival, and that Japan is next in line. Such views may be more widely repeated than deeply held; polls show that while there is a deepening distrust and disillusionment with the United States, Japanese still regard America as their closest -- and perhaps only -- true friend in the world.
But it is a measure of Japan's insecurity on this point that books with titles like "The Coming War With Japan" are always much bigger sellers here than in the United States, and a recurrent theme in manga, the thick comic books read by millions of Japanese workers on the subways, is an American military once again at battle with Japanese forces.
Without question, such popular views have a subtle effect on the way Japanese view their own future relations with the rest of the world, making them feel that they are increasingly being cast out to fend for themselves. But some believe that such a change is overdue, that America's domination of Japanese security policy has delayed Japan's maturation as a truly independent state.
"In a sense we are politically in transition, from being dependent on U.S. policy to an independent status," said Saburo Okita, a former Foreign Minister. "But our politics have been so dependent that we still cannot make our own decisions."
Nothing has made that clearer than the two continuing debates that have seized Japan this year: whether to demand a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council and whether to create a peacekeeping force that could be sent on United Nations missions, violating a taboo against "collective security" arrangements that dates to the end of World War II.
The Tokyo Government has not wanted to appear to be openly seeking the Security Council seat, even though countries with far less economic power sit there today. But there is also an underlying fear that Japan, if given a bully pulpit, may have little to say. "We might be ashamed to raise our hand," Seiki Nishihiro, a former Deputy Defense Minister, said during a recent conference.
 
Peacekeeping
Fear of Sending Troops Abroad
 The debate over a peacekeeping force has been marked by ambivalence of another sort. Ever since the Persian Gulf war, the Government has tried to push through a bill that would create a lightly armed organization that could be sent out entirely under United Nations command. From the outside it appears innocuous. Yet twice the bill has been defeated, and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's tenure in office may depend on his ability to pass it in the next few months.
While few will say so explicitly, the debate over the peacekeeping bill seems to be motivated by a broader question: Does the Japanese public yet trust its Government enough to send the military abroad, without fear that it could once again veer toward the expansionist militarism that got the country into World War II?
Over the last year, it has become increasingly clear that the Japanese public does not share the political leadership's enthusiasm for post-cold-war self-assertiveness. In surveys, on television and just in conversation, many Japanese say that while they agree that Japan must find new ways to contribute to the world, they are deeply uncomfortable with the idea of breaking the taboos that have kept their military forces at home and focused the Government on economic development, not geopolitics.
Such questions are arising only now because for four decades Tokyo's foreign policy has followed Washington's so closely that Japan has developed few of the institutions needed to chart its own course -- a powerful foreign ministry, an independent intelligence network, a confident military. Unlike Germany, Japan in the postwar era never entered regional collective security arrangements, even with other American allies like South Korea.
As a result, many Japanese leaders concede that the country still finds itself almost paralyzed diplomatically. Though it has tried to help bring about a settlement in Cambodia, not long ago the Japanese who is running the United Nations peacekeeping operation there, Yasushi Akashi, accused his country of moving too slowly and helping too little in sending personnel and logistical assistance to the area. To get the peacekeeping bill through Parliament, the governing Liberal Democratic Party may have to agree to send no one for several years, presumably until after the Cambodia peacekeeping operation expires. Or the Government may bow to demands from the opposition that forces be sent on a case-by-case basis, meaning a parliamentary debate each time.
Such domestic deal-making may be the biggest impediment to Japan's broader international role. The constant factional struggle in the Liberal Democratic Party has led party leaders to talk about the direction of the country's foreign and security policy in only the vaguest of terms. Japan's neighbors say the clubby, often secretive ways that political decisions are made in Japan add to their distrust of a broader global role for the country.
"The prerequisite for taking a larger political role," said Gerald Hensley, the Defense Minister of New Zealand, "is whether they can clean up their own political system, thus commanding more international confidence. And they must learn to act more generously."
 
Security
Dependence on U.S. Begins to Crumble
 When he commanded the American occupation of Japan, Gen. Douglas MacArthur described his vision of the country as a "Switzerland of the Pacific," a neutral nation that took no sides in the region's many conflicts. It was an image that still resonates deeply with many Japanese, who associate the country's 40-year territorial expansion -- first into Sakhalin and Korea, then into China and Southeast Asia -- with phenomenal destruction and crushing poverty.
General MacArthur's vision of neutrality was quickly jettisoned in reaction to the Communist takeover in China, the growing confrontation with the Soviet Union and the wars in Korea and Indochina. Soon a new bargain was struck: Japan would provide the United States with bases on Japanese soil in return for American protection. Though the security treaty was the subject of violent street protests in 1960, it has since come to be the fabric underlying Japanese foreign policy.
At America's urging, Japan used the prospect of invasion by the Soviet Union to justify the buildup its own military forces, reinterpreting its Constitution to allow defensive forces. As Japan geared up a military budget that now tops $30 billion a year, making it among the largest in the world, Japanese industry profited greatly, building ships and aircraft under American license and gaining considerable technology and manufacturing experience.
"In reality no one really believed there was much of a Soviet threat," a senior Japanese diplomat said recently. But it was a "convenient arrangement," he said.
It was particularly convenient for Japanese businessmen, who always enjoyed hearing the American Ambassador to Tokyo throughout the 1980's, Mike Mansfield, repeat that Japan and America had "the most important bilateral relationship in the world." They knew it meant that the security relationship would almost always overshadow American concerns about economic competitiveness.
"When you read some of the history, it is incredible how much of Japan policy for 40 years centered around making sure that Japan didn't go to the other side, the side of military neutrality," said James Fallows, who is completing a book about Japan and Asia. "As a politically relevant fact, that only ended a year ago."
The first concrete evidence that the traditional thinking was crumbling came in 1989, when Congress objected to technology transfers to Japan for the co-development of a new fighter jet, called the FSX. That began a spiral of resentments that reached a zenith when Japan rejected requests that it provide personnel -- not necessarily military personnel -- in the gulf war.
To Washington that constituted evidence that the alliance was one-sided. "Japan lost a lot of supporters here," a senior American military official said several months ago.
 
U.S. Presence
New Threats Seen As Old Ones Ease
 Critics of America's military presence here say the military is simply inventing missions to justify the presence, overstating threats and magnifying the power of potential rivals.
But whenever American military officials travel through the region, they insist that Japan has taken on renewed importance in the Pentagon's strategy, especially after the loss of Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Station in the Philippines. Potential threats, they argue, are real and plentiful.
"Russia is still one," said Lieut. Gen. Richard E. Hawley, who commands all the American forces in Japan. "You don't see the same changes in the Russian military structure when you sit in Japan and look west as you do when you sit in Berlin and look east."
"China is a major power center," he continued, "and that alone is simple justification for continued U.S. presence in this part of the world."
Perhaps the most unpredictable threat of all, and the one cited most often these days, is North Korea. Its suspected efforts to build nuclear weapons have rattled Japan's leadership and become the focus of what may be the closest political cooperation between Tokyo and Washington in years, as the two try to convince North Korea that the price it must pay for economic aid and recognition is abandonment of its nuclear ambitions.
"To talk about an American decline of interest here is both wrong and dangerous," James R. Lilley, a former Ambassador to China and now Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, said during a recent Asian tour. "It gives potential predators a false sense of opportunity and an inducement to be aggressive."
"Let's not give Kim Jong Il any ideas," he said, referring to the heir-apparent in North Korea.
 
Militarism
Fear of Revival Of Adventurism
 American and Japanese officials are more hesitant to talk about the other, rarely stated benefit of keeping American troops posted here: It reassures Asian nations that worry about a revived Japanese military.
But as the peacekeeping bill demonstrates, the concern seems overblown. There is virtually no detectable appetite for military adventurism in Tokyo, and little support, except from the Japanese right wing, for building anything other than purely defensive ability. Year after year, the Japanese military has been unable to win support for refueling planes or for small aircraft carriers, both of which Japanese fear would be viewed as potentially offensive weapons. Japan does not even have its own surveillance satellites, a source of considerable frustration in Tokyo since the North Korean nuclear scare began.
Most vocal in support of an American presence to keep a check on Japan are countries like Singapore, where this year schoolchildren were herded through an exhibit at the national museum with graphic images of Japanese atrocities during the occupation of the city 50 years ago. Singapore's Defense Minister, Yeo Ning Hong, said recently that should the United States gradually reduce its presence in the Pacific, "Japan may feel compelled to re-arm to safeguard its trade routes beyond the 1,000 nautical miles south of Tokyo," the current limit for Japanese forces.
That could prompt the Chinese and the Koreans, Mr. Yeo said, to "build up their respective armed forces to counter and contain any Japanese rearmament," setting off "a whole chain reaction of destabilization."
But the true concern about American withdrawal from the region involves a far more subtle form of Japanese influence. With newly built factories stretching from southern China to Indonesia, Japan is already the overwhelming economic power in the region. Japanese-style capitalism and Japanese work habits rival the Sony Walkman as Japan's most conspicuous export. The United States, in the view of many Southeast Asians, plays a critical if economically unrewarding role, assuring that Japan's influence stays on the factory floor.
"The more respectable argument is not that Japan will re-militarize in the absence of America but simply that if America pulls back, the Japanese will slowly move to fill the gap," said Mr. Hensley, the New Zealand Defense Minister. "Everyone will feel uncomfortable. Not because of memories of World War II -- most people are too young to remember it -- but because America and Great Britain, while they have made mistakes in Asia, have thought and acted globally. They pay into the system as well as take out. And so far, the Japanese have not paid in."
 
Old Disputes
New Relationships Are Elusive
 In their dealings in Asia, the Japanese have also seemed oddly hamstrung by their older cold-war habits.
Many Tokyo officials say they are embarrassed that smaller nations like South Korea managed to break free of traditional anti-Communist restraints over the last two years, forming new relationships with Russia, China and even the hard-line Communist regime in North Korea. But Japan still seems locked in its old disputes.
Its longtime territorial dispute over four northern islands, taken by the Soviet Union in the last days of World War II, has virtually frozen any prospect of anything but grudging Japanese economic aid to the former Soviet republics. Relations with China and South Korea, always on a knife's edge, are once again being colored by new charges that Japan is ducking responsibility for war atrocities -- this time by deflecting demands that it compensate Korean and Chinese women who were forced to provide sex to Japanese troops. It now appears unlikely that Emperor Akihito will take a long-expected trip to China this year, the first ever by a Japanese emperor.
Not everyone is unhappy keeping the Japanese slightly off balance in Asia.
"No matter what kind of nice face they put on it, people are still suspicious as hell of the Japanese," said K. S. Sandhu, a Malaysian who heads the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore. "The fact is that they are perfectionist about everything they do, and if they decide again to become influential politically or militarily, they will do it to a fine art."
The Japanese have their own complaints about the new era, and the chief one is that if an American comes to visit Japan these days, someone has to lock the treasury door. Though Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d chastised Japan last year for what he called its inability to break out of "checkbook diplomacy," Japanese say a check is all America really seems to want, whether the project is the liberation of Kuwait or the building of the superconducting supercollider in Texas. In each case, they complain, Japan is often excluded from the critical moments of decision.
Some fear that Japan is heading into a Faustian bargain, that a more assertive Japan will mean the abandonment of the postwar military restraints that have become the core of the country's self-image.
Many Japanese recognize, however, that their political re-engagement is now inevitable, the logical conclusion to a particularly mercantile phase of Japanese history.
"Since 1945, the whole country was directed to bringing a recovery to the Japanese economy," said Akio Tanii, the president of the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, the world's largest consumer electronics company. "We have come to the point where we are not the student any longer. We have something to teach. The problem is we don't know where to start."

HEADLINE: A Neocapitalist Basks With Reagan

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SIMI VALLEY, Calif., May 4

 BODY:
Mikhail S. Gorbachev journeyed to an easier, sunnier summit today to share super-power nostalgia with Ronald Reagan and had a word of warning about the lingering "demons" of nationalism threatening the world.
Cautioning that the evil of an "all-embracing xenophobic hatred" is contained in the new wave of "nationalist exclusiveness," the former Soviet President surveyed the world scene from the California mountainside that is the site of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. 
 "Nationalist extremism is a serious threat we face on the way to more civilized relations within and among states," Mr. Gorbachev said in accepting warm praise and the first Ronald Reagan Freedom Award from the former President.
 
The Feelings Are Mutual
 Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Reagan greeted each other as super-power retirees satisfied with their deeds but still interested in garnering some attention on the world stage.
"We were able to make a difference," Mr. Gorbachev told Mr. Reagan in summarizing the disarmament treaties and tumultuous world developments that saw the end of the cold war and the Communist empire during their years of power.
For his part, Mr. Reagan hailed Mr. Gorbachev as a man "whose shining legacy will live forever," and he urged fast approval of proposals for United States economic help to Russia and the other post-Communist republics.
"If we do not help, who will?" asked Mr. Reagan, who obviously enjoyed his duties as library host and referred several times to Mr. Gorbachev as "my friend."
Visiting some of the balmiest and most affluent California terrain, Mr. Gorbachev opened a two-week tour of the United States with an impressive lesson in fund-raising from the Reagan Library. Five hundred guests paid $5,000 each for the privilege of Mr. Gorbachev's company, with most of the funds earmarked for the library.
The fiscal details of the Gorbachev trip have not been disclosed beyond a gentle mention from United States consultants that they hope to raise up to $2 million in traversing the United States in Forbes Magazine's corporate jetliner, Capitalist Tool.
Mr. Gorbachev's scheduled speeches include an address to Congress and an appearance Wednesday at Westminster College in Fulton, Mo., where in 1946 Churchill issued his Iron Curtain warning about Soviet totalitarianism.
Mr. Gorbachev told a gathering of business and political leaders here that "blind commitment to ideology" was at the heart of the long cold war. "It is no less dangerous when ideological dogmas are replaced by the demons of nationalist exclusiveness, which so easily transform into all-embracing xenophobic hatred," he said.
Using the theme of "We the people" from the United States Constitution, the former Kremlin leader declared: "You the people -- I say this today as I address the Americans and citizens of other countries -- you were the first to reject cold-war stereotypes, the image of the enemy and automatic animosity toward the other side."
In recent interviews Mr. Gorbachev has been critical of Pentagon strategists who have asserted that the United States should be committed to policies of strategic dominance in the post-Communist world.
Down the mountainside, a dozen people picketed in behalf of the John Birch Society with signs declaring: "Socialism is not dead" and "Gorbachev -- world class criminal" and "Gorbachev to the gulag."
There were kinder words at the security-laced ceremony in the library garden, particularly for Mr. Gorbachev's wife, Raisa. She was praised by Mr. Reagan as "a wonderful representative of Russian womanhood."
 
Enter the Women, Smiling
 Mrs. Gorbachev and Nancy Reagan, well remembered for their mutual animosity in the shadow of their husbands' summit meetings, today displayed mutual friendliness in their public appearances, as they had at news photo sessions on Saturday and Sunday. "Mrs. Reagan and Mrs. Gorbachev kissed," declared the only "news" pool report on private events issued by the library; it was written by Charles Z. Wick, a devoted Reagan partisan and former head of the United States Information Agency.
Mr. Gorbachev described his reunion with Mr. Reagan as "a very emotional moment."
"Together we covered perhaps the most difficult part of the road back from the edge of the abyss that the world was facing in the early 1980's," he said.
"A high price has had to be paid for the historically necessary emancipation of the many nations living in our vast country," he said of the former Soviet domain. "We must not despair. Today the country has more free people than ever before."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
The R.V. Indicator Turns Upbeat

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
Sales of recreational vehicles, those homes on wheels that clog the nation's highways during the summers, appear to be picking up, figures compiled by the industry's trade association show. That may signal some good news for the nation's economy; many in the industry at least view R.V. sales as a reliable leading indicator.
"The pattern has held for 20-plus years," said H. Wayne Dahl, president of the Holiday Rambler unit of Harley-Davidson Inc. "Recreational vehicle sales are among the first things to fall off in a recession, and they have always led the recovery." Although Harley-Davidson is best known for its rumbling motorcycles, 25 percent of its revenues come from Holiday Rambler, which makes high-priced motor homes and other vehicles.
 
A Cyclical Business
 David Humphreys, who is president of the Recreational Vehicle Industries Association in Reston, Va., said: "We knew the industry had a history of ups and downs, but at first we didn't believe that we were a leading indicator. But Chase Economics and the University of Michigan's Consumer Research Center found that we were one of the most leading indicators they could find." 
 Part of the reason, he said, is that the purchase of an R.V. can be readily deferred. People have to buy cars and trucks eventually for basic transportation, but nobody needs an R.V. So when the economy turns down and people start worrying about their jobs, they avoid frills like an R.V. Now, with the worst of the recession evidently past, and vacation season approaching, buyers are returning to showrooms to look at products ranging from folding camp trailers starting at $4,000 to luxury cruisers costing more than $100,000.
For investors, the sales upturn offers opportunities, but most analysts are recommending a selective approach that favors the smaller companies in the industry over the bigger names like Winnebago.
The association, which represents R.V. manufacturers and their suppliers, says shipments to dealers totaled 62,100 units in the first two months of this year, an increase of 84 percent over the 33,800 shipped in the comparable 1991 period. This includes vans that have been converted to include sleeping areas, but which lack the kitchens and bathrooms of fully equipped vehicles.
The year-to-year comparison is distorted by the effects of the Persian Gulf war last year, as well as by the fact that dealers were consciously drawing down their inventories; still, it gives an indication of the turn.
Mr. Humphreys notes that with dealer inventories slim, wholesale shipments should translate quickly into retail sales. That should produce more orders for factories. R.V.'s are largely hand built, so factories can crank up production fairly quickly by adding labor.
John DeWolf, an economic forecaster who is a consultant to the association, said R.V. sales usually lead the overall economic recovery by about half a year. "They pick up about six months ahead of industrial production," he said. He attributed this year's increased sales largely to lower interest rates. Since R.V. loans can have terms as long as 15 years, interest rates are an important factor.
Mr. DeWolf is forecasting that recreational vehicle sales, excluding converted vans, will increase 12.4 percent this year, to 191,200 units, from 170,100 last year. That would still be well below the peak of 223,100 in 1988.
But the sunny outlook has not so far been extended to the stocks of the companies that make the vehicles. Most stocks in the group peaked late in March and have been drifting lower since then.
Fleetwood Enterprises, the industry leader, which was profitable all through the sales trough, hit $48 on March 20, but has since slumped below $40 and closed yesterday at $38, up 62.5 cents for the day. Winnebago Industries, once a darling of investors, has struggled up to $6.25, but yesterday it closed at $4.625, down 62.5 cents. Winnebago, unlike most of the industry, is expected to remain in the red for the rest of its fiscal year, which ends in August.
Ellen T. Horing, who follows the recreational vehicle industry for Gabelli & Company, suggests that some of the smaller companies, like Coachman Industries and the Skyline Corporation, might provide a conservative bet on the industry.
Coachman returned to profitability in the first quarter, posting earnings of 5 cents a share in contrast to a loss of 57 cents a year ago. Unlike some of the larger companies, it has held on to most of its gain from the first quarter. After peaking at $8.875 it slipped, closing yesterday at $7.625, down 50 cents. Skyline closed yesterday at $16.875, up 12.5 cents; it went as high as $18.875 in late March.

HEADLINE: Pricing Plans Shift at Hertz And Alamo

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
The Hertz Corporation, the world's largest rental-car company, expanded its new simplified pricing system yesterday to many business customers, lowering its rates in most cases. Alamo Rent A Car Inc., the fifth-largest rental-car company, quickly followed with a similar offer.
Two weeks ago, Hertz and Alamo lowered rates on rental cars used on weekends, mostly by vacation travelers. The new rates, effective today, do not require weekend use of the car and are for businesses travelers not covered by corporate rental contracts. 
 Availability is limited, and to be eligible the renter must be at least 25 years old and present a current airline ticket. About 80 percent of auto- rental customers hold airline tickets, according to industry estimates.
 
Variety of Rates
 The new Hertz rates for an advance booking of at least three days start at $24.99 a day for an economy car, and $28.99 for the same car booked as late as two hours before pickup.
Other book-ahead daily rates range from $28.99 for a subcompact to $42.99 for a full-size car, while same-day daily rates are generally $3 more in each category. On average, the lowest new economy rate is about $5 a day lower than previously, according to Joseph Russo, a Hertz spokesman. The new rate for an economy car in New York, booked the same day, is $38.99, down from $54.
The new rates will be the same for most locations, although they will be slightly lower in Florida and higher in New York, Boston, Chicago and Detroit. In the past, the same car could rent for many different prices depending on the city, and the rate would change as frequently as the old air fares did.
 
Pickup in Airline Traffic
 The latest moves by Hertz and Alamo follow similar announcements of pricing overhauls by airlines, led by American Airlines, and by the ITT Sheraton Corporation, the hotel chain. Car-rental executives said that airline traffic appears to be picking up in the wake of the airlines' new fare structure, and the new rental offers are an attempt to grab a bigger share of the expanding market.
Hertz scored a jump on its competition when it announced its new rates early yesterday, effective at its 800 corporate locations nationwide. An Alamo spokeswoman said Alamo had intended to announce its new rates later this week but accelerated its plans in the wake of Hertz's announcement.
Although the new rate structure is intended to be permanent, Hertz said, the rates are valid through June 30, after which they may be raised or lowered, as market conditions warrant. The 800 locations covered by the announcement have more than 90 percent of Hertz's fleet of 230,000 cars.
 
Alamo's New Rates
 Alamo's new rates, in effect at its 102 locations through Aug. 31, range from $26 for a one-day advance on a subcompact, or $29 if booked the same day, to $44 for a luxury car booked a day in advance, or $47 the same day.
Alamo officials described the rates announced yesterday as "phase 2 in what we hope to be a long line of phases." It introduced phase 1 on April 20, cutting its rate to $15 for compact cars, $19 for a midsize vehicle and $29 for a Cadillac Sedan de Ville -- but requiring the use of the car through a Saturday night. That strategy, Alamo officials said, was aimed at gaining market share among cost-conscious domestic travelers.
In response to that move, Hertz and Avis Inc. reduced their economy rate to $14.99 at about 100 locations, also requiring a Saturday stay-over. But Craig R. Koch, president of Hertz's North American Rent A Car division, said yesterday that the Saturday stay-over rate did not address the needs of midweek business renters not covered by corporate contracts.
 
Mileage for Frequent Fliers
 Rentals under Hertz's new structure will also earn mileage for customers enrolled in the frequent-flier programs of American, Northwest, United and USAir, as well as points in Marriott's Honored Guest Program. Alamo rentals qualify for mileage under the frequent-flier programs of Alaska Airlines, Delta and United.
Avis yesterday described the Hertz announcement as "playing catch-up," noting that for the last month it has had a program aimed at small businesses, requiring no advance booking and available even to local business people.
Mr. Russo said that Hertz had a similar program but that those programs -- unlike the simplified rate structure announced yesterday -- required signed contracts negotiated by the renter's company.

HEADLINE: RIOTS IN LOS ANGELES: The '92 Campaign;
Crisis Casts New Light on Candidates

BYLINE: By JEFFREY SCHMALZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AKRON, Ohio, May 4

 BODY:
With its rubber-processing plants and its Goodyear Boulevard and Goodyear Heights, there's no mistaking what city this is: it can only be Akron.
Yet with its mix of black and white faces, its rich and poor schools vying for dwindling money, its overall harmony in day-to-day life, it could be any small to medium-sized city in America. And like the others, it has spent the last few days moving to the rhythms of Los Angeles, one minute holding its breath, the next sighing with relief, the next trying to figure out what it all means for people here and, this being an election year, for Presidential politics. 
 "To tell you the truth, I was on the fence, leaning toward Clinton," said Earl Antibus, 72 years old. "But I think Bush handled this thing real well, real well."
Asked his opinion of Gov. Bill Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, David Eldridge, a 32-year-old pharmacist, said: "I forgot all about Clinton. Let me think for a minute."
Indeed, in three dozen interviews and chats here over two days, the opinion of Mr. Clinton was the lowest it has been in informal interviews with hundreds of voters in various parts of the country over the last three months. As always, there were reservations about Mr. Clinton's character, though no more so here than elsewhere. In part, his problem seemed to be his having been out of the mainstream of dramatic events, a spectator, not a leader.
"I've always voted Democratic, but I don't know," said Mary Sattler, who works for the Adult Literacy Council setting up computer programs. "The verdict was sad. Those four people should have been convicted. But it's not justified to have violence for the sake of violence. I don't know if Clinton is up to the job or not. He doesn't turn me on." Then she added, "I guess I shouldn't put it that way, with the adultery and all."
 
Lack of Trust
 Ms. Sattler meant that as a joke. But similar wisecracks about allegations that Mr. Clinton had an extramarital affair cropped up so often that many people seemed unable to trust him in a crisis.
"We've gone back, lost ground ever since Reagan," said Delores Campbell, who described herself as a homemaker. "We've become more divided. I'm looking at Perot. I'm not sure about Clinton. It's a big job and he's got so much to overcome."
Asked if she meant questions about the Governor's character, Mrs. Campbell replied, "Yes."
At that point, friends of Mrs. Campbell, who is black, pointed out that Mr. Clinton, being from the South, had experience with issues pertaining to blacks. "Well, that's true," she said. "That's true."
All this is not to say that Mr. Clinton was without any support in this city, whose residents will vote in a Presidential primary on June 2. Some other blacks agreed that his roots in the South were a plus, that he had a background in dealing with the problems of blacks. And some whites, disenchanted with President Bush, said Mr. Clinton was the only realistic alternative.
"I think Reagan and Bush have failed, and that leaves it up to Clinton," said W. J. Pennell, who, at 63, is retired. "I think he's put down too much. He's been Governor. He's up to it."
Race relations here in Akron, a city of 230,000 people in northeastern Ohio, have been generally good over the years. Blacks, who make up about 22 percent of the population, had few racially based complaints about the mayor and police chief, both of whom are white.
 
Some Uneasiness
 Still, there is some uneasiness among blacks. Even as rubber processing has declined with the automobile industry, Akron has managed to increase the number of job holders by 8,000. But the city, helped by the presence of the University of Akron, has done so primarily in high-technology and office jobs, where those with less education often cannot compete.
White people here, asked about the 1992 election, tended to shake their heads and say with a cavalier shrug that there is no one they like. But blacks were not cavalier at all, often working themselves into anger when answering the question, believing that there was no one -- no one -- who was going to make a difference for American blacks.
"The only thing America understands is violence and money," said Anthony R. Hudson, 30, a black man who works with the Ohio University Young Scholars program. "We live in a government, not a democracy. The media tells us which candidates are acceptable for us to choose from. They won't even let us hear all of them. None of the candidates are going to do anything about the problems of blacks. Not Bush, that's for sure. Not Clinton. Not Perot. I don't know what we can do."
For many people of Akron, black and white, the last few days have been the same: sitting transfixed by television images of beatings and burning buildings, running to call friends and family members in California, listening to Sunday sermons for calm. Almost universally, the not-guilty verdict was condemned here. The empathy of whites for how their black neighbors must feel seemed genuine.
"I spent an hour talking about it with my class," said Mary Anne Drobnak, 58, a fifth-grade teacher, who laughed at herself for driving around, not on, streets in black neighborhoods immediately after the verdict, though no violence broke out here. "The verdict was so unfair. It was all I could do to keep from crying."
 
'The Right Tone'
 But also universally, the looting and particularly the violent attacks were also condemned as unjustified. While Mr. Bush was criticized for not doing enough to build housing and create jobs, that fight can come another day. For now, the top priority of most whites and many blacks here is restoring law and order in Los Angeles, and Mr. Bush got high points, indeed, for his Friday night address to the nation.
"I think Bush struck the right tone," said Lori Dinkins, 31, a black woman who works on a word processor. "There's no excuse for beating innocent people."
In a pastoral letter, the Rev. Ronald J. Fowler, pastor of the Arlington Church of God, a black church here, called for tax incentives for businesses to hire and train marginally skilled people. He also called for requiring public employees to receive multicultural training.
"Bush's speech was a good one, maybe a day late and a dollar short, but a good one," Mr. Fowler said. "He's right. We cannot let lawlessness prevail. But let's see what he and the party platform say on domestic issues and what they will do to help those who are marginalized economically. That's the big problem for the country. That's what will sway my vote."

Fowler, pastor of the Arlington Church of God, a black church in Akron, Ohio; "To tell you the truth, I was on the fence, leaning toward Clinton," said Earl Antibus.

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
The Attack of the 8-Legged Vampires of Doom!

BYLINE: By Andrew H. Malcolm

DATELINE: EASTON, Conn.

 BODY:
THIS is $ weep$ month for television, that vital time when someone somehow counts how many people watch which show.
Coincidentally, sweeps month happens to be when TV uncovers the hottest, sexiest, scariest stories of the year, the ones about women stealing their sisters' husbands, engagement-ring ripoffs, supermarket scams, sex after 60 and how your dinner plates just might be poisoning the children tonight. 
 Coincidentally, Our Towns today has uncovered a dangerous suburban health situation that could strike your family without warning. Reader discretion is advised:
TICKS! They're back! And they could be sucking your blood right now. (Insert here film of hectic hospital emergency room.)
On the surface, bucolic Fairfield County seems an unlikely setting for a reign of terror by a plague of insects. (Pan across scenic woods and tidy homes, then zoom in on a toppled tricycle.) But few homeowners dare walk their pricey property this spring for fear of this creature. (Get a file photo of a tick. How big are they anyway? A poppyseed? O.K., blow up the tick pic. He should fill the entire screen. Can you make all eight legs wiggle? Then we'll cut to Dolly Curtis in her garden.)
Dolly Curtis is a TV producer. She never saw the voracious insect that ate part of her foot. "I never saw it." (Cut to Kirby Stafford.)
Kirby Stafford is a state scientist studying the tick crisis: "They begin to move every May. Last year was bad. Each female lays up to 2,500 eggs." (Quick cutaway to the forest and back.) "The ticks hang on leaves to grab passing creatures. They crawl up and burrow in. Their mouths secrete a cement to hold on. They suck for days. You never feel the bite." (We won't use any scientific stuff about bacteria, ticks in colonial times and only one tick in five actually carrying Lyme disease. What was it, 4,000 Lyme cases a year in New York and Connecticut?)
Every year thousands of people contract Lyme disease with its chronic fatigue, inflamed joints and flu-like pains. (Mrs. Curtis again.) "My foot was swollen for weeks."
Lyme disease wasn't discovered until 1975 here in Connecticut. Now these diseased ticks are spreading. (Map of the United States shows Wisconsin, Minnesota and the top of Illinois growing dark.) Any mammal in the woods can carry diseased ticks. Even household pets. (Curtis.) "Everyone in Connecticut is at risk."
Early diagnosis of Lyme disease is crucial. One telltale clue: a red circle around the bite. But thousands of Lyme victims may be misdiagnosed by inattentive doctors. (Tomorrow, we'll cover the run on doctors' offices.)
Now, in the face of immense official inaction, Lyme disease victims are organizing. (Curtis again.) "One day I noticed how many neighbors on the same street were sick -- Joy Haller, Barbara Paolini, John Stanczyk, his son, his grandson and his sister. They said, 'Dolly, you should get a support group started.' So I did."
The group meets every few weeks at the Congregational Church hall to exchange sympathy, share stories and hear experts. Attendance is mounting. The next session is May 11. Josephine Kusnierczak attends every one. "It's scary," she says. "I love to garden. Next thing my leg is red and swelling. At first, they didn't know what it was. Then I took antibiotics for weeks. I still tire easily. And I don't sit outside anymore. You worry where these little guys are all the time."
(Cut to John Stanczyk.) "This'll be another bad year. I've taken four ticks off the dog already."
The economic impact of the tick plague may be severe. Not one Japanese tourist bus has visited this tiny rural community since the infestation began. The nearby headquarters of the giant General Electric Company keeps 24-hour guards at the gate, still. And companies across the state have laid off thousands in recent years. Given current government budget problems, any immediate remedy seems unlikely.
One thing is certain though: One solution to this seriously major suburban problem would be to kill every mouse in Connecticut. Also all the deer and every bird that ever touches the ground. Then remove every tree, bush and blade of grass and all the stone walls. Seal the border with New York. Burn every hint of leaf litter and send people in moon suits to spray the entire landscape with lethal insecticides with a half-life equal to the average copy of National Geographic.
An alternative would be for people to wear bug repellent and long pants in the woods.
(Great, great, but drop that last sentence. It's misleadingly simple. We might lose viewers for the Deadly Diets segment.)

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: On the Issues;
Perot Tells Money Managers How to Fix U.S. Education

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO, May 4

 BODY:
For nearly a decade, Ross Perot has linked what he believes are the nation's lax schooling standards with America's eroding strength in global industrial competition.
And in a speech on those issues here today before a national convention of professional money managers, Mr. Perot provided a preview of how his blunt assessments of America's troubles, blended with pledges of quick action and a rapid-fire Texas humor, might sound if he decides to run as an independent candidate for President. 
 "We spend $400 billion a year on education, including college, so we are buying a first-class ticket," the billionaire Texas businessman said. "But we are not getting first-class results."
In the Depression, he said, the biggest problems with students in schools were talking in class, chewing gum, making noise, running in the halls and not putting paper in the waste basket. The troubles today are drug abuse, alcohol abuse, pregnancy, suicide, rape, robbery and assault.
 
'Talking About Reality'
 "You say, 'All right, gee, we don't want this guy in the White House,' " Mr. Perot said. " 'He's talking about reality.' If you don't want reality, you don't want me there. I could give you a whole list of reasons not to vote for me."
Alluding to his dark view of school life in America today, and the lagging performance of students compared with those in other industrialized nations, he said, "If you can live with this, you don't want me around."
Mr. Perot, who led a statewide campaign in 1983-84 to improve management of public schools in Texas, described in his remarks an effort that has generally been credited with improved standards for teachers and students in the state.
He said that 36 percent of Texas adults are not high school graduates, 63 percent of mothers receiving Federal Aid for Dependent Children do not have high school diplomas, "and here's the really sad one," 85 percent of the inmates in Texas prisons are high school dropouts.
"It costs more to send a young man to prison than to go to Harvard," he said. Early-childhood programs that develop self-esteem and encourage learning in children were the best investment the nation can make in education, he said.
 
Economic Concerns
 "We've got to build early childhood development centers," he said. "They work. They are the most cost-effective thing you can do."
Referring to children in economically depressed and crime-ridden areas, he said, "If you don't love them, if you don't care about them and you have no other reason to do it, just do it for hard-headed business reasons. You are providing a future taxpayer."
Organizers of the conference here said that Mr. Perot was invited to speak several months ago to the gathering of the Association of Investment Management and Research because of his efforts on behalf of Texas public schools. The speech before 800 people, who gave Mr. Perot enthusiastic applause when he finished, was not listed as a campaign event by Mr. Perot's staff.
John D. Messner, partner in a San Diego money management firm, Meridian Capital, said after the speech that Mr. Perot had the makings of a serious threat to President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton.
"He struck a chord -- education is important to everyone," Mr. Messner said. "Perot is saying some of the same things as Paul Tsongas."

HEADLINE: RIOTS IN LOS ANGELES: The Democrats;
Clinton Tours City's Damaged Areas and Chides Bush

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 4

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton inspected the devastation of South-Central Los Angeles today and sparred with the Bush Administration over political responsibility for the riots in America's second-largest city.
The long-distance exchange with Administration officials in Washington illustrated the potential risks and benefits of Mr. Clinton's effort to use the riots as evidence of what he describes as President Bush's neglect of race relations, urban problems and domestic social policy in general. 
 Over the weekend, Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, complained that Mr. Clinton, the likely Democratic Presidential nominee, had exploited the riots for political gain. Mr. Kemp said the Arkansas Governor had "stooped to partisan demagoguery" by "accusing President Bush and the Republican Party of helping cause the riots."
And today the Administration instead attributed to the disturbances in Los Angeles in part to liberal policies adopted after the riots of the 1960's. "We believe that many of the root problems that have resulted in inner-city difficulties were started in the 60's and 70's, and that they have failed," said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman.
Surrounded by dozens of photographers and journalists, Mr. Clinton walked the streets of the South-Central area and Koreatown and inspected the damage: smoky rubble, ashes, twisted metal and shards of glass where dozens of thriving restaurants and stores once stood.
The Arkansas Governor said he was astonished by Mr. Kemp's criticism but "not particularly concerned about it." Mr. Kemp himself has prodded the White House to show more interest in poverty and the "underclass," the people living outside the mainstream of American society.
Taking note of that, Mr. Clinton said today: "Jack Kemp has been the most critical member of the Cabinet on President Bush's inaction. My guess is that he got some heat for being so critical of the President, and he was just trying to make up some political ground on the home court."
Indeed, as Mr. Clinton noted, he and Mr. Kemp have much in common. Both assert that government programs alone cannot solve deep-rooted social problems and say that poor people must shun welfare and take responsibility for their own lives.
"The key to any long-term progress is the economic and political empowerment of the people who are most disadvantaged," Mr. Clinton said as he paused in a tour of Vermont Avenue, one of the streets most damaged by the riots.
 
Uncharacterisic Caution
 Otherwise, Mr. Clinton, who is usually full of self-confidence, seemed uncharacteristically cautious today in his remarks on the rioting. While seizing an opportunity to underline the differences between himself and the President, Mr. Clinton evidently also realized that he would be vulnerable to criticism if he made simplistic comments blaming Mr. Bush for the problems here.
Mr. Clinton said, "I hope my trip here will play a constructive role in trying to rebuild Los Angeles and rebuild America." He said his meetings with black, Hispanic and Korean Americans had given him many ideas for actions that the Government could take to aid in reconstruction.
Mr. Clinton listed several steps he would take, if President, to help poor residents of Los Angeles and other cities. The money saved from cuts in military spending should be invested in construction of housing, streets and bridges and water and sewer systems, he said. In addition, he said, the Federal minimum wage, now at $4.25 an hour, should be automatically increased each year to keep pace with inflation. And he said Los Angeles should train its residents for construction jobs and other work for use in rebuilding the city.
"It is imperative that we have an economic expansion agenda from the national Government, that we increase investment in our cities and our infrastructure, that we do what we can to stimulate redevelopment of businesses in this area of Los Angeles, businesses that could be owned by all ethnic groups," the Governor said.
Mr. Clinton said local leaders told him they did not want a repetition of the events after the riots in the city's Watts section in 1965, "when somebody came up with a grandiose plan and then everybody forgot about it." It is essential for community leaders to be involved in drafting the reconstruction plan, he said, because "people want to be empowered to control their own destiny."
Mr. Clinton, who surveyed the damage with Representative Maxine Waters, the local Congresswoman, said he had no concern that he or other Democratic candidates would suffer by association with the rioters who tore up wide areas of this city after the acquittal last week of four white Los Angeles policemen in the beating of a black motorist. "I have a good law-and-order record," Mr. Clinton said.
Asked what he would do as President to prevent such civil unrest, Mr. Clinton said: "What you have got to do is to provide real hope and economic opportunity, and then set an example for one another. When something like this happens, it obviously means that a lot of people feel they are not part of the common community."
Residents of the riot area welcomed Mr. Clinton's visit. "It's a good thing he gets to see first-hand how this community has been affected by the revolt and the anger over the jury decision" to acquit the police officers, said Margaret Bush-Ware, executive director of Youth Opportunities Unlimited, a job training program in South-Central Los Angeles.
Mr. Bush, who dispatched Federal troops and law-enforcement officers to the Los Angeles area on Friday, plans to visit the city on Thursday as part of a previously scheduled trip to California.

HEADLINE: Revival on Broadway Is Broadway;
Theater District Businesses Give the Season Rave Reviews

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
In a parking lot on West 46th Street, the measure of Broadway's success often comes down to this: At what time can Frank Gonzalez play chess?
With remarkable speed and even more remarkable dexterity, five guys -- none named Moe -- wheel the BMW's, Mercedes-Benzes and Lincoln Continentals of harried theatergoers into spaces prudent drivers might consider best suited for Volkswagens. 
 When the lot is filled, Mr. Gonzalez, the lot manager, settles into his white clapboard booth for his nightly chess game with his employees. If he starts by 7:30,he knows the theaters are doing well.
These days, he's playing at 7 o'clock. And all Broadway is smiling.
"Good? Things are very good," said Mr. Gonzalez. "In the 12 years I've been here, I've never seen so many shows open all at the same time."
As surely as producers live or die on reviews, Mr. Gonzalez's Restaurant Row parking lot -- like scores of midtown restaurants, hotels and gift shops -- thrives or busts on Broadway's ticket sales. Stories from the businesses say a lot about the health of one of New York's most vital areas. This spring, after a grim year of darkened marquees and empty seats, the sales are booming. In April, Broadway attracted more than 830,000 theatergoers and the box-office receipts, $30.1 million, were the highest of any four-week total in New York theater history, according to the League of American Theaters and Producers.
George Wachtel, director of research for the league, projects that by the end of the season on May 31, Broadway will have generated $562 million in economic activity for midtown, $45 million above last season.
With 28 productions at the end of April, seven more than in the same period last year, the Great White Way has the hurly-burly feel of a gold-rush boomtown once more. Cafes are bustling, restaurant reservations are up and armadas of limousines are again commandeering entire blocks outside theaters.
"There seems to be so much more going on," said Jon Dietrich, a salesman at One Shubert Alley, the theatrical gift shop off West 45th Street. "Everyone who comes in these days is filled with excitement. It's in the air. And it keeps us all up."
 
The Electricity Factor
 The message on the chalkboard inside Sam's restaurant on West 45th Street told the whole story: "Falsettos -- break a leg. Love, Sam."
It was opening night for the musical at the John Golden Theater across the street, and the restaurant workers, most of them actors themselves, were waiting in tense anticipation for the newspaper reviews.
When the first editions arrived at 10 P.M., Craig Dawson, a waiter, ripped to the review, read for a moment, and then sighed. In relief. A rave.
"With ticket prices the way they are, people won't buy until a play is considered a sure-fire success," said Mr. Dawson, 41 years old. "We're so dependent on the street, we have to keep our finger to the pulse of the business."
The owner, Sam Sapienza, said the pulse was throbbing.
Mr. Sapienza, whose father opened the restaurant as a speakeasy in 1929, likes to measure the block's vigor by its electrical use. Last year, with three theaters closed, was a low-watt year. Not as dark as the dire year of 1975, when a musicians' strike closed nine theaters and wiped out some of his restaurateur friends. But dim.
This year, West 45th Street's seven theaters are all open, including the Imperial, where "Les Miserables" has been a money-making fixture.
"The lights are up," the 62-year-old owner said. "And when the lights are up, everybody's alive."
 
In Front of 'Streetcar'
 As the sun set below a pale blue sky, Frank Gonzalez had his workers in high gear, gunning cars in reverse, swerving down narrow parking lanes, briskly attending to the growing line of customers.
Mr. Gonzalez, a 40-year-old resident of Jackson Heights, Queens, orchestrated this operation like an an air-traffic controller, packing his 50-foot by 25-foot lot as tightly as a sardine can.
"What play?" he asked a woman as she pulled her white Toyota into the lot entrance.
"Two Trains something," she replied.
" 'Two Trains Running,' " Mr. Gonzalez says. "About 10:30."
Then, turning to a worker, he shouted, "Two Trains, el blanco," and the car was backed into the middle of the pack, somewhere behind "Falsettos" but well in front of "A Streetcar Named Desire."
By 7:10 about eight spaces remained vacant and Mr. Gonzalez conceded that this was a slow night, by boomtown standards. But with a sudden spurt of activity, Mr. Gonzalez was positioning pawns by 7:30.
He lost the chess game, but took it philosophically. "You can't win them all," he said. "At least business is good."
 
'No Mascara Left'
 It was 10:38 P.M., so the two women eyeing the mugs and t-shirts at One Shubert Alley must have just left "The Secret Garden."
"How was it?" asked Mr. Dietrich, the salesmen.
"I've got no mascara left," said a still teary-eyed Linda Golderg as she dug deep into her purse to pay for the musical's taped soundtrack. "I just love to cry."
Nestled between the Booth and Shubert theaters, the tiny gift store, with its knickknacks and music boxes and soundtracks, is a good barometer of tourism's economic, and emotional, health.
For Ms. Goldberg, 38, a self-proclaimed "I hate New York person" from Baltimore, Broadway offered an escape from a city she expected to be unwelcoming.
A manager with Baltimore Gas and Electric, she was attending a conference on labor relations. Asked to introduce herself, she leapt to her feet and announced: "One of my skills is that I can remember the lyrics of every song I hear and I'm looking for someone to go to the theater with."
At which point Janet Courtemanche, 43, from Boston, leapt to her feet and said: "That's me!"
So there they were, two women crying their eyes out at "The Secret Garden," cementing a friendship. "New York, New York," said Ms. Goldberg. "It's an amazing town."
 
No Answers, but Sales
 Among the theatergoers rushing from parking lots and restaurants to curtain time on a recent evening, questions seemed to outpace explanations for Broadway's revival. Had long-dormant theater lovers loosened their wallets because they believed the recession was over? Was the ticket-buying surge a result of better productions, more popular revivals, or just more tourists?
Could it be, as David Letterman recently suggested, the naked ushers?
It was Jessica Lange's star power that brought David Breault, a visitor from Tallahassee, Fla., to the Barrymore Theater and "A Streetcar Named Desire" on a recent night.
"I thought it would be cool to see her," he said with a tug at his studded black-leather jacket. Unfortunately, his discount ticket placed him somewhat closer to the ozone layer than the orchestra pit. "It seemed like a good performance," he reflected. "It would have been nice if we could have seen her expressions."
For Lurana Amis, like many New Yorkers, the question of whether to plunk down big money for seats hinged as much on economic as aesthetic issues.
For five years, the Bronx resident has gone to plays with a group of friends at least twice a month, spending, she said, about $30 each night. But over the past year, "nameless fears" about layoffs and recession have almost kept her away several times. Almost.
"I didn't want to come tonight," Ms. Amis, 53, who teaches French at the Horace Mann School in the Bronx, said as she walked to "Two Trains Running." She had heard the play was depressing. A friend had canceled. But here she was. "I know that by 11 o'clock, I'll be happy," she said.

GRAPHIC: Photos: There are many measures to gauge the success of Broadway, but regardless of the micrometer used, there is no doubt sales are booming. Outside the Music Box, theatergoers gathered to see the new hit "A Small Family Business."; One measure used to review Broadway's health is finding out what time Frank Gonzalez, above, a parking lot manager, has begun his chess game. The earlier he makes his opening pawn move, the sooner theatergoers have filled his lot on West 46th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues. (Photographs by Andrea Mohin/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: With Pot of Fiscal Gold, Proposals for Mining It

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
In preparation for the fiscal year that begins July 1, the Dinkins administration is seeking various forms of financial help from the Municipal Assistance Corporation.
The state-run corporation was set up to borrow money for New York City during the city's fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's by issuing bonds that are backed by city sales-tax revenues. 
 Bonds that the corporation issues on the city's behalf receive a better interest rate than the city could obtain on its own because the corporation has a better credit rating. The corporation's credit rating is better because it has first lien on the city's tax revenues and greater flexibility in repaying its debt.
The city has proposed three ways of obtaining money through the assistance corporation:
 
Mirror Bonds
 At one point this year, the city planned to borrow hundreds of millions of dollars through mirror bonds to close billions of dollars of budget gaps over the next four years.
Under the plan, the city would have sold its own bonds and used the proceeds to buy back old notes that M.A.C. holds.
The assistance corporation could have then used that money from the city to pay the interest on its own outstanding corporation bonds, freeing some sales tax revenues that the city would normally pay toward retiring the M.A.C. bonds.
The Dinkins administration had planned to use $250 million worth of mirror bonds to help balance the budget for the 1993 fiscal year, but Mayor David N. Dinkins said last week that a large budget surplus would allow the city to avoid the borrowing. Bond raters had warned that such borrowing would lower the city's credit rating. The city still plans to use $300 million in mirror-bond financing to balance its budget in the 1994 fiscal year.
 
Cash Surpluses
 The assistance corporation has generated a $300 million cash surplus by refinancing its bonds to take advantage of lower interest rates. In February, the corporation promised to give the city $100 million of the surplus.
That money has been used to close budget gaps. Aides to Mayor Dinkins have said that he wants to use the remaining $200 million as a bargaining chip with municipal labor unions in exchange for getting improved worker productivity. But Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez and the City Council want to spend that surplus on the schools.
 
Bonds for Capital Projects
 Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, has proposed a joint financing arrangement to issue bonds with the city that would allow the administration to restore up to $600 million in proposed cuts to the capital budget without increasing the city's overall cost of borrowing.
Mr. Rohatyn has said that he wants the money to be spent for school-construction programs.
The City Council wants to take advantage of Mr. Rohatyn's offer and to have the city borrow $400 million through the assistance corporation to finance school rebuilding.
But aides to Mr. Dinkins said yesterday that they were not convinced that the corporation could do that without increasing the city's overall cost of borrowing for capital projects, which is expected to account for more than 20 percent of every city tax dollar by 1996.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Is Pressed to Use M.A.C. Money on Schools

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Pressure increased on Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday to support a plan for committing hundreds of millions of dollars in Municipal Assistance Corporation money to the public schools as the City Council joined Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez in endorsing similar plans.
But the administration held its ground as mayoral aides said that the city could not afford to borrow more through the corporation and that any M.A.C. surplus should be used as a bargaining chip in trading raises for a smaller city work force. 
 The Council proposed spending $500 million in assistance corporation money to expand computer education, upgrade school libraries and restore $200 million in capital spending cuts for school construction. Under the plan, $100 million would come from a $200 million surplus that the assistance corporation has generated by refinancing its bonds at lower interest rates and $400 million would come from new M.A.C. borrowing.
 
'Good News'
 Aides to Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone said they have been working on the proposal since March and had discussed it with the Governor and Schools Chancellor, who last week announced a similar plan.
James Vlasto, a spokesman for the Schools Chancellor, said: "We are delighted by the endorsement of the Council to make education a major priority in this budget. It appears they are doing just that and coming on the heels of Governor Cuomo's announcement Friday, it is good news."
The Council's call for the administration to commit itself to using assistance corporation money for schools sets the stage for the first major battle over the Mayor's proposed budget for the 1993 fiscal year, which begins on July 1.
While Mr. Dinkins proposes the city's budget, it is subject to the approval of the Council. At the same time, the chairman of the assistance corporation, appointed by the Governor, has considerable influence over the city's finances. As pressure mounts for the Mayor to use the M.A.C. money for education, he is finding himself increasingly isolated on the issue.
Felix G. Rohatyn, the financier who is chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, has indicated that he would like the money to go toward education programs, but he has not set that as a condition for the city's receiving it. Mr. Rohatyn was traveling abroad yesterday and could not be reached for comment.
 
Presented to Rohatyn
 Mr. Vallone said yesterday that he had presented the Council's proposal to Mr. Rohatyn last week and that Mr. Rohatyn was very warm to it. In fact, Mr. Vallone seemed convinced that the Mayor would eventually give in.
Mr. Vallone, when asked if he had discussed the plan with the Dinkins administration, said, "I think we are all in agreement on this."
But First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel said that while the administration was still studying the Council's proposal, many of the plan's education programs were not consistent with the Mayor's goal of using the surplus assistance corporation money to streamline government, possibly through actions like early retirement and automation.
 
'Vitally Important'
 "Everyone recognizes that education is vitally important, but we have to balance the needs of schools against the overall financial requirements of the city," Mr. Steisel said.
Shrinking the city's work force will bring large savings that Dinkins administration could use to finance raises for the city's municipal labor unions, almost all of which are without a contract. But Mr. Dinkins has said there will be no raises without increases in productivity.
Under the Council's proposal, $30 million would be spent to renovate library space and buy new books, $142 million for school computer labs, $200 million to build new schools, $20 million for special education, $16 million for basic school supplies, and $75 million for school maintenance to repair broken boilers, leaky roofs and boarded windows.

HEADLINE: The Growing Business of Helping Things Grow

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J., May 4

 BODY:
It is springtime, and nature must once again be made to behave.
No riot of chickweed, henbit or dandelion may on the lawn appear. No bag worm in the spruce or arborvitae, no leaf miners in the birch nor lace bugs in the azaleas are allowed. These and other signs of nature taking its course, especially including tall, unkempt grass, are subdued by determined homeowners backed by an army of lawn and garden maintenance workers now deep in their annual routine of mulching, feeding, mowing, pruning, poisoning, aerating and de-thatching until each flower and fruit, each blade and leaf are in their right order. 
 "It's a constant battle to stay on top of nature, because nature is always trying to come back," said Josephine Peiser, whose two-acre garden in Princeton is a showcase of flowers and plantings.
Along with her own labor, Mrs. Peiser calls upon that of Bill Turner, the owner of Princeton Gardeners, one of hundreds of lawn and garden services that help take some of the work out of working the soil.
 
Two Kinds of Clients
 According to figures kept by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and Energy, the number of commercial garden services holding permits for applying garden chemicals has more than doubled with the growth of the New Jersey suburbs, from 1,700 in 1979 to 3,500 in 1990.
"I didn't know when I was a freshman in college that I was going to end up in this business," Mr. Turner commented. "But they made me take a course in agricultural sciences and one in horticulture, and I found out I liked it."
Now, with a bachelor of science degree in ornamental horticulture from Delaware Valley College in Doylestown, Pa., Mr. Turner employs 10 people to serve nearly 400 customers in central New Jersey, "doing everything outside the house but wash the windows."
Not surprisingly, while New Jersey's economy was busily adding jobs in technology, health care, real estate and financial services during the decade, employment was also growing sharply in agriculture, where the number of jobs rose by 16,000 between 1980 and 1990 on the strength of demand from homeowners for help in keeping the lawn mowed and the red bugs out of the yews.
"The people who hire a lawn service come in two groups," said Bob Olszack, owner of Nassau Lawn and Garden Service, also of Princeton. "There are the people who are just so busy they want someone to keep the grass cut and that's about it, and there are the ones who want you to give them a garden that looks like it came out of a gardening magazine."
 
A Rake, a Mower, a Business
 Ten years ago, Mr. Olszack planned to become a commercial airline pilot, but airline deregulation made employment there less dependable than the turning of the seasons and the yearly renewal of the war on crabgrass and clover.
Like their customers, lawn services seem to break into two groups -- the licensed, perhaps even specially trained garden experts with crews of a dozen or more and someone to answer the phone, and the far larger category of freelance gardeners and leaf sweepers who threw the lawnmower in the back of a pickup, had some cards printed and went into business.
"The fly-by-nights don't have to pay for licensing or fees," said Mr. Turner. "Most of them don't have insurance or anything. State law says if you have a commercial truck you have to have your name on the door, but some of those guys are impossible to identify."
But Willie Smith, a laid-off Trenton factory worker who put himself in business mowing grass in the summer and raking leaves in the fall, argued that there was room in a growth field for the small fry.
"Those guys charge $30 an hour, and I charge $10," he said, leaning on his black Ford with the rakes and shovels standing like pennants in their racks. "They buy their fertilizer at the same place I do, and then they raise the price of it for their customers. So there's a lot of old people that I go to who can't afford to pay what the big boys charge."
A typical lawn is 15,000 square feet and requires five fertilizer treatments a year at about $70 each, Mr. Turner said. Along with mowing and some tree pruning, the annual cost typically runs to more than $1,000. It can go as high as the $8,000 Mrs. Peiser calculated she and her husband spent maintaining their cultivated two-acre garden.
"There are some people who just have the men come in their trucks to mow the lawn, but clearly it needs more than that," she said of her yard. "I think that if all we did was cut the grass, it would all look rather sad."
Lately there has been a lot of interest in organic fertilizers, composed mainly of "tankage," which is the bone meal and anything else left over from cattle slaughter. But organic fertilizer costs twice as much as the chemical variety, Mr. Turner said, and does not include weed killers.
"People ask about it," he said, "but when I tell them that they'll have to pay $30 an hour for one of my men to pull weeds by hand, they forget it."
As it is, Americans put as much fertilizer on lawns, golf courses and cemeteries as the third world uses for growing food, said Beverly Eliot, who runs the Lawn Institute, a nonprofit research farm near Memphis.
"I know that could be made to sound negative, but it should not be seen that way," she said. "Lawns are the frames for your house, they give it curb appeal and raise values. They are excellent guards against erosion; they help keep ground water clean by holding and absorbing runoff. And they're soft, so they help prevent injuries. Just ask football players if they would rather play on artificial turf or natural grass."

HEADLINE: Sweden Agrees to Let Volvo Raise Its Stake in Procordia

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Volvo A.B. reached agreement yesterday with the Swedish Government over the auto maker's links with Procordia A.B., saying it would increase its stake in Procordia but would not merge with the food and drugs company.
The pact appears to end a three-month standoff between Volvo and the Swedish Government, which began on Jan. 25 when Volvo and Procordia announced plans to merge. If completed, the merger -- an exchange of shares valued at $6.6 billion -- would have been one of Europe's largest. 
 Under the terms of yesterday's compromise, Volvo will become the dominant shareholder of Procordia, and the Government will reduce its stake. The deal will increase Volvo's voting stake in Procordia to 45 percent, from about 42.7 percent, and cut the Government's holding to 40.4 percent, from 42.7 percent.
In addition, the Government said it planned to sell its remaining Procordia shares, preferably to a large number of investors in Sweden and abroad. But if the Government does arrange to sell off more than 5 percent of the total shares to any individual buyer or group, Volvo will have the right of first refusal on the sale.
As a consequence, Volvo could eventually acquire all of Procordia.
For the center-right Government of Prime Minister Carl Bildt, the deal allows it to pursue its goal of selling off Government stakes of Swedish companies while protecting the interests of taxpayers, who are effectively Procordia shareholders. The Government had objected to the proposed Volvo-Procordia merger, saying the complex stock-swap favored Volvo shareholders to the detriment of Procordia holders, a view shared by most securities analysts.
Moreover, Government critics of the merger plan said it had little industrial logic, besides giving Volvo access to the healthy cash flow from Procordia's eclectic stable of businesses, ranging from Nicorette, a gum to help people quit smoking, to its Pinkerton Tobacco subsidiary in America, which markets Red Man chewing tobacco. In the 12 months that ended in September, Procordia earned $545.5 million before taxes on sales of $6.51 billion.
For its part, Volvo wanted access to Procordia's cash to help it ride out the rough cycles in the car and truck business. But Volvo also argued that it would assist Procordia financially during the upswings in the auto market and that Volvo's global contacts would ease Procordia's way into foreign markets.
"We wanted the whole deal, and the Government said no," said Tomas Ericson, a vice president of the Volvo North America Corporation. "But this is an agreement that both parties are happy with."
Volvo, a small-scale producer, is considered one of Europe's less efficient car makers. It has also had to contend with recessions in its three main markets -- the United States, Britain and Sweden -- as well as tougher competition in Europe from Japanese car makers.
Last year, Volvo had an operating loss of 1.17 billion crowns ($210.7 million) on revenue of 77.22 billion crowns ($13.93 billion).
The link with Procordia has been one step in Volvo's effort to cope with the financial strain of an increasingly competitive global auto market. The other more significant step has been Volvo's integration with the French state-run auto maker, Renault S.A.
Volvo holds a 20 percent stake in Renault; the French Government holds 80 percent of the shares.
Volvo said last week that its alliance with Renault would mean annual savings of 4 billion crowns ($666 million) by the late 1990's, roughly twice the previous estimates of cost savings.
"There is only one direction, toward tighter cooperation," Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's chairman, said at the company's annual meeting last week.

HEADLINE: Fernandez, Citing Los Angeles, Urges a School 'Marshall Plan'

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez yesterday called for an "educational Marshall Plan" to rebuild and recharge the nation's decaying urban schools, arguing that a small investment in Los Angeles's classrooms might have averted the losses in life and property left by the rioting last week.
In making his appeal, at a hearing in the Bronx, the Chancellor joined other political leaders yesterday who invoked the bitter lessons of Los Angeles to buttress the case for some programs they have long sought. 
 Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, for example, mentioned the turmoil in Los Angeles at a news conference in Albany yesterday to renew his call for a residency law that would require police officers, firefighters and all other uniformed workers hired in the future in New York City to be city residents.
"When I grew up in New York City, the public servants who protected us, taught us and cared for us in the clinics lived in the same city with us," Mr. Cuomo said. The residency law, he said, would increase the chances "that your public servants would reflect the population they serve."
 
'Options for Young People'
 And Mayor David N. Dinkins, without mentioning Los Angeles specifically, seemed to allude to the rioting by urging government to "provide options for young people" so that they do not feel "a desire to turn to violence." He also renewed his call for stricter Federal laws to control guns.
Mr. Fernandez and Mayor Dinkins made their remarks in testifying before a hearing on school violence that was held by Representative Jose E. Serrano of the Bronx. Mr. Serrano has sponsored a bill that would provide $100 million a year for three years to selected schools for buying metal detectors to screen for weapons and starting programs that help youngsters settle conflicts peacefully.
While expressing his support, Mr. Fernandez said that metal detectors would not solve the underlying despair that led to the Los Angeles rioting. He argued that too many young people see moldering school buildings, "battle fatigued" teachers, overcrowded classrooms, outdated textbooks and too few extracurricular activities and come to believe that the system does not care about them.
His remarks seemed to have a particular pungency in the dingy faded auditorium of James Monroe High School in the east Bronx, where the hearing was held.
 
Words Aimed at Washington
 While Mr. Fernandez is battling against cuts in the city's school budget, he principally aimed his message at the deeper pockets of the Federal Government. It was not the first time that he has used the metaphor of the Marshall Plan, the vast United States effort that was proposed by Secretary of State George C. Marshall to rebuild the economies of Europe after the devastation of World War II. But the remark seemed to have special significance to an audience for whom the television pictures of the churning fires of Los Angeles's storefronts were still vivid.
The Federal Government, he recalled, managed to find tens of billions of dollars quickly to bail out the savings and loan industry and tens of billions of dollars to wage the war against Iraq.
The United States, he said, must come up with similar determination and financing to rebuild the nation's schools so that students do not have "to attend schools that look like this."
"If those things don't happen, we'll lose that generation that you see out there," he told the panel as an audience of Monroe's students listened.
Long wary about metal detectors, Mr. Fernandez said that heightened security measures alone would not stop violence.
"What resolves the problem is getting rid of the frustration our kids have," he said.

HEADLINE: Dow Soars 42.04 to Hit New High

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON Jr.

 BODY:
Stocks surged yesterday, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average to another record, as Wall Street welcomed the return of calm in Los Angeles and the return of investors, who fled on Friday, back into the stock market.
The Dow gained 42.04 points, closing at 3,378.13, surpassing the previous record of 3,366.50, set on April 16. It marked the 18th time since Jan. 1 that the Dow bettered its previous high, a streak of advances that has fed on the seemingly endless procession of hints -- without outright confirmation -- that an economic recovery has begun. 
 The Dow soared more than 30 points in the opening hour of trading, and floated easily in record terrain for the rest of the day, reaching above 3,390 in the early afternoon. Other indexes also advanced strongly, although none broke a record.
 
'Big Sigh of Relief'
 "There was a big sigh of relief," said Robert Walberg, an analyst at MMS International, referring to the market's reaction to the peace that has descended on Los Angeles, in contrast with the dangerously uncertain situation when the market closed on Friday afternoon. "Everybody came back in early, and that gave us a nice pop."
Hugh Johnson, chief investment strategist at the First Albany Corporation, argued that an even greater factor in the market's advance was the realization by many investors, after some faintly positive economic indicators were released late last week, that a feeble recovery might benefit stocks better than anything else.
"Wall Street is about to get the best possible of all worlds," Mr. Johnson said. "And that is a no-boom, no-bust trajectory that lasts."
 
Lower Interest Rates?
 In a slow, drawn-out recovery, Mr. Johnson said, the Federal Reserve Bank may again choose to lower interest rates, as long as inflation remains low. That will especially benefit growth-oriented stocks, which have fallen in recent weeks while the Dow has continued to climb.
Trading volume on the Big Board yesterday was moderate, as 174.5 million shares changed hands, compared with 177.4 million on Friday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.38 points, to 416.91, only a few points away from its high of 420.77, which was set on Jan. 15.
The Nasdaq Composite index, a leading indicator of over-the-counter stocks, went up 5.40 points, to 583.54, far below its record high of 644.92, set on Feb. 12. The American Stock Exchange index was also up, by 1.83 points, to 391.61, some distance from its record high of 418.99, also set on Feb. 12.
Robert Freedman, chief investment officer at John Hancock Mutual Funds in Boston, said that the market also reacted positively to rumors that the Federal Reserve Bank would again cut its discount rate.
"We're still in this odd period," Mr. Freedman said. "The worst of the economic bad news is over, but we're still waiting for the earnings to take off. There's still a lot of cash out there that's ready to come into the market.
"The environment is still good for stocks," he concluded. "There is nothing like low inflation and low interest rates for the stock market."
Mr. Freedman predicted greater gains in the market over the coming weeks. Mr. Walberg and Mr. Johnson were more cautious.
Health-care stocks, which drifted downward in recent weeks, were among yesterday's big gainers. Merck rose 3 5/8, to 147 1/2. Johnson & Johnson went up 1 5/8, to 97 3/8. Bristol Myers Squibb rose 1 3/4, to 76 1/2.
Brokerage industry stocks also gained broadly yesterday, after falling considerably in recent weeks. Morgan Stanley rose 2 3/4, to 52 1/8, while Salomon rose 1 7/8, to 33 1/8. Merrill Lynch went up 5/8, to 50 1/2.

HEADLINE: REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK;
Newspapers Seek Way Out of Income Drought

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
The unusually down-to-business tone of this year's annual convention of the American Newspaper Publishers Association became apparent early Sunday morning, a day before the convention formally began at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan.
A workshop was scheduled for 8:30 A.M., and it was so jammed with eager publishers that extra chairs had to be brought into the room, and there were not enough hand-out materials to meet the demand. 
 After two years of deep recession for newspapers, the workshop topic was one calculated to be irresistible, even to publishers who had come to New York early for a weekend on the town.
The title: "What's worked in revenue generating, cost containment and new products."
In other words, how to make more money.
Though there is a pronounced optimism among many newspaper publishers about the prospects for economic recovery, there is also an intense interest in finding new ways to generate revenues and cut costs after a painful advertising drought.
At 7 A.M. yesterday, another workshop advised publishers on how to start what are known in the industry as frequent reader programs, in which papers build circulation by offering special discounts at local businesses to those who subscribe for at least six months.
Harry M. Whipple, an expert in such programs, explained how The Arizona Daily Star in Tucson and The Tucson Citizen are going even further and joining with financial institutions to issue Visa and other credit cards to subscribers, then splitting with the financial institutions the commission paid by the retailers. And a plan is under way for the papers to start offering discount telephone rates through MCI and Sprint.
In a report to the association yesterday morning, Cathleen P. Black, the group's chief executive, said that marketing was one of the areas of primary focus for the association, along with public policy issues, technology and diversity.
Her appeal for more diverse newspaper staffs to the overwhelmingly white and male association was made not just on moral or even journalistic grounds, but on practical dollars-and-cents grounds as well.
Ms. Black said that diversity was vital to whether newspapers would be able to attract and keep the readers and advertisers they must have if the industry is to prosper in an increasingly diverse society.
"Diversity is right, it's good business, and it's long overdue," she said.
Similarly, Robert F. Erburu, the association's chairman and chairman of the Times Mirror Company, used his address to focus on "the importance of good journalism" after two years in which "events have focused much of our attention on the financial side of the business."
Mr. Erburu said that journalistic excellence was an obligation and the highest purpose of newspapers. He argued that sacrificing good journalism for the sake of profit was ultimately bad business.
"Our newspapers will fail as surely from a lack of principle as from a lack of revenue," Mr. Erburu said.
 
Return of a Hostage
 What will almost certainly prove to be the most dramatic and emotional segment of the convention was an appearance by Terry A. Anderson, the reporter for The Associated Press who was held prisoner in Lebanon for nearly seven years by Muslim fundamentalist kidnappers.
Mr. Anderson was released in December, and has spent most of his time since then relaxing, traveling, and recovering from his long ordeal.
Mr. Anderson said he would soon begin work on a book about his experience. He said the book would probably take about a year, and he had no plans as yet beyond that project.
In an informal conversation format, Louis D. Boccardi, president of The Associated Press, asked Mr. Anderson how he had survived his years of imprisonment.
"God had a great deal to do with it," Mr. Anderson said.
In a remarkably unbitter account of his experience, Mr. Anderson described how, after deserting Catholicism as a young man, he had returned to the faith six months before he was kidnapped in 1985. His captors allowed him a Bible, which he read through "like a book" 50 times.
He described how his jailers would prepare him to be moved to another location by wrapping him "like a mummy" with broad plastic tape, leaving only a breathing hole for his nose. Unable to move at all, he would then be thrown into the trunk of a car or into a cramped secret compartment of a truck bed, where he would have to spend hours inhaling exhaust fumes in sweltering heat.
In the only comment Mr. Anderson made that sounded at all self-congratulatory, he said with some pride that the fumes had made him violently sick and that it had taken "an enormous effort of will" not to throw up, because with his mouth taped he knew he would choke on his own vomit.
When Mr. Boccardi referred to Mr. Anderson as courageous, he countered that Terry Waite, the Anglican church envoy, was courageous because he chose to go to Lebanon to try to free hostages and was taken prisoner.
"I had no choice," Mr. Anderson said, describing his view of himself as having demonstrated "will and some strength," but not -- to his mind -- courage.
Asked if he hated his captors, Mr. Anderson said he did not.
"I have no room for it; I have no time for it," he said. "Bitterness will not hurt them one ounce, it will only hurt me."
The nation's newspaper publishers signaled their opinion of Mr. Anderson with two prolonged standing ovations.
 
A Better Sense of Humor
 "There's not as much gallows humor this year," said Frank A. Daniels Jr., publisher of The News & Observer in Raleigh, N.C.
The anticipation of better profits and a recovering economy have indeed lifted the collective spirit of the newspaper industry.
But while there may not be as much gallows humor, there is still humor.
The staple joke at this year's convention stems from the imminent merger of the American Newspaper Publishers Association (A.N.P.A.) with the Newspaper Advertising Bureau (N.A.B.) and several other industry associations into a new umbrella organization to be called The Newspaper Association of America (N.A.A.).
The merger, which is scheduled for June 1, is expected to create nearly $5 million in cost savings annually and improve overall service.
While the merger has not generated serious opposition, its new name has created what may prove to be an unfortunate acronym.
Wags are already referring to the new Newspaper Association of America as, "Naaaaaaa!"

HEADLINE: Pizza and Persistence Win in Hungary

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUDAPEST

 BODY:
It is close to midnight and George F. Hemingway, a one-man American locomotive for the nascent market economy in Hungary, is swinging his Isuzu Trooper through the gloomy streets here, pointing out the extent of his business empire.
"That's mine," says the burly entrepreneur from Los Angeles, gesturing toward a gourmet food store called Bon Bon Hemingway. "That's mine also," he adds, as he passes a sports outfitter named USA Sport. "Mine too," he declares, indicating a Chinese restaurant that, he reckons, serves Europe's finest caramelized bananas. "And this is my big favorite," he roars, lurching to a halt beside Hungary's first Pizza Hut. 
 Outside the restaurant, which opened in April, is a long line; inside, a vision of Hollywood, complete with shocking lilac walls, a fresco of Superman, portraits of Humphrey Bogart and a mannequin of Marilyn Monroe. As Mr. Hemingway strides in, the manager scurries up with a computer printout: 1,980 pizzas served that day and more than $6,500 earned.
"He's not selling pizza; he's selling the speed and glitz of U.S. culture," said Peter Rona, the chief executive of the First Hungary investment fund.
Agnes Pankotai, a student, explained her willingness to line up for pizza. "It's the only thing like it in a city of two million people and it's exciting," she said. But the price of about $2.60 for the cheapest pizza is something "most Hungarians can only afford about once a month," she added.
Still, Mr. Hemingway, who made his fortune selling pizza and real estate in California, said, "I never did business like this in the U.S." Beaming, he reflected: "You know, I first came here in 1984 and could see that socialism was not the system of the future. It was clear there would be something else and I thought, hey, it'll probably be capitalism."
The same thought has occurred to many other Western business executives since the countries of the former Soviet bloc began their painful transition to market economies two and a half years ago. But while the majority of potential investors have pondered the political instability, inflation, yo-yoing currencies and Communist mind-sets, Mr. Hemingway has acted.
 
Faith and Computers
 "All you need in Eastern Europe," the 44-year-old businessman insists, "is a basic faith and a very good computer system."
In fact, his success seems to reflect two central factors: an unusual perseverance in the face of initially stifling bureaucracy and the emergence of Hungary as the East European country offering the best prospects of doing business.
"If there's anywhere in East Europe to make a buck, it's Hungary," said Marc L. Holtzman, the chief executive of Central European Associates, a Budapest-based consulting firm. "But it's no good coming for four nights and leaving. You have to roll up your sleeves and dig in because a transaction that might take two months in the U.S. takes a year here. That's what Hemingway has done -- dig in."
His Hungarian empire comprises 137 restaurants in Budapest, 31 in the provinces, a hotel, 87 food stores, several sports shops with the exclusive license for L.A. Gear, a computer company, an agricultural publishing concern and a furniture importer. With an exclusive fast-food franchise from Pepsico, Mr. Hemingway plans to open 15 Pizza Huts and 22 Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets in the next three years. And with a franchise from Allied-Lyons P.L.C., he has 40 Dunkin' Donuts on the drawing board.
 
Long-Distance Commuting
 Mr. Hemingway has had to face difficulties typical of Eastern Europe -- a deep recession and soaring unemployment that have cut into consumer spending, and restaurant employees with little tradition of or commitment to attentive, speedy service. But commuting twice a month between Hollywood Hills and Budapest, he has been in the vanguard of a growing private sector that has thrived on the determination of the Hungarian authorities to unshackle the economy.
Where it required 12 permits to open a barber shop two years ago, today none is needed. Where just 10 percent of the economy was in private hands in 1989, 40 percent is now privately held, including a large underground economy, said the former governor of the central bank, Gyorgy Suranyi.
William H. Strong, chief executive of Salomon Brothers in London, mentioned Hungary's clear corporate and tax laws, ethnic homogeneity and far-reaching deregulation. "Hemingway typifies the spirit of entrepreneurism that Hungary is endorsing more strongly than its neighbors," he said. Salomon is currently raising $20 million to back Mr. Hemingway's East European expansion.
A lawyer, Mr. Hemingway formerly worked for McKenna & Fitting, a Los Angeles law firm, and made his fortune in pizzas and real estate in California. He learned Hungarian from his mother, who was born in Budapest, and first invested in Hungary in the mid-1980's, setting up a chocolate factory.
"It was horrendous," he recalls. "There was fear everywhere, and the Government was very ambivalent about foreigners. I couldn't even get aluminum foil for my chocolates."
Persevering, he acquired from the state a chain of stores that he renamed Bon Bon Hemingway and a large stable of dingy but nicely situated self-service restaurants. Some have already been converted into ethnic restaurants, serving, among other things, Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Czechoslovak fare. Others are to be converted to Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Dunkin' Donut restaurants.
"It was never a question of can I do it or not," Mr. Hemingway said. "It was that I wanted to do it. Too many potential investors here do not have that enthusiasm to carry them through the difficulties."
In all, he has invested more than $20 million of his own money in Hungary, including $1.1 million in the first Pizza Hut restaurant. Since 1990, his activities have been grouped in Hemingway Holding A.G., a company quoted on the Vienna stock exchange in which his California holding company owns 51 percent. Girozentrale, an Austrian bank, recently recommended the shares in a report, citing "very promising profitability" for the company's activities in Hungary.
Certainly Pizza Hut has made an impressive debut, with lines of as many as 150 people regularly stretching outside the restaurant. Mr. Hemingway's gamble on decor and computers allowing waiters to punch orders directly into a portable electronic ordering system appear to have impressed Hungarians.
Mr. Hemingway has been trying hard to teach the notion of service, something foreign to the people of East Europe after 40 years or more of Communism. When a waitress approaches and quickly retreats after a customer says he does not want dessert, Mr. Hemingway leaps to his feet.
"What do you mean by going away?" he asks the waitress. "How about suggesting an ice cream, or coffee, or some cakes?" As she slinks off, he says, "You have to teach everything -- how to smile, how to move, how to seat people. The people here are smarter than in California, but they're slower. So you work on the speed. You say, 'Excuse me, you're moving in slow motion.' "
 
Margins of 25%
 This is not a problem from which Mr. Hemingway suffers. His first Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant -- decorated in what he calls California Art Deco -- is scheduled to open across the street later this year. By 1995, he expects to be operating at least 77 fast-food restaurants and reckons he can operate them with 25 percent profit margins. In the United States, a typical profit margin at a fast-food franchise is far less.
As yet, there is scant political resistance to this Americanization of Budapest. "We do have some criticism that it's not good to have a Pizza Hut or a Burger King on every corner downtown," said Attila Tarkany Szucs, the deputy managing director of the State Property Agency. "But fast food is still welcome, and Mr. Hemingway has a good reputation."
Yet in other East European countries, where he hopes to expand, Mr. Hemingway has not fared so well. He recently met with Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus of Czechoslovakia and came away disillusioned.
"Mr. Klaus kept talking about the first wave and the second wave and third wave of privatization and which wave I should come in on," Mr. Hemingway said. "I got the same wave stuff in Bulgaria. But I'm not interested in waves. In fact I'm getting an allergy to the wave word in Eastern Europe. I want to know how to do business. I want to know when I can open a Pizza Hut on Wenceslas Square."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Slow Trading; Gold Shows Mixed Results

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday in dealings quieted by holidays in two important foreign markets -- Japan, where Constitution Day was observed, and Britain, which has an annual bank holiday in May.
Gold prices were mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $337.30 an ounce, off $1.70 from Friday. The Republic National Bank said gold fell $1.45 an ounce, to a late bid of $336.80. 
 Analysts said the dollar opened higher in domestic dealings. Traders tried to bring the dollar down, but it recovered on technical buying by the end of the session.
Marc Chandler, an analyst with the advisory firm IDEA, called the day's trading "the calm before the storm." He said the Thursday meeting of Germany's central bank council and Friday's release of American unemployment data for April could pull the dollar out of its recent tight trading range.
There are some rumors that Germany's central bankers might lift interest rates, putting American rates at even more of a disadvantage. Similarly, speculation is brewing that the Federal Reserve might lower American interest rates by the end of the month.
"Interest-rate differentials are capping the dollar's upside momentum, while some buying is capping the downside," Mr. Chandler said. Noting that "overnight rates here are about 3.75 percent; in Germany they're 9.60 percent," Mr. Chandler said "that illustrates why the dollar can't rise."
Higher rates abroad make foreign debt securities more attractive to investors, increasing their need for foreign currencies. In the past, relatively high American rates lured investors and enhanced the value of the dollar.
In Europe, the dollar was quoted at 132.55 yen, down from 133.13 yen on Friday in Tokyo. In New York the dollar settled at 133.20 yen, up from 132.65 on Friday.
In Europe, the British pound was quoted at $1.7795, down from $1.7840 late Friday. In New York it cost $1.7790 to buy a pound, down from $1.7865 on Friday.
In Zurich, the late bid for gold was $336.85, up from $336.35 late Thursday. Zurich markets were closed Friday.
Silver prices rose in domestic trading. On the Comex in New York, silver settled at $4.002 an ounce, up from $3.997 on Friday.

HEADLINE: Business Scene;
A Worker Share Of Rise in Output

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

DATELINE: WOOSTER, Ohio

 BODY:
CHRISTOPH SCHMID'S message is a little unusual for the chief of a Midwestern manufacturer. His company, Luk Inc., supplies the Big Three American auto makers with the majority of the clutch plates they use in their stick-shift transmissions, a highly competitive business. But Mr. Schmid says that rising labor costs for Luk's 311 employees here are not a major problem -- and certainly not a reason to shutter the plant and decamp for Mississippi or Mexico.
Not that Luk, a German company, outbids the other manufacturers for workers in this partly rural, partly industrial town, still encircled by grain fields. Quite the contrary. The various manufacturers swap wage information so that all use roughly the same scale of $7 to $15 an hour. But while others stress sticking close to this pay scale and holding down labor costs, Mr. Schmid preaches generous extra payments to reward his workers for their productivity. He insists that Luk can offset this extra outlay through constant investment and retraining, so that the factory can produce more clutch plates per worker. 
 "We are going to go above Rubbermaid in pay in a few years; not significantly, but above them," Mr. Schmid said, referring to the manufacturer of housewares that is Wooster's biggest employer. "Fortunately, our shareholders focus on productivity, and ours is rising at 6 percent a year."
Output per worker at Rubbermaid, one of the nation's most profitable companies, is also rising smartly. And Rubbermaid is channeling back to its workers at least some of the added income that they generate from their increased production -- mostly as contributions to pension accounts. But while Mr. Schmid, president of the Luk subsidiary here, says he is willing to offset higher labor costs by striving for greater productivity, Walter W. Williams, Rubbermaid's chairman, tries to hold the line on compensation. Rubbermaid's managers tell workers that the payoff for productivity is job security. And if the workers insist on higher pay, then the company might shift some operations to Rubbermaid factories elsewhere with lower labor costs. And this the company has done.
The Rubbermaid approach has held sway among United States companies for more than a decade. But as Corporate America has made itself more productive and thus more competitive in world markets, pressure has risen on management to share the gains with workers, as Luk says it is doing.
"Once the economy recovers from recession, then the issue will be whether American companies will raise workers' earnings," said Richard Freeman, a Harvard labor economist. "If they don't, then managers and shareholders will get the new income from productivity gains, and not workers, and incomes will continue to stagnate for most of the population."
But if Mr. Schmid's approach previews the future, then the Luk operation here offers a significant insight. Breaking with the past, the new income from greater productivity will not be distributed as higher base pay, but as bonuses, profit-sharing and other special payments that can be canceled if sales or productivity decline. Mr. Schmid, a 45-year-old German engineer who has been a Luk executive in Wooster for a decade, says that bonuses and other variable payments represent 25 percent of the company's labor costs.
The pay of Jeannie Boyd, a 34-year-old operator of computerized punch presses, illustrates how productivity at Luk translates into income. Her base wage -- what she gets whether she is working or on vacation or out sick --is $7.55 an hour, having risen by 25 cents in each of the last three years. The raises failed to keep pace with inflation, but Ms. Boyd also earns an additional $1.80 to $2.40 an hour, depending on how many clutch plates she processes. And every three months she gets a bonus check, representing her share of the company's gains from productivity. Her 1991 income was $23,000, with roughly $15,000 of it in base pay.
When sales drop, then work subcontracted to outsiders -- data processing, for example -- is pulled back to sustain productivity, and people are retrained: an assembly line worker might become an accounting staff member, for example, or a packer might learn to run a machine. Luk has not increased its staff in three years, but like Rubbermaid it has not laid anyone off in years.
Mr. Schmid insists that the retraining and flexible use of workers make moving to Mexico a moot point. Although worker pay here is several times higher than at Luk's Mexico operation, so is productivity, and personnel costs in Wooster represent 18 percent of total costs compared with 19 percent in Mexico.
"I don't have to and won't, but if I did go up $2 an hour in wages, that is not going to kill me," Mr. Schmid said. "It would take something out of the bottom line short-term, until I could find ways to offset this with efficiencies."

HEADLINE: The Fight for Mr. Bush's Mind

 BODY:
Following the waves of urban violence 25 years ago, President Johnson announced an "unconditional war on poverty." Later this week George Bush flies to Los Angeles to deliver his response to urban violence 1992. He lacks Lyndon Johnson's passion for the poor. He surely lacks for easy access to funds. What he does have is a priceless opportunity to face up to a subject he rarely touches -- the racial and economic divisions laid bare by the violence.
In the last few days, Mr. Bush has sensibly balanced justice and order. But what of substance? Even now, his aides struggle for his mind. 
 On one side are people like Housing Secretary Jack Kemp who urge that he make a strong speech complete with a forceful anti-poverty agenda. On the other are cost-conscious budgeteers like Richard Darman and some political advisers, who worry that a program to help the disadvantaged would reap little or no political gain.
And then there is Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, who yesterday blamed the violence on the social programs of the 1960's and 70's (read the Democrats). It would be silly and wrong for Mr. Bush to continue that line. Silly because it's such a pinched, ideological response to a national tragedy. Wrong because many Great Society programs -- Head Start and the Job Corps, to name two -- have been consistently successful.
Unfortunately, should he choose to take a higher road than Mr. Fitzwater, Mr. Bush does not so far have much to offer. His urban policies filled only 25 pages of a 433-page budget, and half of that concerns drugs and law enforcement. The rest consists of initiatives from Mr. Kemp.
For years the Housing Secretary has promoted "empowerment" -- the idea that giving inner-city residents more control over their lives offers greater hope than dependency. To that end, Mr. Kemp would allow poor families to buy apartments in public housing projects. He would also establish 50 "enterprise zones" in depressed urban areas. Businesses that invest would receive tax breaks; their workers would receive tax credits.
The idea has two big flaws. In similar state-run schemes, many businesses have ended up hiring workers from outside the target zone. And there's a real danger that once Congress gets through with it, the pork will be spread too thin to make much difference. That was the fate of Lyndon Johnson's Model Cities program.
Still, unlike others in Mr. Bush's camp, Mr. Kemp recognizes the crisis in urban America. He deserves credit for his principled effort to bring conservative ideas to bear on the central problems: jobs and poverty.
There's a lesson here for the President. For 12 years, he has acted as though he believes all the Reagan-era oratory that this is "morning in America." Mourning, as Los Angeles shows, is more like it, and the country waits to see what Mr. Bush wants to do about it.

HEADLINE: For the 90's, National Security Begins at Home

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Indefensible Defense" (editorial, April 12) is a welcome addition to the all-too-muted debate on reduced defense expenditures. For the most part, our national decision makers have failed to recognize the extent of the reduced threat to our national security following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact.
What is needed now is a revised definition of national security that factors in the well-being and skills levels of our human resources as well as the dangerous pathologies of drugs, AIDS, domestic violence, substandard housing and inadequate health care. A new definition of national security must also take into account our industrial base, levels of productivity, rates of capital formation, rebuilding of infrastructure and the state of research and development for civilian purposes. 
 All of these contribute to the foundations of American strength (and are reflected in our ability to defend ourselves in the future). But they are also important in their own right.
Further, the transition from military production to peaceful production requires a national bipartisan plan for conversion which minimizes the pain on those workers whose livelihoods will be affected, including subsidized training for new employment opportunities.
We cannot use the excuse of job dislocation to obstruct the transition from a military-propelled to a civilian-dominated economy. It is ironic to hear conservatives who stridently oppose welfare for the most needy among us become the vociferous advocates of obsolete military production to pander to voters in their own constituencies. From our perspective, that amounts to welfare for the producers and their employees.
Less fortunate Americans, including many of our minorities, have seen their dreams deferred for half a century as our leaders increased defense expenditures at the expense of housing, education, universal health care and job training. Regardless of class or race, Americans supported the notion of a militarily dominant America in face of threats to our survival as a free nation.
Now things have radically changed, and it is time to get on with the fulfillment of the American dream -- for every single American.
Honest men and women can differ over which weapons systems to eliminate or reduce, but we can no longer differ on reordering our priorities to put the prosperity, health and safety of people at home at the top of the list.
We of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People intend to hold our national leaders responsible for the speed and scope of
this urgently needed transition. The elections in November will be the first test of their commitment and will. It will be a challenge for every concerned American, regardless of party, race, region or gender. Let the debate begin.

HEADLINE: For the 90's, National Security Begins at Home;
Making the Adjustment

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Leslie H. Gelb (column, April 17) laments our inability to earn the peace dividend because of the absence of conversion plans. Consequently, he points out, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's $1.5 trillion military spending bill over the next five years is less a response to imagined new enemies than a jobs bill.
Unfortunately, the problem is more general. The inability to accept the dislocation of workers and entrepreneurs also makes us leery of bringing the free trade agreement with Mexico to a vote, of pushing for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and probably even leads us to the forcible repatriation of political refugees from Haiti. 
 For some reason, we seem to have given up trying to devise an effective adjustment program. Yet the Scandinavians have reportedly done reasonably well with worker retraining; the Japanese manage to shift production from sunset to sunrise activity within the same company, and Chile has devised a temporary, large-scale public-works program. Though our own experience with adjustment assistance, sometimes called "burial assistance," has been mixed, that is no reason to give up. Precious little effort has been expended on studying past successes and failures.
We need to create a system that gets workers and entrepreneurs to shift into new activities, instead of giving them additional time and incentive to resist change. The budgetary resources would not be a problem; foreign aid spent at home would be popular both in this country and abroad, be cost effective and pay large returns on several fronts around the globe.

HEADLINE: For the 90's, National Security Begins at Home;
Transportation Focus

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Indefensible Defense" (editorial, April 12) calls for major cutbacks in large, obsolete weapons programs. You leave out making a responsible transition from military to commercial activity. You are talking about layoffs for tens of thousands and destruction of many communities across the country at a time of feeble recovery, if any, from deep recession.
Why not use most of the billions saved by cutbacks for a national initiative that uses much of the talent we have? I am thinking of the speech in which John F. Kennedy set this country on its course to the moon. Areas that contain a vast range of technology are energy and transportation. How about unifying this country's efforts in transportation and related energy research under a national transportation initiative? 
 The initiative would have as its goal making this country the world's center of transportation expertise. With new technologies on the horizon, superconductivity and new fuels, this seems an opportune time to provide a national focus to develop technologies associated with air, land and sea transportation of goods and people.
This initiative would have to be coordinated at the national level by a public corporation or Government agency. One important part would be to involve our aerospace industry. Also, of course, it should include the repair and upgrading of our transportation infrastructure, which badly needs attention.
Think of building an intercity network of high-speed surface and tube trains, running between stations fed by an urban-suburban network of electric, clean-running, highly efficient vehicles. Think of all the opportunities for improved commuter transportation, centered on safe, small vehicles and road-unclogging mass transit.
Think of spending billions for a better society, instead of killer weapons.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Primaries;
Easy Clinton Victory Is Expected In Capital's Democratic Primary

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4

 BODY:
Already well on his way to capturing the Democratic Presidential nomination, Gov. Bill Clinton is the runaway favorite to win the District of Columbia primary on Tuesday.
The only real issues in the contest are how many of the 17 delegates at stake the Arkansas Governor can win and whether, in the process, he can spark an enthusiastic voter turnout. 
 Ninety percent of the District's voters are Democrats, the vast majority of them black. Thus, Tuesday's primary, more than any other this year, offers Mr. Clinton a clear-cut opportunity to demonstrate his strength with black voters.
In most other primaries this year Mr. Clinton has enjoyed solid backing from black voters, whose support is crucial to Democratic Presidential candidates. But the turnout of blacks has been low, often lagging behind that of whites, whose turnout in the current climate of voter unease is at its lowest level in years.
 
Emphasis on Black Support
 Mr. Clinton seems intent on making the best of Tuesday's opportunity to show strength with black voters. Although he has a big lead in delegates and is his party's likely Presidential nominee, the Arkansan has invested a considerable amount of time campaigning here, making three swings, the latest on Sunday.
The other major Democratic candidate on the ballot is former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California. He did not spend as much time in the city as Mr. Clinton, though he made a final appearance today, calling for racial healing after the riots last week in Los Angeles.
Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts is also on the ballot, and a few diehard supporters are campaigning for him even though he suspended his campaign six weeks ago.
Then there is an "uncommitted" line on the ballot.
In some primary contests earlier this year, sometimes to Mr. Clinton's embarrassment, "uncommitted" has drawn large numbers of votes, another reflection of the deep political unease within the electorate. But more recently, as Mr. Clinton has moved closer to becoming his party's nominee, the uncommitted vote has begun to shrink.
 
Support From Labor Group
 When Mr. Clinton visited Washington on Sunday, he spoke at two black churches and met with some local labor leaders, the two main forces in Democratic politics here.
The labor leaders, members of the Metropolitan Washington Council of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., endorsed the Governor. He also picked up the endorsement of the city's Mayor, Sharon Pratt Kelly, one of the few top-tier local political figures who had not previously endorsed him.
Just about the only remaining high-profile local Democrat who has not endorsed Mr. Clinton is the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the nonvoting delegate to the Senate for the District of Columbia. Mr. Jackson has taken no public stand in the Washington primary except to make sure that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Brown do not waver in their support for statehood for the District.
Republicans will also hold a primary on Tuesday. But since they account for barely 10 percent of the city's vote and President Bush already has his party's nomination in his pocket, the contest is expected to go all but unnoticed.
Mr. Bush's sole opponent, Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative columnist and television commentator, is now talking only of being a "voice" in national politics.

HUMANS have always exploited nature in the belief that the all-encompassing biosphere -- the seamless, wondrously resilient fabric of life, land, water and air -- was so vast and enduring that people could never do it basic harm.
Events of the last decade have shattered that comforting perception. The moment of awakening may have come in the mid-1980's when governments finally accepted and acted on the evidence that waste industrial chemicals were weakening the stratospheric ozone shield that protects living things from biologically harmful ultraviolet rays. 
 But that is almost the least of it. People have now transformed the biosphere on so many fronts, scientists say, that Homo sapiens rivals grand forces like the movement of continents, volcanic eruptions, asteroid impacts and ice ages as an agent of global change.
The transformation has sharply escalated in both scale and pace since World War II. And it is raising serious questions not only about the ability of nature to sustain the global economy, but also about the health and future of the biosphere itself. That is why delegates from around the world are preparing to gather at an "Earth Summit" early next month in Rio de Janeiro.
There are many reasons for concern:
*People have transformed or manipulated ecosystems constituting about half the planet's ice-free land surface and have made a significant impact on most of the rest.
*They have appropriated to their own use about 40 percent of the photosynthetic energy produced by plants.
*They have steadily reduced the number of other species in the world through pollution, hunting and destruction of natural habitat. Now, as the inroads become deeper and more widespread, many biologists fear that human activity could bring about a mass extinction of epic scale, wiping out 25 percent of the world's remaining species in the next 50 years.
*By burning coal, oil, natural gas and trees they cut down, humans have altered the global flow of energy within the biosphere. Atmospheric concentrations of heat-trapping carbon dioxide have increased by 25 percent since pre-industrial times. That is well above levels recorded at any other time in the last 160,000 years, which is as far back as scientists have been able to track the trend. No end to the buildup is in sight. If it remains uncontrolled, scientists warn, a disruptive and possibly catastrophic warming of the earth could take place.
*Global population, which stood at 2.5 billion only 40 years ago, is expected to reach 6 billion by the year 2000 and swell to perhaps 10 billion 60 years from now.
Delegates to Rio hope to sign legally binding treaties to cope with the threats of climate change and species extinction. The final round of talks on climate is to conclude at the United Nations in New York this week. The last round of biodiversity talks starts next week in Nairobi, Kenya.
The Rio delegates also hope to adopt a statement of principles and an agenda for action to prevent broad damage to the biosphere while accommodating the economic needs of the surging population.
The question of limits to economic and population growth has come to the fore once again in connection with the summit. But this time it has been joined by the newer and more pressing question of the degree to which the biosphere is in jeopardy. Scientists are still struggling toward an answer in each case.
Until now, humans have always been able to push back the physical limits imposed on their expansion by the rest of the biosphere. When limited food supplies have threatened to check the proliferation of people, for instance, people have employed technology and social organization to grow crops and then clear forests, plow grasslands and, finally, harness science to agriculture. Humanity has not repealed the laws of ecology, but it has bent them; it continually expands to fill its ecological niche, then stretches the niche -- at some cost to other elements of the biosphere.
 
Capacity for Growth
 Is the capacity of the earth to accommodate human growth infinite?
No, argue Donella H. Meadows, Dennis L. Meadows and Jorgen Randers, three authors of the "limits to growth" thesis propounded 20 years ago under the sponsorship of the Club of Rome, an informal group of academics, civil servants and business leaders. The thesis, based on computerized simulations of the workings of the global ecosystem, held that limits to growth on the planet would be breached within a century and that a sudden and uncontrollable decline of population and industrial capacity would ensue. Damage to the biosphere's natural resources were one element in the predicted collapse.
In a new book called "Beyond the Limits" (Chelsea Green Publishing Co.), based partly on updated computer simulations, the three authors argue that if human activity continues as at present, it will "overshoot" the carrying capacity of the biosphere and precipitate a collapse within the next few decades.
The result, they write, would be "a permanently impoverished environment and a material standard of living much lower than could have been possible had the environment never been overstressed."
The new analysis puts more emphasis on deterioration of the biosphere, and Dennis Meadows said that it convinced him that less time is available to halt the expected collapse than had earlier been thought. Twenty years ago, he said, "it seemed to us there was a period out to 2030 or 2040 in which to fashion a sustainable society." Now, he said, it looks as if a new set of attitudes and policies are not in place in the next 20 years, it will be too late to avoid an eventual collapse.
 
Are Limits Real?
 The original limits-to-growth thesis drew sharp criticism and dissent, and the updated one is likely to provoke argument as well. Indeed, Allen Sinai, chief executive officer of the Boston Company Economic Advisors, an economic analysis group, took issue with its forecast of overshoot-and-collapse in a debate on the subject a few weeks ago in Cambridge, Mass. The debate was organized by Earthwatch, a Boston-based scientific research and education organization. The earth's carrying capacity is "roughly infinite over the time span of relevance to most of us, which would be 50 to a hundred to 150 years," Dr. Sinai said.
He did not discount "the very real effects" of population and economic growth on the physical world in the short term. But "again and again," he said, the market system has "stretched limits which appear finite to roughly infinite," frustrating Malthusian predictions of disaster.
But no one knows the capacity of the biosphere to sustain humanity's expansion. "We have yet to see a cogent analysis of what the real, sustainable carrying capacity of the earth is for people," said Dr. Daniel Botkin, an ecologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara.
Scholars have a better fix on the ways in which human activity is transforming the biosphere, even though they have only recently begun looking at the question systematically.
 
No Immediate Danger
 Contrary to widespread popular perception, they say, the earth itself is in no danger at the hands of humanity, and life itself is not about to be wiped out. Grand movements of the continents, shifts in the earth's position relative to the sun that bring on ice ages, global temperatures higher than any contemplated in the foreseeable future, bombardment of the planet by debris from space -- all have transformed the earth in the past without destroying the planet or extinguishing all life.
Nor are humans the only species that has altered the biosphere. The earth's original atmosphere, for instance, was far different from today's. But about 2 billion years ago, photosynthesizing microbes that lived on hydrogen began to break down water and expel oxygen as a byproduct. Oxygen was toxic to most other organisms then alive, and they perished as atmospheric oxygen built up. The ultimate result was the creation of a new, oxygen-rich atmosphere that supports today's animal kingdom.
Nevertheless, the extent of change wrought by humans "is enormous; you can't get away from it," said Dr. B. L. Turner 2d, a geographer at Clark University in Worcester, Mass., who directs a new program based at Clark on human transformation of the earth. The most recent and comprehensive inventory of biospheric changes caused by humans was published in 1990 under the auspices of Clark. In it, a wide range of experts in the physical and social sciences from around the world described the last 300 years of change.
"Humankind has altered or transformed virtually every element of the biosphere," Dr. Turner, Dr. Robert W. Kates of Brown University and Dr. William C. Clark of Harvard University wrote in the first chapter of the voluminous report, "The Earth as Transformed by Human Action" (Cambridge University Press, 1990).
The face of the earth, the 1990 report said, bears the most visible and oldest marks of change, although the more recent and more subtle changes in the flows of the biosphere's energy and chemicals may be more profound.
Alterations to the face of the earth have been going on "a bit longer than most people realize," Dr. Turner said. For instance, one quarter of the deforestation that has now taken place in the world had taken place by 1700, and 75 percent by 1915.
But in most cases, at least half the biospheric change caused by humans has taken place since World War II. This is especially true of the byproducts of the consumption-oriented industrial societies: emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, chlorofluorocarbons that weaken the protective ozone layer, nitrates that alter patterns of plant growth and sulfates that cause heat-reflecting clouds to form and acid to pollute water and soil.
Some changes analyzed in the study are decelerating even while others speed up. Humans increasingly alter the distribution of water in the biosphere by withdrawing more and more of it for their own use, for instance, and carbon dioxide continues to build up in the air. But some changes are decelerating because awareness of harmful impacts has led to regulation. One example is the successful effort to reduce emissions of lead, sulfur and carbon tetrachloride. Now that the world has formally agreed to phase out the manufacture of ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons, they are expected in time to diminish as a problem.
Moreover, the global pattern of biospheric transformation is uneven. Much land in the industrialized countries has reverted to forest, for example, as those countries have moved toward zero population growth and the area devoted to farming has declined. But in the developing countries, where population is surging and industrialization is only now taking hold, forests are being cleared at an increasingly rapid rate to provide both farmland and lumber.
The effects of the changes are also expected to vary regionally, with winners and losers emerging. If the human population were ever to plunge sharply because there were no longer enough resources to sustain it, "you wouldn't see a global crash," Dr. Botkin said. "You'd see it in one region or another." The Clark study warns that "regional population declines are possible, potentially brutal and even likely accompaniments" to the achievement of zero population growth globally.
Similarly, some cold regions might benefit, or suffer less, from global warming while others would suffer catastrophic drought or flooding from rising sea levels. Developing countries would be hardest hit in both instances, experts believe.
What of the future?
Demographers do not expect the global population to stabilize until it reaches 11 billion to 12 billion more than a century from now, and even this projection assumes that fertility rates eventually stabilize at replacement level -- an insecure assumption. Some analysts say the increase would be accompanied by a tripling or quadrupling of agricultural production and a sixfold to eightfold increase in energy use. Dr. Turner and his colleagues say that this analysis suggests that "the enormous transformations of the last three centuries will be doubled, trebled or more in the centuries to come."
But surprises are virtually assured.
"The very best scientists of any time," they wrote, "may only poorly understand the fundamental processes governing nature, society and the relationships between them."
And even if fears about the biosphere's health are genuine, they said, "the gloomiest of forecasts may not be realized because society takes them seriously and acts upon them."
 
POPULATION
Pressure Is Building
 THROUGHOUT most of history, humans have been a quite minor presence on the planet. Only 200 million people were alive at the time of the birth of Christ. By the time Europeans first settled in America 1,600 years later, the world population had grown to 500 million. But the human population spurted to 1 billion in 1850, more than doubled by 1950 and then more than doubled again, to 5.3 billion, in just the next 40 years. This post-Industrial Revolution expansion -- and especially the last 50 years -- is generally held responsible for most of the stress humans have put on the biosphere.
Demographers say that though women have been having fewer children since 1950, improved health and control of disease have caused death rates to plummet, so that global population increased. At the same time, population growth feeds on itself: more people means more women of childbearing age.
The United Nations now projects that if fertility ultimately stabilizes at a replacement rate of about 2.06 births per woman, the global population will reach 10 billion in the year 2050 before leveling off and stabilizing at around 11.5 billion soon after 2200. But those numbers could vary greatly if fertility rates turn out to be higher or lower. At a rate of 2.5 births per woman, the U.N. calculates, world population would reach 28 billion in 2150. At a rate of 1.7, which a few industrialized countries have achieved, it would reach 7.8 billion in 2050 but then fall to 4.3 billion a century later.
 
Economics and Population
 According to conventional wisdom, a country's population will stabilize as its economy develops and living standards rise. This "demographic shift," as it is called, has already taken place in industrialized countries, where the fertility rate is generally at or below replacement level.
But the shift is only starting in developing countries of the Southern Hemisphere, where fertility rates, while dropping in many instances, are still double and even triple those in the affluent countries of the North. As a result, the developing countries in 1990 accounted for 77 percent of the global population; by 2025, they are expected to account for about 85 percent. The U.N. projects that more than 60 percent of these will be urban dwellers, as compared with 37 percent in 1990.
Because the rural dwellers of developing countries rely for their direct sustenance largely on ready-at-hand renewable resources like trees, soil and water, growing population puts increasing pressure on the local biosphere. Forests are cut for wood, soil is depleted, water is withdrawn at ever-rising rates. In an anxious quest for income, many of these countries are also cutting some of their forests for commercial sale.
Perhaps a billion people remain desperately poor in these circumstances of mismatched resources and population, slowing the onset of the demographic shift. Many of these are moving to increasingly overcrowded and misery-racked cities in their search for sustenance.
 
AGRICULTURE
Revolution Has Slowed
 TEN thousand years ago in the Middle East, humans first freed themselves from dependence on what they could glean from the wild. By cultivating grains for the first time, they were able to expand food supplies so that an unprecedented growth in population was made possible.
For millennia, farmers sustained population growth mainly by clearing and cultivating new lands. The clearing escalated about three centuries ago, and since then there has been a 450 percent increase in the world's cultivated acreage, from a total area equivalent to Argentina to an expanse as large as South America.
Almost all prime agricultural land is now under cultivation. And although forests are being cleared at a rapid rate, scientists say, the land now being freed for farming is of marginal productivity and will have relatively little impact on future food production.
Moreover, since World War II, agriculture, deforestation and overgrazing have left an area about the size of China and India combined with moderately to severely diminished soil quality, reducing overall productivity.
The Green Revolution, based on higher-yield seeds and fertilizer, largely overcame these limitations starting in the 1960's and 1970's, enabling the world's farmers to sustain the doubling of the global population that began after World War II.
High-yield strains of wheat and rice bred in the world's agricultural laboratories doubled and tripled harvests in much of the developing world. So abundant did the harvests become that world food prices declined by more than 20 percent in the 1980's.
Sub-Saharan Africa is the main exception to the rule. It is the only region in the world with declining food production. It relies most heavily on imported food and a higher proportion of its people are malnourished than for any other region.
But out-and-out famine as a result of underproduction has largely disappeared. World hunger today is caused mostly by political upheaval, ineffective distribution of food and inability of the poor to buy it.
Yet the demand for basic food grains could double by 2020, and the ability of agriculture to keep pace with the demand is being called into question. Some neo-Malthusians insist that mass starvation is on the horizon, while some economists counter that human ingenuity will come through as it always has.
Even some who have brought the Green Revolution about, however, acknowledge that it has made its biggest and easiest gains, and that the challenge ahead appears formidable.
 
Side Effects of Production
 "The task will not be an easy one," said Dr. Donald L. Winkelmann, the director-general of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in Mexico, where the Green Revolution's "miracle wheat" was developed. The Green Revolution has entered a new and slower phase, he said, one in which increased production will depend on relatively simple measures like more intensive use of fertilizers, more efficient water use and fast-maturing varieties of plants that allow multiple crops.
Intensive use of synthetic chemicals runs the risk of further polluting water supplies through runoff, and a number of advocates urge the adoption of alternative methods of cultivation that rely on organic fertilizers and natural pest controls. But alternative agriculture is making inroads slowly.
Many scientists say that a variety of highly productive new strains of crops might be developed, but there are widespread fears that the natural genetic material from which they might be created is rapidly disappearing.
Farmers, as they embrace the Green Revolution, are abandoning traditional crop strains that constitute part of this genetic capital. And the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization warned recently that global agriculture could be threatened by the extinction of 40,000 important plant species in the next 60 years unless conservation measures are immediately stepped up.
 
SPECIES
The Signs Of Danger
 IN THE last 600 million years, the earth has experienced five big extinctions of life, usually linked to climatic change, in which 35 percent to 95 percent of all species then on the planet disappeared. Scientists know from fossil records that in each case it took 10 million years or more for the earth to regain its biological diversity.
Humans may now be precipitating an extinction of comparable scale, many biologists fear. Some economists argue that the fears are based on insubstantial evidence, and a few biologists say they may be exaggerated. But most biologists who have studied the situation believe the threat to species diversity is a clear and present danger.
As people alter or obliterate natural ecosystems to plant crops, harvest trees and build cities and towns, they destroy species habitat. Eventually a species that lives in a given kind of habitat will be doomed to extinction if enough patches of habitat disappear.
Globe-traveling humans have also introduced countless species into new habitats around the world, where they tend to choke out native species. Few areas on earth have been unaffected by this redistribution of plants and animals. Many animals have already been hunted to extinction. Others, like the rhinoceros and the African elephant, are threatened by hunting today. The Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Pacific and Indian Oceans are so heavily fished that fish populations can no longer withstand the pressure, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization says, and pressure is nearly as heavy in some other oceanic areas.
 
Diversity of Life
 No one can say for sure how many species are being doomed. But Dr. E. O. Wilson, a Harvard University biologist, has determined on the basis of field observations that when a patch of habitat is reduced by 90 percent, the number of species living in it eventually declines by about half. Using this formula, Dr. Wilson has calculated that at the rate at which tropical rain forests are being destroyed, 10 percent to 22 percent of rain forest species will be lost in the next 30 years because of habitat destruction alone.
The rain forests contain about half the plants, animals and microbes on earth. A quarter or more of the planet's species could be eliminated in 50 years, Dr. Wilson said.
How many species this amounts to is unknown, for the simple reason that the vast majority of all living species have yet to be discovered. About 1.4 million have been named, but biologists say there may be as many as 10 million, or even 100 million undiscovered species. The overwhelming majority are not charismatic species like elephants and whales but obscure but essential invertebrates and microbes that undergird the web of life. "The life of this planet," Dr. Wilson said, "is largely unexplored." If he and others are right, much of life could vanish before scientists can even name it.
What does it matter?
Apart from the value attached to life in general, natural ecosystems provide the materials of human sustenance That is where crops originally came from. Forests contain untapped riches in the form of medicines. But more than that, scientists say, natural ecosystems are such an essential part of the biosphere that mass extinctions could undermine its functioning. It is now widely recognized, for instance, that the diversity of life interacts with the oceans and the atmosphere in regulating climate, that it is essential in creating soils and holding them in place, that it cleanses waters of pollution and maintains a microbial standoff that keeps harmful pathogens under control.
Scientists do not know at what point a gradual loss of species results in the disintegration of ecosystems, or at what point the loss of ecosystems begins to affect the overall health of the biosphere. But many argue that it is dangerous to take chances.
 
FOREST
Chain-Saw Progress
 OF ALL the differences humans have made in the face of the Earth, perhaps none is so striking as the disappearance of forests. People have long been cutting down trees, but only in recent decades have they become alarmed at the scope and rate of deforestation.
Trees play a vital role in the maintenance of the biosphere. They hold soil in place, preventing erosion and the silting of rivers. They absorb water and give off moisture, helping to recycle water. They absorb vast amounts of heat-trapping carbon dioxide and lock it up in their cells. And they contain a disproportionate share of the world's living species.
Estimating the extent of forest cover and of deforestation is chancy, since many forests regenerate and are in constant flux.
In fact, deforestation of temperate-zone forests in the industrialized countries has reversed in this century as marginal farm land is taken out of production and trees reclaim it. There were an estimated 7.7 million square miles of forest in the developed nations in 1900, and about 8 million in 1985.
 
Pressure on Forests
 But the population explosion in the developing countries has intensified the pressure on forests there, which are one of the last sources of fuel and of new pasture and arable land, however marginal. The advent of the chain saw, truck and tractor have made it immeasurably easier to clear trees. As a result, according to United Nations estimates, an area of tropical forest larger than the state of Florida is disappearing each year.
Scientists estimate that about half the forest cover of the developing world has vanished in this century, and the rate of tropical deforestation is believed to have increased by 50 percent in the 1980's.
Worldwide, scientists say, there has been a net loss of more than 3 million square miles of forest, an area roughly equal to the 48 contiguous states of the United States. About half the loss has come since 1850. Figures on deforestation vary somewhat, but experts agree that trees are being destroyed on a large scale, and many believe the rate in the tropics is accelerating.
Assuming that about 3 million square miles of forest have been lost, that would be 12 to 13 percent of the pre-agricultural worldwide total. Forests may therefore cover an area 85 to 90 percent as large as they did 10,000 years ago. Scientists nevertheless raise two main alarms.
First, some 25 percent of the heat-trapping carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere as a result of human activity has come from deforestation. While the burning of fossil fuels will continue to be the main source of carbon dioxide buildup, accelerating deforestation adds substantially to the atmospheric total.
Second, the tropical forests -- which happen to be in the very developing countries where population pressures are greatest -- harbor far more living species per acre than forests elsewhere. Their density, complexity and fertility allow many habitats to coexist in a small area, and the loss of even a tiny patch can doom numerous species.
 
WATER
Few Drops To Spare
AS POPULATION expands and economies develop, humans are pressing the world's freshwater resources hard, and some regions are starting to bump up against limits imposed by water supplies.
Only 3 percent of the water on earth is fresh. Most of that is locked up in ice caps and glaciers. If all the water in the world amounted to 25 gallons, about half a teaspoon would be available for human use.
Against this background of limitations, human use is 35 times what it was three centuries ago. People withdraw the equivalent of Lake Huron from the world's rivers, streams, lakes and aquifers each year, and withdrawals have been increasing by about 4 to 8 percent a year in recent decades. About 40 percent of the water withdrawn is returned quickly to the water cycle as waste water. The rest is consumed.
About two-thirds of the withdrawals are used for agriculture, about 25 percent for industrial use and the rest for domestic purposes. Experts expect withdrawals for farming to increase slightly by the end of this century and withdrawals for industrial use to double. Most of the increase will be in the developing countries. Water use is stabilizing in the industrialized countries and is actually expected to decline slightly in the 1990's.
 
Water Supply Problems
 The vagaries of rainfall make the distribution of water uneven related to human need. Water is chronically short in many areas of sub-Saharan Africa, threatening the ability of agriculture to keep up with population. Supplies of water are beginning to fall behind demand in northern China, and the World Resources Institute says shortages could reach crisis proportions in the Middle East before this decade is out. Shortages have become a familiar and serious problem in the southwestern United States, particularly in California.
In their thirst, humans have greatly altered the distribution and quality of fresh water on the planet, most of which is found in river basins. They have submerged an area the size of France in reservoirs, disrupting the flow of rivers and transforming their ecosystems. They have polluted more than enough river water to fill Lake Superior. And typically, they have caused the amount of choking sediments to triple in large rivers and to increase eightfold in smaller ones in crowded regions.
The World Resources Institute says that in general, river water quality as measured by the biological demand for oxygen has improved in industrialized countries over the last 20 years because of better sewage treatment.
In the developing world, water quality is difficult to determine with precision because of a lack of information. But there appears little doubt that it is deteriorating there, especially around urban areas. Industrial discharges are usually poorly controlled, according to the World Resources Institute, and few cities in the developing countries treat their sewage.
Both pollution and development have had a heavy impact on many river ecosystems, and the rivers also carry pollution to coastal areas, where they affect coral reefs and the breeding grounds of marine life.
 
ATMOSPHERE
Potential Disaster
GLOBAL warming is the most far-reaching transformation wrought by humans because it could catastrophically magnify other changes as well -- if it develops as many scientists fear.
Atmospheric levels of some gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, mainly carbon dioxide and methane, are rising steadily as a result of human activity like the burning of fossil fuels. But scientists agree on little else beyond that.
They have not yet fully understood the myriad atmospheric interactions that are touched off when these "greenhouse" gases trap heat. The ultimate heating depends on the degree to which these interactions cancel each other out. But with that caveat, an international group of scientists convened by the United Nations predicts that if humans continue to pour greenhouse gases into the air at the present rate, the average surface temperature of the globe will rise by 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit some time in the next century. In comparison, the average temperature of the earth has risen by 9 degrees since the depths of the last ice age.
Whether a human-induced warming has already begun is unclear. The 1980's were an unusually warm decade, and 1990 and 1991 were the warmest years recorded, globally, since surface-temperature records have been kept. As provocative as this change is, it falls well within the natural swings of climate variability.
Warming, at least in the lower range of the prediction, could well benefit some people, scientists say. Higher concentrations of carbon dioxide, for example, stimulate crop growth. Some areas of the world would probably receive increased rainfall, making them more fertile. Some would enjoy longer growing seasons in regions where it is now too cold for maximum farm production. The cities of the industrialized North would experience a more salubrious winter climate, while still able to insulate themselves from summer's heat.
But there is also a long list of possible catastrophes, especially if warming develops in the high end of the predicted range. As glaciers and ice caps partially melt, according to the United Nations forecast, the level of the oceans would rise by about two feet by the end of the next century. This would place many coastal cities in jeopardy, inundate many low-lying, populous areas in countries like Egypt and Bangladesh and devastate coastal wetlands.
 
Redistribution of Water
 Warming would pour more energy into the climate system, and some studies show that the result would be more frequent and more disastrous storms.
While some areas would receive increased rainfall, others, particularly in the interior of continents, would probably get less. This global redistribution of water would subject some areas to disastrous flooding. In others, drought would devastate agriculture, and some studies show that drought generally would become more frequent.
One recent study suggests that agricultural yields would increase in the lower ranges of the predicted warming but decline in the higher ranges, and that farming in industrialized countries would fare better than in the developing world.
Developing countries, according to a U.N. study, would generally be the most vulnerable to climate change because they depend more on agriculture, forests and other natural resources. People in many developing countries already live on the margins of existence, and their plight would be intensified.
Even if humans were able to adapt, many scientists say, natural ecosystems would not easily be able to do so. While nature has adapted to climate change many times in the past, the rate of change was much slower then, taking place over hundreds or thousands of years. Global warming would take place over mere decades, and ecologists say that many ecosystems would be torn asunder as temperate-zone trees, for example, would be unable to migrate to friendly climes fast enough. Many climate-sensitive habitats could be destroyed, hastening the extinction of species. One study suggests that as much as 40 to 60 percent of the planet's vegetation could be disrupted, and the web of life with it.
How all of this might actually play out remains to be seen. But one conclusion seems inescapable:
By altering the chemistry of the atmosphere, humans have launched out into unexplored territory.


GRAPHIC: The human species, from a small population 2,000 years ago, has now grown to rank with grand natural forces like volcanoes and continental drift as a transformer of the earth's life-support system. Through technology and social organization, people have continually pushed back the natural limits on their population, allowing their numbers to increase exponentially over the last two centuries. The human impact on the globe has grown in proportion, and scientists now question how long the biosphere can continue to sustain growth without suffering severely damaging disruptions.
 
Irrigation
Diagram/Graph: "Demands of People: The Widening Impact"
As early as 4100 B.C., humans had laid the foundation for one of the world's earliest civilizations by irrigating the Euphrates River plain. But the inhabitants had abandoned these lands by 1700 B.C. because their farming methods caused the soil to become laden with salt.
 
Farming transforms the land
Early agrarian societies changed the landscape on a major but local scale, clearing and draining land for agriculture. Almost all the world's arable land was under cultivation by the early 20th century.
 
The growth of cities
In 1900, 16 cities had one million or more inhabitants. By 1990, 276 cities have reached that population.
 
Emissions
With the Industrial Revolution, human influence became truly global as emissions of substances like carbon dioxide and sulfur changed the chemistry of the atmosphere and introduced the possibility of climate change.
 
Autos and trucks
Contemporary transportation systems in some countries rival agriculture as a consumer of land.
 
Population explosion
Rapid population increases drive the search for more productivity, more land for crops, more wood for houses and fuel.
 
Water pollution
So fetid had the River Thames become from sewage that by 1850 all the fish had died and cholera plagued London. Since World War II, however, the river has been restored to health.

Water, Clean and Otherwise
There has been a geometric rise in water demand for industrial, agricultural and municipal uses. In many regions, a small fraction of raw sewage is treated before it is discharged.

Graph/Map: "Food Gains and Soil Losses"
Total food production has generally increased in developing regions, although many experts think the promised gains of the Green Revolution, the surge of production made possible by high-yield strains of grain and fertilizers, have largely been achieved. And the gains have enabled the food supply to keep pace with population increases. But per capita cropland has declined in all regions, and per capita food availability fluctuates dramatically. Soil degradation by agriculture, deforestation and grazing is increasing. Farming contributes to soil erosion, salinization and loss of soil nutrients. Soil restoration is sometimes possible, but expensive and difficult.

Chart: "Fading Biodiversity"
Tropical deforestation is a threat to a disproportionately large share of the world's plant and animal species. Although tropical forests cover only about 7 percent of the globe, they are thought to contain more than half the world's species.
 
The Utility of Biodiversity
On the most profound level, the benefit biodiversity confers is a healthy biosphere, for species are the agents of essential biological processes. Varied species help scientists answer evolutionary questions. They also provide valuable products. New medicines are constantly being sought, as well as fibers, spices, oils and lumber. Perhaps most immediately important to people, varied species insure vigorous crops and the resources for crop improvement. The strain of rice grown in Asia has been made immune to some diseases with genes from a single wild Indian species.
 
Approaching Extinction?
Populations of some animals have dwindled so rapidly that extinction within our lifetime seems inevitable. One in every three species of primate is in some danger, some conservationists believe, and one in every seven is highly endangered. The major cause is destruction of their habitats in tropical forests. They are also being hunted as a source of food or fur and to eliminate them from agricultural areas where they have become crop raiders. (Source: "Biodiversity," National Academy Press) (pg. C6)

Diagrams: "Flows of Carbon: A Global View"
Carbon circulates among four reservoirs: terrestrial plants, plants and soils, the ocean, the atmosphere and fossil fuels buried in the earth. Because the other reservoirs are so large, only a small amount is contained in the atmosphere.
 
The Land Reservoir -- Respiration
Plants withdraw and store carbon from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. About half of all carbon storage in plants takes place in the tropics.
Carbon is transferred to soil through decomposition.
 
The Ocean Reservoir -- Evaporation
Atmospheric carbon dioxide dissolves into surface ocean waters through the action of the wind. Some is taken up by plankton and incorporated into their shells and organic matter.
Some carbon is transferred to other organisms through the food chain, and some remains dissolved in water.
Some carbon is transferred to sediments.
 
How human activities affect the balance
The burning of fossil fuels and forests is releasing heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the biosphere faster than the oceans and plants can absorb it. As a result, atmospheric concentrations are at higher levels than any seen in at least 160,000 years. (Sources: "The Earth as Transformed by Human Action" (Cambridge); Scientific American) (pg. C7)

HEADLINE: Top Republican on a House Panel Is Charged With Accepting Bribes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, May 5

 BODY:
A Federal grand jury today indicted United States Representative Joseph M. McDade, the ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee and on its military subcommittee, on charges of racketeering, conspiracy and accepting bribes from five military contractors and an industry lobbyist.
According to the five-count indictment, Mr. McDade was charged with receiving scores of bribes and gifts, including a golfing umbrella, $7,500 for his son's college tuition and $15,750 in "sham campaign contributions" from one contractor. The document said Mr. McDade had solicited some of the gifts.
 
$100,000 in All
 In all, prosecutors say, Mr. McDade received about $100,000 in cash, gifts and services from contractors and their lobbyists from 1983 to 1988. In return, the indictment says, Mr. McDade used his powerful position in the House to obtain Government contracts for the companies. 
 The document also charges that Mr. McDade concealed the bribes by repeatedly falsifying financial statements that he is required to file under Federal disclosure laws.
Most of the charges in the indictment involve United Chem-Con Corporation, which was based in Lancaster, Pa., and is now defunct. But some charges involve Westland Corporation, an oil company in Conroe, Tex., GSGS & B, a Scranton architectural firm, and two Long Island contractors, the Grumman Corporation and the Sperry Corporation, which is now called the Unisys-Paramax Corporation.
 
Lobbyist and Executive Named
 The individuals named in the indictment were James Kane, a Sperry lobbyist who is now deceased, and Charles Gardner, a former Sperry vice president who was convicted of conspiracy, bribery and tax offenses in Virginia in another case involving a military contractor last year.
None of the corporations or lobbyists were charged in the indictment.
Mr. McDade, who is 60 and the dean of Pennsylvania's Congressional delegation, denies the charges, saying in a five-page statement on Monday that he had not broken any law. But in a clear acknowledgement that errors had been made, he said that he had repaid companies for contributions and services as soon as he realized that they were improper or that he had not been billed for services like free air travel and vacation houses. He would not elaborate.
Mr. McDade, who said in the statement that he would continue campaigning for a 16th term in the House, represents the 10th Congressional District, which includes Lackawanna County and Scranton, where he and his family live in a suburb. In last week's primaries, Mr. McDade ran unopposed in the Republican primary and he also won the Democratic primary as a write-in candidate.
In a statement issued today, Michael M. Baylson, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, said, "This indictment reflects the Justice Department's continued high priority commitment to fully investigating allegations of political corruption at every level of government and requesting indictments when evidence warrants."
If convicted on all the charges, Mr. McDade would face a maximum combined sentence of 34 years in prison and a fine of $1.25 million.
The last bribery scandal implicating members of Congress concerned Wedtech, a South Bronx military contractor. Last fall, former Representative Robert Garcia, a Bronx Democrat, was convicted of extorting bribes from the company and is awaiting sentencing. Former Representative Mario Biaggi, who was also implicated in the affair, was imprisoned from 1988 until last summer when he was released for medical reasons.
Mr. McDade is highly popular in northeastern Pennsylvania for having brought hundreds of millions of dollars in Federal projects to his district, including money for hospitals, colleges, highways, flood control and sewers. Nationally, Mr. McDade is known as a principal architect of the military buildup in the 1980's and has been the principal advocate for preserving an Army depot in his district that employs 4,000 people.
Most recently, he won Congressional support for the completion of Steamtown National Historic Site, a $67 million railroad yard and museum in Scranton that is viewed by many historians as an economic development project rather than a historic site.
Mr. McDade refused to comment today, but his press secretary, Jake F. O'Donnell, said that "the indictment was in line with what the Congressman had expected." Mr. McDade said in the statement released Monday in anticipation of today's indictment that Federal investigators had "harassed" and "hounded" him for the last 44 months and that they had turned his life into "a living nightmare."
Federal prosecutors said that the charges grew out of the investigation and prosecution of executives of the United Chem-Con Corporation, which had offices in Renovo in Mr. McDade's district. The company, which made steel cargo containers and bulk mail containers from 1978 to 1987, received about 90 percent of its business from the Federal Government without competitive bidding under a Federal program to help minority-owned businesses.
But the mismanaged company went bankrupt in 1987, and its president, James Christian, served several years in jail on charges that he and 11 others defrauded the Government of more than $12 million.
The indictment today charged that Mr. McDade took bribes disguised as campaign contributions and honoraria, as well as illegal gratuities in the form of free travel on corporate aircraft, a free vacation at a Delaware beach condominium, clothing and golf equipment.
The indictment also charged that he extorted from United Chem a $10,000 contribution for a charity event in Washington. In return, the indictment said Mr. McDade used "his influence to intercede and cause others to intercede with employees of the Department of the Navy, Small Business Administration, United States Postal Service and other departments and agencies of the United States to induce the award of contracts" and contract modifications to the company.
The indictment also said Mr. McDade "conspired" with several military contractors to obtain free airplane trips. The contractors included United Chem, Grumman and Sperry.

HEADLINE: KOHL URGES JAPAN TO INCREASE HELP FOR EAST EUROPE

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 5

 BODY:
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said today that his country had "reached the limit of our capacity" to help the countries of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and he launched an unusually blunt appeal to Japan to offer them more aid.
Addressing members of the American Newspaper Publishers Association gathered at the United Nations, Mr. Kohl said that Germany had done as much as it could to help these countries make the transition from Communism to democracy and market economies. He insisted that the time had come for Japan "to contribute more than it has up to now toward this reform effort." 
 This is not the first time that Germany has indicated displeasure with the level of assistance offered to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union by Japan and other Western countries. But today's speech represented one of the Chancellor's strongest and most direct criticisms of Japan so far.
 
German Economic Problems
 Although Mr. Kohl spoke of the "hardy state" of the German economy, his appeal to Japan for more help comes when the country's growing economic difficulties clearly limit his margin of maneuver. The costs of unification with East Germany have sent the German budget deficit soaring, while a public sector strike is currently paralyzing the country's transport system and many other services. [Page A6.]
Mr. Kohl warned that without more help, the world could face new risks that are "primarily of an economic and social nature."
But if Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are left to cope with their economic problems alone, Mr. Kohl said, the rest of the world could face "uncontrollable political developments" as well as destabilizing new flows of refugees.
 
Stocks of Arms in East
 "For a long time to come," the German Chancellor continued, "there will be enormous stocks of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons in the successor republics of the former Soviet Union. They remain a source of danger against a background of political instability and hence conflict."
As long as such risks remain, the Chancellor said, a "substantial presence of North American forces in Western Europe and Germany remains indispensable for the security of our two nations."
Mr. Kohl said that Germany had pledged the equivalent of $47 billion to the former Soviet Union and a further $65 billion to the Eastern European nations, with most of this second sum going to the territories of the former East Germany.
"Now especially it is time for Japan, an exporting nation, to assume a larger share of the West's common responsibility and, in keeping with her economic strength, to help insure the success of the reforms in Central, Eastern and Southeast Europe and in the Commonwealth of Independent States," he said.
The International Monetary Fund warned this month that the former Soviet republics will need $44 billion in foreign aid this year, and as much as $100 billion in outside assistance over the next four years, to insure that their transition to market economies does not break down.
"To play a waiting game and save in the wrong place would be the worst of all possible investments in our common future," the Chancellor said.
Japan appeared upset earlier this month when President Bush and Chancellor Kohl announced a $24 billion aid package for Russia in the name of the Group of Seven major industrialized nations, of which Japan is a member.
Diplomats say Germany is particularly worried that Japan, which has offered only modest aid to the East so far, may drag its feet further in an effort to put pressure on Moscow to return a handful of islands at the southern end of the Kurile chain. The islands were seized by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II.
In an effort to promote a settlement of the territorial dispute, the German Government has offered be help mediate between Tokyo and Moscow.
Mr. Kohl warned the former Soviet republics that they can only reasonably expect continued Western assistance if they "drastically" reduce military spending and agree to ratify and respect all international disarmament agreements.
 
Pact on Missile Technology
 Ukraine and Belarus, two of three new independent republics with long-range nuclear missiles stationed on their territories, have said they will sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as non-nuclear weapon states, returning these missiles to Russia, which is allowed such weapons under the treaty.
But the third, Kazakhstan, has not yet unequivocally promised to sign the treaty and thus renounce the use of nuclear weapons. In addition, Russia has not yet joined an international agreement limiting the spread of long-range missiles called the Missile Technology Control Regime and is currently discussing the possible sale of space rocket technology to India and Brazil on terms that would breach this pact.
Considerable uncertainty still surrounds the amount of economic assistance the Western world has offered so far to the emerging democracies in the former Soviet bloc and the relative contributions of Japan, Germany and the other major industrial nations who make up the Group of Seven.
An informal estimate by an international banking institute has Germany offering some $45 billion in all kinds of economic commitments between September 1990 and February 1992, followed by Italy with $6.2 billion, the United States with $5 billion and Japan offering $2.6 billion.
It is also unclear just how the new $24 billion aid package for Russia announced April 1 will be divided among Japan and other donor countries and how much represents new money rather than existing promises.
Mr. Kohl spoke to the publishers in the General Assembly chamber, which is occasionally used by private organizations for such addresses.

HEADLINE: Caribbean Exodus: U.S. Is Constant Magnet

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic

 BODY:
Before dawn on many days, in a ritual repeated across the Caribbean, long lines of people anxious to build new lives in the United States begin forming outside the high white walls of the American Consulate here.
Inevitably, many fail to clear the barrier before the building's sprawling courtyard is filled and no new applicants are admitted. But for those turned away, there are touts outside buzzing like eager ticket scalpers, offering illicit passage aboard small boats to Puerto Rico, the perilous first stop for many on the way to New York or Miami. 
 "You'll never get the visa," said a recruiter who identified himself as A. A., explaining that he had adopted the initials of American Airlines to help drum up business. "Don't be an idiot. Ride with us and your chances are much better."
Scenes like this occur daily throughout the Caribbean, a place affected perhaps more than any other by the gravitational pull of the United States.
Hit by hard economic times and seduced more than ever by influences like mass tourism and satellite television, this region of 15 independent countries and a smattering of dependencies of the United States and European countries, with a total population of only about 33 million, has been consistently exporting more of its people in percentage terms than any other area of the world.
While populous countries scattered widely around the globe, from Mexico to Thailand, often lead in one United States immigration category or another, a handful of Caribbean nations sit at or near the top of virtually every ranking.
"In some of these smaller countries, if you measure emigration as a portion of their total population, the numbers you come up with are just incredible," said David Simcox, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based group. "Tiny states like St. Kitts and Nevis, Grenada and Belize are sending 1 percent to 2 percent of their citizens to the United States every year, meaning they are basically exporting all of their population growth to us."
Between 1981 and 1990, the four Caribbean nations that supply the largest number of immigrants together accounted for nearly 12 percent all legal immigrant admissions to the United States, according to Immigration and Naturalization Service data. The Dominican Republic sent 251,803 people to the United States, Jamaica 213,805, Haiti 140,163, and Guyana, a South American country that considers itself Caribbean in its economic and social structure, 95,374.
In 1990, 111,000 citizens of those countries already living in the United States applied to become legal residents. For Mexico, by far the largest supplier of illegal immigrants, that number stood at about 2,200,000. Mexico is not included among Caribbean nations, although it has some Caribbean coastline.
Debates rage over how much immigration the United States can support and which regions of the world should be given preference. The effect of the growing Caribbean presence, meanwhile, can be seen in most large American cities, especially on the East Coast, where people from the region have often created new communities or revitalized old ones in places like New York, Boston, Miami and Baltimore.
 
Islands Are a First Stop
 Much attention has been focused on the surge of Haitians fleeing the violence in their country and the effects of an economic embargo imposed after a military coup there last September. But experts say the thousands who line up patiently each day at consulates around this region and the hundreds more who attempt clandestine trips each week constitute a far more formidable wave.
In the tiny English-speaking countries of the Leeward Islands, with their depressed banana economies, those who cannot get visas now steadily make their way to the United States Virgin Islands, where a third of the population is composed of people from elsewhere in the region. For many of the newly arrived, the relatively prosperous islands are merely a stopover on the way north.
In Guyana, desperate citizens who strike out on the visa line or cannot afford plane tickets often head north island by island, stopping awhile for short-term jobs, leapfrogging their way up the long Caribbean archipelago to the economic promised land.
In Communist Cuba, those fed up with their own bureaucracy or the interminable wait at the backlogged United States consular office escape aboard small boats and even makeshift rafts, hoping to hit the Florida Keys. So far this year, more than 2,000 Cubans have gone to the United States in this fashion; American law allows them to become legal residents almost immediately upon arrival.
Experts explaining the region's disproportionate weight among United States immigrants say that in addition to the classic factors of economic opportunity and proximity, long-established West Indian communities in American cities have served as a magnet and facilitator, providing family ties, money, legal help and even hiding places to an extent that immigrants of few other regions can match.
 
Many Arrive Illegally
 On top of their officially recorded contributions to the United States' immigration, each of the larger Caribbean islands provides substantial numbers of illegal immigrants. The Immigration and Naturalization Service declines to provide data on the number of illegal immigrants from individual countries, saying that in any case such estimates are highly imprecise.
For Caribbean countries, the phenomenon brings problems, including 'brain drains" of educated and trained people, and benefits, like the large amounts of money earned by emigres and sent home to relatives.
Jamaica, a relatively large Caribbean nation of 2.54 million people, saw 213,805 people, a number that is nearly 9 percent of its present population, emigrate to the United States in the 1980's, a higher percentage than any other country in the world. The island furnished nearly 3 percent of all United States immigration in that period, according to Immigration and Naturalization Service data.
Alarmed by the loss of so many of its people, including many of the country's most ambitious and best-trained young adults, Jamaica commissioned a study of emigration that concluded that the island, with an annual per capita income of only slightly more than $1,000, was in effect providing foreign aid to its vastly richer neighbor.
"The Jamaicans concluded they were training all of these people, nurses, teachers, doctors and then watching them go off to the U.S.," said Anthony P. Maingot, a Trinidad-born sociologist at Florida International University in Miami. "In exchange, they complained they were getting a paltry $41 million in aid."
 
Money Flows Back
 On the other side of the ledger is the amount of money sent back to relatives in the island nations by people living and working in the United States.
"You are losing good people, of course," Mr. Maingot said. "But those are the kind of people who can send back money, who can lobby for you. There is really a synergism at work there."
John F. May, a demographer with the Population Reference Bureau in Washington who focuses on the Caribbean, said: "Remittances have completely changed the structure of income distribution in some places. In Haiti, there was a boom in the construction sector that began in the 1970's, which mostly came as a result of this money. People may send only $20 or $25 a month, but you are talking about tens of thousands of people, and the total has a very big impact."
The Dominican Republic, Haiti and Jamaica are among the five nations that have lost the largest percentages of their populations to United States immigration in the last decade, according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Laos and El Salvador are the two other leaders.
American immigration officials say that in recent years Santo Domingo, the capital of this country of seven million people, has had either the second or third busiest American consulate in the world. These days it issues more visas to immigrants that any other office in the region, and the second most in the world after Manila.
 
Rejection Rate Is 70 Percent
 Seemingly undeterred by an overall rejection rate of about 70 percent, crowds of Dominicans show up here daily in the hopes of becoming one of the 300 to 350 who will be interviewed and, if truly lucky, gain legal entry to the United States.
"It has become like a game, the wheel of fortune or the national lottery," said Harry Edward Jones, American Consul General in Santo Domingo. "People leave their kids with relatives. They will leave anything behind for a chance at a job in the United States."
In Santo Domingo, officials say that part of the "game" increasingly includes elaborate attempts to reinvent one's past, pose as a legitimate student, forge documents or claim fictional, well-to-do relatives, preferably already living in the United States, to increase the chances of being granted a visa.
For many Dominicans, like others in the Caribbean, the small odds of obtaining a visa, or the risks of trying to enter the United States illegally, seem worth taking because of limited opportunities at home and the powerfully seductive images of life in America.
"The elites of this country have always sent their children to be educated in the United States, and when they have returned, it has always been a triumphant return, looking good and speaking English," said a Dominican newspaper editor who asked not to be identified. "The message for the rest of us has been so well received it has assumed an almost demonic force. If you stay here like good Dominicans, you will be left behind."
American officials say that more than 30,000 Dominicans travel illegally by boat each year to Puerto Rico, where they may travel freely to the continental United States. By comparison, the number of Haitians who have been intercepted at sea since September stands at 20,000.
Of those trying to enter Puerto Rico by boat, only 3,500 or so are caught each year, but untold hundreds more die when their boats capsize, officials say.
Asked why they wished to leave their country, Dominicans of a wide range of backgrounds who lined up for visa interviews echoed the residents of other Caribbean islands who complain that their nations have few opportunities for them and their children.
"Being so close to the United States, what we have developed is a kind of circular movement of people," said Frank Moya-Pons, a Dominican historian and economic development consultant. "Dominicans work there, stay for some years and come back. Even when they don't come back definitively, people travel often, bringing goods, money, merchandise, but, most importantly, new values."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
CLINTON, IN ATTACK ON PRESIDENT, TIES RIOTS TO 'NEGLECT'

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
In a counterattack on the Bush Administration, Gov. Bill Clinton said yesterday that the riots in Los Angeles resulted in part from "12 years of denial and neglect" of festering social problems under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
Mr. Clinton said he was amazed and appalled at comments on Monday by the White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, suggesting that the riots resulted from social welfare programs created by Democrats in the 1960's and 1970's. 
 "It's just amazing," said Mr. Clinton, the likely Presidential nominee of the Democratic Party. "Republicans have had the White House for 20 of the last 24 years, and they have to go all the way back to the 60's to find somebody to blame. I don't care who's to blame. I want to do something about the problems."
 
'They Are Not Serious'
 Mr. Clinton said the real cause of the riots included "12 years of denial and neglect" of social problems under the Reagan and Bush Administrations.
"They are not serious about any of these domestic issues," said Mr. Clinton, who has served for more than a decade as Governor of Arkansas, one of the nation's poorest states. "I was appalled by that comment" of Mr. Fitzwater.
In Washington, President Bush accelerated his efforts to demonstrate concern about the riots in Los Angeles, moving up a scheduled trip to the city as the Justice Department dispatched 50 officials there to oversee Federal investigations of riot-related violence. [Page A24.]
 
Proposals for Aid
 Mr. Clinton, in discussions of the country's urban problems, often emphasizes the role of Government as a social catalyst rather than paternalistic benefactor. He says that Government programs alone cannot solve deep-rooted social problems and that poor people must shun welfare and take responsibility for their own lives.
After visiting Los Angeles on Monday to inspect the damage from the riots and looting, Mr. Clinton said he would use the money saved from cuts in military spending to invest in construction of housing, streets and other public works projects in Los Angeles and other cities. He said that the minimum wage, now at $4.25 an hour, should be automatically increased each year to keep pace with inflation.
Mr. Clinton's reaction to Mr. Fitzwater came in a formal speech and in informal remarks at the 106th annual convention of the American Newspaper Publishers Association, held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan.
In his speech, Mr. Clinton said, "The question of this White House, according to the morning papers, is not, 'What are we going to do?' but, 'Who are we going to blame?' "
He added, "I don't want scapegoats, but I do want action."
Mr. Clinton said that tracing the cause of the riots to the social programs and liberal approaches of the 1960's was "clearly mere posturing and almost unbelievable," since Republicans have controlled the White House for so long.
Mr. Clinton says in speeches that he is trying to define a new approach to the pervasive social problems of America's cities, a "third way," well to the left of Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan, well to the right of Lyndon B. Johnson, Hubert H. Humphrey and their Great Society programs.
Critics at the White House and in President Bush's re-election campaign say Mr. Clinton is slick or slippery because he equivocates on many issues. But on domestic social policy, Mr. Clinton is deliberately trying to steer a middle course, which could attract conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans without alienating liberal Democrats.
 
'Didn't Ask for a Grant'
 Mr. Clinton said he found strong support for his approach among community leaders whom he consulted amid the smoldering ruins of black, Hispanic and Korean-American neighborhoods in South-Central Los Angeles.
"They didn't ask for a grant or a handout," Mr. Clinton reported. "Nobody said, 'We're expecting a big check from the Government.' Rather, they asked for investment in small businesses, for help in creating a free enterprise system in the inner city.
"I saw people who want a third way, a different way, a new approach to our problems, not a big new bunch of top-down money coming from Washington, not 12 more years of neglect coming from Washington. They want basic empowerment at the grass-roots level, which is different from what either party has done in the past. They want to work through community-based organizations instead of through Federal bureaucracy."
Until last week, liberal Democrats like Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio refused to support Mr. Clinton on the ground that he scorned the party's liberal political orthodoxy, with its heritage of Great Society welfare programs from the 1960's.
But now, the Arkansas Governor is being criticized by Republicans on the ground that he and his party have defended such programs.
Speaking on Monday about the riots in Los Angeles, Mr. Fitzwater said, "We believe that many of the root problems that have resulted in inner-city difficulties were started in the 60's and 70's," and he asserted that many of the social welfare programs begun in those decades "have failed."
The Republicans' attack on Mr. Clinton presents a paradox: They criticize the Arkansas Governor for embracing the same policies that liberal Democrats criticized him for abandoning.
Mr. Clinton's social policy is similar, in some respects, to what politicians describe as the "bleeding-heart conservatism" of Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. It is even more similar to the ideas promoted by James P. Pinkerton, a former aide to President Bush who now works as a full-time counselor to the Bush-Quayle re-election campaign.
 
Wean the Poor Off Welfare
 Mr. Pinkerton, like Mr. Kemp, advocates the selective use of tax credits and other Government incentives to stimulate private investment in the inner city and to wean poor people off welfare. Richard G. Darman, director of the White House budget office, has ridiculed Mr. Pinkerton's idea for a "new paradigm" in social policy, and Mr. Bush let the notion languish until this spring, when Presidential politics prompted him to take a new interest in domestic policy.
The following sentence could be uttered with conviction by Mr. Clinton, Mr. Kemp or Mr. Pinkerton: "We must discard the failed bureaucratic model for fighting poverty and instead empower individuals to control their lives through the power of property ownership and entrepreneurship." (In fact, it was written by Mr. Kemp.)
Mr. Clinton charges that Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan neglected the problems of America's cities, but at the same time, he distinguishes his own prescription from the ones espoused by liberal Democrats and many labor unions. "There is a role for Government, but it has to be carried out through grass-roots community organizations" rather than through Federal agencies and bureaucrats, Mr. Clinton said Monday, because "the Government does not always know what is best or how to do it."
Mr. Clinton said the community leaders of South-Central Los Angeles "are not asking for a return to what we tried in the 1960's and lost political support for, which is more direct aid through top-down Government bureaucracy."
"My sense is that there will be more Federal money, and there should be, but that it will not be a massive bail out," Mr. Clinton said. "The money will go exclusively to economic growth or to law enforcement for community-based policing. There will be more and more emphasis on what the Federal Government can do to get the banking system to work, to make free enterprise work in the inner city. There will be more emphasis on putting money out through community nonprofit organizations, through churches and other groups that are less bureaucratic and more directly connected with the community."

HEADLINE: Yields Fall Once Again At Banks

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit were lower for the week ended today, according to The Bank Rate Monitor. The week was the 13th consecutive one in which overall yields have been lower or flat, the longest such period in more than two and a half years, The Monitor noted.
Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor, said that since February yields on one-year certificates had been unchanged, while five-year certificates were up an average of 35 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
 "On one hand banks are saying that the next interest rate cycle is up," Mr. Heady said, "while on the other hand weakness in the economy is holding the shorter end down."
"While the odds favor a recovery, there is no clear sign as to when it will begin and interest rates rise," Mr. Heady added.
 
Rates on Bills Drop
 At the Treasury's auction of new three- and six-month bills, rates were down modestly at the offering on Monday. The auction, held the first business day of each week, is considered by many rate watchers as a good barometer of what many banks could be paying their depositors in the weeks ahead.
The discount rate on the three-month bill fell 6 basis points, to 3.65 percent, while the six-month bill dropped 7 points, to 3.78 percent.
Yields at New York area banks fell slightly more than they had in the previous week, with the average yield on a money market account down 3 basis points, to 3.50 percent, while yields on three- and six-month certificiates declined by an average 2 basis points, to 3.57 percent and 3.73 percent, respectively.
Savings banks in the New York area outdid commercial banks in dropping yields on C.D., but the commercial banks went further in cuts on money market accounts.
Commercial banks cut 4 basis points off the average money market account, to 3.24 percent, while adding a point to a three-month C.D., taking it to 3.40 percent. Their six-month C.D.'s were unchanged at 3.48 percent.
 
Declines at Savings Banks
 Savings banks cut money market yields by a basis point, to 3.77 percent, while reducing the yield on a three-month C.D. by 4 basis points, to 3.76 percent, and lowering a six-month by 3 basis points, to 3.98 percent.
The biggest changes in yields amoNg New York area banks came at Fleet Bank, which cut its money market account by 50 basis points, to 3.50 percent, and at First Nationwide, which dropped the yields an average 40 basis points on three- and six-month C.D.'s, to 3.35 percent and 3.40 percent, respectively.
For 20 large banks outside the New York market, the yield declines matched those in New York,with the yield on a money market account down 4 basis points, to 3.38 percent, and a six-month C.D. down 3 points, to 3.75 percent.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, May 6, 1992. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open anaccount, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Jumped 18.3% In Late April

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 5

 BODY:
Sales of North American-built cars and light trucks rose 18.3 percent in late April. While automotive analysts said the gain fell short of a full-fledged recovery, it provided a lift to beleaguered auto makers and retail dealers.
Sales of domestic cars rose 10.8 percent in late April, to 235,864, and domestic light-truck sales rose 31 percent, to 163,389. The total sales of domestic vehicles, 399,253, compared with 300,075 in the corresponding period of 1991. 
 The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for domestically built cars was 6.1 million for the April 21-30 period. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for all of April was 6.0 million, compared with 5.5 million for the month a year earlier. The industry considers cars assembled in the United States, Canada and Mexico to be domestically made.
 
 
Weak Sales a Year Earlier
 Because vehicle sales were so weak in April 1991, the fairly large percentage increases were not enough to raise sales to a level that analysts would call healthy or robust.
Over all, the industry sold 1.12 million vehicles in April, a year-to-year increase of 8.2 percent. That consisted of 718,429 cars, an increase of 3.4 percent, and 401,575 light trucks, up 18 percent.
"We're stuck in neutral," said Harvey Heinbach, the automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch. "The rate does understate the fact that retail buyers have replaced fleet buyers somewhat, but it's still disappointing."
Wendy Needham, automotive analyst for Smith Barney in New York, said: "A lot of positive things are going on that the gross numbers are masking, such as overall profitability. The quality of the sales is better this year."
There were nine selling days in the late-April period this year, compared with eight selling days in 1991. Percentage increases for the period account for the difference in the number of selling days.
Tom Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, acknowledged that sales had been stalled at about the same rate since last fall. But, he said, "we remain convinced that the recovery in the economy, which is very real, will soon make an appearance in the auto industry."
D. Kim Hackett, owner of Pontiac and Saturn franchises in Orlando, Fla., said, "The economy is coming on strong." He said Saturn sales had doubled from a year ago, when the models were just becoming available, and Pontiac sales were up 30 percent in April. He said that instead of buying station wagons, customers had been choosing the Pontiac Trans Sport mini-van.
The General Motors Corporation, the industry leader, reported a 10.7 percent increase in late-April sales of domestically built cars, to 110,754, and a 21.1 percent increase for domestically built light trucks, to 58,871. For the entire month, G.M. sold 6.7 percent more domestically built cars, or 252,818, and 11.5 percent more domestically built light trucks, or 133,331. Over all, G.M. sold 398,745 vehicles in April, including domestics and imports, a 6.9 percent increase from April 1991.
The Ford Motor Company posted a 5.5 percent increase in domestic car sales for late April, to 58,088, and a 19.2 percent increase in light trucks, to 49,824. For the month, domestic car sales rose 9.4 percent, to 142,461, and purchases of light trucks rose 20.3 percent, to 126,070. Over all, Ford sold 275,812 domestic and imported vehicles in April, a 13.2 percent increase from April 1991.
 Robert L. Rewey, Ford's vice president of sales operations, said, "April was the fifth month in a row that our truck and total vehicle sales both increased versus the prior year."
The Chrysler Corporation sold 49,219 domestic cars in April, an increase of 5.2 percent from a year earlier, and 94,660 domestic trucks, an increase of 38.5 percent. Chrysler does not report sales on a 10-day cycle. Chrysler said its total April sales, which rose 23.8 percent to 150,227, were the best in nearly two years.
 
Bigger Share for Big Three
 Benefiting from price increases for vehicles sold by Japanese auto makers, the Big Three gained market share last month. G.M., Ford and Chrysler sold 71.3 percent of all vehicles, compared with 68.3 percent a year ago. Japanese auto makers, including those with manufacturing operations in the United States, sold 23.3 percent, compared with 24.8 percent last year. The share of all other importers was 5.4 percent, down from 6.9 percent a year earlier.
The Toyota Motor Corporation's vehicle sales for the month rose 9.1 percent, to 81,756. About 37 percent of Toyota's cars and trucks were built in the United States.
The Nissan Motor Company sold 48,640 cars and trucks, about even with its sales a year earlier. The Honda Motor Company sold 62,689 cars, down 9.4 percent from the April 1991 total of 69,177. The Mazda Motor Corporation sold 39,238 cars and light trucks, up 28.4 percent. And the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation sold 16,159 cars and trucks for the month, down 14 percent from a year earlier.

HEADLINE: U.S. Court Suspends Capital Law Aiding Minority Businesses

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5

 BODY:
A Federal appeals court today ordered a temporary suspension of the District of Columbia's minority set-aside contracting law, saying it violated the civil rights of a white-owned business.
The decision jeopardizes a 15-year city policy and tens of millions of dollars in contracts that Washington awards annually to minority-owned businesses. 
 "The district will need to make major changes in its letting of contracts," the court said in an opinion written by Judge A. Raymond Randolph of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly said the decision reflected the "economic retrenchment" minorities have suffered during the Reagan-Bush years.
But she said as a safeguard against such a ruling, her office had already been planning other ways to encourage minority businesses and will hold a series of seminars on how to compete for government contracts.
The decision requires a lower court to temporarily block application of the law to the O'Donnell Construction Company, which is owned by whites. While the appellate court left the decision on making the injunction permanent to the lower court, it said that so far Washington had failed to show the law did not violate the company's constitutional right to equal protection under the law.
The law requires agencies to set aside 35 percent of city contracts for minority-owned businesses. Although the law calls the 35 percent figure a "goal," the court said that figure was in practice a quota.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE RIOTS;
Riots Inflamed a Festering South-Central Economy

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 5

 BODY:
As officials develop plans for the future of the ravaged South-Central area, residents say that rebuilding and restocking stores there will not be nearly enough to address the resentment generated over the years by the community's racially fractured, barely functional economy.
Even before last week's spasm of violence, South-Central Los Angeles was close to an economic wasteland, with few stores, banks or well-paying jobs for its predominantly black and Hispanic residents. Per capita annual income, at $7,600 for the core of South-Central in 1990, was 52.6 percent lower than for Los Angeles County as a whole. There is one supermarket for every 40,646 residents in South-Central's core, as against one for every 23,224 residents in the county. 
 Living just a few miles from the glittering office towers of downtown Los Angeles and the palm-lined boulevards of Beverly Hills, the 523,000 residents of South-Central's 25 square miles have always been aware of such disparities.
"We may have access to stores, but everything is second-rate," said Mary Bolden, a black resident of South-Central. "You have to learn to settle for that or go without, and that brings on anger."
 
Widening Chasm
 The inequities, economists and other analysts said, have only grown in the last two decades. While most of California boomed, South-Central suffered from a flight of well-paid manufacturing jobs, an exodus of middle-class blacks and a reluctance among large businesses to operate there.
"What's happened is the culmination of frustration on two fronts, the first being a series of events over the last decade showing that blacks have disproportionately been treated in a disrespectful manner by the police," said James Johnson, the director of the Center for the Study of Urban Poverty at the University of California at Los Angeles. "The other has to do with the steadily declining access to mainstream economic opportunities. Over the last two decades blacks in those communities have become increasingly isolated economically."
The face of the South-Central area has been changed by a rapid influx of Hispanic residents and a decline in the black population. From 1980 to 1990, the area lost more than 48,000 black residents, while the Hispanic population grew by 146,000, bringing the racial mix to about 55 percent black and 45 percent Hispanic in 1990, from 65 percent black and 17 percent Hispanic a decade earlier, according to the United States Census Bureau.
 
No Consensus on Remedy
 Racial tensions are growing in the area. Black residents have become increasingly resentful of the rapidly growing Hispanic population, which economists said is taking the majority of the region's low-wage jobs.
And as the riots made clear, many black and Hispanic residents harbor considerable hostility toward Korean immigrants, who have become the area's merchants but employ few people from the neighborhood in their family-run stores.
As a result, South-Central residents and economists said, there is no single political power base or clear consensus on what needs to be done to rebuild the area. That fractiousness, they said, is certain to slow the effort being headed by Peter V. Ueberroth, the former baseball commissioner, to rebuild the area and address the underlying economic problems. Mr. Ueberroth said last weekend that the rebuilding effort could be effective only if the diverse community, as well as government officials and businesses, came together and made a commitment to working together over the long term.
 
'Can't Get Any Worse'
 Mr. Ueberroth, who organized the nearly flawless 1984 Summer Olympic Games but who is little known in minority neighborhoods, has won commitments from several local banks to provide small-business loans and from supermarket companies to repair and reopen their stores. But it remains uncertain how much financial support Mr. Ueberroth will obtain from governments and corporations, or what specific steps he plans beyond repairing the physical damage from the riot.
The looting, arson and violence, which destroyed thousands of businesses and caused as much as $1 billion in damage, exposed the fragile nature of the local economy.
"The Rodney King incident was the match that lit the fire that exposed the increasing disparity between the haves and have-nots," said Carlton Jenkins, the managing director of Founders National Bank, the only black-owned commercial bank in Los Angeles. "It's been a situation festering for some time in the economically disenfranchised communities who live every day with the knowledge that they've gotten everything they're ever going to get."
With the area's few grocery stores and most of its convenience stores destroyed or closed because of arson and looting, residents were unable to find food and other essential goods, forcing them to travel miles away from home, line up for handouts or go without. People who needed to cash paychecks or welfare checks found the area's few banks and most of its check-cashing services shut down. Many residents were unable to get to their jobs for days because bus service was canceled.
"Thank God my supervisor understands," said Tajuana Falls, a South-Central resident who could not get to her job as a clerk at the county courthouse because she had been unable to pick up her paycheck or buy her bus pass. "It can't get any worse than this."
The unemployment rate in the core of the South-Central area in 1990 was 7.1 percent, according to a survey by the Census Bureau, as against 5.8 percent for all of Los Angeles County. Among black teen-agers, the rate in South-Central was 43.8 percent, and among blacks aged 25 to 54, the rate was 9.1 percent, the Census Bureau said. Many economists think the census data substantially understate the unemployment rate in South-Central.
 
Manufacturers Relocated
 In any case, economists said, the unemployment statistics understate the economy's deteriorating condition. Mr. Johnson of the University of California at Los Angeles said that from 1978 to 1982 alone, South-Central and neighboring areas lost 70,000 high-paying, previously stable manufacturing jobs of the sort that supported the black middle class. During that nationwide recession, companies like General Motors and Bethlehem Steel relocated or closed their plants.
Mr. Johnson said new jobs had replaced many of the lost manufacturing jobs but that most of the new jobs, in industries like garment making, did not pay nearly as well and were often filled by Hispanic immigrants, some of them in the United States illegally.
"It's hard to get a job here because all these foreigners are coming in and working for $2.50 an hour, and they don't even speak English," said Patrick Burns, a black construction worker who said he had not had a job in three years.
Because the area has few large shopping centers, it has few retail and other service jobs compared to the city as a whole. And because many of the small stores are owned by Koreans and other Asian immigrants who bring enough money to finance their own operations and who tend to employ mostly family members, few jobs are available with neighborhood retailers.
Many residents and business executives say that unless political leaders reshape the rebuilding effort to address underlying problems like the declining quality of the city's schools and the lack of job training and bank financing available to South-Central residents, nothing will change.
"These folks come out of school unable to read, much less read a blueprint at an aerospace company," said Mr. Jenkins, the banker. "There's also the glass-ceiling concept, which suggests that the best opportunities are in minority-owned businesses. But if you look at the number of minority-owned businesses, you know they can't absorb many people looking for work."

HEADLINE: In Mississippi Education Battle, New Governor Loses on First Veto

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, May 5

 BODY:
In its continuing effort to improve the state's historically poor record of supporting education, the Mississippi Legislature has voted to override the new Governor's veto of a sales tax increase to $168 million for school buildings, books and supplies.
The dramatic defeat for Gov. Kirk Fordice, the state's first Republican governor in 115 years, came as an unusual weekend session of the Legislature extended into Monday. On a vote of 82 to 38, the House finally provided the necessary two-thirds margin for an override. The voting capped months of bickering in which Mr. Fordice, who had campaigned on a platform of no new taxes, had vetoed the measure without offering any alternative. 
 The outcome provided an occasion for partisan cheering by Democrats and was an omen of tough sledding ahead for Mr. Fordice, who Democratic State Auditor Steve Patterson said had shown "a lack of sophistication in being able to negotiate" with the Democratic-controlled Legislature. He and others argued that with his rigid and conservative ideology, Mr. Fordice had misread voters.
"Anytime you lose on an issue that is as visible and as important as this is, it's not going to strengthen your hand as Governor," said William Winter, a former Democratic Governor who is credited with starting the movement in the state to increase spending on education. "It is happening in the first session at the start of his first term when he should be at the height of his power. This is not a good beginning."
But public education advocates among both Republicans and Democrats suggested that the override was less a vote against Republicans or Fordice and more a vote for public education that reflected the efforts of parent groups, teachers and higher education institutions. Most said it sent a signal that there was a sentiment for continuing change and improvement in public education that began more than a decade ago under Democratic governors.
Mississippi ranks 49th in the average per pupil spending for education by the states.
Jack Reed, a member of the state Board of Education who was the unsuccessful Republican candidate for governor in 1987, said the override of a veto so early in a new governor's term was "unusual" but added that it was not something that Mr. Fordice could not recover from. The Governor had failed to see that parents and not just educational professionals were for the tax increase, he said.
"But the veto override was surprising, and it was unusual," he said.
For his part Mr. Fordice said the long-term political impact of this early defeat would not be clear until November, when many legislators who voted to override the veto will seek re-election in redrawn legislative districts. He said he was convinced that the true will of the public against such an increase would become evident then.
"Some people say that I come out ahead politically no matter what because I stuck by my position," Mr. Fordice said in a telephone interview. "But we won't really know until November, and I think this vote will still be fresh in people's minds. But whatever happens, I'm not changing."
The Governor said he had opposed the sales tax increase that will go into effect on June 1 because its timing could "smother the improvements that are starting to show in an economy that has been down".
The 58-year-old Mr. Fordice, a construction company owner who is a conservative, defeated the incumbent Governor, Ray Mabus, a Democrat, in a surprise victory last November. Mr. Mabus came into office in 1987 amid a wave of new, young and fiscally conservative Democrats who were educated in the North and who many believed would represent the future leadership. But he and others in that group, like former Gov. Buddy Roemer of Louisiana, proved unable to last more than a single term.
The new law will increase the state sales tax to 7 percent from 6 percent on June 1 and produce $168 million for school buildings, books and supplies, as well as increases in discretionary money for the state's four-year and two-year colleges. Critical elements in its passage was the measure's requirement that new revenue be earmarked for these purposes, said Andy Mullins, a spokesman for the State Board of Education, as well as a requirement that school districts cut local property tax rates in the coming years to reflect the infusion of increases.
Legislative leaders like House Speaker Tim Ford, a Democrat from Tupelo, have pointed to these two features of the sales tax increase as making lawmakers more comfortable with them in an election year.
Even Lieut. Gov. Edward Briggs, a Republican, said Mr. Fordice had failed to counter the tax increase proposal with an affirmative approach to address declining revenue for education.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
Decoding the Remarks By Fitzwater on Riots

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5

 BODY:
President Bush's political supporters and opponents agree that when his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said Monday that the social welfare programs of the 1960's and 1970's were responsible for the Los Angeles riots, Mr. Fitzwater was talking in code. But they disagree about what he meant.
The supporters say Mr. Fitzwater was referring to an attitude that they say prevailed during the Great Society era, with Democratic encouragement, that poor people were not responsible for deviant behavior. 
Those who oppose the President hold that the spokesman was trying, without saying so directly, to appeal to voters who feel that Democratic programs were tilted to favor blacks.
Both sides agree that Mr. Fitzwater could not have been talking, in purely factual terms, about the giant health programs like Medicare and Medicaid, or Social Security retirement benefits that keep pace with inflation, or college scholarships and loans, or grants to grade schools and high schools based on the number of poor children attending them. They have become so much a part of the fabric of American society that it is difficult for legislators or policy makers in either party to imagine life without them.
 
Some Programs Praised
 And Mr. Fitzwater, who refuses on the record to elaborate on what he meant in his statement to reporters Monday, was certainly not thinking about the small Great Society programs like Head Start, the Job Corps and community health centers, which are widely praised by members of Mr. Bush's own Cabinet.
The President's press secretary may have been referring to Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the Government's main welfare program. It costs the Government about $15 billion a year, 3 percent of the $500 billion spent on Social Security and Medicare. But A.F.D.C. was started in the 1930's, and the most significant change, the law that requires welfare mothers to seek education and job training, was enacted in 1988 with bipartisan support and Mr. Bush's blessing.
Charles Murray, a social scientist whose book "Losing Ground: American Social Policy 1950-1980" (Basic, 1986) provided the policy justification for Republican cuts in social programs in the 1980's, is one of those who holds that general criticism of those programs is really an attack on an attitude prevalent in the 1960's that is still held by some Democrats.
"It's a mistake to try to demonize any particular program," Mr. Murray said in an interview today. But taken together, he added, the laws, court decisions and regulations that went on the books between 1964 and 1972 served to blame society for the problems of poor young people and to make it socially acceptable in some circles to become reliant on the public dole.
But Senator Jim Sasser of Tennessee, the Democratic chairman of the Budget Committee, reflected the view of many Bush critics that Mr. Fitzwater's statement was meant to generate racial antagonism. "This Administration has been very adept at playing the race card," Mr. Sasser said.
Whatever Mr. Fitzwater meant, the argument over whether social programs provide a critical safety net for the poor or merely foster dependency draws attention away from Mr. Bush's most serious political weakness, the poor state of the economy, and from his failure to press for programs that he himself says are the solutions to the problems of the cities.
Since John F. Kennedy talked about a rising tide lifting all boats, every President has held that the single best cure for poverty is a thriving economy. Here, for example, is an exchange from a Bush news conference last fall:
Question: Do you think you are going to do more for the Americans who are without jobs now and who are really poverty stricken?
Answer: I think we are beginning to see this economy move, and I think that, of course, is by far the best answer to jobs.
Yet, by almost any measure, the economy has done worse under Mr. Bush than under any other President since World War II.
In Mr. Bush's first three years in the White House, the economy grew a total of only 1.8 percent after adjusting for inflation. Even if the Administration's forecast for growth this year, 2.3 percent, turns out to be accurate, the four-year figure of 4.1 percent growth will be far and away the worst since the war.
Average economic growth for the 10 four-year terms beginning withPresident Harry S. Truman's in 1949 and ending with President Ronald Reagan's last term was 13.7 percent. The weakest periods, 7.3 percent growth in Dwight D. Eisenhower's second term and 7.6 percent in the Richard M. Nixon-Gerald R. Ford term, were almost twice as strong as the Bush record.
Looked at another way, the number of jobs in the country increased by only three-tenths of 1 percent from the time Mr. Bush became President through last March. Even if the economy picks up this year, the total number of jobs created in Mr. Bush's term will be less than half the worst previous four-year term.
 
Little White House Push
 Even Mr. Bush's strongest advocates hold that strengthening the economy is more important than realigning social programs. "A good economy," said Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, "is the best way to help individuals. It makes it possible for more people to escape the blighted areas."
Nonetheless, lawmakers say, the President has hardly lifted a finger to win Congressional passage of measures like enterprise zones, tax breaks for businesses starting up in poor neighborhoods, that he is now advocating as a solution for the problems of the cities.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said he might support some of Mr. Bush's initiatives in the social policy area but had never really been called on to do so.
"You could be a United States Senator for the last three years without knowing there was any Bush domestic agenda," Mr. Moynihan said. "I have never once felt it in terms of I've got to go to this hearing, or I've got to deal with this proposal."

HEADLINE: Dow Drops by 18.78, but Broader Market Is Mostly Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The majority of stock prices rose yesterday, even as the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average retreated from Monday's record, losing 18.78 points to close at 3,359.35.
On Monday, the main market barometer climbed 42.04 points, to a record 3,378.13, the 18th new high this year. But yesterday, traders said, institutional investors turned away from blue-chip stocks and spread their buying among other sectors, including technology and transportation issues. 
 Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by 935 to 783 on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume came to 200.6 million shares, up from 174.5 million Monday.
The active trading indicated that institutional investors refocused their attention from the Dow average -- which consists of big-name stocks like I.B.M., Coca-Cola and McDonald's -- to other areas. Most of the other market indexes gained.
The broader New York Stock Exchange index rose 0.08 point, to 229.50; the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks gained 4.53 points, to 588.07; the American Stock Exchange index rose 1.56 points, to 393.17, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 0.07 point, to 416.84.
Traders said they did not view the Dow's decline as a harbinger of a sell-off, although some investors sold stocks to capture profits at the record level. The decline was exaggerated late in the day by a flurry of computer-driven program sell orders.
"We had more buyers all day than sellers," said Dudley Eppel, a senior vice president at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation. "The Dow got hit for a change instead of being the leader."
 
Effects of Riot
 Monday's market rally was attributed partly to the end to rioting in Los Angeles. Traders had been worried about the riot's effects on the mood of the nation.
Also, investors were encouraged by the apparently steady but slow economic recovery, which could leave room for the Government to push down interest rates further. "It's the best environment -- slow growth, lower rates, no inflation," said Tony Cecin, equity trading director at Piper Jaffray Inc. in Minneapolis.
He said investors with sizable cash holdings were still being forced into the stock market to avoid low rates from fixed-income securities.
Among actively traded Big Board issues yesterday, I.B.M. continued upward, gaining 1 3/8, to 93 7/8, and leading other technology stocks higher. Hewlett-Packard was up 1 1/4, to 81 3/4; Texas Instruments rose 1 1/4, to 36, and Compaq gained 3/8, to 25 1/4.
In the over-the-counter market, Intel, the computer chip maker, rose 1 7/8, to 54 3/8. Among other technology stocks posting gains, Novell was up 1 1/8, to 54 3/8; Adobe Systems 2 1/2, to 47 1/2, and Microsoft 2 1/2, to 116 1/2.
Losers that helped depress the Dow included Caterpillar, off 2 5/8, to 53 1/2; Procter & Gamble, down 2, to 101 5/8, and United Technologies, down 1 1/2, to 53 1/4.
ITT rose 2 3/4, to 66 3/4, in heavy trading. The hotel, insurance and industrial-products conglomerate announced that its board had authorized a stock repurchase program for up to 25 million common shares.
Transportation stocks as a group were higher. AMR, parent of American Airlines, rose 2, to 68 7/8, and Southwest Airlines gained 2 3/4, to 41 3/4. Roadway Services rose 1 3/4, to 77 1/4, while Burlington Northern was 1 3/8 higher, to 45 7/8.

HEADLINE: CANADA TO DIVIDE ITS NORTHERN LAND

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, May 5

 BODY:
Maps of Canada are about to be redrawn after a vote that carves up Canada's north, setting the boundaries of what is to become a self-governing homeland for Eskimos.
By a 54 percent majority, the voters of the Northwest Territories took the momentous step on Monday, authorizing the split-up of their huge area into two separate territories divided by a zigzag line stretching from the Saskatchewan-Manitoba border practically to the North Pole. 
 The eastern portion, extending nearly to Greenland, covers 772,260 square miles, a third larger than the state of Alaska, and is inhabited by about 17,500 Eskimos, or Inuit, as they call themselves. It is this area that is to be administered by the Eskimos. They call the territory Nunavut, meaning Our Land.
For the Ottawa Government the next steps will be to draft legislation creating the new land and work with community leaders on plans for the transition, including a crash program of training Eskimos for administrative jobs in the Nunavut government.
 
'Speak With One Voice'
 "This is a very positive development for Canada," said Stephen Kakfwi, minister of intergovernmental and aboriginal affairs for the government of the Northwest Territories. "It shows that Canadians have the potential and capacity to support very strong change in favor of aboriginal people."
Rosemarie Kuptana, president of the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, the national political voice of the Eskimos, said the results "demonstrate that Inuit speak with one voice on Nunavut." Tapirisat is brotherhood.
Canada now consists of 10 provinces and two territories, the Yukon and the Northwest Territories. Provinces represent somewhat more evolved political units than the territories. The main practical difference is that provinces own their own land and mineral resources; land in the territories is owned by the federal Government.
Under the new arrangement, which is expected to come into effect after a seven-year transition, there will be three territories instead of two: the existing Yukon, Nunavut, and what's left of the Northwest Territories, populated by Indians of the Dene Nation in the Mackenzie Valley, Eskimos known as Inuvialuit around the Beaufort Sea, and whites, mainly around Yellowknife, the territorial capital.
The creation of Nunavut is tied to an agreement signed last December in which the Eskimos will get outright title to nearly 20 percent of the land in the new territory and are guaranteed $1.4 billion over 14 years as an economic jump-start for the new homeland.
One final formal obstacle to Nunavut is a vote scheduled for next November to ratify the land agreement. But the high turnout of Eskimos voting on Monday suggested that the November poll will be overwhelmingly affirmative.
Of 55,000 inhabitants of the Northwest Territories and 27,000 who were eligible to vote, those who actually took part in Monday's plebiscite numbered 15,484, a turnout of 56.5 percent.
In the eastern Arctic, where most of the Eskimos live, 72 percent voted and 87 percent said yes to the proposed boundary. In the western part of the Northwest Territories, where most of the local opponents of the split-up of the territory resides, 74 percent voted no.
 
Opposed by Dene Indians
 Many of the nonnatives in the west saw the division as a needless expense and a threat to jobs. The territorial government in Yellowknife is the town's biggest employer, but its functions would be cut once the new Nunavut comes into being with its own governing structures.
Some of the fears were expressed by Shirley M. McGrath, past president of the Chamber of Commerce of Yellowknife, who noted in an interview that businesses are closing at a rapid rate and "if we look at losing a lot of government jobs as well, then what do we have left?"
The Dene Indians opposed the boundary as well because it cuts through some of their traditional hunting and burial grounds.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Willkommen To Amerika's Sky

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
WHEN word got out that BMW was thinking of assembling cars in South Carolina, the only question anyone asked was "How soon can you come?" But whenever Lufthansa has hinted that it would like to fly Americans around the United States on American-made aircraft operated by American pilots, the company has been no more welcome than a snowstorm in Miami.
There are explanations for this apparent contradiction. For one thing, it's the law. The Civil Aviation Act of 1938 prohibits foreign control of a United States airline. For another, it makes for a plausible bargaining strategy: Investment rights remain a useful chip in Washington's sometime effort to increase global airline competition. 
 But Clark Onstad, a Washington lawyer and consultant to airlines who was a senior aviation official in the Carter Administration, thinks the time is ripe to make an exception. What is more, he is sure that President Bush has the legal authority to do it without Congressional approval.
The case for foreign ownership, Mr. Onstad argues, is as plain as the red ink dribbling off the airline industry's balance sheets. Three carriers (Eastern, Pan Am, Midway) met their maker last year. Three others (Continental, America West, T.W.A.) are in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. And two giants (Northwest, USAir) are vacuuming the seats for loose change. Only three major carriers -- American, United and Delta -- seem certain to weather the recessionary storms.
Fresh capital from abroad could not transform an ugly duckling into a high-flying swan. But Mr. Onstad contends that well-placed investments could see cash-starved carriers through next winter, giving them a fair chance to prove their mettle in the post-recession economy.
Of course, this capital need not come from foreign airlines. But they are the likeliest deep pockets because they want what even bankrupt American carriers have to offer -- access to the world's largest national market.
Foreign carriers already have the right to buy minority stakes in United States airlines. And several have: KLM owns stock in Northwest, S.A.S. in Continental, Ansett in America West, J.A.L. in Hawaiian. But under the Department of Transportation's interpretation of the law, foreign companies are not permitted to own enough to assert control over key airline policies -- everything from pricing to routes to aircraft selection.
Mr. Onstad argues that this interpretation of the statute is unnecessarily restrictive. The law specifies that an airline's president and two-thirds of the directors be American citizens, and that no more than 25 percent of voting stock be in foreign hands. But he believes that the Administration could allow foreigners to own preferred stock that gave them veto power over all material decisions, save those affecting United States security interests.
The Transportation Department has never given anyone a reason to believe it would entertain such a deal. Indeed, the department held up a far less radical proposal for an alliance between Northwest and the Dutch airline KLM before caving in to pressure from free-market types in the White House. Why might the regulators change now?
Foreign carriers have recently made it very, very clear that they would not open their purses simply to buy good will. Just after the Persian Gulf war, Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner reportedly tried and failed to persuade the Japanese carrier J.A.L. to buy a passive interest in a distressed United States airline.
Perhaps more important, the political stakes have grown. Three carriers including one of the biggest, Continental, are flying today at the sufferance of their creditors. And the fare war touched off by American Airlines' price restructuring last month is going to make it very difficult for them to amass enough cash during the summer season to make it through next winter.
Presumably, any airline liquidation would embarrass officials charged with shielding airline deregulation from vocal Congressional critics. But an election-year liquidation of Continental, the largest employer in George Bush's hometown of Houston, or America West, a major economic force in the Republican stronghold of Phoenix, would be an embarrassment indeed.
If the Administration chose to give the green light to a salvage job by a Lufthansa or a British Airways or a Singapore Airlines, there is little chance it could be thwarted by competitors or the distressed carrier's labor unions. Federal courts have proved very reluctant to second-guess regulators who buttress their decisions with even a shred of logic. The trickier tactical question is how to avoid a precedent that would weaken the bargaining leverage for, say, United to negotiate its entry into Europe's domestic airline markets.
But there is one clean place to draw the line: bankruptcy. Foreigners willing to revitalize a failing carrier might be welcomed. Those who simply sought competitive advantage in America would have to wait for their own governments to open their home markets.

HEADLINE: Purchasing Managers Raise Forecast for Manufacturing

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla., May 5

 BODY:
Citing signs of an improving economy, the National Association of Purchasing Management today raised its forecast for growth in manufacturing this year.
In its semiannual forecast, the association said its members expected 5.1 percent growth in factory revenues in 1992, before adjustments for inflation, which were expected to be minimal. 
 The forecast was up from a 4.2 percent nomimal growth prediction made by the group in December.
 
 
Growth Expected to Continue
 "The recent growth in the economy will continue to improve during the balance of 1992," said the forecast, which was released at a conference of the group.
The association surveys the purchasing managers at more than 300 manufacturing and industrial companies across the United States. Its monthly survey of manufacturing is closely watched by the financial markets for signs of the direction of the economy and interest rates.
Traders in the markets were surprised on Friday when the group's index slipped to 51.3 percent for April, from 54.1 percent in March. But the chairman of the group's business survey committee, Robert Bretz, said the April figure was probably an aberration.
"The major reason for the April decline was seasonal adjustment factors," Mr. Bretz said. "They are strongest in April than in any other month. Actual indicators are almost the same as in March, particularly new order growth in April, which was strong in all industries."
 
 
High Rate of New Orders
 Mr. Bretz added that "given the high rate of new orders in April, one would have to believe that growth would continue into May when seasonal adjustments are not as high."
He also said the latest forecast for manufacturing revenue growth was consistent with overall economic growth in 1992 of 2.5 percent to 2.7 percent, after inflation.
"The turning point in the U.S. economy has arrived," said Joseph Duncan, corporate economist and chief statistician at Dun & Bradstreet.
The purchasing managers group said prices had declined fractionally since the end of 1991, and it expected inflation of less than 1 percent for all of 1992. "The rate of increase in labor and benefit costs is expected to slow again, to 2.9 percent, down from 4.1 percent predicted in December 1991," the report said.
The purchasing managers said the decline in overall manufacturing employment was likely to end this year. Only 30 percent of the group's members said they expected their companies' employment to be lower during the rest of the year, compared with 45 percent who expressed such a view in December 1991.
About 27 percent of the members said they expected to see higher employment during the rest of 1992. The report said that purchasing executives had turned optimistic for the next 12 months. "The 44 percent of members expressing satisfaction or optimism is up sharply from only 13 percent in December 1991 and is the most since the December 1988 semi-annual economic forecast, which was 48 percent," the report said.
Conversely, the number of members who are worried or pessimistic dropped to 4 percent, down from 12 percent in December.
Although there was a unanimous consensus that the dollar would continue to strengthen, export growth was also predicted to remain strong.

HEADLINE: Hachette Announces A Merger

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, May 5

 BODY:
Jean-Luc Lagardere, the humbled king of the French media business, today announced an unlikely merger of his publishing giant, Hachette S.A., and the Matra defense group in an apparent attempt to shore up Hachette's troubled finances.
Hachette's rapid growth during the 1980's in Europe and the United States -- its magazines include Elle and Woman's Day -- propelled its chairman, Mr. Lagardere, to the status of international media baron. 
 But the group has suffered several setbacks over the last year. Most damaging was the collapse last month of the French television station La Cinq, a failure that cost Hachette at least $637 million and contributed to the company's record 1991 losses of $350 milion.
 
Costly American Expansion
 Hachette's ambitious American expansion, which involved the purchase of Grolier encyclopedias and Diamandis magazines for $670 million in 1988, has also caused difficulties, for it incurred $1.9 billion of debt partly to make the acquisitions just as the recession in America began a long reduction in magazine advertising revenues.
Acknowledging his problems at a news conference, Mr. Lagardere, who is 64 years old and was only recently regarded as one of France's most successful entrepreneurs, said that the demise of La Cinq constituted "the most serious setback of my life." But he vowed to battle on, comparing himself to a boxer in the final round of a fight who rises from the floor to seek victory.
Analysts are skeptical. While insisting on anonymity, they noted that there was no apparent synergy between Hachette and Matra and said the move amounted to a last-ditch attempt to salvage Hachette's financial situation and allow Mr. Lagardere to hang on to power.
In a statement that was full of good intentions but conspicuously short on details, Hachette said it would complete the proposed merger with Matra this year, creating a group with annual sales of $9.6 billion in areas including book publishing, magazines, telecommunications and ground-to-air missiles.
The financial arrangements for the merger were not disclosed, and a Hachette spokeswoman, Eve Magnant, declined to elaborate.
Matra was already linked to Hachette through the MMB holding company, which is controlled by the Lagardere family. Indeed, Mr. Lagardere was chairman of both companies. But their activities were distinct.
While Matra also had a bad year in 1991 -- its profits tumbled 58 percent, to $45.8 million -- it has scant debt and a much stronger balance sheet than Hachette. Analysts said the merged company would therefore look more attractive to Hachette's creditors, which include Credit Lyonnais and the Banque Nationale de Paris.
It is unclear how other Matra shareholders will react to the company's effectively rescuing Hachette. Among such shareholders are the German automotive group Daimler-Benz. Trading in Matra and Hachette has been suspended since last week and is due to resume on Wednesday.
 
Recapitalization to Proceed
 Before the merger, Hachette said it would raise $236 million by selling assets, including its landmark building on the Boulevard St.-Germain in Paris. An 8.1 percent stake in the Italian media group Rizzoli -- once seen as an important platform of Europe-wide expansion -- has already been sold this week, for $74.9 million.
Hachette also said it would proceed with a $510 million recapitalization before the merger with Matra. The money is to be raised principally through a stock offering and an issue of convertible bonds, a plan that appears ambitious given the current generally cautious view on Hachette's stock.
Banks are tightening their hold on Mr. Lagardere since his recent failures, and officials close to the deal said Matra-Hachette would be controlled by a reconstituted MMB holding company, in which creditor banks would be strongly represented, Mr. Lagardere's stake diluted and his management kept on a tighter rein.
Moreover, under the terms of MMB's new incorporation, all Mr. Lagardere's personal equity would be liable in the event of failure, said the officials, who spoke on condition that they not be identified.

HEADLINE: Official Seeks Building Jobs For Students

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
H. Carl McCall, the president of the Board of Education, yesterday called on the agency that oversees construction of school buildings to offer apprenticeships to high school students and graduates that could lead to union membership in the construction industry.
In making his appeal, Mr. McCall invoked the specter of riot-torn Los Angeles and seized on an opportunity to provide jobs to the kind of poor and discontented young people that engaged in looting and burning. 
 "The lack of meaningful employment leads to the eruption of violent disturbances such as we have seen in recent days," Mr. McCall said in a memorandum sent to the trustees of the School Construction Authority.
The authority has become one of the city's biggest builders, with a $4 billion plan for erecting and renovating school buildings over five years, half of which has already been spent. Since the Board of Education dictates which buildings the authority puts up, it theoretically has a powerful lever to extract jobs out of an industry that has historically had a poor record of hiring black and Hispanic workers. More than 80 percent of the city's high school students are members of minority groups.
 
Budget Is Under Discussion
 The authority's budget is now under discussion by the City Council and the State Legislature and that is being seen as a wedge to revive interest in the apprenticeship plan, which was first discussed three years ago. Mr. McCall said some legislators, like Assemblyman Roger L. Green of Brooklyn, a former head of the Black and Puerto Rican Caucus, would be more receptive to providing construction money if they knew it would provide jobs for their constituents.
Meyer S. Frucher, a trustee of the authority, said he and a second trustee, Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez, had been working on an apprenticeship plan for more than a year, but the idea had been stalled by a recession in construction that has cost more than 50 percent of the 98,000 construction workers their jobs.
As a result, he said, the unions want to make sure that apprenticeships do not replace the jobs of some of their members, while the authority is concerned that an arrangement that merely adds apprenticeship jobs will make building schools more costly.
Louis Coletti, president of the New York Building Congress, an umbrella group of builders and unions, said he welcomed the idea of an apprenticeship program as a path out of poverty. But any program, he said, must be tied into the industry's existing apprenticeship program.
He said that 38 percent of union and nonunion construction workers were black and Hispanic. He cautioned that creating apprenticeships without being able to deliver real jobs would only yield disillusionment.
Mr. McCall did not accept such logic.
"Young people are already disillusioned," he said. "We want them to be prepared to compete for jobs when they are available."

Insomniacs for Dollars: Traders, TV and Numbers

BYLINE: By Douglas Martin

 BODY:
AT 1:30 A.M. yesterday, the floor of New York's principal commodity exchanges on the eighth floor of 4 World Trade Center was eerily quiet.
The floors were bereft of the slips of paper that drift like snow during trading hours; the hundreds of video screens displayed nothing but dull green, and not a scream could be heard in darkened pits where huge quantities of everything from oil to orange juice raucously change hands during the day. 
 Only in the pit where an odd new financial instrument called U.S. Dollar Index Futures are traded was there a hint of action. And not much of a hint, if first impressions were any clue.
What attention of the half-dozen traders present seemed predominantly focused on a leggy Australian model appearing on a talk show. One lumbered over to answer a phone, then shouted a number. No response. "Gentlemen, wake me up when I have something to do," he said as he lay down on the top tier of the carpeted pit.
You could actually hear the clocks ticking, but appearances were deceiving. This exchange, Finex, a division of the New York Cotton Exchange, boasts that it is the world's only futures market to trade around the clock.
It offers contracts that are, in fact, nothing but a numbers game: players bet on the dollar's value by buying and selling an index of 10 other currencies. Unlike cocoa or cotton futures, nothing is ever delivered. Buyers and sellers just settle their wager at an assigned date -- which, as a practical matter, is the same thing that mavens in real commodities almost always do.
Arbitragers can profit from currency movements; hedgers, such as portfolio managers, can guard against them, and just plain gamblers can have a ball. It adds up: since night trading began on March 1, the self-described "night warriors," who account for a quarter of traders, have come to account for 40 percent of the $400 million in contracts traded each day.
The truth is that most people do sleep in "the city that never sleeps." This gaggle of insomniacs is a forced aberration.
To learn to cope with forced nocturnality, Richard Jaycobs, Finex's managing director, went to Philadelphia to see a night work consultant. Somehow, the lessons learned from nuclear plant employees did not seem relevant.
For one thing, television assumes weird and inordinate importance during trading lulls. "Don't make fun of the Weather Channel," begged Mr. Jaycobs as he dined with colleagues during the nightly break from 11 to 12:30, timed to coincide with lunchtime in Tokyo.
Ha! These are Wall Street guys who routinely brandish jokes to get them through million-dollar market turns, the perversity of economic statistics and, oh yes, terrible human tragedies. The only thing they hold sacred seems to be their favorite commercials. Each seemingly itches to chirp a favorite jingle for products ranging from used cars to cheap mortgages to sex phone lines.
On Monday night, eyes were focused on "Trading Places," a movie shot on the floor of the nearby orange juice exchange. They made scathing fun of the extras, all of whom they knew too well.
But the overall effect of TV has been enervating. Everyone has lost interest in "Branded," a former favorite shown at 4:30 A.M. "We inaugurated quiet time," pronounced Daniel Kelleher. With a slight giggle, he continued, "We read books and reflect on currency movements."
What they mainly do, of course, is work very hard. One who stands out is Gary Hoffman, who routinely puts in 32-hour shifts, trading Treasury notes days and the dollar index nights. "You probably don't remember it, but once I forgot to bring a change of shirt and deodorant," he said between bits of steak.
"We do remember that, actually," a friend said.
It would take the sort of person who bets point-by-point on pro basketball playoff games to appreciate the fun of all this financial volatility. Alan Osofsky, who owns a trading firm, puts it this way: "Just 15 seconds is an eternity. You could be out of business in a minute."
When things move, they move fast. If a world leader were assassinated, millions would change hands almost instantly. The fear of someone knowing something one does not is so omnipresent that people feel duty-bound to eavesdrop on phone conversations. As a result, they have learned that one trader provides a nightly running commentary of whatever is on TV to someone somewhere.
Not to say buying and selling high-priced esoterica is all these people do. Mr. Hoffman, for instance, coaches youth sports for some 20 hours a week. One trader, Mike Bryne, a recent college graduate, is less ambitious but knows what he likes.
"At 9:30 in the morning, you can find me in any of the local taverns," he said.

Newsday Seeks to Cut Work Force

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
Newsday announced yesterday that it would seek to reduce its total work force by about 10 percent by offering enhanced severance pay to up to 300 employees who volunteer to resign.
Chiara Coletti, a spokeswoman for the newspaper, said the cost reduction had been prompted by the depressed economy on Long Island, which has significantly weakened advertising. 
 "We believe the 90's will not equal the 80's, even when a rebound occurs, and we're trying to be as realistic as possible," Ms. Coletti said. "This is a measure we're taking to continue avoiding more drastic measures."

 Since January 1990, Newsday has reduced its work force to 3,000 from about 3,300 through attrition and an early-retirement plan. Last summer, the paper offered voluntary unpaid furloughs to employees in an effort to reduce costs without layoffs.
The newspaper is offering a severance package of eight weeks' base pay plus two and a half weeks' base pay for each year of service, up to a total of 60 weeks' base pay. Some health insurance is also part of the package.
The severance package will first be offered to 282 circulation employees who oversee the Long Island edition's home delivery operation.
 
Target: Home-Delivery Jobs
 Ms. Coletti said the paper was restructuring its circulation department, which was established years ago to oversee a delivery force made up mostly of children who delivered the paper in the afternoon. In recent years, Newsday has shifted to early-morning home delivery by adult carriers, who need less supervision.
Ms. Coletti said that home-delivery employees would have from May 6 to June 22 to volunteer for the program, and that the paper's target for this group was about 200 positions.
From June 1 to July 15, the paper's other employees in all departments of Newsday's editions on Long Island and in New York City would be allowed to volunteer.
Asked what will happen if the target of 300 jobs is not reached, Ms. Coletti said, "I don't want to speculate."

HEADLINE: U.S. Extends Caribbean Loan Effort

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5

 BODY:
The Treasury Department said today that it had extended by three years a Government-guaranteed loan program intended to encourage private investment in the Caribbean.
The Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a Federal agency, had been scheduled to stop guaranteeing loans this year after $100 million already in process had been delivered. 
 In a letter dated March 31 to Congress, however, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said the program would be extended to allow $300 million more in loans over three years, said Richard Myers, a department spokesman.
The extension, first reported today in The Wall Street Journal, had been urged by Senator Bob Kasten, a Wisconsin Republican who is the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee's Foreign Operations Subcommittee, the newspaper said.
 
Based on Puerto Rico Effort
 The program is an offshoot of a longstanding tax exemption for profits that American companies make on their operations in Puerto Rico.
In 1986, when Congressional opposition threatened the exemption, which costs $2.7 billion a year, Puerto Rico offered to funnel about $100 million a year of the profits to projects around the Caribbean.
Companies used part of their tax-free profits to buy tax-exempt bonds from agencies in Puerto Rico or from private financial institutions, which then lent the proceeds at low interest rates to finance projects like a hotel in Jamaica and a plant in the Dominican Republic that makes cream of coconut milk.
As an added inducement, the United States agency guaranteed repayment.
But as a budget-cutting measure, the Treasury has sought to replace the OPIC guarantee with the guarantee of a "quasi-governmental Puerto Rican insurance facility," Mr. Myers said. Still, the agency's guarantee program was extended because of difficulty in getting the Puerto Rico program up and running, he said.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Deutsche Bank Pursues Diversity for Its U.S. Unit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
When Ronaldo H. Schmitz was an executive in the United States at BASF, the giant chemical company, he used Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, as a valued lender but a less-than-complete financial partner.
"The bank had its traditional competence as a lender, but for more sophisticated products I found that my American colleagues turned to American banks," he said. 
 Now, two years after having left BASF to become one of 13 managing directors at Deutsche Bank, the 54-year-old Mr. Schmitz is pushing the American branch to diversify its business and grow in areas more in demand among corporations -- and more profitable for the bank.
 
Looking to the Future
 Mr. Schmitz, who is based in Germany but spends much time in the United States running North American operations, is bold enough to foresee a time, several years hence, when the bank's American business will be bolstered by a listing on the New York Stock Exchange and perhaps the acquisition of a major American bank or securities firm.
Instead of a staid lender, the Deutsche Bank being assembled by Mr. Schmitz in North America will provide corporate customers a fuller package of services, including offerings of securities and financial advice.
Mr. Schmitz acknowledges that his models are Bankers Trust and J. P. Morgan, two New York companies that have thrived by concentrating on trading and financial advisory services for large corporations and wealthy individuals.
 
Growth in Assets
 Mr. Schmitz expects the assets of Deutsche Bank's North American banking business, which have expanded to nearly $14 billion from $6 billion five years ago, will grow more slowly in the future. But he expects the bank's impact in American financial markets to be greater.
To handle the growth, Deutsche Bank has been hiring. Recent recruits include John Ross, previously head of asset and liability management at the Bank of New York, who became treasurer of Deutsche Bank's newly created holding company for North American operations.
Also hired was Jeff Stuart, who came from Paribas, the French bank, to head the capital markets group, and John Stomber, who left the Security Pacific National Bank to head the interest-rate and currency-swap group.
In the securities business, Deutsche Bank plans to take more advantage of its familiarity with European markets, where it is a leader. Beside offering American investors securities of European companies, Horst Risse, chief executive of Deutsche Bank Capital, is working for a bigger role in distributing securities of American companies. A pending worldwide offering of stock by the First Chicago Corporation, for example, will include Deutsche Bank Capital as an underwriter.
Deutsche Bank is still dickering with the Federal Reserve over the terms by which it may combine the business of its C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell securities unit with that of the bank. But Mr. Schmitz said he was optimistic that the combination of Deutsche Bank's capital and connections with 24,000 European businesses, plus Morgan Grenfell's expertise in mergers and acquisitions, would be a powerful lure to American companies.
Mr. Schmitz said he also planned to develop or acquire a private banking business to serve the wealthy individual customers who, he said, "have been seeking us without any effort on our part."
Although Deutsche Bank earned $100 million from its American businesses last year, Mr. Schmitz warned that the bank could not always expect to benefit from the wider profit margins that have developed here as some banks, particularly Japanese, have pulled back from the market. When competition among lenders eventually increases and profit margins decline, he expects Deutsche Bank's new strategy to produce benefits.
As one of the world's few banks with a triple-A rating from every credit agency, Deutsche Bank should be well positioned to attract business from corporations that are increasingly desirous of doing business with financially strong banks that also have expertise in securities markets.
Deutsche Bank has about $8.5 billion of loans issued by its American branches in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, enough to make it one of the country's 50 largest banks.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Lower; Gold Prices Are Up Slightly

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly lower in trading that was heavily influenced by rumors on world currency markets yesterday.
Gold prices were slightly higher after falling overseas. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $337.50 an ounce, up 20 cents from Monday. The Republic National Bank said gold had risen 15 cents an ounce to a late bid price of $336.95. 
 Currency trading was intially subdued by the absence of Japan, where financial markets were closed for the second consecutive day because of a national holiday.
In Britain, where markets also were closed Monday for a holiday, big banks responded to a signal from the Government by cutting their base lending rate by half a percentage point to 10 percent.
It was the lowest level in three years and helped spur trading even though the move had been expected. The central bank gave a hint last week when it eased its money market rates just a bit.
The pound strengthened on the news, but speculation about German interest rates appeared to dominate the market.
"The mark was strong due to speclation that the Bundesbank, at its Thursday council meeting, might raise interest rates," said Randolph Donney, director or research at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
That possibility, coupled with speculation that the Federal Reserve might lower interest rates here to give the economy another jolt, worked to undermine the dollar.
"People were making the leap in logic and selling dollars before they have actual proof that that's what the Fed has to do," Mr. Donney said.
The Labor Department report on unemployment rates for April, due out Friday, is expected to help the Fed determine the direction of monetary policy.
As yields rise overseas, United States investors have a greater incentive to invest money abroad, thereby increasing their need for foreign currencies at the expense of the dollar.
In Tokyo, financial markets were closed for Children's Day, a national holiday. In London, the dollar closed at 133.10 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 132.90 yen, down from 133.20 yen on Monday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7825, from $1.7795 in Europe late Monday.

HEADLINE: 'Green' Wine Adds Spice to Summer

BYLINE: By HOWARD G. GOLDBERG

 BODY:
NOW that spring has come and summer beckons, light, thirst-slaking vinho verde -- green wine -- can't be far behind for the Portuguese communities in Mineola, L.I., and Newark's Ironbound section. It also holds appeal for other, economy-minded consumers and for Pasquale (Pat) Iocca.
Many in the wine world call Mr. Iocca the nation's No. 1 authority on Portuguese wines. Last week, guests at the International Wine Center, a Manhattan wine school, quickly saw why when he pronounced the name VEEN-you VEHRD; even buffs call this white wine VAIR-dee. 
 The occasion, Mr. Iocca said, was "the single largest tasting of vinho verde ever held in the United States." Tapping his resources as wine product manager at the Portuguese Trade Commission, he easily rounded up 19 bottles -- 12 costing under $6.
Some say the word "green" (the wine is actually pale yellow) alludes to the bracing acidity, the fizz (injected carbon dioxide) and the fresh, youthful personality. Others point to Portugal's verdant northwest corner, just south of the Spanish border, which exported 126,100 cases to the United States in 1991, up from 28,416 cases in 1980.
Mary Ewing Mulligan, director of the center, laid the groundwork for Mr. Iocca's lecture. "Vinho verde is not a single type of wine but a whole region, with three distinct microclimates and four different grape varieties used singly or in combination," she said.
Their varied styles shattered the conventional notion that vinho verde has only one aroma and one flavor.
Vinho verde's astringency, sometimes unrelieved by barely detectable sweetness, needs toning down by food. The wine, an acquired taste, is understandable to fans of lean, appetite-whetting versions of muscadet, Chablis, Sancerre, Vouvray, dry and half-dry German rieslings, pinot grigio from Italy's Alto Adige region, New York seyval blanc and Washington semillon.
To preserve the fruitiness, large and most small-estate producers make vinho verde in steel and glass-lined cement vats, rather than in wooden barrels. The wine is about 9 percent alcohol, as against the 12 to 13 percent in most wines, and is made to be drunk young, ideally within a year of the vintage, two at most.
"You will find four or five but more commonly one or two big brands in stores outside America's Portuguese communities," Mr. Iocca said in an interview. He recommended Casal Garcia (about $5), Aveleda ($4.50), Casal Mendes ($4) and Gazela ($4.50). "These typical vinhos verdes are extremely skillfully made," he said.
They are not vintage-dated because the high-volume producers of the wine are used to quick sales and consumption. "I would prefer," he added, "that all, at least those for export, be vintage-dated."
The top grade, usually made only from the alvarinho grape, can be costly. Mr. Iocca called the estate-bottled, vintage-dated Palacio da Brejoeira (about $20) "the Lafite-Rothschild of vinhos verdes." He also recommended these estate-bottled brands: Quinta da Pedra ($16), Casa de Sezim ($9), Solar das Boucas ($9), Quinta de Sao Claudio ($8), Quinta do Outeiro do Baixo ($7.50) and Quinta d'Alem ($7).
Jose Meirelles, the Portuguese-born co-owner and chef of Les Halles, a Manhattan bistro, pours Grinalda, a famous brand, as his house wine and suggests it with oysters on the half shell. He likes it with a salad nicoise with a vinaigrette that has more extra-virgin olive oil than vinegar.
Jean Anderson, author of "The Food of Portugal" (William Morrow, 1986), said: "Vinho verde is sprightly and sturdy enough to stand up to spicy seasonings. I always use it for picnics."
She pours it with gazpacho; cold shrimp; deviled crab; vitello tonatto; a salad of cold roast squab, green beans and radicchio, with warm gravy from pan drippings; cold poached salmon with cilantro green sauce; broiled red snapper stuffed with fresh fennel; cold pork slathered with garlic and marinated in the wine before roasting, and pasta mixed with cooked broccoli florets and slivers of pimento and roasted red pepper and pine nuts.
The New York area's major suppliers include Lisbon Wines, 140-A Jericho Turnpike, Mineola (15 varieties), and Lisbon Liquors, 114 Ferry Street, Newark (10). In Manhattan, Garnet Liquors, 929 Lexington Avenue (68th Street), has three; Astor Wines and Liquors, 12 Astor Place, has four. Vinhos verdes are often discounted.
Lareira, a restaurant at 64-66 East Jericho Turnpike in Mineola, offers 10 different vinhos verdes.
The Portuguese also make red vinho verde. When asked to explain the contradiction, they shrug.

HEADLINE: The War Against the Poor

 BODY:
As if, after Los Angeles, there were any doubt: America's cities need help. So far, President Bush mainly offers them gratuitous insult. For the White House to assert that liberal social programs of the 60's and 70's set off rioting last week assaults the truth. The evidence, plain to anyone willing to take an honest look, shows that:
1. Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty help cut the poverty rate nearly in half, and poverty among the elderly even more. 
 2. Instead of fighting poverty, Presidents Reagan and Bush have fought poverty programs. They have slashed Federal assistance to cities dramatically (see chart). During the Reagan-Bush 80's, poverty rates rose, and froze.
If the Administration were right, eviscerating social programs would have had a benign effect. Tell that to the nation's mayors. They can only hope that when the President tours Los Angeles tonight he will see clearly and not through a prism of callous doctrine.
The War on Poverty brought needy Americans food stamps, medical care, higher Social Security benefits, college tuition, legal services, prenatal care and early childhood education. To denounce programs like Medicare, Head Start and WIC denies the suffering of tens of millions who would stumble, or fall, without the help.
Such poverty programs, along with a healthy economy, brought the poverty rate down from 19 percent in 1964 to 11 percent in 1973. Even after the OPEC oil price hikes sent the economy spiraling downward, the poverty rate stayed low.
Compare that enviable record with the Reagan-Bush years. Even though the economy recovered for seven straight years, poor people did not. Poverty rates did not drop back to pre-recession levels.
Spending on direct aid for cities has fallen by more than 60 percent, after adjusting for inflation, since 1981. The Federal share of city budgets fell an astonishing amount, from 18 percent in 1980 to 6.4 percent in 1990 -- just as AIDS and crack sent social spending through the roof.
New York City's budget offers an eye-opening example. Last year the city spent one of every five municipal dollars on Medicaid, foster care and other express needs of the poor. That doesn't count a dime of spending for police and education.
Instead of blaming poor people, and the cities that try to help them, Mr. Bush might try finding compassionate solutions.
The first and most essential is to lift the backbreaking welfare burden off cities and share it with taxpayers.
The simplest, fairest remedy would be to set a uniform welfare benefit, and increase the share paid by the American public as a whole. Otherwise the current trend will continue, as localities cut benefit levels in order to control costs.
The poor, sick and homeless who roam city streets are not the citizens or the products simply of New York or Los Angeles or Detroit or Chicago. They are America's poor, sick and homeless. America has forgotten its collective responsibility to them during the Reagan-Bush years. To deny it now denies the realities President Bush will see tonight.

HEADLINE: The Cancer Freed Me. It Freed Me.

BYLINE: By Paul Tsongas; Paul Tsongas, the former Democratic candidate for President, was Senator from Massachusetts from 1979 to 1984.

DATELINE: LOWELL, Mass.

 BODY:
Cancer survivorship, Presidential politics, people's fears about cancer, the public's right to know. This volatile mix of forces swirled around me for the past year, and even managed to outlive my candidacy. More than once during those months I wondered whether it was possible to have a rational discussion about surviving cancer in a society that equates cancer with a death sentence.
Put simply, how does someone who has entered the hell of cancer and emerged from the other side help others truly understand how to cope with "thinking" about cancer. This applies not just to would-be Presidents but to all survivors. If you have absorbed the terror of cancer and learned to process it, how do you expect people who have not had this experience to ever comprehend how you think? 
 I have dealt with cancer for more than eight years. The first three weeks after they told me were days of immobilizing terror. That is something anyone can understand. Yes, they say, I can see myself doing the same thing; yes, I would also begin the awful descent into emotional paralysis.
But, they ask, how do you cope? Why doesn't cancer and the threat of cancer dominate your mind forever? Put another way, how can you live if you must always think about dying? How does life ever return to what would pass as reasonably normal?
Easy. You have no choice. And that survival instinct helps explain how it was possible for me, my wife, for those closest to us, for my doctors -- for all of us -- to have considered the removal of a node from my armpit in 1987 to be a minor matter in 1992. The node was found to be lymphoma, it was removed and the area was irradiated. Although all this was no secret, it recently caused a large flap about access to my medical records.
While this matter about the malignant node was first reported in Boston Magazine in April 1988 and was known by other national newspaper reporters during my campaign, it became a cause celebre among reporters who did not know. Thanks to reporters' tapes, memories and the Boston Magazine piece, I was able to limit the fallout somewhat.
One report, however, in The New York Times, suggested that my physicians at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute did not fully disclose the nature of this lymph node to me or the public and may have minimized its significance. While my doctors did not tell The Times, they told me about this node when it occurred and in subsequent checkups. Their expert medical judgment remains, as they stated publicly, that the node became of decreasing concern as the years went by and I continued to be cancer-free. Nonetheless, they frequently commented that the lymphoma obviously could recur.
In March, my physicians drafted a letter to this newspaper that referred to the node, among other matters. Because of their concern about patient confidentiality, they wanted me to review the letter. I asked that it not be sent because I wanted to avoid exacerbating a touchy situation involving a reporter and some of my physicians. Let's forget it, I thought. It's an old story and without consequences five years later.
My decision was wrong. Furthermore, my doctors had prepared a summary of my treatment, including the removal of the node in 1987, to be released during the campaign, but we did not get to it before I ceased my efforts. These doctors did their best to meet the needs of the press, the public and the patient. I put them in a very difficult position when I ran for President, thrusting them into the national political limelight.
Even now, the politics of cancer is never far from my mind. Cancer is not just a physical threat. Being told that you have cancer is a devastating psychological assault. Why? Because of society's prevailing presumption that cancer equals death. Many people cannot even use the word "cancer." The euphemisms resorted to are "illness," "health problem," "personal difficulties," etc.
In these eight and one-half years, I have dealt with that initial assault and countless other would-be fatal signs. Some were minor, some weren't -- in 1986, a feeling in my right abdomen that seemed like a node; in 1987, a fever that lasted four weeks and seemed to be a sure indication of massive recurrence; in 1987, the node. On and on. A pain here. A pain there. A spot that shows up on a gallium scan but nowhere else. A spot that shows up on the gallium scan and is not there three days later. An unexplained this. An unexplained that.
Physical checkups every three months. Full-range checkups every six months. Painful bone marrow extractions at least once a year. Every one of them endured with the knowledge that "something" could be found that could eventually end my life.
Try it sometime.
Go ahead, try it. And then tell me you don't understand.
Dealing with cancer requires a capacity sooner or later to concentrate on living rather than remain terrified about dying: After years of dealing with the dread, I learned. Swimming restored my sense of physical strength. Competing at swimming at the national level put me in a mind-set that allowed me to accept the thought that I had indeed been rendered free of disease. All the subsequent checkups and molecular analyses have only confirmed that conclusion.
Thus, I can function.
Thus, I can be a fully focused husband and father.
Thus, I can run for President and say things other candidates shy away from. I ran with a sense of the obligation of my survival. I didn't give a damn about George Bush's 91 percent popularity. And I told the American people the hard truths about our economy, middle class tax cuts, entitlements, gasoline taxes, replacement of striking workers, gay rights -- all certain to be controversial.
And all these were used against me. So what? I felt that to be just another pandering politician would have been like spitting on my survival. The cancer freed me. It freed me.
So I have learned how to live. And to count each day. And to value that day. I am beyond terror because I have had more than enough of it. Stay focused on the endless number of scares and would-be scares? No, thanks.
I thank God my wife and I have been able to think positively and not allow these various false fears to ruin the last few years. And I thank God that I had doctors whose attitude allowed us to do this. Facts? Yes, they gave all of them to us -- in 1983, when the cancer was discovered, and in 1987, when the node appeared, and today. But black crepe? They didn't have any in my size.
Thanks to medical advances, there will be more and more cancer survivors. How they and society relate to each other will be a continuing story. Mine is only one of them.
If I should surface again politically, I will make available all my medical records for public inspection. This will set a precedent that all candidates will have to follow, even though their previous health history seems perfectly normal. If there is any remaining doubt about my records, I will submit to an examination by an independent group of doctors. That will also set a serious precedent that others will have to follow, if only out of political necessity.
I will do it because I will have no choice. I will have to prove I don't have cancer, no matter how many years will have passed. And there will always be people who would never vote for me because of fears about a disease they dread.
In subtle ways, cancer survivors face similar considerations in everyday situations like job searches and personal relationships. When do you tell them? How much do you tell them? Do you believe they would ever understand? Would it change things? We all are in the coping stage brought on by the cancer survivorship of more and more fellow citizens. But the old goblins will hang around for a long time. Our job is to shorten their stay.
