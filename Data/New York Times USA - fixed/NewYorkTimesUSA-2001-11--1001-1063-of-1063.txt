PERSON: W. Glenn Campbell 

HEADLINE: W. Glenn Campbell, Shaper Of Hoover Center, Dies at 77 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
W. Glenn Campbell, an economist and friend of President Ronald Reagan who built the Hoover Institution at Stanford University into one of the world's most influential conservative research groups, died on Saturday at his home in Los Altos Hills, Calif. He was 77.
 The cause was a heart attack, said Michele M. Horaney, a spokeswoman for the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace. 
 Dr. Campbell, who was reared on a Canadian farm without running water and indoor plumbing, earned his doctorate at Harvard and took control of the Hoover institution in 1960 when it was in organizational and financial shambles. By 1991, two years after his resignation, The Economist called Hoover the top such institution in the world. 
"When Glenn took over this place, it was nothing," said Melvyn Krauss, a Hoover senior fellow. 
Dr. Krauss, an economist, said Dr. Campbell's success in increasing the Hoover endowment to $135 million from $2 million and attracting high-profile intellectuals were the results of strategies like recruiting famous academics whom many universities considered too old; these big names, in turn, attracted younger researchers.
Another advantage stemmed from a friendship begun with Mr. Reagan when he ran for governor of California. Dr. Campbell eventually built on this personal relationship to forge institutional ties to the Reagan administration in Washington, giving the institution an unusual practical influence. At one point in President Reagan's second term, 26 Hoover fellows worked in his administration, in positions ranging from top advisers to members of advisory panels. 
Still another Campbell policy was to give researchers wide autonomy to work independently, while freeing them from chasing grants and other chores. 
All these approaches combined to help bring in money from conservative donors and ideas from the cream of conservative scholars, including Milton Friedman, the economist, and Edward Teller, the designer of the hydrogen bomb. Scholars who later attained fame and Nobel Prizes also followed. 
"He was the premier intellectual entrepreneur of the century," said Martin Anderson, a policy adviser in the Reagan White House.
Describing himself as an "old Scottish warrior," Dr. Campbell delighted in fierce ideological battles, whether with Stanford administrators whom he accused of wanting to take over Hoover or of spokesmen for liberal causes, not a few of whom he considered nonsensical.
"He loved controversy," said George P. Shultz, the former secretary of state and a distinguished fellow at Hoover. "He felt that if what he said provoked other people to say otherwise, that was fine with him."
Dr. Campbell was born on April 29, 1924, on a farm in Lobo Township in Ontario. He was one of seven children. He graduated from the University of Western Ontario in 1944 and received his doctorate in economics from Harvard in 1948. At Harvard he studied with the economists Joseph A. Schumpeter and Wassily Leontief.
President Herbert Hoover appointed Dr. Campbell to head the Hoover Institution in an effort to keep what Hoover called left-wingers from gaining control of it. Three months after Mr. Campbell's appointment, the Stanford faculty tried to end the institution's autonomy and put it under direct university control. Hoover, then 86, ended this initiative with the flick of his pen.
Another storm arose from Dr. Campbell's invitation in 1983 to President Reagan to store his papers in the institution. Ronald A. Rebholz, a Stanford English professor, said in an interview with The New York Times in 1987, "Hoover brings Stanford into the Reagan presidency in a way that is completely objectionable."
In the end, Stanford agreed to accept the library, but the Reagans decided to go elsewhere, building the library in Simi Valley, Calif.
Mr. Campbell's last battle with Stanford arose when the university demanded that he retire at 65, the official retirement age. He noted that other Stanford professors were allowed to stay beyond 65, and threatened to file an age discrimination suit, but eventually stepped down.
Throughout his career, he exemplified the ease with which many Hoover scholars passed back and forth between academia and public service. He was a regent of the University of California and chairman of the president's Intelligence Oversight Board during the Reagan administration, among other jobs. 
Dr. Campbell is survived by his wife of 55 years, Rita Ricardo-Campbell, an economist at Hoover; three daughters, Diane Rita Campbell, Barbara Lee Gray and Nancy Elizabeth Yaeger, and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
Cash, Race and Rancor? No, It's Not the Mayoral Race

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
New Yorkers have just watched a political race that featured harsh attacks, racial divisions, piles of money, a badly fragmented Democratic Party and enormous challenges for the eventual winner.
 Get used to it. This year's mayoral race could provide a preview of next year's race for governor, now getting under way in earnest, a contest that is already being singled out by campaign consultants and political journals as one of the toughest and most interesting in the country. 
 The Democrats, Andrew M. Cuomo, the former federal housing secretary, and H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller, are already running hard, throwing barbs at each other and Gov. George E. Pataki, at a stage when most campaigns have barely begun. They have set up a primary that all sides acknowledge could leave the party as divided as this year's mayoral primary did, with the winner facing an uphill battle against Mr. Pataki, a Republican. 
"Of course it's going to be tough," Mr. McCall said yesterday, after giving a speech that assailed the governor on education, the economy and state finances, and that his aides described as the real start of his campaign. "I'd be disappointed if it wasn't tough." 
Mr. Cuomo dismissed the speech as "nothing new or provocative."
The campaign, he said, "is going to be about new ideas for very difficult challenges that the state faces," and he promised to be the source of those ideas. Mr. Pataki, he said, has had nothing going for him but "Bill Clinton's economy."
Joseph Conway, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki, said the governor could point to "a record drop in crime, lower taxes, more jobs, a cleaner environment and record investments in education and health care." When Mr. McCall accused the governor of defending the state's byzantine school aid formulas that a judge found had violated the State Constitution, Mr. Conway countered that Mr. McCall did not support the governor's attempts to simplify those formulas.
The winner of the race will take over a state battered by a recession and the attack on the World Trade Center, facing a multibillion-dollar budget deficit, and potentially burdened by the financial troubles of New York City, Buffalo, Yonkers, Nassau County, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Mr. Pataki has the advantages of incumbency, high approval ratings and a war chest that Republicans and Democrats both predict will top $40 million, double what he spent in 1998, and far more than either Democrat is likely to raise. But after governing only in good times, he could be weakened politically by a slumping economy and a fiscal crisis. He faces an electorate that has grown steadily more Democratic in recent years, and the prospect that George W. Bush, the Republican president he campaigned for, will continue to spurn New York's calls for more money from Washington.
For the Republican Party, this is a must-win race. Mr. Pataki is the only Republican elected to statewide office, and if he loses, his party could be shut out of all the statewide posts for the first time since 1942.
The road to next Nov. 5 is littered with hazards for each candidate, but that means opportunities for the others.
For Mr. McCall and Mr. Cuomo, the challenge will be to avoid a repeat of the Democrats' self-immolation this year in New York City. Mark Green won the mayoral nomination over Fernando Ferrer, who is Hispanic, but he was dragged down by the ill will and ethnic tensions left by the primary, and lost in the general election to Michael R. Bloomberg, the Republican.
Mr. McCall, who is black, is counting on the same minority coalition that backed Mr. Ferrer. But he cannot afford to be seen, as Mr. Ferrer was, as primarily a minority candidate, just as Mr. Cuomo cannot afford to alienate minority voters in opposing Mr. McCall. Race has already become an important subtext to the campaign; each camp insists it is steering clear of race, while suggesting that the other side is not.
Both campaigns address the dangers with bravado and predictions of harmony. They contend that statewide races are very different from New York City contests, that the electorate is less sensitive to ethnic provocation. But each side recognizes the risks.
"We are a party of primaries, and tough ones, but healthy competition makes for a better Democratic candidate," Mr. Cuomo said. A situation in which Democrats are wounding each other "is always a danger," he said. "Racial tensions, ethnic tensions, are nothing new."
In New York, candidates do not always get to pick their own fights. They are often at the mercy of their own allies, people like the Rev. Al Sharpton or former Mayor Edward I. Koch, with their own constituencies and a knack for getting attention. This year, Mr. Green and Mr. Ferrer both suffered for the provocative comments and actions of their surrogates.
Mr. Ferrer and his supporters, many of them allies of Mr. McCall's, are still stoking the fires of resentment over this year's race and calling for a widespread self-examination by the party, an exercise that the McCall camp would rather skip. Yesterday, Mr. McCall felt compelled to defend Mr. Ferrer against accusations that he cost Mr. Green the mayoral election by withholding his support in the campaign's final days.
On Monday, a Cuomo supporter, Assemblyman Sam Hoyt of Erie County, cited the age gap between Mr. Cuomo, who turns 44 next week, and Mr. McCall, 66, in discussing the differences between them, after the Cuomo camp had vowed that it would not make an issue of age.
"The media in New York thrives on racial and other kinds of conflict," said a top adviser to one Democratic candidate for governor. "Both campaigns are going to have to be extremely careful, and even then they might not be able to avoid it."
New York Democrats can have competitive primaries that do not leave the nominee bloodied, as in the 1998 primaries that led to the elections of Senator Charles E. Schumer and Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer. But they can also have nasty, damaging primaries without racial divisions, as in the 1992 Senate race.
"We do have to worry about not repeating this year's mistakes," Mr. Spitzer said. "Anybody who denies that is kidding himself."

HEADLINE: Profit Drops 76% At Men's Wearhouse 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: FREMONT, Calif., Nov. 27 

 BODY:
The men's apparel retailer Men's Wearhouse Inc. posted a 76 percent drop in third-quarter profit today and warned of significantly lower results for the rest of the year, as a decline in consumer spending has further dampened sales of men's apparel. 
 The decline in profits and the near-term outlook set off a 12 percent decline in Men's Wearhouse stock, which fell $2.81, to $19.97 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Men's Wearhouse posted income of $3.98 million, or 10 cents a share, in the quarter, down from a profit of $17 million, or 40 cents a share, last year. Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 
Sales for the period, which ended Nov. 3, fell 6.1 percent, to $285.6 million, from $304.2 million a year earlier. Sales at United States stores open at least one year fell 14.4 percent, while Canadian same-store sales fell 1.9 percent. 
As a result of diminished sales, Men's Wearhouse, which is based in Fremont, Calif., has cut its profit outlook nearly in half, expecting earnings for the fourth quarter in the range of 35 cents to 45 cents a share.
Analysts surveyed by First Call expected fourth-quarter earnings of 70 cents. Men's Wearhouse's same-store sales declined 19.2 percent in September from the month in 2000. They fell 16.1 percent in October.

HEADLINE: ARTS ABROAD; 
Collecting $600 Million in Art, or a Tiger by the Tail

BYLINE:  By Elizabeth Olson 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Nov. 28 

 BODY:
In his two decades as a physician in Africa, Gustav Rau took breaks several times a year, boarding a "small rattletrap of a plane," as he called it, to fly across the bush to Kigali in Rwanda. Then he would return to his native Europe, and sometimes to the United States, where he used his inheritance to buy works by old masters at auction.
 At first, collecting was a diversion and a chance to indulge a childhood fascination with sculpture and painting, especially the Dutch and Flemish artists he remembered from the museums his parents took him to visit. Dr. Rau said that in 1958, he bought his first painting, "The Cook," by Gerard Dou, the 17th-century painter of the Netherlands, and was hooked. 
 Over several decades, he built up a major private art collection, which he says he rarely sees. The collection has prompted a four-year tangled dispute over his competence and control over his Fragonards, Bonnards and Fra Angelicos. The art is stored in a duty-free port near Zurich, he said. He rarely sees it, he said, because he lives in a nursing home and is hindered by his physical state.
The battle that erupted over his artworks was bitter and dragged through courts and administrative bodies in two countries. Still smarting from accusations of being mentally unfit, Dr. Rau, who is 79 and uses a wheelchair, makes only rare public appearances, preferring to live at an undisclosed location in his native Germany. He declines most interviews.
But he agreed to answer written questions from a reporter about his collection, which experts value at nearly $600 million and which is second only in size to the Thyssen-Bornemisza collection in Madrid. 
Dr. Rau said he chose each painting and sculpture himself. He built the collection, which includes examples of nearly every period of European art over a five-century period, he added, without any financial advice, although he intended from the outset that it be sold after his death to benefit the poor.
He was the scion of a Stuttgart family whose auto components business prospered from its connections with Mercedes-Benz. At 19, he was drafted into the Nazi Wehrmacht, but he quickly deserted, he said. He later studied economics and received his medical degree. Like many young heirs, he entered the family business. He sold out in 1970, and he left for Nigeria and then the Congo, where he worked in the 1970's and 80's. He never married.
Before he went to Africa, he channeled his wealth through two foundations in Switzerland: one for art appreciation and the other to ease suffering and illness. But his philanthropic impulses would nearly prove to be his undoing.
Using part of his inheritance, he built a clinic in the eastern part of what was then the Belgian Congo, where he served as the physician for the surrounding community. He said he wanted to put his pious, but not fanatical, Christianity into practice by working with the poor. But he pursued his other vocation -- buying art -- with equal dedication.
"I simply started buying pieces of art because I had fallen in love with them," he said, replying to written questions with written answers. 
He said he was partial to French Impressionists, which he described as an "early delight," and the Dutch masters because of the way "they gave faces a genuineness of expression that mirrors their subjects' character and uniqueness as human beings." He branched out to nearly every period and every European country, from early Italian Fra Angelico panels to Renaissance artists like El Greco, to Renoir, Monet and Munch.
With no place at his African lodgings to house his art suitably -- which had grown to 423 paintings, 238 sculptures and 91 other pieces -- he decided to store the collection for many years at a duty-free warehouse outside Zurich. He abandoned his idea of building a museum in Marseilles, France, for his collection.
When his health began to deteriorate, Dr. Rau returned to Europe in 1997, first to the South of France then to Monaco. There he began to medicate himself, trying to overcome the effects of a stroke and the buildup of fluid on his brain.
"He insisted on being his own doctor, and being a large man, he didn't believe in small quantities," one of Dr. Rau's lawyers said. He was found, more than once, disoriented and wandering the streets late at night. In March 1998 local authorities set up a guardianship, and his affairs plunged into a three-year morass.
Fairly soon, he was on a plane to Israel, accompanied by his closest confidant, a German graphologist, but quickly realized that he did not have sufficient control over his own money to choose his residence, he said. He returned to Germany, but his Swiss lawyers had already moved to have him declared incompetent and to take control of his affairs. 
The Swiss body that oversees charities declared that his behavior was "endangering" his assets and put them under trusteeship. The actor Peter Ustinov, a longtime Swiss resident, soon attacked Swiss authorities for trying to take over the collection. Dr. Rau went to court in Germany to prove his mental fitness; after a visit to his hospital bedside, a judge in Baden-Baden found him to be mentally capable, which eventually turned the legal tide in his favor.
But not before the behind-the-scenes battle became public, when Swiss officials allowed 100 pieces from the collection to be sent on a tour to Japan, France and the Netherlands nearly two years ago. The artworks are now in Munich at Haus der Kunst until Jan. 13. Swiss news reports stated that the officials had allowed a "precious heritage" to slip out of the country's grasp. 
Dr. Rau said he never intended that Switzerland benefit, and in 1999 he bequeathed his art to the German chapter of Unicef. Its director, Dietrich Garlichs, said Dr. Rau was "completely aware of what's going on." 
"He is physically handicapped but he can discuss politics, history or art," he said. 
In August -- after nearly a dozen lawsuits and other legal actions -- Dr. Rau regained total control of his collection and his foundations.
Dr. Rau said that he was happy with the outcome but that he regretted the drain of several million dollars in legal fees. Somewhat frail, he is recovering from a bout with pneumonia. "My passion for art has only grown throughout these past difficult years," he said. That passion includes his favorite painting, Fragonard's 18th-century "Portrait of the Duke of Harcourt," which is among his works in Munich.

HEADLINE: ONLINE SHOPPER; 
Visions of Sugarplums Dance on the Web

BYLINE:  By Michelle Slatalla; E-mail: Slatalla@nytimes.com

 BODY:
SOME people, when they remember childhood Christmases, think first of a special present: the year of the red bike. Others can't forget certain trees that glittered more than they ever could today. Others have sweet memories of midnight church services when candles lighted worshipers' faces with a glow of love, or of pink-cheeked carolers in the snow. 
 For me, the holidays were a little different. I knew it was really Christmas only after my three brothers and I battled nearly to unconsciousness (yes, hair pulling) over the last of the Fannie May Mint Meltaways on my grandmother's silver-plated candy tray. Any of us would have killed for a green one. 
 Here, from the company's official literature, is a description of the
little chocolates that bedeviled us: "Made exclusively in Chicago, legendary Mint Meltaways have a smooth mint chocolate center, with a coating of milk chocolate or creamy pastel."
Oh, how I want to be a kid again. Last night I dreamed that I was: my youngest brother, Dan, sat under the tree, amid a huge pile of ripped wrapping paper. My other brothers, Jack and Joe, were already mildly bloodied by the puck from the new table hockey game. Life was good. 
Then I woke up. I no longer live in a town where the corner candy store has a red-and-white-striped awning or peddles delicacies with arcane names like Debutantes and Carmarshes that little kids take on faith. "I got the Colonial Assortment for Mom's birthday," we would say proudly, and we would no more question the meaning of the name "Colonial Assortment" in the world of chocolate than a car buyer would ask, "Why Buick Electra?" We knew the Colonial Assortment had the Pixies and the Trinidads. 
The dream was gone but the craving for chocolate remained.
Chocolate is having the same effect on many people these days. A University of Michigan survey released last week showed that customer satisfaction with chocolate rose during the third quarter of this year, even as consumers became less satisfied with items like pet food and soft drinks. The reason? "When times are turbulent, chocolate is a very inexpensive comfort," said Prof. Claes Fornell of the University of Michigan Business School, who oversees the quarterly American Customer Satisfaction Index. 
Professor Fornell found a similar trend during a recession in northern Europe about a decade ago. "Results then showed that satisfaction with candy was up, also alcohol and hard liquor went up," he said. "Of course, satisfaction with yeast also went up, and one wonders what they did with yeast during hard times." 
Well, I guess they used yeast for baking bread or brewing beer, both of which I consider comfort foods. Still, I couldn't imagine my brothers and me wrestling on the living room floor, risking a concussion from the sharp edge of the piano bench, if the stakes were no higher than the last packet of Fleischmann's RapidRise Yeast. 
Fortunately, Fannie May Candies has a Web site (www.fanniemay
.com), with a full selection of chocolate products. I also found plenty of other online stores -- Groovycandy
.com, Sweetnostalgia.com,
Gumdroptree.com and Oldtimecandy.com -- that have a wide selection of nostalgia-provoking candies, including forgotten favorites from my childhood.
Let's take a moment to consider rock candy. My brothers and I used to ride our bikes up to Keeler's candy store, next to the movie theater, to get a quarter-pound bag of that stuff, glittery as diamonds and just as hard on your teeth.
But little did I imagine, in my wildest fantasies, that rock candy came in seven colors or that you could order it by the pound ($2.29) from Economycandy.com, the Web site of an old-fashioned, family-owned store on Manhattan's Lower East Side that also sells hundreds of kinds of candies, nuts and even chocolate-covered graham crackers. 
"We just got a big order from Cartier for rock candy, 80 pounds for every one of their stores because they're going to put it in the windows to look like diamonds," said Jerry Cohen, Economy Candy's co-owner. (Note to do-it-yourselfers: Cartier went with purple and white candy to create the effect.) 
Economycandy.com's most popular product, however, is jelly-filled, chocolate-covered graham crackers. "You never had them?" Mr. Cohen said. "You're kidding." He sounded as if he really felt sorry for me. He said anyone who got even a very last-minute urge to send them as a holiday gift can call the site's toll-free number to negotiate down-to-the-wire delivery.
"We're a family business and we don't know about deadlines," he said. "We'll do whatever you want, whenever you want. We'll fill your order fast before you have time to change your mind." 
At Gumdroptree.com, the specialty is an unusual, old-fashioned product. Yes, it's an actual gumdrop tree. "It's a tradition that goes back at least to World War I," said Lori Tosches, the site's owner, "when people who didn't have a lot of money would actually go out to the yard and get a branch and bring it in and stick candies on it. It would be their table centerpiece or even their tree, with the gifts under it." 
The site sells a reusable 15-inch-tall plastic tree for $12. Gumdrops, $2.75 for a one-pound bag, enough to fill the tree, are sold separately. 
Californiacandy.com sells 300 products in 10 categories like chocolate (Nestle's Chunky bars, 99 cents each), sour (half-pound bag of assorted Warheads, $6.49) and novelty (wax fangs or lips, 89 cents apiece). 
The site sells retro boxes ($26.95), featuring candies that had their heyday in the 50's (Mason Crows, Skybars, Charleston Chews), the 60's (Pixy Sticks, Razzles and Red Hots) or the 70's (Nik-L-Nips and Chunky). 
Having grown up outside Chicago, I remain a Fannie May loyalist. What child of those suburbs didn't grow up on the lore of the single downtown store founded in 1920 that spawned a chain that proudly hoisted the red-and-white awning in 12 states?
Fanniemay.com's Web site was so easy to navigate that I effortlessly ordered three one-pound boxes of candies and had each shipped to a different address (Meltaways for Jack, Pixies for Joe and the Colonial Assortment for Dan). It cost $75.70 including regular ground shipping. 
Here's what I wrote on the gift cards: "Hope this brings back happy memories." 
Here's what I wanted to write: "Make time stop."

 Re "Parking Garages Suffering From Manhattan's Single-Driver Restrictions" (news article, Nov. 26): 
 While parking garage operators in Manhattan lament the decline in business resulting from the ban on one-passenger vehicles entering Lower Manhattan during the morning rush, they ignore the even greater economic benefits: reduced traffic congestion. 
More efficient use of roadway space by a decline in private auto traffic speeds necessary truck deliveries, an economic boon more vital than the profits lost by parking garage operators.
Reduced auto traffic means improved emergency vehicle response rates, speedier bus operations, safer streets for pedestrians and cyclists and less air and noise pollution, resulting in an improved quality of life for the vast majority of commuters, tourists and residents who choose to use other means of traveling into and around Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Andean Trade Renewal Stalls 

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
The Bush administration wants to renew and expand a trade agreement with four financially troubled South American nations, but with just days to go before the pact expires, on Dec. 4, a last-minute split in Congress has put the deal into question.
 For the last decade, the agreement, the Andean Trade Preference Act, has helped Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru fight narcotics trafficking by lowering tariffs on flowers, clothing and other exports to the United States. The aim was to bolster local economies and encourage local farmers to plant legitimate market crops instead of the coca and poppies used to make cocaine and opium. 
 Despite opposition from American farmers and textile manufacturers, who say that the agreement has cost thousands of jobs, the Bush administration has been determined not only to renew it but to expand it to cover a broader range of products, including canned tuna and clothing made from fabrics produced in the four Andean nations. The House, with bipartisan support, approved a bill to do that on Nov. 16. 
The Senate is scheduled to consider a similar bill in the next few days. But now a streamlined version of the bill that would extend the current agreement for six months has been tucked into the economic stimulus package the Senate is considering.
That would allow for a more thorough review of the agreement in the next legislative session -- the holiday recess is set to begin Dec. 6 -- when the calendar presumably will be less crowded.
The leaders of the four Andean countries have made it clear that if the agreement is not renewed, they will find it difficult to stabilize their economies and offer their citizens a viable alternative to drug trafficking. They have also made reauthorization a test of the administration's commitment to Latin America.
American companies, particularly textile manufacturers, have lobbied against renewing the agreement, saying that it has not been effective in combating drugs. They also say that expanding it to include other goods would be a setback for already battered American industries.
"What sense does it make for Washington to be pursuing a domestic economic stimulation package while at the same time pursuing trade policies that put more textile workers out of work?" said Carlos Moore, executive vice president of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, an industry association.
In contrast to free-trade agreements, like the one the United States has with Mexico and Canada, the Andean Trade Preference Act lowers tariffs only on exports to the United States, not on imports from the United States. That, Mr. Moore said, has hurt the textile industry without giving American workers a chance to increase sales to the South American countries.
Expanding the products covered by the pact could cost America's textile industry thousands of jobs, Mr. Moore added. The House bill would expand the tariff benefits to apparel made with cloth produced in the four Andean nations, particularly Pima cotton from Peru, a material known for its softness. In addition, Mr. Moore said, a lack of clarity in the interpretation of the provisions could allow them to dye and finish textiles.
The Senate version generally retains the current limit of tariff benefits to apparel made with cloth from the United States. The extension that has been written into the economic stimulus package does not change any provisions in the agreement.
All four Andean nations have a lot riding on a renewal of the pact, which was set in place in 1991, during the first Bush administration, as part of the war against drugs.
Since then, there have been some small successes. Peru and Bolivia have reduced their coca leaves harvest, though they have not ended the cultivation of coca plants. "Progress has been made," President Alejandro Toledo of Peru said in a recent interview, "but the problem has not been resolved."
Ecuador and Colombia cannot report even that modest advancement, and some United States senators, including Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, complained at hearings in August that the trade pact has not worked as envisioned, sometimes at the expense of American farmers. 
According to the State Department's latest drug control report, Ecuador "continues to be a major transit area for drugs," and Colombia "produces and distributes more cocaine than any other country in the world."
Still, administration officials said, the legislation has made some inroads in supporting the development of a fresh-cut flower industry in Colombia. Every day, 30,000 boxes of Colombian roses, carnations and chrysanthemums arrive in the United States -- by one estimate, constituting two-thirds of the country's fresh-cut flower supply. Officials in Washington assume this means that some Colombian farmers have switched from growing coca.
The trade pact also encouraged farmers in Peru to plant crops like asparagus that are uncommon there but can be exported to the United States. Peru has been so successful that asparagus growers in the United States are helping to lead the fight against what they see as unfair competition.
The four Andean nations would like the pact to be expanded to other goods. They also have asked that the same benefits be extended to a fifth country, Venezuela.
There is little support in Congress for inviting Venezuela along, in large part because of increasing irritation with President Hugo Chavez, who has befriended Fidel Castro of Cuba and has criticized United States policies, including its campaign in Afghanistan.
Some members of Congress are also skeptical about the value of using trade as a weapon in the war on drugs, and some are concerned about the effect of lowered tariffs on American businesses.
Besides, Congress has had its hands full since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, with little time or energy to focus on the Andean pact.
So little time is left to pass a bill in the Senate and reconcile it with the House version that some administration officials accept that the best Congress may be able to do is extend the current pact for six months.
"That would basically hold things until we have the chance to do a substantive reauthorization where we move the deck chairs around," said one senior administration trade official
The House bill that passed on Nov. 16 would extend the agreement for four years, to 2005. By then, the administration hopes to have in place a Free Trade Area of the Americas, covering all 34 democracies in the Western Hemisphere.
To get a hemispheric trade pact, the Bush administration believes it first needs so-called trade promotion authority, once called fast track authority. When a president has this power, Congress agrees to vote on negotiated trade agreements without amending them.
For a time, it was not clear that Congress would be ready to act on either trade promotion authority or the renewal of Andean trade preferences, and if so, which would come first. 
The agreements reached at the World Trade Organization meeting in Qatar earlier this month seemed to breathe new life into the administration's push for trade deals to fight drugs and terrorism.
But after Thanksgiving, Congress was left with so many issues to deal with before it recesses on Dec. 6 that there might not be time for a vote on trade promotion authority, which still faces substantial opposition.
To the nations of South America, struggling to deal with a severe economic slowdown, the attention that Congress gives to the bills is seen as affirmation of the United States' interest in the hemisphere.
"The world's strategic posture has been scrambled since Sept. 11," said Luigi R. Einaudi, assistant secretary general of the Organization of American States. "And the rest of the world is worrying that the United States will relegate them to the back burner."

HEADLINE: Educating Ourselves 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Educating the World," by Gene Sperling (Op-Ed, Nov. 22): 
 The United States has one of the most abysmal records among developed nations in educating its own children. 
It seems highly unlikely that it could play the role of a leader in educating the world's children, either by simply providing federal funds for developing education (especially given that the federal government plays such a tiny role in financing American education -- less than 10 percent) or by orchestrating an education strategy through the World Bank and other development institutions. 
It would be wiser to make a call for us to get our own house in order before we exhibit the hubris of trying to spread reform in an area where we are so clearly failures ourselves. More money for the world's children may help. But only if it is spent wisely.

HEADLINE: Fed's Survey Finds Few Signs of ReliefFrom Jolt to Economy 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28 

 BODY:
Economic conditions were still sluggish in recent weeks as the economy felt the aftereffects of the Sept. 11 attacks, according to a Federal Reserve report released today.
 "Reports from the Federal Reserve districts indicate that economic activity generally remained soft in October and the first half of November," the Fed said in its report, known as the beige book, a snapshot of the economy based on reports from the Fed's 12 regional banks. 
 The Fed added that the slowdown deepened in most regions, although a few areas reported signs of recovery. 
The Fed said that consumer spending was mixed, with automobile sales rising to "exceptional levels," but that purchases of other goods were "spotty."
"Retailers' outlook for spending during the upcoming holiday season was also mixed," the Fed said.
The report said that in most areas of the country, luxury sales suffered but discount retailers reported a jump in demand.
Car sales were expected to weaken after having soared with interest-free loans offered by automakers after the Sept. 11 attacks.
"Looking ahead, automobile dealers expressed concern that sales in coming months would fall as incentives ended," the Fed said.
The beige book report, for use by Fed policy makers at their Dec. 11 meeting, was based on information gathered before Nov. 19 and compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va.
The Fed said that job markets nationwide had weakened further.
"Layoffs and downsizings contributed to a greater supply of available workers, and wages were steady to lower," it said.
As an example of the softness, the report mentioned an employment agency whose clients had been seeking cuts in billing rates for temporary workers.
The Fed has cut short-term interest rates 10 times this year to bolster the economy. Earlier this week, the National Bureau of Economic Research declared that the economy fell into a recession in March and was hurt further by the attacks.
Despite the lower interest rates, the Fed said banks were issuing few loans.
"Several districts reported tighter credit standards for bank lending and increases in loan delinquencies," the report said.
The Fed's report showed little to worry about on the inflation side as prices were described as stable. The central bank noted that prices for cars, gasoline and computers were falling while insurance and health care costs headed higher.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
In Sept. 11's aftermath, the cure for the economic ills of our democracy is more democracy.

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and a collection of essays, "Unconventional Wisdom: Alternative Perspectives on the New Economy." He teaches at Cooper Union and the New School. E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
SINCE Sept. 11, this nation has thought more deeply about itself and its values than it has in a long time. Foreign criticism has stunned many Americans because we think of ourselves as a good people and are surprised that others may not. America's values are exemplary, we believe, and in many ways that is true. 
 But in fact, much of what Americans cherish most is now under challenge. Much that Americans might well be disturbed by continues to be swept under the rug. And all these matters affect the economy in ways people do not always consider. 
 The right response to Sept. 11 is not a public relations campaign to the world but an assiduous reassertion of the nation's truest principles by the Bush administration. And nothing, in fact, would be better for the economy. What follow are several crucial characteristics that have long helped make both America and the American economy great. Some of them have for some time required more attention, and since Sept. 11, that attention is in even greater demand.
Immigrants have provided a foundation for the American economy since the early 1800's. Now, the rounding up of foreigners on the possibility they may be linked to the attacks as part of the administration's domestic war on terrorism is chilling. State attorneys general refuse to accept the Bush administration's broad demands, and Spain even refuses to extradite prisoners to the president's military tribunals. But the concern goes beyond potential civil rights violations to the everyday workplace. Since Sept. 11, nearly 100 lawsuits have been filed that contend that Arab-Americans have been victims of bias in the workplace.
The president, rather than simply paying occasional lip service to tolerance, should lead a series of town meetings on reducing prejudice and burn the idea of tolerance into the American consciousness. A presidential directive should be issued to pursue violators of antiprejudice laws in the workplace more vigorously. As the Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow has written, the economic evidence that there is still prejudice against women and minorities in labor markets remains overwhelming.
Free speech is almost as central to the workings of the economy as it is to the workings of the nation itself. The administration asked the news media to limit coverage of Osama bin Laden's speeches and restricted information about the war itself.
And from both corporations and Wall Street, there has long been a pattern of increasingly less trustworthy disclosures. Many businesses now aggressively "spin" their information. Wall Street analysts, often the conduit of that information to the media, are increasingly accused of tailoring reports to please their investment banking clients. Liberal accounting techniques are exploited to keep reported profits rising.
In fact, the Levy Institute Forecasting Center argues that in recent years, profits of American companies have been overstated by 20 percent. The Securities and Exchange Commission should take much more vigorous action at home to assure the "transparency" of business in America. The Bush administration, though, seems to be backing away from the fight.
High levels of literacy and education were central to America's political and economic development. By the mid-1800's, local governments had produced the best public education system in the world. But because it is based largely on local taxes, the quality of education is now highly unequal, and Americans are no longer the best-educated people in the world. 
To take one example, one in five American adults lacks functioning literacy skills, according to the Human Development Report -- a far higher rate than in any other developed nation except Britain.
In some states, school financing is increasingly provided at the state level, compensating for inadequate incomes in localities. Such programs must be encouraged.
Even in colonial times, Americans were probably the healthiest people on earth. Documents reveal that the average American was three inches taller than the average British soldier sent to put down the revolutionaries -- a result of better nutrition and fewer diseases.
Good health care is fundamental to a productive work force. But health care is unequal in America, and inadequate for tens of millions. Nearly 13 percent of newborns do not survive to 60; in Canada, it is only 9.5 percent.
The most efficient way to protect Americans is through their employers. What frightens people most since Sept. 11, even more than losing their incomes, is losing their health insurance, one study shows. Efforts to enable them to afford their benefits when they lose jobs are critical.
One of the more audacious assertions made by some serious economists in recent years is that the growing inequality of incomes in America has produced greater incentives to work hard and create new businesses. In truth, the best incentive for working hard and saving has always been to pay people what they deserve. But income inequality is greater here than in any other developed nation. The richest 20 percent in America have incomes roughly nine times those of the poorest 20 percent. By contrast, in nations with a comparable per capita gross domestic product, like Norway or Canada, the top 20 percent earn only four or five times what the bottom 20 percent do.
Such inequality should be reduced through a higher minimum wage, less regressive payroll taxes and negative income taxes. But the state of inequality in America also emphasizes how important it is to equalize other areas of daily life, including education and health care.
Sept. 11 should elicit more than just soul-searching. We can differ about how to address these problems, but ignoring them or even aggravating them weakens the nation at home and weakens America's pride in itself. It gives others grounds for criticism.
Our attention is now mostly focused on the war against terrorism. But the home front matters just as much.

HEADLINE: The Casino Jinx 

 BODY:
While most New Yorkers were focused on emergencies elsewhere, the governor and the State Legislature in Albany took advantage of our distraction and passed a law designed to convert New York into a gamblers' paradise. The decision happened swiftly and covertly. There were no public hearings, and the final vote came after midnight, before an audience consisting mainly of high-priced lobbyists. The fruit of this unseemly process was an agreement that Gov. George Pataki should conduct negotiations for six new Indian-run casinos. As bargains go, it is not a good one, and Mr. Pataki and the Legislature should bail out of this package before it's too late. In the end, Mr. Pataki's casinos will cost New York far more in social problems than they can ever deliver in state or local benefits.
 Mr. Pataki has been pushing for casinos as part of his economic relief package for the Buffalo and Catskill regions as well as a way to boost state revenues. The new gambling complexes, including video slot machines at raceways, are supposed to keep New Yorkers' gambling dollars in the state, and supply the government with millions of dollars in a difficult economic period. Left unaddressed are the questions of who loses all that money and how much of it benefits those outside the casino doors. 
 The historical data is not encouraging. The casino losers are not confined to people who can afford it, and as gambling increases, so does crime. Suicide rates go up, as do bankruptcies and divorces. The casinos may do well, and even earn the state new money. Yet the communities where they are planted, after an initial burst of increased traffic and low-level jobs, generally begin to lose local businesses.
Under the midnight deal in Albany, the public is virtually cut out of the negotiations. Any compact would involve approval by the tribes, the federal government, Mr. Pataki and possibly the courts. Hovering around every move are the lobbyists concerned with this issue whose clients have spent more than $2 million this year in Albany, a state record.
If the casinos do get built, it is far from certain that the state will actually get any money. Under the deal, the state's share of the casinos' profits will come from their slot machines. But anti-gambling forces believe they have good grounds for challenging the legality of slot machines under the State Constitution, which contains anti-gambling provisions. If they win, New York could be left with the casinos but no state revenue.
Many Americans support the idea of allowing Indians the leeway to locate businesses like casinos on their reservations, even if they are prohibited in the surrounding state. But this is not what will happen under the New York deal. Mr. Pataki would have to oversee intricate land swaps to give the Indians title to land that is nowhere near their historic reservations but conveniently located at the places where various lobbyists and political interests would like to see casinos.
These land pacts are not about Indian sovereignty. They are about the enticement of billions of dollars in gambling revenues. The Interior Department ought to reject the land swaps. If the federal government does not act, the courts should bar these unhealthy agreements.
New York has had casinos on upstate Indian reservations for some time, but bringing gambling into an urban area like Buffalo and to land in the Catskills that is almost within commuting distance of New York City is another matter entirely. The governor and the Legislature have taken the state into a whole new territory, one that its citizens might not have chosen to visit if they had been consulted. Bringing more casino gambling and slot machines into the state is the sort of issue that ought to be debated in next year's gubernatorial campaign. And like any change to the State Constitution, this one deserves to be voted on by two Legislatures and then put on the state ballot for New Yorkers to have their say. Mr. Pataki and the Legislature should roll back this law before they are remembered for trying to turn New York into another Nevada.

HEADLINE: Relations at Last Normal, Vietnam Signs U.S. Trade Pact 

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Nov. 28 

 BODY:
After five years of fits and starts, Vietnam joined the United States today in approving a far-reaching trade agreement that throws open its economy and brings an end to a final chapter of the war.
 The agreement was the last step in a long reconciliation that began with the lifting of an American trade embargo in 1994 and the opening of full diplomatic relations in 1995. 
 "With this event, the process of normalizing relations between the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the United States has been fully realized," said Vu Khoan, Vietnam's minister of trade.
From now on, Vietnam and America are just two countries with normal political and trade relations like any others. 
Sometimes it had seemed as though the Vietnam War were being played out all over again as agreements were reached and then followed by second thoughts. That light at the end of the tunnel would glimmer before disappearing again.
Finally, after ratification last month by the United States Congress, Vietnam's National Assembly voted today, 278 to 85, to carry out the agreement. It is expected to take effect at the start of the year.
The trade pact completes a decade-long transformation in which Vietnam retains strict Communist Party control over politics while allowing its economy to liberalize. 
An unusually broad and detailed document, the agreement commits Vietnam to a series of far-reaching reforms over the next several years, in effect setting out a road map for the development of a fully free market in Vietnam.
At the same time, it creates considerable new economic opportunities by opening the American market, with Vietnamese goods paying the same tariffs as most other nations. American tariffs on Vietnamese goods and services will be cut to about 4 percent from as high as 40 percent, removing Vietnam from the company of a small number of unfavored states that include North Korea, Cuba, Afghanistan and Serbia.
Before the current economic downturn in the United States, the World Bank estimated that the lower tariffs could eventually double the amount of Vietnam's exports to the United States, which currently is about $800 million a year. For the moment, economists said, the rise could be about 20 to 30 percent -- much of it in seafood, footwear and garments and textiles.
Kazi Matin, the chief World Bank economist in Hanoi, told reporters today that Vietnam would experience much faster growth in exports when the economy turned around.
Pete Peterson, who ended his tour as the first United States ambassador to Hanoi in July, said in an interview this year that the agreement had to do with much more than trade. "It is a normalization agreement," he said. "It is the completion of the circle of the process, of which economics is the missing link."
Negotiations on the agreement were the main issue between Vietnam and the United States throughout the Clinton administration. Once its provisions are put into effect, many hurdles that have driven away American investors will be removed.
In embracing the pact, Vietnam has committed to difficult reforms that it had hesitated to make since first opening its economy more than a decade ago. The agreement includes chapters on investment, trade and services, banking, accounting, insurance and business law.
It requires that trade barriers be lowered, state industries compete with foreign companies and copyright and investment guarantees be raised to international levels.
To protect the still-fragile Vietnamese economy from the harsh world of open competition, American companies will gain access to certain domestic industries over a seven-year period. These include banking, insurance, telecommunications, tourism and technical services.
"It is the most comprehensive trade agreement ever negotiated," said Virginia B. Foote, who heads the United States-Vietnam Trade Council, a Washington lobbying group, in a recent interview.
The provisions of the agreement encompass the trade and economic standards prescribed by the World Bank and required for entry into the World Trade Organization.
"I think this sends a clear and strong signal of Vietnam's willingness to join the international community," said Do Duc Dinh, an economist at the Institute of World Economy in Hanoi. 
According to several analysts, it was the recent entry into the W.T.O. by Vietnam's giant neighbor and competitor, China, that helped persuade Hanoi to sign the agreement.
"We shall now start to discuss the essence of our application to join the W.T.O.," said Mr. Khoan, the trade minister. "We have already had four rounds of talks with the W.T.O., but they have been about transparency only."
The trade body's director general, Michael Moore, is scheduled to visit Hanoi on Thursday.
Establishment of fully normal relations does not mean the end of frictions, however. There was opposition in Vietnam's national assembly from members who said the United States needed to do more to atone for damage it had caused during the war.
In announcing the ratification today, the official Vietnam News Agency made reference to "nonintervention in each other's internal affairs," a phrase that responds in particular to American criticism of human rights standards in Vietnam.
The Vietnamese government has reacted angrily to the recent passage in the House of Representatives of a Vietnam Human Rights Act that would tie future non-humanitarian aid to improvements in Hanoi's record on human rights. The measure is now before the Senate.
But the final obstacle to ratification came last spring, not in Hanoi but in Washington, where the administration had planned to include the agreement in an omnibus trade package.
That could have required it to be opened for renegotiation and could have delayed this final step for years.

HEADLINE: Collusion Was Widely Disregarded, Says Witness for Sotheby's 

BYLINE:  By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
What the government has presented as a flagrant collusion agreement between the leaders of Sotheby's and Christie's was widely disregarded by both auction houses, a defense witness testified yesterday in the price-fixing trial of the former Sotheby's chairman A. Alfred Taubman.
 The pact particularly seemed to crumble when both houses chased the multimillion-dollar business of clients like the high-profile estates of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Pamela C. Harriman and Alice Tully, evidence showed. 
 In an effort to demolish a foundation stone of the prosecution case as the testimony neared an end in federal court in Manhattan, the defense focused on a 1993 document said to list tougher trade terms that the nominal archrivals had agreed to adopt against customers.
But the defense witness, Christine Nelson, managing director of the Boston office of Cornerstone Research, a financial data-analysis firm, testified that a breakdown of actual deals showed that the two companies, contrary to any promises to each other, continued to grant costly concessions to win business. 
"Instead of seeing these practices stopped, they increased," Ms. Nelson said under friendly questioning by one of Mr. Taubman's lawyers, James P. Rouhandeh. "The data went in the completely opposite direction from what you'd expect."
The defense seemed to be suggesting that Mr. Taubman should not be culpable for a scheme that didn't take hold. But witnesses did not address other incriminating language in the Tennant memo or the broader issue of a rise in seller's rates that prosecutors charge the two chairmen engineered.
A government lawyer, Patricia L. Jannaco, had just begun cross-examining Ms. Nelson when court ended, to resume today. Judge George B. Daniels said he expected the defense to conclude this week, possibly as early as today, with the jury of eight men and four women likely to get the case, which began on Nov. 8, by Tuesday.
Mr. Taubman is still considering taking the stand, people close to the defense said.
At the heart of yesterday's defense counterattack was a memo the government says was written on April 30, 1993, by Sir Anthony Tennant, then chairman of Christie's (and an absent co-defendant in the case), to memorialize an illegal non-compete agreement with his Sotheby's counterpart, Mr. Taubman. 
The memo, rich in trade jargon, pledged that from September 1993 "we" will no longer offer "straight guarantees" -- promising sellers a fixed price for their item without sharing in the upside or excess if the final price exceeded the guarantee.
It also barred loans to auction sellers for single item lots and loans below Libor (for London Interbank Offered Rate), a benchmark international lending rate. And the memo pledged: "If we see you cease to make charitable donations we will cease too."
Earlier, the government's two main witnesses -- the former chief executives of Sotheby's and Christie's, Diana D. Brooks and Christopher M. Davidge -- testified that their bosses, Mr. Taubman and Sir Anthony, directed them to implement these terms along with higher seller's rates and other joint policies that would prevent customers from bargaining between the companies. 
But compete the companies did when it came to fancy clients, sales contracts displayed in court showed. Although the agreement seemed to rule out charitable donations to lure business, Sotheby's assured Caroline Kennedy and her mother's estate on March 17, 1995, "you will advise us of which charity or charities you wish catalog profits, if any, to be donated."
As for the ban on straight guarantees, Christie's on April 4, 1994, gave the estate of the philanthropist Alice Tully just such a boon for its consignment of art, to the tune of $22 million. Christie's gave another straight guarantee nine months later to the estate of Mrs. Harriman, for $14.1 million.
Term by term, Ms. Nelson testified that a study of the actual deals showed no carrying out of any agreement. Sotheby's, she said, continued to offer straight guarantees. 
Far from ceasing, advances on single lots actually grew at Sotheby's from 1 in 1992 to 3 in 1993 to 9 in 1994 to 10 in 1995, Ms. Nelson testified. The dollar value of those loans in that period rose too, from about $25,000 to $1.75 million. They increased at Christie's too, she said, from $2 million in 1992 to more than $12 million in 1994. 
Loans below the London interbank offered rate, supposedly banned under the pact, also increased at both companies, she testified. 
Much of the testimony was aimed at undercutting Ms. Brooks, who has pleaded guilty to antitrust conspiracy and is aiding the government in hopes of winning leniency. She testified last week that she had implemented the antitrust agreement with Mr. Davidge.

HEADLINE: H.I.V. 'Explosion' Seen in East Europe and Central Asia 

BYLINE:  By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 

 BODY:
H.I.V. infections are rising faster in Eastern Europe and Central Asia than anywhere else in the world and are 15 times as high as they were three years ago, the United Nations said yesterday, in its yearly report on worldwide AIDS.
 This year, 250,000 Eastern Europeans and Central Asians were newly infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, twice as many as last year; the total is now one million. More than 75,000 of the new infections occurred in Russia. Much of the increase was caused by rising rates of drug addiction and needle sharing. 
 Because relatively few cases are reported, the number of infected Eastern Europeans and Central Asians is probably four to five times as high as the official figures, said Dr. Peter Piot, the executive director of the joint United Nations program on H.I.V. and AIDS. 
"We are in the midst of an explosion that had been predicted several times in past years," and an even larger epidemic "may be imminent," Dr. Piot said.
A similar scenario is occurring in other former Soviet states.
Ukraine has the region's highest prevalence, with 1 percent of its population infected, the first time any European country has reached that level. H.I.V. is on the rise in Estonia and the central Asian republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.
Dr. Piot attributed the rise to such factors as widespread unemployment, economic insecurity, changing social mores, the use of injected drugs and the disintegration of public health institutions.
Eastern European countries began to recognize the problem and increase their budgets to control it after a special session of the United Nations on AIDS last summer. Also, the United States, England and the Soros Foundation have donated additional funds. Nevertheless, Dr. Piot said, "we still have a long way to go."
Noting that the president of Ukraine is the only head of state in the region to speak out on AIDS, Dr. Piot said that "it is still too much business as usual with no sense of the urgency with which we believe it should be addressed."
The Sept. 11 attacks dealt "a major blow to the global AIDS agenda" because fears of terrorism displaced AIDS in the political dialogue in countries affected by H.I.V. and made it harder to get contributions to a fund that the United Nations has created for AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, Dr. Piot said.
Refugees fleeing Afghanistan and the potential revival of that country's heroin market are of concern to surrounding countries, including Pakistan, Dr. Piot said, because "wherever there has been conflicts and population movements, we have seen the spread of H.I.V."
Speaking at a news conference in Moscow yesterday, Dr. Piot gave a bleak picture of a worsening global epidemic. Worldwide, an estimated 40 million people are infected with H.I.V., and 5 million of them became infected in 2001. The vast majority do not know they are infected or that they can transmit the virus to others through sex or needle sharing.
Since AIDS was first recognized in 1981, it has has caused 25 million deaths and become the world's fourth-biggest killer. Three million deaths occurred in 2001.
Disparities in H.I.V. rates are striking. Sixteen African countries have rates exceeding 10 percent among adults. But 119 countries have rates of less than 1 percent. Although H.I.V. came to Asia in the 1990's, it has infected 7.1 million people. This year, for the first time, new infections in Asia exceeded one million. Prevalence rates exceed 1 percent in Cambodia, Myanmar and Thailand.
In India, 3.86 million people are infected, a total second only to that of South Africa. The figure represents less than 1 percent of India's population. Yet seemingly low overall levels of infection may mask serious localized epidemics. Dr. Piot said that surveys in the states of Maharashtra, Andrha Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, each with populations of at least 55 million, have found prevalence rates of at least 2 percent among pregnant women and more than 10 percent among patients with other sexually transmitted diseases.
In China, an estimated one million people are infected. At least nine provinces are on the brink of H.I.V. epidemics, the United Nations said. More than 70 percent of injecting drug users were infected in a number of areas.
Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country, has experienced a recent surge in infections among injecting drug users and prostitutes. In Jakarta, where H.I.V. rates were negligible until recently, surveys have found infection rates of 18 percent among women working in massage parlors.
"Few countries are acting vigorously enough to protect sex workers and clients" from H.I.V., Dr. Piot said. "Yet, it is from the comparatively small pool of sex workers first infected by their clients that H.I.V. steadily enters the larger pool of still-uninfected clients who eventually transmit the virus."
Infection rates have risen sharply in Nepal and Vietnam, and among gay men in Japan. But in Cambodia, infection rates among pregnant women dropped to 2.3 percent in recent months, down almost a third from 1997.
However, Dr. Piot said, "time is fast running out if much larger AIDS epidemics are to be averted" in Asia.
In Africa, the continent hit hardest, the number of new infections this year has dropped to 3.4 million from 3.8 million in 2000.
"But that is not a reason to cry victory, because we had expected a slowing as evidenced by declining rates in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia," Dr. Piot said, and the extremely high numbers show "that there is still an enormous potential for spread of AIDS in Africa."
In an increasing number of areas in Africa, infection rates in pregnant women exceed 30 percent.
In North Africa, there are signs that H.I.V. is spreading. One study in Algeria showed a 1 percent infection rate among pregnant women. Libya has experienced outbreaks among drug users, and Djibouti and the Sudan face growing epidemics.
In West Africa, five countries that in past years had low levels of infection now have reached 5 percent or higher. They include Nigeria, the continent's most populous country, and Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Togo.
Although drug companies have reduced the price of anti-H.I.V. drugs for African countries, the price is still too high and health services are not well organized, Dr. Piot said. So, he said, even exceptional prevention efforts will only gradually reduce the impact of the epidemic in Africa.
The Caribbean is the world's second-most affected region, with infection rates among adults exceeded only by those in Africa. Haiti and the Bahamas have the highest rates, followed by Barbados and the Dominican Republic. In Central and South America, Belize, Guyana, Honduras, Panama and Suriname have rates of at least 1 percent. Prevalence is lowest in Bolivia, Ecuador and other Andean countries.
Poland has successfully curtailed an epidemic among injecting drug users and prevented H.I.V. from gaining a foothold in the general population through efforts by a Catholic priest and the government to promote safer sex, condom use and needle exchange, Dr. Piot said.
Summing up the state of AIDS, Dr. Piot said it "is unequivocally the most devastating disease we have ever faced, and it will get worse before it gets better.'

HEADLINE: As the Rich Do Without Extras, Service Workers Do Without 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
A nanny on the Upper East Side had her work schedule cut to three days a week from five because the wife in the household lost her job on Wall Street. Limousine drivers complain of carrying fewer passengers and earning 40 percent less than they did before.
 At many top restaurants, waiters are working just three days a week instead of five. And bellhops at Manhattan's five-star hotels say their tips, which often account for half their income, have plummeted by half. 
 These workers are part of a huge yet largely overlooked segment of New York City's ailing economy -- estimated by economists to number 75,000 workers -- who have suffered badly since the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. These 75,000 workers -- separate from the 80,000 who have been thrown out of work since the attack, according to state figures -- have experienced a painful drop in income because, while holding onto their jobs, they are working fewer hours, carrying fewer passengers and receiving lower tips. 
Economists assessing the ripple effects of the Sept. 11 attack originally focused on the surge in unemployment, but they are now beginning to examine this other large group of workers, studying how their shrunken incomes will add to New York's steep economic losses. The financial troubles faced by these workers will go far to reverse the good times that many low-income workers experienced over the past decade. Despite their economic suffering, many of these workers fail to qualify for any assistance, and their declining incomes will have a cascading effect, hurting retailers and landlords alike. 
"There's a whole level of hardship that's not being captured by the employment data, including the unemployment numbers," said Mark Levitan, a senior policy analyst at the Community Service Society of New York. "It's going to have a fiscal impact because there will be less tax money going into the city treasury. And there's going to be a severe impact on low-income neighborhoods, like Downtown Brooklyn and 125th Street, that have had significant gains in the last five good years we had."
Nazir Khan, a limousine driver, complains about a plunge in business because his company is receiving fewer calls to pick up Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley bankers, or passengers on the US Airways shuttle. His weekly gross has fallen to $600 from $1,000, out of which he pays more than $200 a week for gas, insurance and car payments.
Wealthy passengers, Mr. Khan said, have grown more tightfisted. "Fewer people are giving tips by far," he said. "Let's say on the average I would get $20 to $30 a day in tips. Now if you get $5 to $10, that's a lot."
Many financially squeezed workers -- limousine drivers, butlers, housekeepers, waiters, nannies, bellhops -- have been hurt by a wholesale belt-tightening by the city's well-to-do. Wealthy New Yorkers were badly shaken by Sept. 11 and the subsequent economic slump, so not surprisingly they cut back their spending. 
"New York, like London and other global cities, has always had a luxury service class that relied on a healthy upper class," said Joshua B. Freeman, a historian at Queens College. "When that upper class catches a cold, those who rely on them catch pneumonia."
Mr. Khan is a prime example. To make ends meet he now often works 18-hour days, from 6 a.m. until midnight, instead of 14 hours as he did before Sept. 11. He has told his two teenagers to forget about buying the latest Nike styles and the hottest CD's, advising them that they do not have to buy name brands and should buy only what they need.
"This is the hardest period that I've ever had here," said Mr. Khan, who immigrated from Guyana 10 years ago.
Luis Molina, a taxi driver from Puerto Rico, faces a similar squeeze. He said his financial district business has fallen most, helping drag down his daily gross to $170 from $250 -- before he pays $75 a day to lease his cab.
"I used to have a slew of stockbrokers," Mr. Molina said. "They were good tippers. A lot of them brought their mistresses along. They'd want me to take them to the nearest hotel. That's changed. I think they've stopped partying."
Some of the 50,000 taxi and limousine drivers in the city say they are making only slightly more than half what they were before Sept. 11 but working longer hours. Add to that the thousands of waiters, bellhops, nannies and others suffering from shrunken paychecks, and some economists say the estimate of 75,000 people in this group may be conservative. 
Many of these workers complain about slipping through the safety net and being unable to qualify for aid like unemployment insurance, usually half of their weekly pay. And this group also complains that the unemployed have an easier time obtaining government health insurance, like Medicaid.
"The safety net that we have isn't designed for this gray area," Mr. Levitan said. "We have this new twilight zone of people who are formally employed. They work too many hours for unemployment insurance, and their incomes are too high for public assistance or food stamps, yet their incomes have been hurt severely."
Mike Wallace, co-author of "Gotham," the Pulitzer-winning history of New York City, sees parallels between today's downturn and the Great Depression, when many humbled financiers fired their chauffeurs, butlers and laundrywomen. Since there are fewer personal chauffeurs nowadays, he said, many of the wealthy are instead cutting back on their use of limousine companies. Now, as in the 1930's, Mr. Wallace said, those cutting back first are not the "rich rich" but the merely rich and the upper middle class.
Roseana Thomas, a nanny on the Upper East Side, recently saw her schedule cut to three days a week from five, reducing her weekly pay to $250 from $400. Noting that the husband and wife had not lost their jobs, she said their worries about a downturn had evidently persuaded them to trim their spending.
With two teenage daughters at home in Brooklyn and monthly rent of $750, Ms. Thomas said she would have to share an apartment unless she found more work soon. To economize, she does laundry in her bathtub instead of at a coin laundry. She is also baking and cooking a lot more instead of buying prepared foods.
Her hard times are fueling tensions with her teenagers. "I believe in talking to them and letting them know reality, and I told them until I do better, I don't think Santa will be visiting here at all," she said.
The primary business at Royal Airline Laundry, washing linens for airlines, is down 40 percent since Sept. 11. Having laid off a fourth of the 300 workers at his plant in Far Rockaway, Queens, Sherwin Glabman, Royal's chief executive, said, "I've never seen anything like this, even in the Iraqi war."
La Cote Basque, the restaurant on 55th Street, has lost business, including many corporate banquets. As a result, Ricardo Cerdeira, a banquet captain, has worked just three or four days a week the last six weeks. But at least he is working now; for the preceding month, from mid-September to mid-October, Mr. Cerdeira was laid off because of the plunge in business after Sept. 11. 
"September through December is traditionally the best time for New York's restaurant industry," Mr. Cerdeira said. "We're in November, and things haven't gotten much better. January, February and March, they're usually the worst months for the industry, and there's a lot of fear about what happens then."
At the Palace Hotel, 5 of the 19 bellhops were laid off in mid-September. Those who stayed agreed to their union's suggestion to give up one day of work each week to minimize the number of layoffs.
Brendan Daly said that not only did he lose 20 percent of his pay by giving up that day's work, but also tips fell 50 percent because the hotel's vacancy rate soared while the generosity of clients plummeted. In good times, tips often run to $400 a week, on top of his $440 in wages. So the weekly income for many bellhops has plunged from about $840 to about $540. 
"Tips are basically where we get the butter for the bread," he said. "The butter is running a little dry."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: ANALYZING THE DANGERS; 
Scientists Find the New Field of Threat Assessment Full of Uncertainties

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
Shaken by suicide jets and anthrax deaths, scientists are working to better predict the likelihood of major terrorist attacks, and thus to clarify what protections the nation needs most urgently out of a nearly endless lineup of potential defenses.
 But as they work in this new branch of the discipline called threat assessment, they find themselves in a world full of uncertainty. More art than science, the emerging discipline relies on technical knowledge of what is possible and inferences about what resources terrorists have -- money, materials and expertise -- along with as many intelligence clues as possible as to their aims and intentions. 
 "Right now, it's done by gut feeling, and that's proven to have some real drawbacks and failures," said Raymond A. Zilinskas, a senior scientist at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. 
Dr. Zilinskas helped organize a recent two-day meeting in Washington at which the institute's scientists joined with representatives of the Energy Department and its Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to begin an assessment of what is needed in the way of terrorism defense. The National Academies of Science are organizing a similar study, which is to begin next month and go well into next year. Yesterday, academy officials met to outline the study's agenda and goals.
The military has long done threat assessments, mainly in an effort to understand the probable success of tactics and attacks. The scientists are looking at the chances that terrorists armed with germ, computer, chemical or nuclear weapons might try to kill large numbers of civilians or bring mayhem to cities. 
Generally, the probability of such attacks is considered low. But the past is not particularly rich in examples for theorists to draw on. The number of attempted terrorist strikes with unconventional arms has been small. As a result, even experts in the field have little basis for deciding what, if any, are the most likely kinds of assaults in the future.
Could anthrax be spread by atomizers, hand-held sprayers or crop dusters? What is easy, hard or likely? Who is motivated and capable of mass killing?
Answering questions like these will be crucial if government planners are to determine which tactics, among a near-infinity of possibilities, should be adopted. The overall goal is to distinguish theoretical vulnerability from real danger.
A rough start was made in 1999 by the Gilmore Commission, a study group of the RAND Corporation that advises the president and Congress on how the nation should respond to terrorism. Its report, "Assessing the Threat," described categories of possible attack but made no attempt to rank their likelihood.
The commission did, however, fault a general analytical focus on worst-case scenarios and called for greater consideration of dangers that might prove less damaging but more likely. In retrospect, that aptly describes the anthrax attacks that so far have recently left more than a dozen people sick and five dead.
The meeting organized by the Monterey Institute and the Energy Department was attended by Bush administration officials as well as psychologists, insurance experts, nuclear experts, physicians, biologists and a rocket scientist.
"It was a very lively discussion," said Paul Slovic, a psychologist at the University of Oregon and president of Decision Research, a consulting company in Eugene. "There was a pretty good consensus that you can get a useful perspective on magnitude of the risk and a comparison to other hazards, if not taking it all the way to a hard number," or quantifying it. 
Dr. Slovic said similar questions arose in the case of presidential assassination threats, which are frequent but often hoaxes.
"If you don't apply systematic thinking, you rely on human judgment and intuition," he said, "and there's a lot of evidence about how they can go wrong." Sober threat assessments, he added, could replace "unaided judgment."
In an interview, Dr. Zilinskas described a federal nuclear site for the storage of a small amount of plutonium that, for want of serious threat analysis, had engaged in protective excess. First it added a barbed-wire fence, then another, and then put stones between the fences to thwart runners. Then it added television cameras. Finally, it covered the grounds inside the fences with spikes to stop helicopters from landing.
"It's a ridiculous facility that looks like something from outer space," Dr. Zilinskas said. "This is how you can go overboard, especially when everybody has an idea of what should be done. We're trying to put a little order into that kind of process."
The two-day Washington session, focusing on bioterrorism, came to a consensus that a process of outlining threats and testing them against limited historical data and terrorism trends could help determine what dangers are realistic.
More of the Monterey Institute's assessments are to be scheduled if the sponsors can find more financing. The institute, based in Monterey, Calif., has offices in Washington. 
"The real challenge is how we're going to develop strategies to deal with the risks," said Howard Kunreuther, an expert on threat management at the Wharton school and a visiting scientist at Columbia University, who attended the meeting. "That has thrown us into turmoil."
The National Academies of Science, perhaps the world's most prestigious scientific group, based in Washington, is tackling that challenge.
A new panel at the National Academy of Engineering, led by Alvin W. Trivelpiece, a former director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, plans to rank the likelihood that terrorists could cripple the nation's infrastructures, and suggest protective steps. It is to have 10 to 15 members and meet regularly. Among the infrastructures it will focus on are railroads, air transportation, communications and electric and gas utilities.
"We're looking at what we could do that would be new, true, and nontrivial," said Dr. Trivelpiece, a physicist by training. "The academies have an ability to take a little longer look. We need to look at prioritization and unanticipated consequences" of attacks, like telephone systems crashing because of overloading.
"We need," he said, "to understand how all these things interrelate."

HEADLINE: Deficits Are Foreseen For at Least 3 Years 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said it expected federal budget deficits for at least the next three years, confirming that the recession and the war on terrorism had wiped out huge projected surpluses. 
 The disclosure came hours before Republican and Democratic leaders sat down to begin negotiating over their sharply differing approaches to a proposed economic stimulus package. 
 The budget outlook is sure to lead to an intense battle over which party is to blame for the stunning turnabout in the nation's fiscal condition and how to pay for competing priorities. Those priorities include tax cuts, paying down the national debt, a military buildup, prescription drug coverage for retirees and increased federal spending on education.

HEADLINE: In America; 
The Tourism Crisis

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Michele Angerosi, a well-dressed man in his 30's, was sitting at the bar in Il Bocconcino restaurant in Greenwich Village on Tuesday evening. But he wasn't drinking. He'd come in to tell a friend, the restaurant's owner, Gilberto Petrucci, that he'd just been laid off.
 Mr. Angerosi, a waiter at the nearby Ennio & Michael restaurant -- described in the Zagat Survey as a "first-rate Village Italian" -- thus joins the scores of thousands of New Yorkers caught in the employment downdraft that has followed the Sept. 11 catastrophe. 
 "For waiters, it's tough," said Mr. Angerosi. "We pay our bills with tips, so we don't make money if people don't come to eat."
"It's sad," he added. "You get to a point where you have to pay the rent and you can't work. I don't know what else to do. I came here from Italy and I've been a waiter ever since. I don't know how to do anything else in this city."
At 5 p.m. there were no customers in Il Bocconcino, which is at the corner of West Houston and Sullivan Streets. "Things are very bad," said Mr. Petrucci. "We were closed for a week after 9/11 and things never got much better. The Village is for tourists and there are no tourists. All business is completely down."
Mr. Petrucci does not think he can hold out much longer. "If it continues this way," he said, "we'll close. I can't survive another month like this." 
It would be difficult to overstate the importance of tourism to New York City. It's a $25-billion-a-year industry, and it has to recover for the city to recover.
When you think of tourism, think jobs, jobs, jobs. Prior to Sept. 11, tourism supported, in one form or another, more than 280,000 jobs in the city. Under normal circumstances, more than 37 million visitors would descend on New York in a year, spending money in department stores and other retail outlets, in restaurants and theaters and hotels, at museums and sports stadiums, at newsstands and sidewalk vendors, in bars and nightclubs.
The $25 billion generated from tourism is the equivalent of $3,100 for every man, woman and child in the city. "Each tourist," said Tim Zagat, co-publisher of the Zagat Survey and chairman of NYC & Company, the city's tourism bureau, "is carrying a little wheelbarrow full of cash to put in the pockets of New Yorkers."
Luring tourists back to New York in the booming numbers we've become accustomed to will be an incredibly difficult task. First, there's the nationwide problem of Americans being reluctant to fly. But even as that slowly makes its way back to normal, there are some serious problems here to be dealt with.
New York became more and more of an attraction in recent years because it was safer and the overall quality of life had improved. But now there are ominous signs, as the economy has deteriorated and the police have been diverted to terror-related tasks, that the bad old days are attempting to stage a comeback.
Two shootings last week were particularly chilling. A 5-year-old boy and a 25-year-old man, both bystanders, died when they were hit by stray bullets that came from a gunfight between two men on a street in the Bronx. Two days later, a teenager running an errand for his mother was held up and shot to death by a group of thugs in Brooklyn.
The Police Department acknowledges that there has been a recent increase in shootings. A spokesman for Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik said some cops were being redeployed to cope with the problem.
There are also long lines at the city's food pantries and soup kitchens, and an increase in the numbers of homeless men and women sleeping on the streets. And, in a development that carries heavy symbolic resonance for many New Yorkers, there is evidence of a re-emergence of squeegee men at some intersections. 
Michael Bloomberg will take over as mayor in a little more than a month. He'll have budget problems to wrestle with. And he'll have to fight for more help from Washington. And he'll have to develop a strategy to prevent a new explosion of crime.
These are not impossible tasks, just tough ones. New York is still the safest big city in America, and the best. Keeping the tourists in mind may help to keep it that way. Because it turns out that what's good for the tourists is good for the rest of us. Just remember: jobs, jobs, jobs.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Board Approves Payment of $3 Billion as Loan to Turkey 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28 

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund approved a $3 billion loan payment to Turkey today after completing its latest review of Turkey's economic progress. 
 The approval makes the money available immediately under the fund's $19 billion loan program for Turkey. 
 But perhaps more important for Turkey's fledgling economic recovery, which was knocked off balance by the events of Sept. 11, the fund signaled that it was likely to approve even more cash soon. 
The fund's management has already said it is considering increasing lending to Ankara by about $10 billion to bridge a financing gap for 2002. 
In a statement released after the fund's decision-making executive board discussed Turkey, the board suggested that it would support additional funds for Ankara if the government puts the right economic policies in place.
"Directors agreed that an appropriately strong response would warrant additional support from the international community," said the statement, from Anne O. Krueger, the board's acting chairwoman.
The fund said the Turkish economic slump had appeared to be bottoming out in August but was set back on Sept. 11 when the attacks on the United States disturbed the global economy. 
The fund said the darker outlook called for an even stronger policy response, including maintaining a high primary surplus in the public sector, a renewed effort on banking reforms, better management of public resources and development in the private sector.
While the fund praised Turkey's fiscal management, it said reaching the target -- a primary surplus of 6.5 percent of the gross national product public sector in 2002 -- would be essential to ensure that Turkey's debts are sustainable.
The fund also said that given current economic conditions, it supported the decision to delay the introduction of a plan to set inflation targets until next year.
The latest loan payment by the fund had been due in September but was delayed because of Turkey's failure to implement some conditions earlier this year and by global turmoil after the Sept. 11 attacks.
Experts from the fund are expected in Ankara on Dec. 3 to talk about the potential new loan.
Earlier this year an ongoing economic crisis forced Turkey to float its currency, cutting its value in half. But Turkey had planned to turn that devaluation to its advantage. 
Before the attacks, Turkey hoped that it would benefit from higher exports as a result of its weak currency.
But Turkey's hopes of exporting its way to recovery were dashed when the global economic outlook deteriorated and expectations of strong tourism revenues were scuttled after the events of Sept. 11.
Turkey needs the money to help it pay its domestic debt, which has been swollen by an expensive bailout earlier this year of a banking system in crisis.

HEADLINE: Layoffs Feared as Consultant Examines Mount Sinai's Budget 

BYLINE:  By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN 

 BODY:
Facing growing expenses and dropping patient revenue, Mount Sinai Hospital has hired a budget-cutting consultant, sending fears of layoffs rippling through the medical facility's staff.
 The hospital emerged last year with operating losses of $26.4 million, according to Mount Sinai officials, and only $3.8 million in overall profit from patient care. 
 The move to hire the consultant, the Hunter Group, occurs as the financial climate has been tightening for the city's vast teaching hospitals, including Mount Sinai, which have been battered by a loss of patient revenue after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack. The hospitals are also facing new labor negotiations this spring that raise the specter of increased operating costs. 
But Mount Sinai, on Manhattan's Upper East Side with 1,171 patient beds and 8,329 employees, appears to have other problems. Its merger with New York University Medical Center in 1998 has been of little financial benefit, say doctors at both hospitals. Administrators say that the merger is still on, but that it has been restructured. And recently, Mount Sinai has lost teams of high-earning doctors to competing hospitals.
Mount Sinai is also searching for a chief executive and a dean to run its medical school. This leaves the institution somewhat rudderless as the Hunter Group, known for recommending layoffs, looks at the budget. Administrators who work in Mount Sinai's bureaucracy are nervously brushing up their resumes, according to some in the field who have received calls from the job seekers.
Mount Sinai officials said yesterday that many hospitals were facing budget problems. "To me, we're in no worse shape than any other hospital in New York, and this is no news," said Dr. Gary Rosenberg, a senior vice president. "We've had a 20-year run of no economic difficulty, and I don't know many corporations that don't need to refocus after a 20-year run." Dr. Rosenberg said the causes were typical. "We give a large amount of free and subsidized care," he said. "Managed care contracts pay us less. We had an increase in patient volume."
And then came Sept. 11, he said, which drove all these difficulties home. Like many hospitals, Mount Sinai opened beds and canceled elective surgeries to make room for casualties that never arrived.
But the hiring of the Hunter Group, of St. Petersburg, Fla., has left some doctors anxious and angry. "They have a reputation for being cutters," said Dr. Avi Barbasch, a Mount Sinai oncologist. "So while there is an attempt to allay some of those fears, there is still a sense of uncertainty."
The consultant's recommendations are expected by the first of the year. A Hunter Group employee said yesterday that the company did not comment on its consulting activities.
Mount Sinai is sitting on a relatively thin cushion, with an endowment of $30 million. By contrast, some New York City hospitals have endowments of close to $1 billion that generate a great deal of revenue.
N.Y.U. Medical Center, a smaller institution whose doctors initially opposed the merger with Mount Sinai, realized a $22.7 million operating profit last year. One Mount Sinai official said that N.Y.U. did not need to provide much free care to the poor, because it was affiliated with Bellevue Hospital Center, a public hospital three blocks away that treats all who walk through its doors. Mount Sinai spent more than $20 million on care for the poor last year.
Doctors say that the merger has been the source of ill will and infighting, with negligible benefits. "It's a joke," one N.Y.U. Medical Center surgeon said. "You can save on personnel and laundry, but that's kind of it."
Administrators at both institutions said that the merger was alive and well, just reconfigured to be "decentralized," as Lynn Odell, a spokeswoman for the N.Y.U. Medical Center, explained.
And Dr. Rosenberg said that the merger was of practical and financial benefit, allowing the hospitals more negotiating power when buying in bulk and arranging contracts.
A Mount Sinai trustee pointed to the good news at the facility: the recent recruitment of a Boston-based team of cardiothoracic surgeons, a new chairman of the department of medicine and an active recruitment campaign for the new dean and chief executive.
But he said: "Do I think there will be some layoffs? Sure."

HEADLINE: New Daily Newspaper Is Planned in New York City for 2002 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
An investment group that includes the company of the publisher Conrad M. Black said yesterday that it planned to start printing a new daily newspaper in New York City in the first few months of next year.
 The newspaper will "be very upmarket, certainly neoconservative in its ideological views," said Daniel W. Colson, the vice chairman of Mr. Black's company, Hollinger International. 
 The newspaper, which will be called The New York Sun, will start publishing at a time when advertising revenues are in a sharp decline because of the weakening economy. The Sun will enter one of the nation's most competitive newspaper markets, where two of the city's daily newspapers, The New York Post and The Daily News, have both lost money in recent years. 
Executives who work with Mr. Black, the chairman of Hollinger International, which owns The Chicago Sun-Times, and The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph of London, said that he had long wanted a newspaper in New York.
The top editors of the newspaper will be Seth Lipsky, who resigned under fire in 2000 as editor of The Forward, the English-language descendant of the venerable Daily Forward, and Ira Stoll, a former Forward staff member who now runs smartertimes.com, a daily Internet critique of The New York Times. Mr. Stoll describes himself on his site as "an ordinary semi-intelligent guy in Brooklyn who reads the newspaper carefully early each morning."
In a telephone interview from London yesterday, Mr. Colson said: "Look, New York is obviously one of the greatest, if not the greatest city in the world. Conrad Black lives part time in New York and is a great fan of New York. It's only natural."
He added, "I think you can assume the quality of the newspaper will be very high."
In 1993, Mr. Black failed in a bid to buy The Daily News. In 1999, he was unable to work out an agreement to buy a large interest in The New York Observer. Mr. Black was born in Canada, but he has renounced his Canadian citizenship and is a member of the House of Lords in Britain as Lord Black of Crossharbour. His company is based in Chicago.
Mr. Colson said Hollinger was making a 12.5 percent investment in The Sun, or about $2 million of the $15 million invested in the project.
The plans for the newspaper were reported yesterday in The Observer.
Mr. Colson said startup costs would be low because The Sun did not plan to establish its own printing and distribution systems, and would instead contract those services out. 
Mr. Lipsky, a longtime New York journalist who covered the Vietnam War and worked at The Asian Wall Street Journal, was the founding editor of the English-language Forward. He resigned in May 2000 after a battle with some investors over what they perceived as the newspaper's increasingly conservative bent under his leadership. Mr. Stoll, who also worked at The Forward, left at the same time and has since been operating smartertimes.com, which describes itself as being "dedicated to the proposition that New York's dominant daily has grown complacent, slow and inaccurate."
Smartertimes.com has lately been displaying classified advertisements seeking journalists and others to work for a new daily newspaper.
Mr. Lipsky and Mr. Stoll declined to comment yesterday. An executive involved in the planning said the Sun's other investors include Roger Hertog, the vice chairman of Alliance Capital Management, and Michael Steinhardt, a former hedge-fund manager and former vice chairman of The Forward. There are other investors, Hollinger officials said.
Hollinger officials said that Mr. Hertog, who had expressed an interest in starting what he called a conservative alternative to The Times, helped Mr. Stoll and Mr. Lipsky write the business plan.
Mr. Hertog did not return calls seeking comment yesterday. 
In circulation, Hollinger International is one of the world's largest newspaper and magazine publishers.
The venture takes the name of a storied newspaper from the city's past. The New York Sun, founded in 1833 by Benjamin H. Day, was among the first successful penny-press daily newspapers and is perhaps most remembered for its "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus" editorial in 1897. Charles A. Dana, editor of The Sun for almost three decades starting in 1868, was among the era's most influential journalists. The Sun effectively ceased to exist when it merged with The New York World-Telegram in 1950.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE MARKET; 
In Turbulent Bond Market, Enron's Woes Exacerbate Turmoil

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
The swift downfall of Enron has contributed to extreme turbulence in the United States Treasury market in recent weeks, causing violent swings in interest rates not seen since Russia defaulted on its debt and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund nearly collapsed in late 1998. 
 Even though the exact makeup of Enron's large trading portfolio remains a mystery, traders said that the energy company had bet that interest rates would continue to decline because of continuing weakness in the economy. 
 Then two weeks ago, the economy began to show signs of revival. As investors decided that the days of Federal Reserve rate cuts were over, rates began to rise and prices on Treasury securities fell. The move out of Treasuries crushed traders who still expected the weak economy to push interest rates lower. Scrambling to cut their losses, those traders sold even more, depressing prices and pushing up rates further. 
The sense among many market participants is that Enron's woes made a bad market excruciating. "I think the Street in general lost half of its year or more in the last week or two," said Stan Jonas, managing director at Fimat USA, a broker dealer. "Everyone was long the bond market, thinking the economy was going to be bad. Then everything shifted, and Enron drove it to extremes."
How extreme? In the two weeks beginning Nov. 12, two-year Treasury notes plummeted in price, pushing their yields up to 3.18 percent, from 2.41 percent. In the same period, yields on Treasuries with five-year maturities went to 4.4 percent, from 3.62 percent.
The trade that appears to have gone awry for Enron, market participants say, involved the sale of hundreds of thousands of Eurodollar futures, some of which matured in two or three years. Such contracts are frequently used to bet on the direction of interest rates. Enron could also have used the Eurodollar contracts to hedge against fluctuations in oil prices. In a weak economy, oil prices usually fall. But so do interest rates, so a bet on lower rates would produce gains to help offset the decline in oil prices. When data showed signs of life in the economy, traders surmised that Enron began to sell its Eurodollars and started an avalanche of selling among other traders. 
There were huge Eurodollar positions being liquidated, said Gemma Wright, director of market strategy at Barclays Capital. "We don't know for certain who it was, but the amount of the loss was high."
One reason that traders suspect Enron may have been forced out of such a position was that the company had neither the cash flow nor the bank credit to meet calls for additional cash from traders at other firms. Typically, companies have cash reserves to meet such calls or have access to temporary lines of credit to cover shortfalls. Enron appears to have neither. Yesterday, the company said it was suspending all payments except for those "necessary to maintain core operations." 
In addition to the recent interest rate spike, Enron has had to contend with falling oil prices. The price of crude oil has dropped 28 percent since the end of October.
Caught in a vise, Enron has almost certainly been selling securities to raise cash. Treasury securities and Eurodollar contracts, because their markets are large, are among the easiest to sell. In both cases, Enron was probably selling into a falling market.
Adding to the turmoil in the bond market, traders said, was less participation by Wall Street firms, which were unwilling to take on big new trading positions near the end of their fiscal year. Several firms end their years on Nov. 30. 
Some traders say Enron's problems started with comments on Tuesday by Laurence H. Meyer, a governor of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Meyer suggested that additional rate cuts might be coming, and that remark helped stabilize prices of Treasury securities. "It's my view that there are no coincidences," Mr. Jonas said. "Laurence Meyer is a big hawk on interest rates, and he basically talked a 180. That was their big gun. The only bigger gun would have been Greenspan."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: AN OVERVIEW: NOV. 28, 2001; 
Troop Buildup, an Aggressive Dragnet and the High Price of Terror

BYLINE:  By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
The buildup of United States forces in Afghanistan is far from over, said their commander, Gen. Tommy R. Franks of the Army. The operative word seemed to be "more." More marines will soon arrive, bringing the total to about 1,000. More makeshift bases will be built as needed around the country. And more attack planes will be sent to Central Asia, with the former Soviet republics of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan the likely staging areas.
 ADDING PRESSURE -- The goal, of course, is to deliver a final blow to Osama bin Laden and the remnants of his Taliban shield, believed to have taken refuge near Kandahar in southern Afghanistan and across a stretch of terrain east and south of Kabul, the capital. "We're going to continue to apply pressure," General Franks said. 
 "We," it would seem, means more than Americans. Anti-Taliban commanders in eastern Afghanistan said the United States had enlisted them to hunt for Mr. bin Laden in remote mountain hide-outs. And leaders of the Northern Alliance, who have shown a willingness to march to their own drummer, said they planned an eventual push south of Kabul, in the hope of making life tougher for Taliban still active in that area.
On Tuesday, American warplanes hit a compound near Kandahar where Taliban leaders had clustered. Some important people were probably killed, Pentagon officials said, but it seemed not the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar. He was safe, his people said.
From the Americans' perspective, by far the most important casualty was one of their own. In a rare announcement, the Central Intelligence Agency said that one of its officers, Johnny Michael Spann, 32, was killed on Sunday in the uprising by Taliban prisoners. He was the first American combat death in Afghanistan.
CIVIL LIBERTIES -- The civil liberties implications of the domestic war on terrorism came under scrutiny from the Senate Judiciary Committee, whose Democratic leaders have been increasingly skeptical of administration policies. But Assistant Attorney General Michael Chertoff made no apologies. "Are we being aggressive and hard-nosed? You bet we are," he told the committee. "In the aftermath of Sept. 11, how could we not be?"
Mr. Chertoff said the detention of hundreds of people was important to combat terrorist "sleeper cells" waiting to strike. But a close look at those being held suggests that, if guilty as charged, they are largely a collection of petty criminals and garden-variety immigration violators. Some are indeed charged with serious crimes, including about two dozen linked to Al Qaeda or said to have other terrorist ties. But most seem to be small-timers caught up in an aggressive dragnet.
On that score, too, Mr. Chertoff saw no reason for apologies. People who have overstayed their visas or otherwise violated immigration laws "have essentially overstayed their welcome in this country," he said. "They don't belong here."
CASH AND TERRORISM -- Money, the raising and the spending of it, has been essential to understanding the post-Sept. 11 world. That may seem obvious, but it has been reinforced, several times over.
Money enabled the Sept. 11 suicide hijackers to take flying lessons in the United States. Now the German police have arrested a Moroccan, Mounir el-Motassadeq, who is described as the terrorists' paymaster in Hamburg, managing a bank account through which he funneled cash to them.
Money, $428 million to be precise, is being spent by the Bush administration to buy 155 million doses of smallpox vaccine from two companies, Acambis and Baxter International. Along with supplies that already exist or are on order, there should be enough vaccine to protect every American if smallpox becomes a bioterrorism threat, the administration says.
Money is suddenly scarce for federal budget makers. Doesn't it seem only yesterday that surpluses would stretch to the horizon? Between the recession and the costs of war, the administration now says, deficits can be expected for the next three years -- at least.
And money is what national politicians usually think of when New York is mentioned. The tendency has been to treat the city as if it were a giant A.T.M., a place to go for quick campaign cash. But New York's sorrow apparently has touched political hearts. People in both major parties say they are thinking, as a gesture of solidarity, about holding their 2004 presidential conventions in Madison Square Garden. They mean it, they say.

 The Hot Pursuit

MORE AFGHAN BASES -- The commander of American forces in Afghanistan said the United States might establish more makeshift bases inside the country, making it easier to dispatch marines and Army soldiers quickly wherever they are needed in the intensifying hunt for leaders and fighters of the Taliban and Al Qaeda. A1

SEARCHING FOR BIN LADEN -- American forces have enlisted commanders in eastern Afghanistan to help search for Osama bin Laden in isolated mountain hideouts. B2

MILITARY TECHNOLOGY -- The air war in Afghanistan, which is being waged using a pastiche of Civil War and Star Wars techniques, demonstrates the advances in technology since the Persian Gulf war. B1

CONFLICT AVERTED -- Spain's prime minister avoided a potential confrontation when he said he would consider any request by the United States for his country to hand over eight men charged with complicity in the Sept. 11 attacks. B4

The Afghan Future

SOLDIERS DISARMING -- Thousands of Northern Alliance soldiers withdrew from the city of Kunduz, and their commander said they would begin disarming, then assume civilian jobs to help the interim government. B5

NEGOTIATING IN GERMANY -- In a meeting in Bonn, delegates from four Afghan factions began intensive negotiations over the shape of an interim post-Taliban government. B5

SPEAKING FREELY -- With the Taliban gone from the northeastern city of Jalalabad, the bazaar is once again a marketplace of ideas, with people taking pleasure in arguing about the future of Afghanistan. B5

The Search for Security

A LOOK AT DETAINEES -- Only about a dozen of the 1,200 people detained in the investigation launched after Sept. 11 have any links to terrorism. The rest appear to be a collection of immigration violators, speeders and petty criminals. A1

TERRORISM MEASURES QUESTIONED -- In a Senate hearing, a Justice Department official faced questions about the planned use of military tribunals and the interrogation of mostly Middle Eastern men. B7

A HOLIDAY ON ALERT -- Only a few Americans will get to see the Christmas decorations at the White House, which is securely battened down by guards on terrorism alert. B7

RADIATION PRECAUTION -- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is moving toward buying millions of doses of a drug that protects against thyroid cancer that might result from radiation exposure. B8

The Aftermath in New York

CITY'S NEW MEANING -- The terrorist attacks have sent the political parties scurrying to New York, eager to show unity with the nation's most wounded city. Both Democrats and Republicans are mulling over holding their 2004 presidential conventions at Madison Square Garden. A1

A BAFFLING COLLAPSE -- Almost lost in the chaos of the Sept. 11 attacks is another mystery: the fall of 7 World Trade Center hours after flaming debris from the twin towers rained down on it. B9

MORE ACCESS -- New York City officials eased several restrictions on cars coming into Manhattan. B9

LOST TIPS, FEWER HOURS -- Workers like nannies and limousine drivers are part of a huge yet largely overlooked segment of New York's economy that has suffered badly since the terror attacks. D1

The Arts

LOOKING FOR ANGLES -- Cable networks like VH1 and Court TV have been finding a way to work the war into their programming. E1

Enemy Of My Enemy

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Here is the modern corollary to a Middle Eastern proverb: The enemy of my enemy can be my enemy, too. 
 Iran's Shiites despise the Taliban Sunnis; fundamentalists of both branches of Islam have long been killing one another. Iran's ayatollahs also hate another U.S. enemy, Saddam Hussein of Iraq, who killed a half million Persians in the Iran-Iraq war. 
 Does that enmity of our enemies make Iran our friend? You might deduce that from the warm handshake extended to Iran's foreign minister by Secretary of State Colin Powell at the U.N. last week, the first such contact since the mass kidnapping at our Tehran embassy in 1979. Or from Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld when asked by Bob Schieffer of CBS about Iranian liaison with U.S. forces in Afghanistan: "You're going to see new relationships coming out all across the globe." 
That's because we've been falling for the tough-cop-nice-cop routine from Tehran. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who rules as Iran's religious commander, punishes dissenters as he spews hatred of Israel and "Great Satan" America. Meanwhile, nice-cop President Mohammad Khatami condemns the Sept. 11 attacks and supports the Afghan rebels, feeding dreams of "moderation" in bloom. 
But reformers in Iran's Parliament are repeatedly squelched by Khamenei's ruthless Guardian Council. Suppressed Iranians now know that front-man Khatami's election led to a false spring. Fifty newspapers have since been closed; the vigilantes of Hezbollah, the "Party of God," are urged by clerics to beat up students with democratic yearnings; savage public executions are on the rise. When rumors spread last month that the government had bribed soccer players to lose a World Cup qualifying match, tens of thousands marched in the streets to denounce the ayatollahs and to hail America. 
In our State Department's most recent report on global terrorism, Iran beat out Iraq and Syria to win the title of "most active state sponsor of terrorism." This conclusion, unwelcome to dovish policy makers at Foggy Bottom, was not lightly arrived at. Evidence is mounting that Tehran sponsored the killing of Americans at Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia. Even today, Iran's air cargo planes fly arms and explosives to Damascus for trucking to terrorist headquarters of Hezbollah in Lebanon, for use by suicide bombers against Israeli civilians. 
Most dangerous to us, Iran leads the terror-sponsorship world in the development of nuclear capacity. Sitting atop a sea of cheap oil, Iran needs atomic energy like a hole in the head, but its rulers take income sorely needed by hungry Iranians and spend it on nuclear material and scientific know-how from Russia. Vladimir Putin, President Bush's fervently trusted ally, continues to refuse all appeals from the U.S. and Israel to curtail sales to its customer at the center of terror sponsorship. 
Why the intense economic and diplomatic pressure from Tehran on Moscow, which overwhelms the pleas of the Bush White House? Because Iran's Hezbollah wants its nuclear bomb and no so-called moderates in Tehran stand in its way. 
Here's new evidence of Hezbollah's increased power: Imad Mughniya is called by Israelis "the Lebanese Carlos," after the former jackal of terror, because he is suspected of leading a string of hijackings and embassy bombings, including the attacks on Jews in Buenos Aires in 1994. A key figure in the Islamic Jihad, he has enjoyed asylum in Iran. 
Six weeks before Sept. 11, in a meeting in Beirut, the top Hezbollah commander, Hassan Nasrallah, placed Mughniya on the terror group's governing body, the Shura Council. To maintain the fiction that Hezbollah is a local Lebanese political party, the global terrorist's name was changed to Jawad Nour al-Din. 
Whatever he calls himself, the Lebanese Carlos is now considered by Israelis to be the man selected by Iran's strongman, Khamenei, to be Tehran's operational leader in Lebanon. The significance is that Mughniya is not a radical politician, like the man he replaced, but an experienced international terrorist on the lam from three governments. 
In Iran as in Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Syria, local tyranny and global terror go hand in hand. That's why we should resist strange antiterrorist bedfellowship with Iran's tough-cop-nice-cop rulers. Iran is becoming ripe for democratic revolution. We should not ally ourselves with the cruel clerics whom secular Persian patriots will one day throw out.

HEADLINE: White House Says It Expects At Least 3 Years of Deficits 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said today that it expected the federal government to run budget deficits for at least the next three years, confirming that the recession and the costs of fighting terrorism had combined to wipe out huge projected surpluses and complicate the agendas of both parties.
 The disclosure came hours before Republican and Democratic leaders sat down to begin negotiating over their sharply differing approaches to a proposed economic stimulus package. Republicans continued to press for a new round of tax cuts for businesses and individuals. Democrats insisted that the focus should be on assisting low-income workers and people who have lost jobs. 
 J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the House speaker, said after the negotiating session that the two parties had discussed procedural issues and would meet again on Thursday.
Both sides said they were willing to run deficits for a year or two in an effort to revive the economy and pay the bill for national security. But the worsening budget outlook is sure to lead to an intense partisan battle over who is to blame for the stunning turnabout in the nation's fiscal condition and how to pay for competing priorities, including tax cuts, paying down the national debt, a military buildup, prescription drug coverage for retirees and increased federal spending on education. 
Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said the economic downturn, less optimistic forecasts for tax-revenue growth in the future and increased federal spending after the Sept. 11 attacks mean the government will return to the red in this fiscal year and remain there for the two subsequent years and maybe longer.
"It is regrettably my conclusion that we are unlikely to return to balance in the federal accounts before possibly fiscal '05," Mr. Daniels said, referring to the fiscal year that will start on Oct. 1, 2004. "That is, within the next two years things will have to break right for us to do that."
Raising the possibility that the budget situation could continue to deteriorate, Mr. Daniels, in a speech at the National Press Club, said decisions about taxes and spending in the next year "will determine whether we ever see another surplus."
Democrats in Congress said they concurred with Mr. Daniels's forecast but that they differed with him over the cause. The single biggest contributor to the swing from huge surpluses to persistent deficits, they said, was the $1.35 trillion tax cut that President Bush pushed through Congress earlier this year over opposition from most Democrats.
"I agree with his analysis that we will be running deficits for those years, but he left out the biggest reason, which is the tax cut," said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, a Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. "We were in danger, as I pointed out on many occasions, of running deficits before Sept. 11 ever occurred because of the tax cut and the economic downturn -- and the tax cut was by far the biggest reason."
In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the government posted a surplus of $127 billion, down from $236 billion the year before but the fourth straight year the government ended in the black after nearly three decades of continuous deficits.
As recently as August, the Congressional Budget Office and the White House had continued to forecast large and growing surpluses in coming years even after factoring in the cost of Mr. Bush's tax cut. The Congressional Budget Office projected then that the surplus for the current fiscal year would be $176 billion, including $174 billion in excess Social Security revenues, followed by surpluses of $172 billion and $201 billion in the two subsequent years. The White House's figures were similar.
Mr. Daniels did not say how big he expected the deficits to be in coming years, but he acknowledged that the government would be forced to use the Social Security surplus to pay for other government operations, something that both parties had been promising not to do.
Democrats said the new budget outlook made it all the more important that the proposed stimulus package not include permanent tax cuts whose costs would mount over the next decade. Republicans said the same thing about Democratic proposals to subsidize health insurance premiums.
After a standoff of weeks, the two sides arranged the negotiations on the economic recovery plan after Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic majority leader, told President Bush and Republican Congressional leaders that he would drop his insistence that a package of Democratic spending initiatives be considered as part of the deal.
Mr. Daschle said he would instead take up the spending plan, which would provide additional money for domestic security needs like border patrols and bioterrorism preparedness, as an amendment to the Pentagon spending bill, which the Senate will consider next week. Mr. Daschle said he would cut the spending proposal in half, to $7.5 billion, in deference to Republican concerns about government spending getting out of hand.
The two parties have agreed in principle that any stimulus package should contain tax breaks to encourage businesses to invest more in new equipment and some sort of payment to low-income people who did not receive rebate checks this summer under the tax cut Mr. Bush signed into law in June. Both parties also want to include some expansion of unemployment benefits.
But Democrats and Republicans have very different ideas about the details, and the philosophical gulf between them does not lend itself to easy compromise.

HEADLINE: Why Won't Bloomberg Call? Giuliani's Staff Is Wondering 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
When asked about what his next administration will look like, a common response from Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg is that he wants "the best and the brightest." When many members of the current administration heard that, they apparently believed Mr. Bloomberg was referring to them. 
 So it has come as a surprise to many high-level Giuliani officials, said several people in both the arriving and departing administrations, that their phones have yet to ring with a transition member from the Bloomberg team on the other end asking if they would like to stay. 
 "Everyone has been walking around the halls in recent days saying, 'Have you been called? Have you been called? No. No. You?' " one administration official said. "I think it has been a major awakening for a lot of people."
As Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani ponders various lucrative job offers and a career in public speaking, many of those who have worked the same vacation-free, hard-driving schedule right next to him are looking at the city's bleak economy and hoping that they can hang on to what they have.
Mr. Bloomberg has said from the morning after he was elected that he would welcome resumes from far and wide, including from within the current administration. But he made it clear that Giuliani administration officials would not have an inside track and that they would have to go through the same casting call as any other candidates. 
"Before you pick, you want to see who else is available," Mr. Bloomberg said that day. 
But many commissioners and other high-level officials still expected at least to be called and are a little perplexed that they have not been, several officials said.
After all, Mayor Giuliani has been called the mayor of America, and his commissioners, deputy mayors and others, by the mayor's account, contributed to his accomplishments, particularly in handling the city during the terrorism crisis. Further, Mr. Giuliani endorsed Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican who many in the administration believed would carry on most of Mr. Giuliani's policies.
Yet Bloomberg aides said that few commissioners, deputy mayors or other officials had been contacted because it was expected that they would submit resumes along with everyone else.
"The obligation is on these people if they want to stay," one aide said. "We have not been going around telling people, 'You're fine.' Everyone's operating assumption is that they should resign Jan 1. The second assumption should be if they want to stay, they should reach out. The onus is on them."
There have been exceptions. A few days after the election, Mr. Bloomberg asked the current police commissioner, Bernard B. Kerik, to stay in his post. Mr. Kerik declined. And during his campaign, Mr. Bloomberg said he wanted to keep the commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services, Nicholas Scoppetta, who has also said he would like to leave government.
The fire commissioner, Thomas Von Essen, has also told Mr. Bloomberg that while he does not wish to stay on, he would not leave before the new mayor has found an appropriate replacement, a mayoral aide said.
But others are longing to stay, according to officials on both sides, and some are dropping their names to reporters, in hopes of floating trial balloons in newspapers, or having others lobby subtly on their behalf. Others who want to stay, like the health commissioner, Dr. Neal L. Cohen, have dutifully sent in their resumes. 
Others still, like Transportation Commissioner Iris Weinshall, will not discuss their plans or wishes but refer inquires in a way that perhaps implies them. "The commissioner would like to refer all calls to Ed Skyler at the Bloomberg team," said Tom Cocola, her spokesman. Ms. Weinshall has told associates that she would like to stay but that she has not discussed this with the Bloomberg transition team, a 56-member group that has just begun to huddle in subcommittees and whose mission is to pick commissioners, but not deputy mayors. 
"Clearly, there are some very qualified people in the Giuliani administration," Mr. Skyler said yesterday. "And anyone who is interested in being reappointed should communicate that to us."

HEADLINE: Bush Gives Tight-Fisted Support to Bigger Farm Subsidies 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28 

 BODY:
President Bush jumped into the debate over American farm policy today, saying he supported generous federal subsidies for farmers as long as those payments stayed within the budget.
 In his first remarks about the 10-year, $171 billion farm bill now stalled in the Senate, Mr. Bush tried to reassure Republicans from agriculture states that he would not abandon farm subsidies. At the same time, he tried to stick to an earlier administration goal of spreading the subsidies to give more to smaller farmers. 
 He said he favored the current safety net, which mostly helps the large farmers of grain and cotton. But he also said he wanted the government to finance savings accounts that would help all farmers based on need.
"A good farm bill should be generous, but affordable. It should honor the budget limits that Congress has agreed to live by," Mr. Bush said.
Normally of interest only to the handful of states that receive huge grain and cotton subsidies, the farm bill has become a major concern of environmental groups hoping to expand conservation measures and of advocates for greater financing for the food stamp program. And today it became a bargaining chip in the battle between the president and the Democratic-controlled Senate over several crucial economic issues.
While both parties want to appear to be a friend of farmers, Republicans in the Senate are threatening a filibuster of the farm bill unless Democrats agree to move on the president's economic stimulus package.
The Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, said today that the administration should press for immediate passage of a new farm bill even though the current law does not expire until October.
"I don't think you can emphasize enough the urgency with which we need to address farm legislation," Mr. Daschle said at a news conference.
And Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa and chairman of the Agriculture Committee, backed away from his proposal to cut crop subsidies to the wealthiest farmers, hoping to win the support of the Southern Democrats on his committee. 
But the administration had sharp words for the Democratic measure supported by Mr. Daschle and Mr. Harkin.
Appearing with the president at a farm convention here, Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman said the Democrats' bill would deepen the current cycle of encouraging farmers to produce too much, leading to lower prices and to farmers pleading for expensive bailouts.
"This creates pressure for more government payments, thereby creating a self-defeating and ultimately unsustainable cycle," Ms. Veneman said.
The White House had similar complaints about the Republican farm bill that passed the House last month. That attempt to provide regular support for farmers went against several goals outlined in the administration's farm policy blueprint. 
Mr. Bush underlined his concerns today saying, "A good farm bill should keep the safety net under our food producers, without misleading our farmers into overproducing crops."
His answer for American farmers who produce far more food than the domestic market can consume is to expand trade. The president said the recent trade summit in Doha, Qatar, could help open new markets to American agricultural exports.
"Doha shows the way toward a more level playing field," he said. "That's good news for the world's hungry; it's good news for the world's most productive food producers -- the American farmers."
But several proposals in the various farm measures being considered by Congress could violate existing trade agreements. The president warned that any farm bill had to "honor our trade obligations as we expect our competitors to honor their obligations."
Democrats said these complaints could stall the farm bill indefinitely and jeopardize the financing for farm subsidies. Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota and chairman of the Budget Committee, has warned that with the economy sliding, money for the farm bill could disappear next year.
Even if Mr. Daschle succeeds in bringing the farm bill up for a vote, lawmakers from both parties plan to offer amendments to shift money from the crop subsidy program to environmental programs and to change the subsidy program itself.
In his speech, the president repeatedly turned to the war in Afghanistan and praised farmers for their role in it.
"As we speak, trucks and planes are delivering American food to the hungry in Afghanistan," Mr. Bush said. "Those rations say, 'A gift from the people of the United States.' This gift is made possible by the farmers in our country, and I want to thank you for it."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: HOLIDAY PLANS; 
In the Capital, It's Scrooge's Season

BYLINE:  By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28 

 BODY:
Only a few privileged Americans will get to see the decorated rooms of the White House this Christmas, with the 100-pound gingerbread house and glittering theme of "Home for the Holidays" securely battened down by guards on terrorism alert.
 True, ordinary Americans are free to journey as tourists 12 miles down the Potomac to Mount Vernon's special holiday showing of George Washington's false teeth. But it's not quite the same as beholding the tree-top ornament within the Bush White House. 
 "Don't come; stay home and hide," said Eleanor Holmes Norton, the capital district's delegate to Congress, finding bittersweet meaning to the "home" theme being broadcast by the White House even as it keeps the public away. 
"The federal government is the Scrooge of the season," Ms. Norton said, waxing Dickensian in denouncing the antiterrorist security at the White House and the Capitol as excessive and damaging not only to this city's tourist economy but also to the morale of Americans far beyond.
"You know, people watch what politicians do, not what they say," Ms. Norton cautioned. She finds President Bush's television spot calling for resumption of a normal happy life "countermanded" by the spectacle of a Capitol ringed by soldiers and a White House blanketed from traditional visitations of the season.
There is something of a Scrooge nominating competition in the capital city, where the spirit of Osama threatens to trump Santa's cheer. 
"There are a lot of nervous Nellie school administrators out there who for unfair and ridiculous reasons have banned student travel," Neil Amrine, president of the Guide Service of Washington, said in offering his nominee. Mr. Amrine tells of irrational travel bans spreading well beyond the capital, with some uptight schools lately forbidding students to visit Plymouth Rock in Massachusetts or even a pumpkin patch in suburban Maryland. 
"The fact is Washington is safer than it's ever been," Mr. Amrine said. He complains that the nation at large is unaware that officials have seen no need for many extra security restrictions here beyond the headlined bans on seasonal tours at the White House and the Capitol.
But those two attractions are exactly the point in coming to Washington in the first place, in the view of Mark Plotkin, political commentator for public radio's WAMU, who knows this city, rich and poor, better than any of the talking heads in the Sunday TV ghetto.
"There's a psychic wound here this season," said Mr. Plotkin, furious at the thickened security barriers. "And they all read 'until further notice,' " he said. "There's no hope in that." 
He sees a "country club" level of security that will let politicians, lobbyists and journalists visit the White House this season, but not plain Americans looking for fresh inspiration after Sept. 11.
Christmas is in the air beyond the crime-scene tape festooning Senate offices. The annual letters-to-Santa celebration by the Postal Service took care to tell kiddies to include clear return addresses and to omit crumbly cookies from the envelopes this anthrax-anxious season.
"Every street closure, every false alarm, every pronouncement by officials has an effect," Congress was told two weeks ago by William A. Hanbury, chief executive of the Washington Convention and Tourism Corporation. City leaders counted empty hotel rooms, rising unemployment and falling revenue as the D.C. industry second only to government -- hospitality -- was traumatized.
The White House may indeed be Scrooge-like in at least being open to second thoughts and ratcheting back security a bit. It has reversed the ban against the general public's daring to gather on the Ellipse, well behind V.I.P. ticket holders, to see the Christmas tree turned on outside the White House next week.
"Bring your binoculars," muttered Delegate Norton as she called for greater concessions for tourists' good cheer. She proposes a system of advance Social Security identity checks, the same as the White House regularly applies to nontourist visitors. 
When the crowds do return, Michael G. Palmer, executive director of the Students and Youth Travel Association of North America, recommends a stop at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial to ponder current twists on fearing fear itself.
"Decisions based on fear teach kids to make decisions based on fear," Mr. Palmer cautioned, reflecting on all the disappointed students who did not get here this fall. 
There is some seasonal hope. Now is the time when major tour groups, including the legions who scrapped their plans to come to Washington after Sept. 11, make decisions about next spring that will prove crucial for the city.
"One of the best things is that Thanksgiving was an absolutely uneventful holiday," noted Eric Liedholm, vice president of New Century Tours. "We are hoping for another uneventful holiday on Christmas and New Year's. If so, confidence will be rebuilt, and tourists will return."
So, the wish is for uneventful holidays to one and all.

Articles in this series are reporting on places around the country as they adapt to life after the terror attacks and to the onset of war.

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Internet: Bush Signs Internet Tax Ban 

BYLINE:  NYT (Compiled by Alan Krauss) 

 BODY:
 President Bush renewed a ban on Internet taxes for two years, saying the legislation would "ensure the growth of the Internet is not slowed by additional taxation and that holiday shoppers will not be burdened by new taxes on their online purchases." Congress passed the original ban on Internet taxes in 1998 to prevent states and local governments from imposing taxes that some thought might stunt the growth of the World Wide Web. 
The moratorium lapsed on Oct. 21. Some governors and state officials have argued that millions of dollars are lost in taxes every year when people shop on the Internet. Others, including online retailers and technology companies, say taxation of online transactions could impair Internet commerce -- particularly during the current recession. Mr. Bush said online spending was expected to account for about 15 percent of holiday purchases this year.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Investors Pull Back as Enron Drags Down Key Indexes

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks sank yesterday as Enron teetered on the brink of one of the biggest corporate implosions in United States history and added to the debate swirling around the market's powerful run-up.
 "The market has come awfully far, awfully fast," said Jon Brorson, director of equities for Northern Trust, which manages more than $300 billion. "Enron is weighing on it, too. I think people are a little squeamish as to the reverberations, and it's a great excuse to take some profits." 
 Enron fell $3.50, or more than 85 percent, to 61 cents, in frenzied trading after Dynegy pulled out of its $9 billion takeover. Shares of Dynegy were off sharply as well, dropping $4.08, nearly 10 percent, to $36.81.
Credit rating agencies sharply cut Enron's bonds, to junk status, pushing the company, a once mighty energy trader, another step toward bankruptcy.
Enron squeezed other energy traders and financial giants, including Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase, which might suffer losses of more than $400 million combined on the loans that they made Enron, an analyst said. Citigroup was off $2.75, to $47.80; J. P. Morgan fell $2.30, to $37.50.
The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average surrendered 160.74 points, or 1.6 percent, to 9,711.86, the largest drop in about a month and the lowest close since Nov. 12. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 20.98 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,128.52. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index dropped 48 points, or 2.5 percent, to 1,887.97.
Enron dragged on the market as Wall Street questioned the rally that had lifted stocks well off the Sept. 21 lows. Investors, still expecting an economic recovery in 2002, pocketed profits on worries that share prices were getting too far ahead of prospects for corporate earnings.
Milton Ezrati, a senior strategist at Lord Abbett & Company, which oversees $40 billion, said, "The market felt it was getting a little too optimistic a little too quickly and there's recognition of the many, many risks in this environment."
Economic conditions were still sluggish in late October and early November after the Sept. 11 attacks, according to a Federal Reserve beige book report, which is an anecdotal snapshot of the economy based on reports from the 12 regional banks of the Fed.

Treasury Prices Fall
By Bloomberg News)
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday, after the government's biggest sale ever of two-year notes flooded the market with debt.
The Treasury sold $21 billion of the two-year notes, up from $19 billion in October's auction, part of an effort by officials to finance a spending increase with the sale of short-dated debt.
It was the biggest monthly auction of two-year notes since the Treasury began selling the securities in 1972, swelling supply and driving down prices.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 3/32, to a price of 100 17/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.93 percent from 4.92 percent on Tuesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 10/32, to 100 11/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.35 percent from 5.33 percent on Tuesday.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auction of two-year notes:

HEADLINE: Pared-Down Election Ballot Reopens a Divide in Iran 

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Nov. 28 

 BODY:
When seven members of Parliament died in a plane crash in May, few expected that replacing them would prompt a national political showdown that has called into question, once again, the degree to which the Islamic Republic of Iran is a republic at all.
 More than 100 candidates signed up to run in the elections, scheduled for Friday in Golestan Province, in northeastern Iran. 
 But the Guardians Council, a conservative oversight body with the constitutional power to screen electoral candidates, rejected 55 of them.
Most of those blacklisted are reformers who, like President Mohammad Khatami and the current Parliament's majority, advocate more government openness, the protection of individual rights, freer expression and more accountability to the people. 
Both Mr. Khatami and the Parliament were elected with wide popular support. They have regularly been at odds with the Guardians Council, which is seen as the arm of the country's religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Ayatollah Khamenei appoints 6 of its 12 members and controls the judiciary that nominates the others.
Believing that they answer to a higher authority than the voters, the ayatollah and other senior clerics have seemed reluctant to accept any dilution of their near absolute power.
This is only the latest clash between the country's elected and appointed bodies, and between reformers and conservatives, since President Khatami's election in 1997 and the Parliament's election last year.
The Guardians Council has defied Parliament's efforts to repeal a repressive press code, which has been used to close dozens of newspapers, and it has rejected other laws, including one aimed at facilitating foreign investment.
If democracy can be rescinded at will, the reformers ask, what sort of democracy is it? If the vetoing of candidates continues, "people will lose confidence in the system, and their participation will decrease," Mohammed Ali Abtahi, an adviser to President Khatami, told one newspaper this week.
Members of Parliament are concerned less about Golestan's election than about the next Parliamentwide election in 2004. If they cannot change the electoral law -- something they promised voters before their election last year -- the council could use it to help conservatives regain control of Parliament. 
The stakes are high, both inside and outside Iran. Since the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, relations with America have become another battleground between conservatives and reformers. The reformers say that the two countries' common interests in Afghanistan -- Iran opposed the Taliban and is eager for stability on its border -- provide an opening to begin talks after more than two decades of animosity. They established a parliamentary committee to review foreign policy and nudge Iran toward talks with America. 
But foreign policy, particularly when it comes to America, is also under Ayatollah Khamenei's control and, at least publicly, he and his conservative supporters have dug in. Direct talks with America are out of the question, he said last month. Lest anyone be inclined to think otherwise, his hard-line judiciary can, through a committee of its own, ensure that no official pursues relations with the United States. 
Still, while it seems that the conservatives hold most of the constitutional cards, reformists increasingly see victory even in defeat. Mahmoud Shamsolvaezin, a journalist who was imprisoned for 19 months after his newspaper was closed under the press code, says the Guardians Council's highhandedness may work to the reformers' advantage, because it exposes the system's weaknesses.
Conservatives argue that Parliament is trying to undermine the pillars of the country's Islamic system, and that it is seeking a political distraction because it has no answer to the country's economic woes.
One conservative member, Moosa Qorbani, told the paper Jomhuri Islami: "Despite the people's demands to answers for their economic problems, the issue of the disqualification of the candidates has been raised. It shows that the people's problems are not important for anyone."
The reformers reply that the country's economic problems did not start when they took power last year. "People could hardly make ends meet from the beginning of the revolution," Ali Shakourirad, a member of Parliament from Tehran, told the newspaper Nowruz.
The Islamic revolution's most clearly articulated ideas, he said, had to do with opposition to America and the capture of its embassy (also known as the "den of spies"); the war with Iraq; and the basij, the volunteer vigilante force founded by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to uphold the revolution. 
"Which one of these have improved the people's economic situation?" Mr. Shakourirad asked. 
As to the people, at least those stopping by a Tehran newsstand on Tuesday, it was hard to find among them a defender of the Guardians Council or the Leader, as Ayatollah Khamenei is known here. None would give their full names, a sign of lingering fear, but they gave their thoughts uncensored.
"I don't follow the news very carefully," Ahmad, 45, a businessman, began before quickly belying that statement, "but what is obvious is that a minority is trying to rule the majority. The aim is to neutralize the reform efforts led by President Khatami and now joined by Parliament. The group trying to neutralize these efforts is led by a higher-ranking leader, and we all know who that is." 
Two men quickly got into a political debate. "We want democracy; we should have a referendum," said Salarvand, 20, a civil servant. "The people should be allowed to vote. Even the Leader should be put on a referendum to see if people want him."
Mashaallah, a 45-year-old math teacher, took a more moderate approach. "Math teachers are moderate," Mashaallah said. "Biology teachers are reformists. We can have the Leader if he obliges himself to act within the law."
Salarvand replied: "Our laws are ridiculous. Parliament's members are the people's representatives, but decisions are made by the Guardians Council, which isn't elected by the people." He invoked the revolution that deposed the shah, and warned: "The laws should be flexible. We don't have to topple the regime." 
In trying to reform the electoral law, Parliament found itself in a constitutional Catch-22. It voted twice last week for amendments to the electoral law that would dilute the Guardians Council's power. But the Guardians Council also has the power to reject laws passed by Parliament, and in this case, it did. The result was a furor in Parliament, and some measure of disgust among the people.
The Expediency Council, which mediates disputes between Parliament and the Guardians Council but is also controlled by conservatives, met Tuesday night to resolve the standoff. As expected, it decided that there was no need to change the existing law on the screening of elections. 
But no one believes the battle has ended. Some reformers plan to push for a referendum on electoral law, and have even threatened to resign if they are blocked again. And in Golestan, reform groups and some of the candidates stricken from the ballot are now tacitly suggesting, in rhetoric cloaked in revolutionary propriety, that voters boycott the conservative candidates in Friday's election.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE; 
Foundation Gives Way On Chief's Big Dream

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

 BODY:
Well before anyone could imagine that Enron might collapse, Kenneth L. Lay was stumped. In an interview in August, he dismissed questions about a vague clause in the energy company's annual report that hinted at bigger problems if its stock price or credit rating fell below certain levels.
 "I just can't help you on that," he said. Pressed further on questions about a bewildering constellation of business partnerships that involved Enron's former chief financial officer, he said, "You're getting way over my head." 
 At the least, Mr. Lay -- a man of big ideas, a crusader for free markets, a risk taker in the Texas wildcatter tradition -- had taken his eye off the ball. While he was busy befriending the nation's most powerful politicians, erecting one of the tallest buildings in Houston and pasting Enron's logo on the city's new ballpark, the little things were turning out to be Mr. Lay's big problems. 
One after another, disclosures spilled out of his company over the last month: the partnerships had hidden billions in debt; years of Enron's reported profits had been exaggerated; the government was investigating. Rivals were shunning Enron's energy trading desks, which Mr. Lay had built into the world's leaders. And sure enough, the stock price tumbled day after day, and credit agencies lowered Enron's ratings once and then yesterday again, turning the company's debt to junk and its shares into a penny stock.
Three weeks ago, Mr. Lay tried to salvage his creation by selling it to Dynegy, his Houston rival. Yesterday, Dynegy pulled out of the deal. Deprived of enough information, and then repelled by what they learned, the free markets in which Mr. Lay had put so much faith all but destroyed, in a matter of weeks, everything he had built.
"If they had been going a slower speed, the results would not have been disastrous," said Bob McNair, a Houston energy entrepreneur who sold the bulk of his own company to Enron three years ago. But Enron, he said in an interview this month, was like a race car, and the markets like an unforgiving track. "It's a lot harder to keep it on the track at 200 miles per hour," he said. "You hit a bump and you're off the track." 
From his youth, Mr. Lay, 59, had nurtured an abiding faith in the markets' wisdom. He studied economics at the University of Missouri, living at home to save on room and board, and eventually earned a Ph.D. in the subject. As a naval officer serving in the Pentagon, he worked to develop more efficient accounting systems. Later, he served as an aide to a federal government regulator for the natural gas industry -- a market that Enron would come to dominate.
Moving into the private sector, he worked his way up the ranks of the natural gas industry, becoming chief executive in 1984 of the Houston Natural Gas Corporation, a big regional pipeline operator. He engineered its merger with Internorth, an Omaha pipeline company, and then became chief executive of the combined company and changed its name to Enron.
Mr. Lay saw Enron's mission as far more than being a conduit for fuel. At the time, gas prices were regulated and pipelines played a relatively passive role; buyers and sellers could not cut deals on the fly. But as oil prices plunged in the mid-80's and gas users began switching to cheaper fuel oil, Mr. Lay returned to Washington to argue, successfully, for rules changes that he said would save the pipeline business by allowing operators to shop for the best deals from both gas producers and utilities.
The new flexibility brought the threat of chaos, however, as natural gas prices began fluctuating wildly. That is when the new Enron was truly born. To help customers shield themselves from risk, Mr. Lay's Enron developed hedging contracts for gas like those traded in the markets for corn and copper and winter wheat. Its innovative "gas bank" let utilities lock up the long-term prices that they craved; Enron lined up the gas supplies from producers, arranged for delivery -- and took a cut of every deal. 
That business became the forerunner of Enron's entry into hundreds of other markets, helping customers obtain supplies and manage risks in products ranging from electric power to pulp and paper and, most recently, fast broadband access to the Internet. Trading soon provided more of the company's profits than the traditional natural gas business.
While other companies, including Dynegy, focused on accumulating hard assets like pipelines, turbines and gas fields, Enron increasingly saw itself as a pure trading company with an almost limitless future. 
"There is a very reasonable chance that we will become the biggest corporation in the world," Mr. Lay's handpicked successor as Enron's chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, told the authors of a book, just published, about business on the Internet. Even the book's title, "Radical E: From GE to Enron -- Lessons on How to Rule the Web" (PricewaterhouseCoopers), showed the cachet the company had attained. Enron, the authors wrote, was "creating a culture in which radical and creative thinking is encouraged and rewarded." 
Mr. Skilling abruptly resigned in August, after just six months on the job, propelling Mr. Lay back into the gritty details of Enron's businesses that he had sought to leave to others.
As the company grew, he had become increasingly involved in public affairs, serving as host when a global economic conference was held in Houston in 1990 and when the Republican National Convention came to the city in 1992. 
Like the leaders of many big Texas businesses -- the construction colossus Brown & Root after World War II or Ross Perot's Electronic Data Systems in the 1960's -- Mr. Lay knew the value of courting politicians and policy makers. 
He played golf with President Bill Clinton; became good friends with the Texas governor, Ann Richards; and supported Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, whose wife, Wendy, a former chairwoman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, joined Enron's board. 
"He's a stand-up guy," said Ms. Richards, now a business consultant in New York. Asked to be more specific, she said, "He's at the meeting" -- meaning she could count on Mr. Lay to become directly involved with whatever she asked him to do, and not just sign onto a project for show.
Mr. Lay's deepest political ties were with the Bush family. In the 1980's, he became a major fund-raiser for George H. W. Bush. When Mr. Bush lost his 1992 campaign for re-election as president, Mr. Lay brought a number of senior Bush aides to Enron as directors or consultants, including James A. Baker III, the former secretary of state, and Robert A. Mosbacher, the former secretary of commerce.
Mr. Lay also cultivated Mr. Bush's son George W. long before he was considered a serious national candidate. After the younger Mr. Bush's election as Texas governor in 1994, Mr. Lay became head of the Governor's Business Council, an important advisory post. 
The bond with President Bush is personal. As governor, Mr. Bush sent Mr. Lay a kidding note in 1997. "One of the sad things about old friends is that they seem to be getting older -- just like you!" he wrote. "55 years old. Wow! That is really old. Thank goodness you have such a young, beautiful wife," he added, a reference to Mr. Lay's wife, Linda. 
In 1999, Mr. Lay sent a handwritten Christmas note to Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura. "Linda and I are so proud of both of you and look forward to seeing both of you in the White House," he wrote.
Yesterday, the White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, said the Treasury Department was monitoring Enron's downfall for its effect on the market. Asked if the president himself had any reaction, Mr. Fleisher said, "The president's reaction is that it should be monitored."
In some ways, Enron's collapse was one more example of the bursting of the Internet bubble. But Mr. Lay was not some stylish dot-com brat; by all accounts, he is an immensely likable product of Middle America. Growing up in tiny Rush Hill, Mo., he was driving a tractor by age 12 and salting away savings. By 16, his sister Sharon recalled this week, "he was bucking bales" -- that is, loading hay -- "and had two jobs in the summer, painting houses."
"I don't think you could ever say that he did something the easy way," she said.
That work ethic ran in the family. Mr. Lay's father was a minister who also sold farm equipment. The family's finances were spotty, "at times no money, at times some money," Ms. Lay recalled. Still, the Lays took in people from their church who were in need. 
Over the last decade or so, Mr. Lay earned some $300 million from Enron, mostly by exercising stock options. Earlier this month, when employees grew incensed at the prospect of his collecting a big severance package with the company's sale to Dynegy, he volunteered to walk away from $60 million in payments.
Mr. McNair, the Houston entrepreneur, who has known Mr. Lay for years, suggested that perhaps everything had not been disclosed to him. "Maybe the people who reported to him told him what they wanted him to hear, but they weren't telling him everything," he said.
Mr. McNair said he spoke to Mr. Lay recently and found him "somewhat in a state of shock." Mr. McNair added, "He's devastated."
In the end, it seems, the man whose company did so much to help others manage their risk could not manage his own.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE MONEY TRAIL; 
House Votes to Combat Sale of Diamonds for War

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28 

 BODY:
The House voted today to give President Bush the power to impose trade-related sanctions on nations that sell diamonds to finance war or terrorism, a step that supporters say will help stem the trade of so-called blood diamonds.
 The measure sailed through the House 408 to 6 after reports linked Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network, Al Qaeda, to the African diamond trade, which is also thought to a major cause of civil wars in sub-Saharan Africa. 
 While human rights groups favored stronger steps to pressure nations to ban imports of diamonds and other gems that finance violent conflicts, the House's compromise bill has the backing of the Bush administration. The Senate has not yet taken up a similar bill. 
"This is an historic step to introduce transparency to the diamond trade and take the profits away from people responsible for carnage in Africa," said Representative Tony P. Hall, an Ohio Democrat who was a sponsor of the measure.
Warlords and terrorists in Angola, Sierra Leone and Congo have fought for years for control of diamond mines, using the diamonds themselves to finance their war efforts, United Nations officials and human rights groups say. Battling militias in those countries have killed millions of people and maimed millions of others in some of the worst human rights abuses in the world, these groups say.
The United States buys nearly two-thirds of all finished diamonds, and the threat of losing access to the American market could pressure countries to cooperate with United Nations-backed efforts to police the trade in diamonds, which are easily transported and hard to trace. 
Bush administration officials have opposed international efforts to impose stringent controls on the purchase and sale of diamonds at every step from producer to consumer, arguing that such measures are onerous and may run afoul of international trade rules.
But the administration softened its position after reports that Mr. bin Laden and his supporters may have made millions of dollars acquiring raw diamonds at low prices from Sierra Leone and reselling them at high market prices. The reports first appeared in The Washington Post.
"That is what put us over the edge," Mr. Hall said.
A separate effort to combat the sale of illicit diamonds is under way at an international conference in Botswana this week. Nations there are seeking to devise a system that would ban the cross-border sale of rough diamonds unless they have a passport denoting weight, value and provenance, making it harder for a country to export more diamonds than it can prove it produced legally.
Supporters of the House vote regard it as helping that United Nations-backed effort. The Bush administration, however, has sought to water down international inspection and certification measures, preferring to deal with illegal diamond sales on a case-by-case basis.
Adotei Akwei, who follows the diamond trade issue for Amnesty International, the human rights organization, said that the Bush administration had so far delivered "half a loaf" by agreeing to use presidential authority to ban imports on an ad hoc basis. But he said that much more remained to be done.
"We still have serious reservations about whether the United States will participate fully," he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Official Sees Russia in Oil Catbird Seat 

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 28 

 BODY:
In American eyes, Russia has taken on crucial importance as a world energy producer, and its role will grow even larger when the Russian government clears the way for extensive foreign investment in its energy sector, the United States secretary of energy, Spencer Abraham, said here today.
 "Russia is emerging as a separate nucleus of the energy equation; we respect that," Mr. Abraham told reporters in a briefing today as part of a four-day visit to Moscow. As new investment unlocks more of its potential, he said, Russia will be put "in a very strong position vis-a-vis world energy decision-making." 
 Mr. Abraham's visit is significant, coming at a moment of great nervousness on world oil markets. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has been pressing major nonmember producers like Russia for weeks to fall in line with its plans to prop up prices by cutting production significantly. Mexico and Norway, the No. 2 and No. 3 non-OPEC exporters, are willing, but only if Russia, the largest, joins them. Russia has made sympathetic signals but has resisted committing itself to anything but token cuts.
As a result, oil markets have remained glutted and prices have skittered up and down on the latest hints about Russia's intentions.
Domestic investment in the energy sector here is booming, and production has risen markedly as a result. But a critical mass of foreign investment has been slow in coming. Foreign companies say they can consider multibillion-dollar projects here only if Russia breaks with past practice and makes firm commitments on the tax rates to be assessed.
ExxonMobil scored a breakthrough last month when it won just such a commitment from the government for a project to develop an oil field off Sakhalin Island in Russia's Far East. Initial investment in the project by a consortium led by ExxonMobil will run to $4 billion.
Another big development is a $2.6 billion pipeline, built by a consortium led by ChevronTexaco, from oil fields in Kazakhstan to the Russian port of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea. The pipeline, which entered service last month with an initial capacity of 600,000 barrels a day, helps address a major constraint on exports from Russia and its Central Asian neighbors -- a shortage of pipeline capacity to bring the oil to market.
"Russia is an enormous country, and there are plenty of opportunities," David J. O'Reilly, Chevron Texaco's chief executive, said in an interview. Mr. O'Reilly is in Russia this week for the formal opening ceremony for the pipeline. "We hope to build further from this place that we have established in the region," he said. 
So far, the pipeline is Chevron Texaco's only major stake in Russia proper, but it is a leading player in Kazakhstan and is looking at investing in Sakhalin. 
Mr. O'Reilly declined to say whether it had other potential projects in Russia under study, but he described Russia as "now a more influential exporter of oil than it has been in some time" and one that OPEC must reckon with.

Musical Chairs In London?
 After months of speculation, the British Museum has finally announced the appointment of Neil MacGregor as its new director. Mr. MacGregor, 55, has been director of the National Gallery in London for 15 years. He will replace Robert Anderson, who has run the British Museum since 1992. 
 As director of the National Gallery, Mr. MacGregor was in charge of an institution with more than 2,000 paintings. The British Museum's collections are vast, with more than 50,000 objects on view and 6 million or so in storage. 
Because of cuts in arts lottery revenues and private support, it is having financial problems so great, experts close to the museum say, that the museum may have to close galleries, cut hours, reduce its staff and postpone plans for a $112 million study center. Attendance has fallen recently, and the museum lacks adequate gallery space.
Mr. MacGregor, who begins his new job on Aug. 1, is a popular choice in the international museum community. At the National Gallery, besides organizing many important exhibitions, he made some important acquisitions, including Stubbs's "Whistlejacket" and Holbein's "Lady With a Squirrel."
His move to the British Museum is expected to trigger a round of musical chairs in the London museum world. So far the likely candidates to replace him are Charles Saumarez Smith, director of the National Portrait Gallery; Christopher Brown, director of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford; and Desmond Shawe-Taylor, who runs the Dulwich Picture Gallery in southeast London. Mr. Saumarez Smith is thought to be the front-runner.
In a statement this week the National Gallery said the closing date for applications for the director's job would be in January, with interviews in February and March. The trustees are aiming to announce the next director in April.

Suburban Ready-Made
That the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art still has no director after the sudden departure of David A. Ross three months ago isn't dampening its enthusiasm for shopping. Nor is the shaky economy, which has affected many trustees' pocketbooks.
With the help of Phyllis Wattis, one of its biggest benefactors, the museum recently acquired Gordon Matta-Clark's "Splitting: Four Corners" (1974), a seminal example of the artist's work.
In 1974 Matta-Clark sawed through the middle of a vacant two-story house in Englewood, N.J., and cut out the four corners at the top, transforming it into a sculptural element. "Splitting: Four Corners" is one of the artist's signature "building cuts" -- site-specific sculptural transformations of condemned buildings.
"Besides being the artist's single most important work, it continues our dedication to art that operates, to paraphrase Robert Rauschenberg, 'in the gap between art and life,' " said Madeleine Grynsztejn, the museum's senior curator of painting and sculpture.
The work is especially important to the institution because it was inspired by works like Duchamp's famous urinal, titled "Fountain," which Ms. Wattis helped give to the museum in 1998.
"Now we can tell the story of ready-mades from Duchamp through Rauschenberg to Gordon Matta-Clark," Ms. Gryn-sztejn said. "It helps us tell the history of art from the beginning of the 20th century to the present."
The work was intended to inspire the viewer to rethink the middle-class American dream of the nuclear family, along with notions of shelter and safety, by revealing the building's layers of lath, plaster, wallpaper and paint.
It is on view through mid-June as part of the exhibition "Points of Departure II: Connecting With Contemporary Art," which showcases several new acquisitions from the permanent collection. The exhibition includes film and video documentation of the work, along with posthumous photographs of "Splitting: Four Corners" given to the museum by the artist's estate.

More Room
The 65-year-old Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond has chosen Rick Mather, an American-born, London-based architect, to plan and design a $79 million expansion and renovation.
The project involves adding more than 100,000 square feet to the 380,000-square-foot building, as well as creating a master plan for the museum's 13-acre site that will include a 3-acre sculpture garden.
Although the museum has already had four additions, its space for temporary exhibitions is awkward, said Michael Brand, its director.
"We can't do all the major exhibitions we'd like to," he added. The existing museum will be reconfigured for a better flow between spaces.
"We're in the quiet phase of the capital campaign, and we have a bit of a way to go," Mr. Brand said. The museum, a public-private partnership, also hopes to get money from the state.
"So far we've gotten $4.3 million for planning, and we're going to the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia to help pay for a share of the building," Mr. Brand added. "They've already agreed to pay $8.3 million for a parking deck."
This will be Mr. Mather's first commission in the United States. In London he has been involved in renovating and expanding cultural institutions including the Dulwich Picture Gallery and the Wallace Collection. He is developing master plans for the South Bank Center on the Thames in London, the largest arts and culture complex in Europe, as well as the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford University.
In July 2000 the museum's board requested proposals from more than 100 architects; five finalists were chosen. The others were Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, Polshek Partnership and Smith-Miller & Hawkinson, all from Manhattan, and Machado & Silvetti Associates in Boston.

HEADLINE: Buying Domestic? Good Luck 

BYLINE:  By CHERYL JENSEN 

 BODY:
THE nation is at war, displays of patriotism are ubiquitous and millions of Americans have rushed out to buy new cars, lured by low- or no-interest financing and encouraged to spend money to stimulate the economy. But despite the star-spangled tenor of the times, the phrase "buy American" has seldom been heard.
 Perhaps that's because the concept, applied to a global auto industry with few borders, seems as outdated as a fallout shelter from the 1950's. 
 "Buying American is an issue for some, but not the key issue for most," said James N. Hall, vice president for industry analysis at AutoPacific Inc. in Southfield, Mich. "And to a lot of younger buyers who grew up with their parents' driving Accords and Camrys, Toyota and Honda are American cars. They're imported from Ohio."
Other potentially confusing examples abound. Decisions about Swedish Volvos and English Jaguars are made by Ford executives in Dearborn, Mich. (and in Anaheim, Calif., where Ford's Premier Automotive Group is based). The executives running Chrysler in Auburn Hills, Mich., have German accents and report to Stuttgart. Chrysler minivans are built in Canada, Pontiacs are made by Toyota in California, some Fords and Chevys come from Mexico and Mercedes S.U.V.'s roll out of Alabama.
Consumers who do care about a car's origins can get some information from its domestic-content label, which is part of, or close by, the window sticker. The American Automobile Labeling Act required the labels on every passenger vehicle made after Oct. 1, 1994. They must include the percentage of American or Canadian parts in each model, the assembly site of the vehicle and the origin of the engine and transmission.
Still, the label is not as helpful as the tag that tells where a sweater is made. It treats American and Canadian content the same, under terms of the Auto Pact that integrated the nations' automotive industries in 1965. And it includes only the origin of the components, not the value of the labor used to assemble those parts. So foreign carmakers with United States assembly plants cannot factor in the value of their American workers' labor.
Careful study of these labels can yield surprises. Only 35 percent of the parts in the new Buick Rendezvous -- built in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico -- are of American or Canadian origin. In contrast, most Toyota Camrys are assembled in Georgetown, Ky., with 65 percent domestic content.
And consider the Dodge Ram 1500 pickup and the Toyota Avalon full-size sedan: both are 75 percent American (or Canadian).
In general, the "most American" vehicles are those that are both sold by the Big Three and assembled in the United States or Canada. A 1998 study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that such cars have, on average, substantially higher domestic content than vehicles built by foreign-based transplant manufacturers like Honda, Nissan or Toyota.
But that is changing. The study also noted that transplants added substantially more American components from 1995 to 1998, while Big Three vehicles used fewer American or Canadian parts but more from Mexico -- because of the North American Free Trade Agreement of 1994.

HEADLINE: The Good Old Days Were Not as Good as We Thought 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
THE late 1990's in America were a wondrous time, when the economic statistics heralded a new era and the stock market confirmed it.
 The stock market statistics are locked in time. No one will ever challenge the fact that the Nasdaq stock market rose 86 percent in 1999. Those numbers do not get revised. 
 But economic statistics are subject to revision, and a lot are being revised these days. The government previously decided that neither corporate profits nor productivity improvements were nearly as good as they appeared to be in 1999 and 2000. And now the industrial production numbers have been sharply revised downward.
"The new numbers show industrial production was dramatically overestimated, particularly in the high-technology area," said John Vail, the chief strategist of Fuji Futures, a financial futures firm in Chicago. The Federal Reserve, in announcing the changes, said that "the new estimates show less rapid gains in the output of semiconductors, computers and peripherals."
To be sure, there was a boom in those industries, but it was not as great as had been thought. Now output in those areas is falling faster than had been reported. "A fair amount of the reason for the enthusiasm for brave-new-world productivity growth disappeared," said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig Securities.
That is important for understanding the economy of recent years and for charting the economy's future. But for the moment it probably is not important for the financial markets. The attitudes of investors and consumers were shaped by what they perceived in the late 1990's, and their recollections are of the longest economic expansion in American history. It was not as good as we thought it was, but it was still pretty good. 
The result seems to be a "What, Me Worry?" dichotomy in the economy. Jobs continue to vanish at a rapid pace, with more people collecting unemployment insurance than at any time since the 1982-83 recession. That number has risen more than 70 percent over the last year, a rate of growth not seen since the brutal 1973-75 downturn. Help-wanted advertising has fallen to a 37-year low.
But many Americans seem to be reacting to such statistics the way they react to reports of starving children in some third world countries: it's too bad, but it really doesn't affect them. Their jobs are safe, they believe, and so is their future. The unemployment rate, at 5.4 percent, is half what it was in 1982. The latest Conference Board consumer confidence survey showed that more people still think jobs are plentiful than think that jobs are hard to get.
For some purposes, perception is reality. Though the industrial sector of the economy has suffered, consumers have remained relatively confident. In a normal recession, few customers would be lured even by big price cuts on automobiles. Now we get record sales, even if they are at prices that produce losses for the car companies.
That same innate optimism will probably produce a better holiday shopping season than most people expect, and it has helped the Dow Jones industrial average rise 19 percent since the post-Sept. 11 bottom.
It may also be enough to end the recession early next year. But if that happens, the recovery is likely to be one of the weakest on record, simply because there will be no pent-up consumer demand to spur it. The optimism born of the late 1990's boom was exaggerated, but it will take time for investors and consumers to conclude that was the case.

HEADLINE: Reports Suggest an Economic Recovery Soon 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29 

 BODY:
Orders for durable goods rose more in October than in any other month in the last nine years and new-home sales unexpectedly increased, according to reports released today. The reports suggested that the economy might soon recover from nine months of recession.
 The 12.8 percent rise in durable-goods orders came after a revised 9.2 percent September decrease and was led by increased bookings for weapons, ships, jet fighters and cars, the Commerce Department said. Sales of new homes rose 0.2 percent, to an annual rate of 880,000 houses, the fastest pace in four months. 
 Separate reports released today showed an increase in initial jobless claims and a drop in help-wanted advertising, signaling that weak labor markets may restrain the economy's recovery.
The factory orders report is "reassurance that a recovery is in the works," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Bank One in Chicago. Still, she added, "the situation will clearly get worse before it gets better."
The Labor Department reported new claims for unemployment benefits rose for the first time in five weeks, up 54,000, to 488,000 in the week that ended Saturday. The report also showed that the number of people continuing to draw benefits in the week ended Nov. 17 jumped to 4 million, the highest in 19 years, from 3.7 million.
An index of help-wanted advertising in major American newspapers fell in October to 46, the lowest since 1964, the Conference Board said. In September, the index was at 52.
The increase in durable-goods orders was the largest since the government started keeping comparable statistics in 1992.
Factories have shouldered the burden of an economy that slipped into recession in March, when employment peaked and declines in business spending deepened. Industrial production has fallen in 12 of the last 13 months, the weakest performance since the 1981-1982 recession, according to Federal Reserve statistics.
Orders for computers and related products increased 18.4 percent last month after falling 7.1 percent in September. Nonmilitary capital goods orders rose 7.4 percent after declining 13.1 percent the prior month.
Orders for automobiles and parts increased 10.6 percent in October after a 15 percent slump in September. Automakers sold new vehicles at a record pace last month, depleting inventories.
Inventories of durable goods fell 0.4 percent in October, the ninth consecutive decline. Shipments of big-ticket items advanced 3.2 percent last month, the first increase since May.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Climb on Some Upbeat Reports on the Economy

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday after orders for durable goods logged their biggest gain in October than in any month in the last nine years and several technology companies offered upbeat financial outlooks.
 "Every passing day, I am convinced that we have not only seen the lows in this bear market, but also that we are going to have decent returns over the next year from the stock market," said Stanley Nabi, managing director at Credit Suisse Asset Management, who forecasts a return of 12 percent to 15 percent by the end of next year. 
 Orders for the big-ticket durable goods notched a record jump last month, and sales of new homes climbed for a second consecutive month, showing bright patches in the ailing economy. 
But jobless claims, which jumped in the latest week, by 54,000, suggested it was too soon to say the United States is in recovery.
The storage networker Brocade rallied and joined the handheld-computer maker Palm Inc. and the business-to-business software maker FreeMarkets Inc. with positive outlooks. 
Technology shares were big winners, while Enron -- the once mighty energy trader that could be facing bankruptcy -- continued to sink.
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index ended up 45.29 points, or 2.4 percent, at 1,933.26 in a late-day rally. The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average jumped 117.56 points, or 1.2 percent, to 9,829.42. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 11.68 points, or 1 percent, to 1,140.20.
The market's powerful rally -- since its slump on Sept. 21 to three-year lows in the wake of the attacks on the United States -- had been been losing momentum this week. Investors are debating if they have pushed prices too high amid a recession, but their hopes for a recovery in 2002 are still firmly in place.
"People are trying to get a feel for when and how quickly there is going to be an economic recovery," said John Forelli, senior vice president at Independence Investment L.L.C., which oversees $20 billion. "They realize there are going to be some land mines out there like Enron, so they can't just indiscriminately buy."
Investors are waiting for today's second official reading of third-quarter gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the nation's economic health. G.D.P. is expected to contract 0.9 percent, according to a Reuters poll of economists, versus a contraction of just 0.4 percent shown by an earlier reading released in late October.
While the current quarter will be grim for corporate America, companies should be announcing better news in the second half of next year, Abby Joseph Cohen, the chief strategist at Goldman Sachs, told reporters.
S.& P. 500 earnings may begin to improve early in 2002, but the substantial year-on-year gains will come in the second half of the year, perhaps on the order of 12 percent to 15 percent, she said. --------------------

Treasury Prices Jump
(By Bloomberg News)
Treasury bond prices surged yesterday.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 19/32, to a price of 101 26/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.77 percent from 4.93 percent on Wednesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 22/32, to 10 21/32. The bond's yield fell to 5.24 percent from 5.35 percent on Thursday.

Sheffield Would Cost Mets a Lot

 BODY:
The Mets want to trade for Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Gary Sheffield, but doing so would cost them more than players. A person close to Sheffield said yesterday that he would use his right to refuse a trade to the Mets so he could renegotiate his contract. 
 The possibility that Sheffield might renegotiate was a major reason the Mets decided not to trade for him last spring. Their economic picture has grown murkier since then, and Mets General Manager Steve Phillips has told clubs he cannot add payroll without shedding salaries first. 
 Although Sheffield asked to be traded to the Mets last spring, the Mets are on his no-trade list and he would want a lavish five-year contract extension to accept a deal to them. He is signed for two years at $22 million, a figure he believes is well below his value. Because of the no-trade clause, Sheffield would essentially be able to name his price for the clubs to make a trade.
In any case, the Mets may not have the chance to obtain Sheffield. A Dodgers official said yesterday that the team was not interested in the package the Mets might offer. The Mets would consider dealing closer Armando Benitez, starter Glendon Rusch and outfielder Jay Payton for Sheffield, a six-time All-Star. But even if the Mets substituted the more established outfielder Matt Lawton for Payton, the official said the move would not make sense for the Dodgers.
Others players who interest the Mets include Milwaukee's Jeromy Burnitz, Anaheim's Darin Erstad and Florida's Cliff Floyd.

HEADLINE: Teachers at Catholic Schools Strike Over Pay and Pensions 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Teachers at 10 Roman Catholic high schools in and around New York City went on strike yesterday in a long-simmering dispute over salaries and pensions, forcing at least five of the schools to send students home early.
 Students at Cardinal Hayes and Cardinal Spellman High Schools in the Bronx were dismissed shortly after classes started in the morning, because the majority of their teachers were outside picketing. Three other schools -- Archbishop Stepinac High School in White Plains and Moore Catholic and Monsignor Farrell High Schools in Staten Island -- closed in the early afternoon. 
 At Maria Regina High School in Hartsdale, in Westchester, students spent most of their day in the gymnasium but hurried to greet their striking teachers at dismissal time, giving them hugs and high-fives. Earlier in the day, parents delivered coffee and doughnuts to the rain-soaked teachers. 
There was less enthusiasm at Cathedral High School in Manhattan, where some arriving students turned to go home when they saw the picket line yesterday morning.
"If we went in there, we would be sitting and watching movies or doing nothing," said Priscilla Espinal, a junior. "I might as well do that at home."
The unrest comes at a time when Cardinal Edward M. Egan is trying to close a $20 million budget gap with measures that have so far included the closure of three schools in the Archdiocese of New York. Although Joseph G. Zwilling, the spokesman for the archdiocese, said yesterday that the budget deficit and the contract talks were "two separate and distinct items," some union leaders bitterly suggested that Cardinal Egan was more interested in meeting the financial bottom line than in ensuring quality education.
At Cathedral, picketing teachers got a zealous pep talk from Randi Weingarten, the president of the union representing New York City's public school teachers. Ms. Weingarten, who was ridiculed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani this week after arguing that her members deserved a 23 percent raise despite the faltering economy, used the strike to lobby for her union members' contract.
"You deserve, like the public school teachers, a living wage and to retire with dignity," she told the teachers before joining their picket line for about an hour.
Delegates of the Lay Faculty Association, the union representing 377 teachers and guidance counselors at the 10 schools, said yesterday that the two sides were close to an agreement on a salary increase. Anthony Cusimano, the union's secretary-treasurer, said that the archdiocese had offered an increase of 8 percent over three years, and that the union was amenable. But the union, which last went on strike in 1993, was also seeking bonuses of $1,500 in the second year of the contract and $2,000 in the third, he said. High school teachers earn between $29,893 and $41,745, depending on experience.
Mr. Zwilling said the salary demands would be considered by the archdiocese only if the union dropped its request for a second pension plan.
Mr. Cusimano said the union wanted a second pension plan financed by its members' contributions because the current plan, administered by the archdiocese, did not provide nearly enough retirement income. For example, he said, a teacher who worked for the archdiocese for 25 years would receive only about $13,000 a year in pension benefits. The new plan, he said, would eventually double the teachers' annual retirement benefits.
The union maintains that the new plan would not cost the archdiocese any money, since teachers would finance it through payroll deductions. But Mr. Zwilling said yesterday that even if there was no cost to the archdiocese in the next contract, it might be liable down the road.
"It legally and financially obligates the archdiocese to this pension fund and exposes the archdiocese to liabilities that we have no control over," Mr. Zwilling said.
He added that the union's request for bonuses in the second and third years of the contract appeared to be a backhanded way of getting the archdiocese to finance the pension proposal, at least in the short term.
The dispute comes as a much larger union, the Federation of Catholic Teachers, is also negotiating a new contract. Leaders of that union, which represents 3,600 teachers at several hundred elementary and high schools in the archdiocese, said yesterday that they, too, were unhappy with what the archdiocese had offered to date.
In particular, the larger union is resisting a proposal by the archdiocese to switch to a new medical plan that would require higher teacher contributions. Michele MacDonald, the union president, also said the archdiocese had offered a salary increase of 6 percent over three years, which she termed "unacceptable."
Elementary school teachers working for the archdiocese earn $26,712 to $37,010 a year. In comparison, salaries for all New York City public school teachers range from $31,910 to $70,000. Salaries in many New York suburbs are even higher.
Mr. Zwilling would not discuss salary negotiations yesterday.
The other schools where teachers are striking are are John F. Kennedy Catholic High School in Somers, Westchester County; John S. Burke Catholic High School in Goshen, in Orange County; and Our Lady of Lourdes High School in Poughkeepsie, Dutchess County.
Union leaders refused to say whether the strike would continue, or for how long. But Mr. Zwilling said the archdiocese had advised all 10 schools not to cancel classes and to have administrators, nuns and priests fill in for striking teachers.
Students leaving Cathedral High School yesterday afternoon said they had spent the day moving from classroom to classroom, following their usual schedule, but with little adult supervision.
"One day is fun," said Glenelys Jimenez, a sophomore. "Two days are fine, too. But if this goes on for a long period, it's not good."

Patriotic Act: Asking Waiter For a Steak

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
IF you are looking to do good in these difficult times, Brian Kahn has a proposition perfectly in sync with the zeitgeist.
 Americans have been told to prepare for sacrifices during the war on terrorism, but so far most of us haven't had to do anything more than stand in line at security checkpoints. In World War II, patriotic civilians put up with rationing of fuel and food. Today Americans are being solemnly urged to stand up to our enemies by traveling to New York and ordering as much food as possible at downtown restaurants. 
 Now Mr. Kahn has an even better way for you to protect traditional American values. You can help New York's economic recovery at the same time you're preserving the landscape of the West. Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to go to a downtown restaurant and force yourself to order a really good steak dinner. 
Specifically, you must order steak produced in Montana by ecologically correct cattle ranchers -- or at least as ecologically correct as a cattle rancher can be. If you consider red meat to be inherently incorrect, you might regard Conservation Beef as an oxymoron, a bit like coming across a boulder in the wilderness that had been spray-painted "Preserve Nature!"
But the grasslands of the West did evolve naturally along with herds of grazing ungulates, and that is the ecosystem that Mr. Kahn is trying to preserve. He used to be director of the Nature Conservancy of Montana, which bought habitats for preservation, but it didn't have enough money to compete with the developers who were turning rangeland into 20-acre "ranchettes."
Mr. Kahn hit on the same strategy being used to protect wildlife in Africa and the Amazon: give the locals an economic incentive to cooperate. He formed Conservation Beef, a nonprofit venture with the Nature Conservancy and ranchers to preserve wildlife habitats along the Big Hole River and in the Madison Valley near Yellowstone National Park.
The participating ranchers follow guidelines to protect grizzly bears, elk, moose, wolves, beavers, bald eagles and great gray owls. The wildlife coexist with free-range, grass-fed cattle, raised without antibiotics or hormones. In return, the ranchers get above-market prices for their cattle from Conservation Beef. 
"We can afford to pay ranchers a substantial premium," Mr. Kahn said, "because we can market a superior beef, raised naturally and dry-aged the old-fashioned way, to buyers who want to protect great American landscapes."
It is marketed as "Beef With a Mission," and the mission doesn't come cheap. The home-delivered frozen steaks (sold through ConservationBeef.org) cost $10 to $18 apiece. The fresh meat sold to restaurants is available only at the end of the grazing season, from October through mid-December, and is confined to upscale restaurants like Artisanal, Il Buco, Picholine, Saul, Savoy and Union Square Cafe. But there seem to be plenty of customers willing to pay the price. 
"The beef has a richer depth of flavor," said Sara Jenkins, the chef at Il Buco, in NoHo. "It's the best piece of meat I've ever had."
The meat costs about 30 percent more than regular beef, said Peter Hoffman, the chef and owner of Savoy, in SoHo. "There's a fuller, richer flavor because the animal has had more exercise and more time to mature. Grass-fed beef at times doesn't feel as luxurious on the mouth because there isn't as much fat interwoven between the muscles, but the taste and the health benefits make up for it. And it's good to know you're helping to preserve land from development."
IF you were an eco-purist, you could argue that any form of beef consumption is an unacceptable assault on the planet because of all the land and energy involved in raising cattle. In fact, you could argue that free-range ranching is an even bigger strain than factory farming because it takes up more land. If all Americans insisted that all their meat be free-range, a good chunk of the continent's forests would have to be chopped down.
But such global worrying seems far-fetched as long as just a few Americans are buying beef from a few places in Montana that would otherwise become vacation homes. The only immediate problem caused by eating Conservation Beef is a diminution in the number of vacation homes available in Montana -- a problem, come to think of it, that may be of concern to some of the very people eating at upscale restaurants in downtown Manhattan. Those self-sacrificing citizens can feel especially virtuous if they force themselves to order that steak.

HEADLINE: Uncertainties Loom As New Yorkers Hit Welfare Time Limit 

BYLINE:  By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
Tonight, after many drumrolls and much confusion, tens of thousands of families in New York will reach a five-year lifetime limit on federal welfare aid. They are by far the largest group yet to face the federal cutoff that has long loomed in the nation's welfare overhaul, and they are among the first to face it in a recession.
 Already, the city's family welfare rolls have been cut in half by tough rules, work incentives, and a good economy, to about 387,000 recipients. But what the end of welfare means in practice for the startlingly diverse veterans of the rolls remains unclear and sharply contested. The issues range from short-term questions about whether computer errors will keep December rent and food money from needy families, to bigger concerns about whether a safety net designed in a booming economy will work as thousands of low-wage workers lose their jobs. 
 New York, which is required by its Constitution to aid the needy, has spread a state-financed safety net of sorts to catch an estimated 38,000 families whose welfare grants will be canceled over the weekend, at least 30,000 of them in the city alone. An additional 13,700 city families are expected to hit their federal time limit over the next three months. 
Starting in October, the city's Human Resources Administration summoned 10,000 to 15,000 of the affected families to apply for the Safety Net program. The mass call-in was an abrupt departure from a longstanding plan to make the transition automatic, and it was undertaken at a time when welfare computer systems and legal services were still crippled by the attack on the World Trade Center. Advocates for the poor protested that errors were likely to interrupt basic support for many needy women and children.
State and city officials say the last-ditch push has been a success, whittling several thousand cases from those expected to exhaust federal benefits by Sunday and moving more recipients toward self-sufficiency. Robert Doar, executive deputy commissioner of the State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, said that no one who is playing by the rules will be left in the lurch, and that most people can get virtually the same benefits as before.
"We do think it's gone very smoothly," Mr. Doar said. "There is no hard, cold, flat, 'You can't get assistance.' " He added, "There is an application process. It's relatively simple."
But a very different picture emerges from visits to several welfare offices, interviews with welfare lawyers, social service organizations, and recipients themselves. Some have received letters just in the last few days denying them state aid, apparently in error. Others, in offices bristling with ominous posters about time running out, tried to apply for benefits but caseworkers told them -- within a reporter's earshot -- that it was too late.
"They are closing cases in error, and clients are being denied the right to transfer to Safety Net assistance in cases where the client has done absolutely nothing wrong," said Marc Cohan, director of litigation for the Welfare Law Center, a national advocacy group based in New York. "The city's Human Resources Administration has been implementing this at the last minute, and 9/11 has been an enormous distraction."
Over all, almost half of those losing the grants from the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families block grant have jobs, but with earnings too low to disqualify them for a welfare supplement. Another 14 percent having been working in exchange for their benefits in assignments like cleaning parks. About 20 percent are classed by the city as noncooperative. The rest are divided among those in job training or job search programs, those still being assessed, and those deemed by the city to be temporarily ill, disabled or elderly. Many have shuttled among these different categories.
Mr. Doar said that families not summoned to apply for Safety Net before their deadline will be automatically transferred to the program. But, the city's past problems making even small case transfers, the sheer diversity of circumstances in these households and the conflicting information they have received from city caseworkers and state notices, all add to the dismay and confusion. 
"Honestly, I don't know what I'm going to do," said Odaliz Lopez, 31, a receptionist and mother of four. 
Ms. Lopez said despite wages of $9.85 an hour, she has been earning too little to forego a $200 monthly welfare supplement, because while her earnings raised her share of the subsidized rent, she kept missing days of pay, mainly to care for her 13-year-old son, Nicholas, who has had repeated operations for a brain abscess.
Summoned last month to apply in person for the state-financed safety net program, she said she thought she had successfully completed the application. But a few days ago she received a notice of denial, claiming that she had refused the offer of a job in the park -- an offer she said was never made. 
"This is to tell you that your public assistance will be discontinued," the notice said. "Your application for Safety Net Assistance has been denied." Ms. Lopez has filed an appeal, which may or may not keep her benefits going for a time. She will not know for sure until she swipes her Electronic Benefits card next week. If her case is closed, in practice she is also likely to lose Medicaid and food stamps until she can reapply, even though both are still available to families who have exhausted welfare benefits, and have even been made more generous in the aftermath of the trade center disaster.
In Brooklyn, Florence Dawson, the sole parent in a family of six, is also uncertain whether she will be begging for help from the church to feed the children next week, and calling charities for Christmas toys. But she admits that she did not respond to the most recent letters saying her case would be closed this month. 
She had other things on her mind she says -- her own surgery for a tumor in October, and her 5-year-old son Hashim's eight-day hospitalization for pneumonia this month. Such problems have always seemed more important to her than meeting welfare rules, she said. 
But Ms. Lopez, who says she did everything by the book, has longer-term worries, ones that echo the concerns of others about the recession, and the growing pool of people with no welfare benefits to fall back on.
"What happens if I lose my job?" she asked. "I'm no longer entitled to apply for assistance -- the letter says I was denied. How could I live off of unemployment, a family of five? One hundred and fifty dollars, which is what I would get -- if I'm even entitled to that."
The misinformation, too, has long-term consequences, said Wendy Bach, a lawyer with the Urban Justice Center, a nonprofit advocacy group. "The impression they have successfully created that welfare ends next week is probably the most devastating part of this," she said. "That's the word on the street. It is my belief that thousands of people simply gave up because of that, which is a travesty." 
To Mr. Doar and Jason A. Turner, the city's welfare commissioner, such concerns fail to acknowledge time limits as part of a successful campaign to end welfare dependency and to help people escape poverty by joining the private economy. 
Convincing long-term recipients to pay attention to time limits is part of the challenge, Mr. Doar said. He also pointed to an array of programs designed to make work pay -- through tax credits, child care subsidies, and child health insurance.
But David R. Jones, chief executive of the Community Service Society, one of the city's oldest social service agencies for the poor, says ideological blinders are keeping the architects of welfare reform from facing up to the new, post-Sept. 11 world. Thousands who had left the rolls are now tumbling into unemployment, he said. "The people who were washing up dishes from the back of restaurants, the secretary jobs -- those are the jobs that are being lost at an extraordinary rate in the recession," he said. "It is irresponsible not to recognize that this is like two freight trains on the same track -- people coming off the welfare rolls onto safety net, and people being laid off because of the depth of the recession in New York."

HEADLINE: Warehouse Holds Trove for Artists; 
Need 50,000 Buttons? They're Here, and Free

BYLINE:  By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
Like a Kmart reimagined as "Pee-wee's Big Adventure," a New York City-run warehouse in Queens is now giving away: 50,000 buttons donated by a button business; crates of neatly coiled bra straps from Victoria's Secret; rattan handbags in the shape of clam shells; and cans stacked floor to ceiling of Martha Stewart's interior decorating paint. And that is only a sample.
 Around 10 a.m. the other day, more than 50 art teachers and artists flocked to the warehouse, a 20,000-square-foot former Ford assembly plant in Long Island City, as the doors were about to open. "Good morning, M.F.A. shoppers," a silky male voice said over the loudspeaker. "Just a reminder: If you see something in shopping carts that is someone else's shopping, please do not take anything." 
 Then they grabbed their shopping carts and were off.
In these times of economic and social uncertainty, demand is rising in New York City for food for the hungry, clothing for the cold, shelter for the homeless and tutoring for children hit by cuts in Board of Education spending for after-school and Saturday classes.
But at Materials for the Arts, or M.F.A. in the parlance of those in the know, workers say they are noticing a rise in demand for a more unexpected commodity -- stuff to make art.
Materials for the Arts, a project of the city's Department of Cultural Affairs, has quietly -- too quietly, its managers now say -- purveyed what its name says since the waning days of New York City's last fiscal crisis, in 1979. It has provided a place for corporations to donate what is called industrial discard -- everything from bolts of fabric to less obviously arty supplies, like air-conditioners, desks, cellphones and computers -- get the tax write-off, and be assured that those materials will go to a public school or other nonprofit organization that is creating art.
For the recipients, the benefit is clear: the materials are free. This has been a great boon since Sept. 11 to the many arts groups that are busily working on memorials to the heroes and victims of the terrorist attack, and to public school teachers who are experiencing some of the worst budget cuts in many years.
"While we're waiting for things to unfreeze, we're trying to get enough stuff donated to keep going," Hawley Hussey, an artist with the Rotunda Gallery in downtown Brooklyn who teaches at public schools in Brooklyn, said the other day while shopping at the warehouse. 
Ms. Hussey is stocking up on buttons. "I really scored," she says. "I got great greens, reds, blues and yellows. I've got buttons that look like nipples, other ones like fingers, all kinds of interesting shapes."
With the money she is saving on materials, Ms. Hussey said, she can buy tools like sharp scissors. "It's so important for an artist to have good tools," she said breathlessly, as she darted around the aisles at top speed, her chignon starting to unravel.
The managers of Materials for the Arts, however, are dismayed that while 1,070 public schools -- nearly every one -- have registered with the warehouse, very few of them actually take advantage of it on a regular basis. On the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, 54 arts organizations came to the warehouse to shop, but only 8 of them represented city public schools.
In the Trim & Notions aisle Rhonda Spencer, a drama teacher at Public School 20 in the Bronx, was asking Ann Woodward, the resident personal shopping adviser, for some tips.
"We're making masks," Ms. Spencer said. "What kind of materials would be good for that?"
"Try Victoria's Secret -- the bra straps," Ms. Woodward replied. "They're stretchy, great for tying them on."
"I found these wooden beads, what could I use these for?" Ms. Spencer wondered.
"You could glue them on the masks," Ms. Woodward said. "Look for texture, look for size."
When they parted, Ms. Spencer was happily putting bra straps into her cart.
Like true artists everywhere, the people who work at Materials for the Arts are a bit quirky. Jesse Charland, the warehouse manager (and silky-voiced announcer), has put great thought into broadcasting the right music over the sound system as people shop. The CD collection features "Abba Gold," Marilyn Monroe's "Essential Recordings," Les Paul and Mary Ford's "16 Most Requested Songs" ("I really like them," Mr. Charland confides), Peggy Lee's "Classics" and the Beatles' "Abbey Road." ("We couldn't do without the Beatles," Mr. Charland says.)
Mr. Charland came to the warehouse in 1992, after a breakdown that had left him on welfare. "I had just broken up with my longtime love, and I just kind of descended into morbidity," he said. Perhaps recognizing his artistic bent, the welfare office assigned him to the city's Department of Cultural Affairs as a "Guy Friday," as Mr. Charland put it, and when an opening for warehouse manager came up, he applied and got the job. He was eminently qualified. He had worked in warehouses for Calvin Klein, Yves Saint Laurent, Ralph Lauren and the Goodheart Clothing Company, he says.
Now Mr. Charland is happy to be doing something helpful.
Harriet Taub became director of Materials for the Arts last November after selling her children's clothing company, Bumblewear. A trained art teacher, she started sewing clothes for her children in 1985 out of dissatisfaction with what was commercially available, then turned her living room clothing parties into a garment business. "I was the person who was always hunting something out of a Dumpster," she said.
It used to be, Ms. Taub said, that Materials for the Arts tried not to advertise too much, for fear it would run out of materials. Even the customers conspired to keep it a secret. "I would ask teachers, 'When you go back, do you talk about us?' " Ms. Taub recounts. "And they would say, 'Oh, no, I'm not telling anybody about you.' They're afraid it will go away."
But Ms. Taub believes that the supply of industrial discard is limitless, if only the warehouse can secure another truck and a couple more workers to make the pickups. Because she cannot afford to hire a truck, she is trying to barter services with other city agencies, like the Sanitation Department and the Board of Education.
"Everybody is used to working on 8-and-a-half-by-11 paper," Ms. Taub said. "Here, you can get paper four times that size. You can walk away with 50,000 buttons."
For those who question the value of buttons, she brings up the liberation of Afghanistan. "For the first time in 10 years, the Afghans are listening to poetry, watching 'Titanic.' Art nourishes your soul, and you don't have to go to Afghanistan for it."
Just a zany warehouse in Queens.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: RIGHTS; 
In Bonn, Three Champions for Afghan Women

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BONN, Nov. 29 

 BODY:
Sima Wali left Afghanistan 23 years ago when the Soviet Army swept into her country. Afghanistan was thrown into a downward spiral of violence, rivalry, civil war and harsh religious rule that finally forced Afghan women out of public life, jobs and education.
 "In these 23 years, Afghan women have had to fight their own jihad for peace and equality," Ms. Wali said. "It was a jihad, really. But it has also politicized Afghan women, even from behind the veil." 
Ms. Wali, who settled in the United States and has worked to better the lives of Afghan women, is one of three women taking part as delegates in the United Nations talks here on a provisional government for post-Taliban Afghanistan.
She and Rona Mansuri, who came to Germany in the 1960's when her father was Afghanistan's ambassador here, are delegates from the so-called Rome group, loyal to Afghanistan's former king, Mohammad Zahir Shah.
Before he was deposed by a cousin in 1973 and moved to Rome, the king, now 87, ruled an Afghanistan in which women had important public roles as legislators and ambassadors.
Under a 1964 Constitution, women were granted the right to work. Four then served as cabinet ministers and two others were members of the National Assembly -- a move into public life that accelerated during the 1979-89 Soviet occupation, when many women wore Western dress.
Under Burhanuddin Rabbani, the titular head of the Northern Alliance who was president before the Taliban took over, women had to be accompanied by male relatives in public under restored old laws enforced by the new Islamic police.
But under the Taliban, who took power in 1996, the status of women plunged. Education for those over 8 was banned and women were forced out of public life and jobs. Many were beaten for exposing their faces and some were publicly executed after accusations of sexual misconduct.
The popularity of the former king now is partly the sense of a lost idyll, before Afghanistan spun apart. But Ms. Mansuri and Ms. Wali are using their positions to go beyond a return to the past. They are here to argue for women to take full and responsible roles in any future Afghan government -- and for the reaffirmation and protection of women's rights to equality.
"We are not waiting any longer to be invited to sit at these tables where peace is being discussed and the reconstruction of our economy," Ms. Wali said. "We are the silent voices that need to be heard."
Pressure from the United Nations and the West, including the United States, was vital to get women as delegates here, Ms. Wali said. But now that she is in the room where the decisions are being made, she said, "I'm a constant presence to raise the issue of women."
A third woman, Amena Safi Afzali, an exile now living in Iran, represents the Northern Alliance. Requests to interview her were not answered.
Another exile, Fatima Gailani, is an adviser to the Peshawar group, who are mostly Pashtun. She comes from a prominent Afghan family, is the sister of the delegation's head, Sayed Hamed Gailani, and is married to another member of the delegation. She has studied Islamic law to better defend the rights of women, she says.
She is articulate and open and not shy about her interest in a serious job in a new government. But she is realistic as well.
"If I go to Afghanistan today and ask women for votes on the promise to bring them secularism, they are going to tell me to go to hell," she said.
"So I will not say that. I will tell them that I would work for equal rights with men under an Islamic constitution. We can work from there."
Ms. Wali, the director of Refugee Women in Development, based in Washington, is also a founder of the Sisterhood Is Global Institute based in Montreal. She is an organizer of a conference on Afghan women scheduled to open in Brussels on Dec. 4.
Ms. Wali persuaded both King Zahir and Mr. Rabbani to sign statements two weeks ago supporting the right of women to a full role in Afghanistan's political future.
The most egregious restrictions on women are being relaxed in Kabul.
Still, Ms. Wali is cautious about Mr. Rabbani's commitment to defend the rights of women "within the context of Islam," she said. The statements must be backed by action, she said.
She also appealed to Western women to understand that the real problems of Afghan women are "extreme poverty and the number of widows who have no means to sustain themselves," cautioning that Afghans would not immediately strip off their veils and take full roles in public life.
It is also important, she said, that "Western women respect the right of Afghan women to choice, including the choice of keeping their chadors and burkas."
The Afghan women here got support today from some European Union legislators, who talked to the delegates about the importance of women's rights and called on their own governments to ensure a new Afghanistan that is open to everyone.
"Let us hope to see each member of the military forces followed by a teacher and a health worker," they said in a "European women's declaration" on these talks. When one of the legislators, Britt Theorin of Sweden, who heads the Equality Commission of the European Parliament, told the Afghan delegations that 40 percent of the seats in government should be held by women, she said, "the women smiled, but the men said nothing."
Another European legislator, Emma Bonino of Italy, announced a one-day fast on Dec. 1 to support women in Afghanistan, and said that over 5,000 people from more than 100 countries had already agreed to take part. 
As for Ms. Wali, she said she intended to take part fully in Afghan political life. "I've been working for the rights of Afghan women for 22 years," she said, "and I do not intend to stop the struggle now."

HEADLINE: N.Y.U. Shuts Down An Internet Venture 

 BODY:
New York University said yesterday that it was closing down its for-profit Internet learning venture, NYUonline, but will move some of the company's activities into its School of Continuing and Professional Studies. 
 "Economic conditions have shifted and the benefits of having a separate for-profit enterprise have diminished," Harvey J. Stedman, the university's provost, said in a statement released by the university. 
 Three years ago, N.Y.U. was the first large nonprofit university to create a for-profit venture to market courses over the Internet.
Columbia University established a for-profit entity named Fathom and spread out costs by teaming up with other universities, museums and other organizations. But it, too, has had to scale back.
N.Y.U. envisioned a huge market for online courses if it could tap the Internet investment market to pay for development and marketing. But as the share prices of Internet companies plunged, so did the hopes for financing online university ventures.
By last year, N.Y.U. said it was offering about 100 hours of online courses in areas like conflict management and communications skills for managers. It teamed up with McGraw-Hill, the publishing company, to sell NYUonline courses to corporate clients.

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Internet: Panel Calls For Service Subsidies 

BYLINE:  NYT (Compiled by Alan Krauss) 

 BODY:
 A federal research group recommended that companies receive tax credits and grants for offering high-speed Internet services, particularly in rural areas. The National Research Council, which is part of the National Academy of Sciences and advises Congress on scientific issues, said the educational and economic value of broadband Internet access outweighed logistical difficulties and the expense of providing the services. 
The council said tax credits could "provide incentives for what is ultimately uneconomic activity." Telecommunications companies have questioned whether it makes sense to expand their networks to areas where there may not be many potential customers. About 8 percent of American households have high-speed Internet access, the council said. Most people connect through cable television lines, telephone lines or via satellite. Senator John D. Rockefeller, a Democrat from West Virginia, has already introduced legislation calling for a tax credit of 10 percent to 20 percent for companies that provide broadband services to rural areas.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: REBUILDING; 
Committee Leader Says Victims' Memorial Will Be Main Priority

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
The newly appointed chairman of a commission charged with rebuilding Lower Manhattan said yesterday that establishing a memorial to the victims of the World Trade Center attacks would be among the first priorities for the panel.
 John C. Whitehead, the former co-chairman of the investment firm Goldman Sachs & Company, was named chairman of the Lower Manhattan Redevelopment Corporation yesterday by Gov. George E. Pataki. Beyond the memorial, Mr. Whitehead urged patience for the residents, small businesses and cultural institutions that, along with the financial district, make up the neighborhood most affected by the attacks on Sept. 11. 
 "We want it to be done right and we want it to be done well," Mr. Whitehead said of the redevelopment effort. "How quickly it's done is not the primary concern." 
The redevelopment corporation has been charged with overseeing all aspects of revitalizing and rebuilding the areas of Manhattan south of Houston Street. Though its responsibilities remain vague, the corporation is expected to be the primary vehicle for spending the federal aid that city and state officials hope will continue to flow from Washington to help the region's economy. 
The board is a subsidiary of the Empire State Development Corporation, so control essentially lies in the hands of Mr. Pataki, who appointed 7 of the 11 directors. The governor and Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of Empire State Development, are likely to have influence over the choice of an executive director for the corporation, who will have day-to-day responsibility for its operations.
Reflecting the importance to Lower Manhattan of the financial industry, the board is heavy with representatives from Wall Street, including Mr. Whitehead, 79, formerly a top State Department official and a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
Chief among the other members was Richard A. Grasso, the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, whose presence is considered vital to the status of Lower Manhattan as the nation's financial capital. After three years of planning, Mr. Grasso recently backed away from a proposal to build a heavily subsidized $1 billion trading complex and office tower across the street from the stock exchange in Lower Manhattan. He said he feared the tower would be a terrorist target.
Mr. Grasso was one of four people chosen for the board by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, but Mr. Pataki also appointed three financial industry representatives. In addition to Mr. Whitehead, they include Frank G. Zarb, the former chairman of Nasdaq, and Deborah C. Wright, the chief executive of Carver Federal Savings Bank in Harlem and a member of the transition team of Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg.
Mr. Pataki's appointees include Ed Malloy, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York. The corporation is expected to solicit investment by private entities, among them union pension plans, in redevelopment. 
Mr. Pataki also appointed Lewis M. Eisenberg, who has resigned as chairman of the board of commissioners of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, a position to which he was appointed by Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey; Roland W. Betts, the lead owner of Chelsea Piers and the former lead owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team, whose fellow owners from 1989 to 1998 included his friend and Yale University classmate George W. Bush; and Madelyn G. Wils, the chairwoman of Community Board No. 1, which includes the financial district and TriBeCa.
The four representatives named by Mr. Giuliani include Mr. Grasso and three previous mayoral appointees: Robert M. Harding, a deputy mayor for economic development and finance; Howard Wilson, the chairman of the School Construction Authority; and Paul A. Crotty, who was corporation counsel in Mr. Giuliani's first term and who is now a public affairs executive for Verizon Communications. 
At a news conference yesterday announcing the board members, Mr. Bloomberg said he had been consulted by both Mr. Pataki and Mr. Giuliani about the appointments, and he noted that Mr. Whitehead had been his personal friend for three decades. During the mayoral campaign, Mr. Bloomberg said he believed the redevelopment work could be done through existing agencies.
The board is notably light on representatives of small businesses, which have been the hardest hit by the economic stagnation that has settled over much of Lower Manhattan since Sept. 11. And many of the neighborhoods below Houston Street that are not in the area immediately surrounding the former World Trade Center site also have no direct representation, including Chinatown, SoHo and parts of Little Italy. "At least we got one," said Ms. Wils, when asked about neighborhoods without direct representation. "I intend to be a loud voice" for the interests of people downtown, she added.
The board is modeled on similar partnerships between the state and the city that oversaw projects like the redevelopment of Times Square. The new entity will have certain legal powers, like the ability to acquire property by condemnation.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: New York City Job Losses 

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton (NYT) (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez) 

 BODY:
New York City lost more jobs in the last year than any other major metropolitan area, according to data released in Washington this week by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The 58,700-job drop in the 12 months that ended in October, which the bureau attributed largely to the Sept. 11 terror attack, surpassed a 38,200 decline in Detroit. But New York's unemployment has risen less than one percentage point, to 6.2 percent, while the rate for the San Jose metropolitan area, which includes Silicon Valley, surged by 4.8 percentage points, to 6.4 percent.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
By giving their staffs an extra-long holiday, agencies are making lemonade out of lemons.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
AFTER an awful year, Madison Avenue cannot wait for 2001 to end, so it will in effect be declared over after the close of business on Friday, Dec. 21.
 As of that day, scores of agencies will throw in the towel on the kind of year that Queen Elizabeth once called an annus horribilis and will not reopen until Tuesday, Jan. 2. 
 The 11 consecutive days off are thought to represent the longest year-end holiday ever for agency employees, evocative of the lengthy vacations typically granted workers by the Detroit automakers. After months of cutbacks, layoffs, closings, attacks and anthrax, the prevailing sentiment among the admakers seems to echo the slogan used to sell the movie "That's Entertainment": "Boy, do we need it now." 
"We're trying to make our holiday celebration in sync with where our people's heads and hearts are at this time," said Linda Garrison, managing director at the Chicago office of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, part of the WPP Group.
That includes the time off, clustered as paid vacation days, she added, along with a holiday party intended to be more of a relaxed gathering than the usual annual "blowout." It also includes a morning designated for community service, helping to refurbish a Y.M.C.A. on the West Side of Chicago.
At agencies owned by the Grey Global Group in New York, employees will be given an extra three days off as offices will close at 3 p.m. on Dec. 21 and reopen on Jan. 2.
In a note from Edward H. Meyer, chairman, president and chief executive at Grey Global, the employees were told "that you've all worked hard all year, and this is a way to show our appreciation," said Jan Sneed, a spokeswoman.
Clearly, the early end to business in 2001 reflects the downturn in the advertising economy that has resulted from the downturn in the national economy.
"If you're not giving people raises, the least you can do is give them some time off," said Owen Dougherty, executive vice president at J. Walter Thompson in New York, owned by WPP. The last workday in 2001 for all Thompson offices in North America will be Dec. 21, he added.
In some instances, the time off is unpaid, as agencies try furloughs rather than dismissing staff members before the holidays.
"To avoid layoffs, we've opted to take unpaid vacation days" between Christmas and New Year's, said Gary Young, president at the Chicago office of Marc USA, which has 45 employees.
"We have not suffered tremendously," he added, "but we had a couple clients whose businesses took a downturn, and I was put in the position of having to do something. By focusing the days around the holidays, it gives employees time with their families."
The concern expressed about employees' lives apart from work also reflects changes in attitude since the attacks on Sept. 11.
"We've always closed the week of Christmas and reopened after the new year," said Vonda LePage, senior vice president at Deutsch, owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, "but time with family and friends is especially important this year."
As for the annual holiday parties at the agency's offices in New York and Marina del Rey, Calif., she said, "We still feel it is important to recognize our co-workers and celebrate this holiday season, even given the climate and the mood." But to acknowledge the new reality, the larger of the two parties, in New York, will be smaller than usual, limited to employees.
That mixed mood is also in evidence at Merkley Newman Harty & Partners in New York, owned by the Omnicom Group.
"We're having a holiday party, but it will not be as extravagant as in years past," said Scott Lahde, a spokesman for Merkley Newman. "It didn't make sense to go all out when we're in the environment we're in, but on the other hand it won't be cheese and crackers in the lobby."
Even some parties that double as work-related functions are changing.
For example, there will be a different cast to the extensive -- and expensive -- annual Burnett Breakfast in Chicago for almost 2,500 employees of Leo Burnett and the Starcom division of the Starcom MediaVest Group, units of the Bcom3 Group.
The committee for this year's breakfast, scheduled for Dec. 7, was asked not to plan a regular formal meeting followed by parties. A memorandum sent to employees said the intent was to "create a day that includes equal doses of fun, because you all deserve it, and conscience, because the times demand it." Also, the event's budget is being reduced, and the money saved will be donated to charity.
As for other year-end business like bonuses, Madison Avenue is not like Wall Street. Many agencies do not distribute bonuses, while many of those that do wait until spring to determine who gets what. Here's a fearless forecast: Bonuses of any consequence are likely only at agencies that are privately held, or at publicly held agencies whose top executives suffer from Enron envy.
The reasons for the long holiday vacations were reinforced yesterday as Lauren Rich Fine, advertising analyst at Merrill Lynch, reduced her forecast again for ad spending in 2001. She now estimates a decline of 5.1 percent compared with 2000; her previous estimate was a 3.1 percent decline.
Also, the online editions of the trade publications Advertising Age and Adweek reported layoffs at Cliff Freeman & Partners in New York and at the offices of the MindShare media agency, owned by WPP.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE IMPACT; 
Californians See a Kind of Rough Justice for Enron

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 29 

 BODY:
The rapid downfall of the Enron Corporation is likely to hasten the end of California's freewheeling experiment in energy deregulation, industry executives and government officials said today.
 But in this state, where the state treasury was drained and the biggest utility was left bankrupt by an ill-conceived deregulation plan, various people saw a kind of rough justice in Enron's getting its comeuppance. 
 "Enron was the flagship for deregulation," said Carl Wood, a member of California's Public Utilities Commission and an opponent of deregulation. Enron, he said, proved to be "all hat and no cattle -- that's their Texas expression, and it applies here." 
Analysts and utility executives agreed that Enron's meltdown would have little effect on the state's power supply, which costly state power contracts and a slumping economy have rendered ample. The one contract that Enron negotiated with the state to provide power this year expired after 30 days. Companies and other institutions that buy electricity or gas directly from Enron are busy negotiating new supplies, regulators said.
About 15 percent of the gas and electricity used by California customers is bought directly from producers and marketers like Enron, Mr. Wood said. Big electricity users, like universities and hospitals, will most likely return to the days before deregulation and buy their power from the state's electricity grid, Mr. Wood said. Institutional and corporate buyers of natural gas will contract with other gas suppliers.
"The utilities are working with them to find new homes," Mr. Wood said.
Enron's troubles are having their biggest effect here on consumers' psyches. Harvey Rosenfield, a consumer advocate in Santa Monica who has criticized both the state's management of its energy crisis and the energy companies themselves, scoffed when one of his staff members at a meeting on Wednesday expressed sympathy for Enron employees whose retirement funds have withered. 
"When California ratepayers were being gouged by Texas energy companies, they didn't get a lot of calls from empathetic Enron workers," Mr. Rosenfield said he told the staff member. In his view, "Enron is just the latest victim of its own greed." 
Enron still hopes to harvest some gains in California. According to the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, the San Francisco utility that filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this year, Enron has submitted claims for $520 million for energy it says it provided the utility's customers. The utility is expected to dispute that sum, contending among other things that Enron is double billing it for some supplies.
California is fighting various energy companies over whether it was overcharged for electricity, a battle being waged in Washington at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The commission has said the state is owed some kind of refund. Until those figures are settled on, analysts here say, Enron -- or its bankruptcy trustee, if the company, as expected, files for Chapter 11 protection -- will probably not see any of the $520 million it says it is owed by the utility.
For their part, energy companies in California say there are messages to draw from Enron's debacle.
"It's a lesson in management for all of us to be transparent in our accounting and not believe your own propaganda," said Stephen Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, the parent company of San Diego Gas and Electric.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE OPTIONS; 
A Trend Toward Liquidation, Not Company Reorganization

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
As the number of bankruptcy filings by public companies surges to a record, companies are increasingly being forced to liquidate instead of reorganizing as viable businesses, according to lawyers, investment bankers and other specialists.
 Big companies like Enron usually file for protection from creditors with the intent of reorganizing after some of their debts and contracts are canceled. 
 But many companies are finding they have no choice but to sell the pieces of their businesses to the highest bidder. Several factors are forcing this: financing is harder to obtain in this tough economic environment, more repeat business failures are in the courts and more start-ups with fewer assets are in trouble. Impatient creditors, too, are pushing companies to sell sooner rather than later out of concern that cash is draining away. 
"A lot of companies have melting ice cubes for assets, and there's not a serious prospect of restructuring on a stand-alone basis," said Henry Miller, vice chairman of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, an investment banking firm.
Shutting down a business is often the best option for creditors, but it can have a high human cost. Virtually all employees will be out of a job, and their retirement benefits placed in jeopardy. In some cases, the disappearance of a business has a devastating impact on the local community, especially when jobs are scarce, as they are now. Competing businesses may also suffer as customers flock to buy products from the liquidating company at bargain prices.
Enron, which appears headed for bankruptcy in the United States after its filing yesterday in Europe, has few tangible assets, like pipelines, that can be sold to satisfy creditors. Many of those assets are already pledged as collateral for loans. "They will probably need to sell most of the other assets to satisfy creditors," one distressed securities analyst said.
The liquidation rate is far higher than a decade ago, the last time there was a surge of bankruptcy filings, bankruptcy lawyers said. Data on liquidations, though, is not readily available. While it is easy to find the number of filings under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, in which a trustee appointed by the court oversees a sale of assets, most large companies that liquidate do so in the context of a Chapter 11 filing, lawyers said. Data on Chapter 11 filings does not distinguish between liquidations and reorganizations. 
A record 230 public companies with more than $182 billion in assets have already filed for bankruptcy this year, according to BankruptcyData.com. That is 25 percent more companies and double the amount of assets for all of last year, when 176 companies with $95 billion in assets filed for bankruptcy.
Companies in many industries are considering a liquidation or in the midst of one: the steel maker LTV Corporation; old and new retailers like Montgomery Ward and Webvan; and the insurance company Reliance Group Holdings, formerly controlled by the investor Saul Steinberg.
Other companies have put themselves up for sale to the highest bidder as part of a Chapter 11 filing. They include Trans World Airlines, which was bought by the AMR Corporation within three months of filing for bankruptcy, and Fruit of the Loom, which is negotiating a sale to Berkshire Hathaway.
Many of the companies confronting liquidation have been through bankruptcy before. LTV, for example, previously went bankrupt in 1986. Montgomery Ward and McCrory are among the retailers returning to bankruptcy court.
"There have been a bunch of Chapter 22's," said Barry Ridings, co-head of the restructuring advisory group at Lazard Freres, referring to companies filing for Chapter 11 a second time. "Things we fixed 10 years ago haven't stayed fixed," he said. TWA was a Chapter 33, Mr. Ridings said, noting that its latest filing was its third.
Many companies that went bankrupt in the early 1990's simply exchanged existing debt for new debt due several years later. In hindsight, Mr. Ridings said, more companies should have insisted their creditors take stock instead.
"Companies that have been through Chapter 11 always retain some vestige of backlash," said Brad Eric Scheler, head of the bankruptcy practice at the law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson. "Their relationship with vendors is never quite the same."
For LTV, the crucial difference between this bankruptcy and the earlier one is that the company is running out of cash, said Mark Tomasch, a company spokesman. "We had significant amounts of cash during the last bankruptcy, but after the import flood of 1998, we've had three down years," he said. The chief executive of LTV resigned yesterday, citing the anticipated liquidation.
A hearing will be held next week to determine whether LTV will be liquidated, Mr. Tomasch said. But after the company announced its intention, workers and politicians criticized the move, citing the potential loss of jobs in Cleveland, where LTV is based. 
Since LTV announced its plans to liquidate, the United Steelworkers of America union has agreed to wage concessions and benefit cuts that could enable the company to get $250 million in government-backed loans. In a statement, the union's president, Leo W. Gerard, said LTV's management had "repeatedly threatened the lives of our members, tens of thousands of retirees and the communities they work and live in."
Liquidations are increasing in part because many of the companies filing for bankruptcy are telecommunications or Internet start-ups, which have few assets other than employees. In contrast, many companies that ran into trouble 10 years ago had been acquired in leveraged buyouts and simply needed to reduce their debt, Mr. Scheler said. "Most of the companies 10 years ago were using bankruptcy to fix their balance sheets," he said. "This time a lot are really sick."

HEADLINE: Russian Oil Power 

 BODY:
Russia may no longer be a military superpower, but in recent years it has quietly become a behemoth in the oil business, a development with important political and economic implications for the United States and its allies. Moscow is now in a position to sharply limit the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to manipulate oil prices. By refusing to go along with production cuts that OPEC favors, Russia can enhance its reputation as a responsible and reliable supplier of Europe's energy needs. That is an opportunity President Vladimir Putin should not squander. 
 The timing could hardly be better. Maintaining current Russian production levels would spare the already sputtering world economy from the added burden of artificially high energy prices. It would also increase confidence in Russia among international oil companies, attracting new investment that could increase output even more in the years to come. A steady flow of oil exports would nicely reinforce Mr. Putin's current efforts to align Moscow more closely with the West. 
 As the world's largest non-OPEC exporter, Russia has considerable leverage over world oil prices. That influence is further enhanced by the fact that the second- and third-ranking independent exporters, Mexico and Norway, have indicated that they will go along with OPEC's planned production cuts only if Russia does so. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham is now in Moscow doing his best to encourage high production levels. Although most Russian oil is now privately produced, the Kremlin retains considerable influence over output and export levels.
It was not so long ago that Russia seemed destined to become an oil importer because of Soviet mismanagement of Russia's large reserves. Shoddy engineering and neglect of oilfields under Soviet rule left output declining in the last years of Communism, and it contracted sharply during the economic and political upheavals of the early 1990's. 
More recently, as investment laws were reformed and economic conditions stabilized, Russian oil companies started investing again, mostly in better recovery techniques for existing oilfields. As a result, Russian output has risen by about 15 percent over the past two years and now accounts for nearly 10 percent of world production. Moscow is presently the world's second-largest oil exporter, and if its considerable exports of natural gas are added in, overall Russian energy exports are nearly as high as Saudi Arabia's. 
Russian oil flows mainly to Europe, and it now supplies a significant share of that oil-hungry Continent's needs. Most of the rest comes from the Middle East. If Moscow acts to shield Europe's economies from the worst consequences of OPEC's projected price increases, Mr. Putin's diplomatic stock in the West will clearly rise. 
This month has already seen proposals for closer relations between Russia and NATO and announcements of sharp mutual reductions of American and Russian offensive nuclear weapons. Moscow's cooperation with the West on maintaining oil production would further transform the atmosphere between former cold-war enemies and help encourage the trend toward warmer ties between Russia and the United States.

HEADLINE: Bhutto Pursues a Pakistani Comeback, in India 

BYLINE:  By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Nov. 29 

 BODY:
It is hard to imagine a stranger place for the comeback bid of a leading Pakistani politician than the enemy territory of India, but that is just what Benazir Bhutto tried to pull off here in the capital this week.
 Glamorous as ever in satin and pearls, she swept through the stately, Raj-era boulevards in a chauffeured sedan like a triumphant head of state. 
 She called on the Indian prime minister and his most powerful advisers. She spoke to the captains of industry, who zestfully applauded her. She fondly reminisced with courtly, retired Indian diplomats about old times when she was prime minister of Pakistan. 
"Have some," she said when they came calling at her five-star hotel suite, ingratiatingly offering them raisins and cashews.
What made Ms. Bhutto's four-day Indian blitz so odd was not just that India and Pakistan were lobbing mortar shells at each other in Kashmir while she was warmly embraced by the Indian establishment, which deeply mistrusts Pakistan's current military ruler. It was also that Ms. Bhutto, 48, was campaigning to be prime minister of Pakistan, where she no longer lives, in India, its archrival.
Inheritor of a legendary political dynasty, the Harvard- and Oxford-educated Ms. Bhutto is today a wanted woman in Pakistan. She faces a raft of corruption charges there and has chosen to live in a comfortable, self-imposed exile in Dubai rather than face a jail cell at home.
She has jetted to New Delhi, Washington, London and other capitals in a desperate effort to regain her good name and to convince the world that she is the best hope for a stable, democratic Pakistan powered by a free-market economy.
She wants to become prime minister of Pakistan for the third time in elections that the military has scheduled for October. And her quest is not as quixotic as it seems. 
Her perennial rival, Nawaz Sharif, has been banished by the military to a luxurious exile in Saudi Arabia, where he has uttered nary a peep for the last year. And in local elections allowed by the military regime this year, Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party fared better than any other.
"She would be one of the top contenders despite all the corruption charges," said Ijaz Gilani, chairman of Gallup Pakistan. "People expect corruption out of politicians."
But there is still one big, immovable obstacle in Ms. Bhutto's path, and his name is Pervez Musharraf, the military ruler who has been transformed since the Sept. 11 attacks from a dictator scorned by the West to the darling of the American-led antiterror coalition.
Ms. Bhutto and her party have been trying to make a deal with him for her return to politics, with guarantees that she will not be arrested, but to no avail. He does not want her back. "He's a law unto himself," said an aggravated Ms. Bhutto. 
General Musharraf, who recently decreed that he will remain president even after the elections, has a withering contempt for Pakistan's leading politicians, Ms. Bhutto and Mr. Sharif, both of whom have been badly tarnished by the corruption allegations. 
With Ms. Bhutto's pronouncements here making front-page news in Pakistan, the general's spokesman and close adviser, Maj. Gen. Rashid Qureshi, was asked Monday in Islamabad about her proposals for improving relations between India and Pakistan. He dismissively replied, "What she says as an individual is of no consequence to Pakistan."
Ms. Bhutto, who came to India at the invitation of the Confederation of Indian Industry and flew out of New Delhi this morning, retorted in an interview: "There's mutual contempt between the politicians and the generals. They call us corrupt, and we call them corrupt." 
There you have it -- the confounding, quintessentially Pakistani power struggle.
As a result, Ms. Bhutto's case presents the United States with a ticklish dilemma. Will the Americans support a friendly authoritarian regime in Pakistan with a wink and a nod, as they have in Saudi Arabia and other Islamic nations? Or will they put pressure on the generals to let go of power, permit political rallies and allow the country's tainted politicians back into the fray? 
Some human rights leaders and members of Pakistan's liberal elite say that the army should let Ms. Bhutto come home. "The military establishment has always tried to deal with political parties minus the heads," said I. A. Rehman, director of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. "But political parties without heads are totally ineffective."
Najam Sethi, the editor of The Friday Times in Lahore who was a harsh critic of Mr. Sharif and Ms. Bhutto, said Pakistan was now facing an even graver threat than political corruption. He worries that Islamic fundamentalist parties will fill the void left by the exiled mainstream politicians.
"People like me fought corruption and paid a heavy price for it," said Mr. Sethi, who was picked up and detained under the Sharif government. "I'm ready to put it on the back burner."
The corruption issue certainly haunts Ms. Bhutto, but like many a South Asian politician, she aggressively claims victimhood and points to conspiracies of nefarious forces -- drug dealers, fundamentalist generals and political opponents who she says have framed her.
Then there is the matter of the house in Surrey, symbol of the family's excesses. She is a little defensive about it. Her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, a polo-playing playboy before they wed in an arranged marriage, became fabulously wealthy after she rose to power. During her second term as prime minister, he secretly bought a 355-acre, multimillion dollar estate in England. 
"They say, 'Your husband spent money and bought a house,' " she said. "Okay, he was a businessman and spent money. It might be unwise, but it's not illegal. People have houses all over the world."
Mr. Zardari, known as Mr. Ten Percent for the commissions he allegedly collected on government contracts, has been in jail on various charges for 8 of the 14 years of their marriage. Both Ms. Bhutto and he were convicted in a kickback scheme while Mr. Sharif was prime minister, but the verdict was overturned. She describes their long travails, with no convictions and endless legal wrangling, as persecution. 
She and their three children, ages 8, 11 and 13, have not seen Mr. Zardari for two and a half years. But since June, they have been allowed to talk to him on the phone once a week. He tells them what he has been watching on TV. The husband and wife have told each other what they look like now. And they have squabbled over whether their elder daughter should take ballet.
"I do love my husband," she said confidingly, "and he loves me, too."
After a few more questions, Ms. Bhutto's press secretary, Bashir Riaz, said it was time to wrap it up. Interviewers from India's television networks were lined up to take pictures of the charismatic, photogenic Ms. Bhutto, who wore a gauzy white scarf over her head and a long braid down her back. 
As she and Mr. Riaz rushed down the carpeted hotel corridor, he told her, "BBC World called."
"What's the slot?" she asked.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE LIABILITY; 
House Votes to Shield Insurers and Limit Suits by Future Terror Victims

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29 

 BODY:
Voting largely along party lines, the House of Representatives adopted a measure today that would provide as much as $100 billion in government loans to the insurance industry to cover losses from future large-scale terrorist attacks. The money would be repaid by insurers, policyholders and, if the administration wanted, taxpayers.
 The legislation, approved 227 to 193, would also impose sharp new restrictions on the ability of any victims of future attacks to collect damages in court against insurers and other businesses. 
 President Bush praised the vote, saying it was "an important step toward ensuring the continued availability of insurance for terrorist-related acts and for ensuring that victims of terrorism don't also become subjects of unfair lawsuits." 
The measure must overcome some political hurdles before it can become law. Senate and administration officials held fruitless discussions today about a bill being prepared under the guidance of the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota. That bill contains many significant differences from the House version.
The House measure has provoked widespread criticism from Democrats because of the limits it would impose on lawsuits by victims of terrorism. Those restrictions were inserted into the bill on Wednesday evening by the House majority leader, Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, with the encouragement of the White House. They prompted the Democrats who had supported an earlier version of the insurance aid package to abandon the legislation and denounce it as a grotesque gift to the insurers and businesses and a cold denial of the legal rights of victims.
"Why do the big dogs always eat first in Congress?" asked Representative Jay Inslee, Democrat of Washington. He called the court limitations "radically callous." 
But one of the few Republicans to speak in support of the tort law changes, Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said that they were essential because the current tort rules "are designed to compensate for injuries from banana peels, not from terrorists."
Supporters of the measure say it is essential to avoid an economic calamity early next year, when many insurance policies come up for renewal, by making sure that policies contain adequate coverage for damages from terrorism attacks.
Administration officials and many lawmakers fear a credit squeeze because banks and other lenders will not extend loans for new construction and other projects without adequate insurance coverage.
"We cannot afford this significant economic disruption at a time of economic sluggishness," said Representative Michael G. Oxley, the Ohio Republican who is the main author of the measure. "The glue that holds our economy together is insurance."
The revisions to tort law would make it significantly more difficult for victims of terrorist attacks to use the courts to collect damages from insurers and businesses. They would also sharply cap fees for lawyers. The measure would not allow victims to sue in state courts, would force all lawsuits from an incident to be filed in one federal court, would eliminate punitive damages and would sharply restrict the liability of defendants.
A comparable insurance aid package has stalled in the Senate over a vigorous debate about whether to include tort law revisions. 
House Republicans have strained to write a law that they say would provide a government backstop rather than an insurance industry bailout. But the measure adopted today would pave the way for a possible bailout of huge proportions by shifting the onus to the administration.
The bill would give the Treasury secretary the authority to decide not to recoup the loans of billions of dollars to the industry, effectively leaving the bill to taxpayers.
The bill adopted by the House would set up a federal loan program to cover 90 percent of any insurance industry losses over $1 billion. (Smaller companies with big losses would be covered once industry losses exceeded $100 million.) For the first $20 billion in losses, the loans would be repaid through a special assessment on the industry. For losses greater than that, the Treasury secretary would decide whether to impose a special assessment on insurance policyholders or have the costs paid by taxpayers.
The White House prefers a simpler measure that would provide direct taxpayer assistance to the industry for any future attacks. But it applauded the measure for "including reasonable, short-term procedures for terrorist-related litigation."
Supporters of the legal liability limits said such restrictions were essential to protect businesses and taxpayers from bearing even greater losses in any large terror attack.
The bill would limit lawyers' fees to a maximum of 20 percent of any claim or settlement and would make it a crime to be paid more. While some Republicans said it was aimed at plaintiffs' lawyers, the provision was inartfully drafted to apply to all lawyers -- including those defending insurers and businesses. A defense lawyer who defeated a claim would be entitled to no compensation because lawyers would be permitted to receive only a maximum of 20 percent of any award or settlement. A lawyer who took in fees in excess of 20 percent could be punished by up to one year in prison. 
The tort revisions provoked a mutiny from many Democrats who had supported the earlier version of the bill, which was passed by a House committee three weeks ago. Invoking the memories of the office workers, police officers and firefighters who perished in September, a parade of Democrats attacked the proposed tort changes. The Republicans did not respond to most of the criticisms.
"The new revisions on torts are so onerous, so extreme, that we're asking the American people to forget victims' rights, rights of people, and only take care of the 24 insurers who write 94 percent of the insurance policies," said Representative Paul E. Kanjorski, Democrat of Pennsylvania.
Representative Patrick J. Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, said the tort changes were necessary "to ensure that payments go to the victims and not to their lawyers."
Representative Christopher Cox, a California Republican who has long sought tort law revisions, said the changes were needed to avoid a situation similar to the one today, when victims of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing are still in court.

HEADLINE: In Houston, a 'Nonpartisan' Race Is Anything But 

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Nov. 29 

 BODY:
The winning formula for Democrats running for mayor in this diverse city has long required patching together ethnic coalitions, so the campaign rally at the sports bar had a familiar feel: a mariachi band, outfitted in matching spangled pants, belted out Mexican ballads as the Hispanic candidate shook hands with a smattering of local Asian business leaders.
 The only thing missing at the event Wednesday was a Democrat. The mayoral candidate, Orlando Sanchez, a member of the City Council, is a conservative Republican. And to the surprise of political handicappers, Mr. Sanchez, 44, appears to be in a dead heat, or even leading, in advance of a runoff Saturday against the two-term incumbent, Mayor Lee P. Brown. 
 "It's an absolute cliffhanger," said a University of Houston political science professor, Richard Murray, who helped conduct a poll released this week. "It's going to go down to the last vote."
This was supposed to be a fairly boring race that would bring a third and final term for Mr. Brown, 64, a career public servant who became the city's first black mayor in 1997. But after finishing a close second in the November open primary and forcing the runoff, Mr. Sanchez appears to be tapping into the ire of conservative white voters frustrated with Mr. Brown, as well as the aspirations of the city's large Mexican-American population to elect the first Hispanic mayor.
Because both national parties want to attract Hispanic voters, and because there are no other major elections under way, the mayoral race in the country's fourth-largest city has attracted national attention, particularly from Republicans.
This week, President Bush endorsed Mr. Sanchez, while his parents, former President George Bush and Barbara Bush, who are Houston residents, are appearing in campaign advertisements on Mr. Sanchez's behalf. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York has also taped radio and television commercials, while Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao attended the sports bar rally.
"We'd love to have this guy," said Richard Bond, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, noting that winning Houston would be significant not only because it is the largest city in the president's home state but also because of its recent history of electing Democrats. Democrats say the Republicans are desperate for a victory after losing the governors' races in Virginia and New Jersey this month.
For Texas Democrats, a loss would be a major blow and could resonate into the 2002 elections for governor and other statewide offices. Republicans hold every statewide office in Texas, but Democrats believe the huge increase in the state's Hispanic population -- to 32 percent in 2000 from 25 percent in 1990 -- could favor them in the coming decade, assuming the party can continue to hold onto Hispanic voters as part of a broader coalition.
Mr. Brown had figured to ride to victory on that coalition, bolstered by the support of the predominantly white downtown business establishment. A victory would be the capstone of a long public career in which he has been police chief in Houston, Atlanta and New York as well as federal drug czar under President Bill Clinton. As mayor, Mr. Brown has helped win voter approval for building a downtown basketball arena and the city's first light-rail line. Houston's economy, though straining recently with the collapse of the Enron Corporation, has mostly boomed during his time in office.
But Mr. Brown also has many critics -- Mr. Sanchez chief among them -- who portray him as ineffective. Downtown traffic is often gridlocked, and critics blame Mr. Brown for failing to better coordinate construction projects that have torn up important thoroughfares. Mr. Brown's administration also suffered some embarrassing budgetary mistakes by miscalculating sales tax revenues.
Mr. Brown has countered the criticism by assailing Mr. Sanchez as unqualified. Before his 1995 election to the Council, Mr. Sanchez served in the Air Force and worked three years as a parole officer. On his financial disclosure forms he said he held executive positions for several companies, but The Houston Chronicle reported that the companies did not exist. Some were company names that Mr. Sanchez had reserved the rights to use for work as a consultant.
Mr. Brown also has questioned Mr. Sanchez's record, including his opposition to the city's affirmative action program and his spotty attendance record. Last year, Mr. Sanchez attended only one of the Council's 20 budget workshops.
"The man hasn't done anything in his life," Mr. Brown said today in a short interview outside his campaign headquarters. "People don't know who he is. He has no management experience whatsoever."
Mr. Sanchez has accused the mayor of running a negative campaign out of desperation and of "running away from his record."
Technically, the mayoral election is nonpartisan, though Mr. Brown is a registered Democrat and Mr. Sanchez is a Republican. But some Democrats worry that Mr. Sanchez may benefit from not having an "R" beside his name on the ballot; some Hispanic voters who might otherwise lean Democratic may instead vote for him out of ethnic pride. Mr. Brown's supporters have sought to undercut Mr. Sanchez with Mexican-Americans by pointing out that he is Cuban-American and Republican.
"People say, 'What are you?' " Mr. Sanchez responded. "By birth, I'm Cuban. By ethnicity, I'm Hispanic. By culture, I'm Texan. By race, I'm Caucasian. You put me in any category you want to put me in."

HEADLINE: Bush Panel Outlines 3 Plans for Social Security Overhaul 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29 

 BODY:
President Bush's Social Security Commission set out three options today for allowing workers to establish individual investment accounts and acknowledged that the proposals would have to be accompanied by benefit cuts or other painful steps if the retirement system was to avert a long-term financial crisis.
 Commission members said the proposals would be the centerpiece of the report they planned to submit to the White House next month. The commission had originally been expected to settle on a single private-account proposal that Mr. Bush would then try to persuade Congress to adopt as the basis for the most sweeping overhaul of Social Security in its 66-year history. 
 But Republicans in Congress, certain that Democrats are ready to attack them for cutting payments to future retirees, have grown wary of embracing any specific plan as they head toward the 2002 elections. And the 16-member commission has itself been divided over how best to modernize Social Security and prepare it for the financial strain that will accompany the retirement of the baby boom generation in the next several decades.
The three proposals would all allow but not require workers to invest part of their Social Security payroll taxes in stocks and bonds. In return, workers would give up some of their scheduled benefits. 
One plan would do little to restore the retirement system's long-term fiscal stability, leaving it to Congress to decide on what further steps might be needed. The other two have additional benefit cuts that would put the system on sounder footing, although one would also rely on infusions of general government revenue or higher taxes on some workers.
In general, proponents of the plans said, workers would end up better off than if nothing was done to overhaul Social Security. Under current projections, Social Security will run short of money to pay promised benefits starting in 2038. After that point, the system would be able to pay about 72 percent of currently scheduled benefits.
It was less clear whether workers would end up better off relative to the benefits promised under current law. The answer would depend in part on how strong a return workers received on their investments.
The commission said that it was still working on some details, and that it might add other proposals before it completed its work in about two weeks. But the outlines released today showed for the first time the basic tradeoffs required in any move to give workers ownership of and control over part of their Social Security taxes.
"There's no painless way to do it, and no quick way to do it," said the commission's co-chairman, Richard D. Parsons, who is the co-chief operating officer of AOL Time Warner.
Opponents said the plans proved that moving to private accounts did nothing by itself to ensure the system's long-term health and would extract too big a price from future retirees by slashing a guaranteed benefit that they should be able to count on whatever the state of Wall Street.
"No matter how you approach it, individual accounts make it more difficult to meet the challenges Social Security faces in the future," said Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat who is a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee. "To pay for privatization, the commission is now proposing serious benefit cuts."
Under one option, workers would be able to invest up to two percentage points of the 6.2 percent payroll tax paid by individuals on earnings up to $80,400 (employers pay another 6.2 percent). For people who choose to participate, the current scheduled benefit would be reduced; otherwise, there would be no changes to the current system or benefits.
Under a second option, workers could invest as much as four percentage points of their payroll tax, up to a maximum of $1,000 per year.
Under that plan, initial benefits for most people would be reduced substantially by a change in the way they are calculated, with yearly increases in the initial payment determined not by the annual rate of wage growth, as under the current system, but by price inflation, which is typically lower. The plan would also improve benefits for low-income workers and widows.
Under the third option, contributions to the account would work much like a 401(k) program. Workers would contribute up to one percentage point of their earnings beyond their current payroll taxes, and that contribution would be matched with 2.5 percentage points of their payroll taxes, to a maximum of $1,000. 
The third plan would also increase benefits for low-income workers and widows.
Mr. Parsons said there are a variety of ways to address Social Security's problems, each requiring its own balance of potentially painful tradeoffs, "and the right people to wrestle with those tradeoffs are our elected officials."
The recommendations came as Republicans -- including political strategists on Capitol Hill and at the White House -- have concluded that it would hurt the party's prospects in the 2002 Congressional elections to make an overhaul of the retirement system a major political issue now.
Mr. Bush is unlikely to be able to invest much time or political capital on the issue, given his focus on fighting terrorism, the strategists said. And they said a change in the system was harder to sell during a recession than during a period of prosperity.
