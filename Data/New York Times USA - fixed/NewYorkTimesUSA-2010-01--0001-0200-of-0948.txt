HEADLINE: Canadian Pipeline Hurdles A Barrier

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
A long-delayed natural gas pipeline in Western Canada, which has the potential to provide significant amounts of energy to North America, has cleared a crucial hurdle by receiving the endorsement of a Canadian government review panel. 
 The $15.4 billion Mackenzie Valley project, which involves Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, would connect natural gas fields in the Arctic with the rest of Canada and potentially with the United States.
 Some Indian communities and environmental groups have called the 750-mile pipeline a threat to local species and native cultures and have expressed concern about the greenhouse emissions created if the gas is used to heat and upgrade oil sands into usable fuels. Greenhouse emissions from oil sands are substantially higher than from conventional oil and gas production. 
 But the joint review panel, after five years of study, concluded late Wednesday that the project ''would deliver valuable and lasting overall benefits and avoid significant adverse environmental impacts.'' It continued, ''The project itself, as long-term infrastructure, provides a key basis for future economic development.'' 
 The National Energy Board and federal cabinet still need to approve the project, but they are expected to follow the recommendations of the review panel. The board is scheduled to hold hearings in April.
 If the project is approved, the oil companies would then have to decide whether to build the pipeline, given the current low gas prices, the prospects for competing gas fields in western Canada and the uncertainty of financial support from the Canadian government. Furthermore, a competing and also delayed gas pipeline project in Alaska might overtake the Canadian project. 
 ''If the oil companies think prices are firming on gas, they will go ahead with this,'' said Donald Hertzmark, a consultant who advises energy companies on international projects. ''It could still be important for the United States and Canada, especially if gas takes off as a transportation fuel or if environmental issues slow down or derail the development of shale gas resources.'' 
 The oil companies originally filed applications for the project in 2004, and hoped to begin operations five years later. But the review panel took longer than expected to complete its study. Now gas industry experts say operations could start in 2014 at the earliest.
 The review panel, which assessed the environmental and socioeconomic impacts, concluded that the pipeline would not harm fish in the Mackenzie River. But it called for regional planning to protect many species including polar bears, caribou and beluga whales.
 It also recommended that the gas be used to replace coal-fired electrical generation to control greenhouse gas emissions that have been linked to global climate change.
 The three gas fields that the pipeline would connect have reserves that are estimated at six trillion cubic feet -- an amount equal to more than two years of total Canadian consumption of gas. The pipeline would initially supply about one billion cubic feet a day, which could be expanded after future offshore and onshore drilling.
 The United States Energy Department has projected that Canadian annual gas consumption will increase from 3.3 trillion cubic feet in 2006 to 4.7 trillion cubic feet in 2030, largely because of the expanding needs of the oil sands industry.
 Production in Canada's conventional natural gas fields have been in decline, along with exports to the United States.

HEADLINE: Deep Roots, Sweet Oranges And a Taste of Florida's Past

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
Jeffrey Schorner darts through Al's Family Farms like a car salesman in a crowded showroom. He brags about his orange juice. He climbs under the packing machine. He grabs a tangelo for a gift box, then orders his 15-year-old son to the nearby groves.
 ''Pick me two sunbursts,'' he shouts, sounding like his own father, Al, who founded the company. ''Then pick lemons.'' 
 Before Interstate 95, Starbucks and Sbarro, roadside citrus stands like Al's lined nearly every major thoroughfare in Florida. They made buying local fun before the locavore food movement made it fashionable, but increasingly they are a dying breed.
 Hundreds if not thousands of family citrus farms and their roadside stands have disappeared since the 1960s -- victims of freezes and disease, highways that diverted customers, corporate consolidation, and the relentless pressure on growers to sell their land to developers. Since 1996, Florida has lost more than 200,000 acres of citrus land, according to state figures, mainly to homes that no longer sell like the oranges they replaced. 
 Only here, in the 90-mile bluff along the Indian River from Cocoa to Fort Pierce, can one find the last handful of citrus stores that offer the stickiness and tart scent that once defined the state. 
 The land gets part of the credit. It has been famous since 1835, when Douglas Dummett's plantation on Merritt Island survived a brutal freeze thanks to the nearby rivers that stabilized temperatures. Dummett also bred sweeter fruit -- after the Civil War, his oranges commanded $1 more a box in New York than oranges from any other grove -- and Indian River went on to become one of Florida's most famous farming brands. 
 Northerners like Roy and Blanche Harvey, who arrived in the area from Cleveland in the '20s, could hardly resist. Larry Harvey, their grand-nephew, said their family business started when Blanche picked a few oranges and started selling them on U.S. 1., then the main road running north and south. Now, at essentially the same location in Rockledge, Harvey's Groves is the last citrus shop around. 
 Like most of its counterparts farther south, the store has a homeyness that comes from its white-painted barn and bins of fruit, its kitschy extras (turtle earrings, anyone?) and from employees who have worked there for more than 20 years. 
 Harvey's displays braggadocio, too. The giant orange in the green elfin costume on the roof and the large sign boasting of the ''world's best orange juice'' might as well be museum pieces for Florida hucksterism. Although Mr. Harvey, 64, refuses to admit it. A leukemia survivor with a bushy mustache, he is the softer side of a management team that includes his brother, Jim. ''World's best'' is accurate, Larry Harvey insists, and as proof he showed off his shiny FMC extractor, a stainless steel juice machine that resembles a truck engine attached to rubber straws. 
 He said three types of oranges go in: tangerines, tangelos and golds. What pours out tastes fresher than what is in the average supermarket carton, he said, because of the blend, and the lack of pasteurization. ''This is superchilled,'' he said. ''It doesn't have the shelf life, but it tastes better.''
 Juice, it seems, is where the roadside stands still like to compete. Dixie cups of the stuff are handed out to all who enter at Al's and Harvey's. At Hale Groves on U.S. 1 in Wabasso, the sign out front offered all you can drink for 10 cents in 1951, but now it says ''the freshest and best tasting. Guaranteed since 1947.'' 
 Still, with a smirk, owners like Mr. Schorner acknowledge that the juice is half vanity project, half marketing gimmick. Even the stands are ''merely showplaces,'' as John McPhee wrote in ''Oranges,'' his book from 1967, because the bulk of the business comes from shipping gift boxes north. 
 This accounts for 80 percent of Harvey's sales. It's a similar proportion for the others. Basically, without orders placed through the stores, catalogues or the Internet, all these companies would be out of business. 
 Holiday gifts matter most of all, and this year, sales are up. According to the Florida Gift Fruit Shippers Association, volume increased by 1.75 percent this season. 
 Not that there are any hallelujahs around Indian River. The growers sell optimism, but sleep with fear. Mr. Harvey said there were 152 members of the Gift Fruit Shippers Association when his father helped start it in the late '40s. Now there are 37. 
 Meanwhile, the famous Indian River citrus region has come to look a little more like the rest of Florida in recession. Driving U.S. 1 now offers views of a closed packing house named Victory, silent strip malls offering three months free rent, and at least one development with empty lots where groves used to be and where new homes may never rise. 
 Economic ups and downs, of course, are not unfamiliar to the roadside citrus crowd. And the bust has brought a bonus: Mr. Schorner said a few former growers are returning to citrus after failing at real estate.
 But if you ask the older owners what will happen next with their businesses, or how they have survived, you are likely to get a humble shrug. ''It's my charm,'' said Ed Peterson, 73, whose family has been selling oranges from its grove in Vero Beach since 1923. 
 ''No,'' said his brother and co-owner, Fred, 70, standing behind the counter in red shorts faded pink. ''We've worked hard; that's what it is. We've refused to give up.''

HEADLINE: Young, Down and Out in Europe

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: MADRID 

 BODY:
Like hundreds of thousands of other young people, Jesus Pesquero Penas dropped out of school to go to work when the Spanish economy was booming. But since he was laid off from his construction job two years ago, he has been living on unemployment benefits.
 Now Mr. Penas finds himself part of a lost generation in Spain, where unemployment among people ages 16 to 24 is 42.9 percent, the highest in Europe, and more than double the overall rate. 
 ''I went to work because the money was good, the lifestyle was good and I really wanted to get out of school,'' Mr. Penas, 25, said as he waited on a long line snaking down the block from an employment office in suburban Madrid. 
 ''I totally regret it now,'' Mr. Penas said, who has a 5-year-old daughter by a former girlfriend who is also out of work. 
 Spain is the extreme, but the experience of younger workers here reflects similar problems in the United States, as well as other European countries still struggling to emerge from the recession. 
 In the last 12 months, the jobless rate in the United States among workers ages 16 to 24 has risen to 19.1 percent from 13.9 percent. Economists expect the rate to remain high even as the overall jobless rate in the United States -- now 10 percent -- begins to shrink. 
 That is because the sectors that employ young people in the greatest numbers -- fast food, construction, retail -- are expected to take the longest to recover. 
 In the United States, workers on the first rungs of the job market run the risk of lower earnings even after the recovery gets going, said Paul Osterman, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T. who also teaches at the Institute de Empresa business school in Madrid. 
 Young Spanish workers, like their counterparts in the rest of Europe, face other obstacles like union rules, long-term contracts and legal protections that shelter older workers and discourage new hiring, Mr. Osterman said. 
 ''There is a cohort of people who are condemned to a permanently stagnant career path in Spain,'' he said. ''It's very worrisome.'' 
 People like Mr. Penas, with few skills, bleak prospects and little desire to go back to university alongside younger students, are the most vulnerable. 
 ''There has been a loss of human capital,'' said Jose Antonio Herce, director of economics at ASI, a Madrid-based consulting firm. ''It will take a long time for this cohort to be absorbed.'' 
 Spain may be the worst example, but it is not alone, ''Young people are the last in the queue when it comes to finding permanent jobs,'' said Anne Sonnet, a senior economist with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. ''Even with university degrees, there are many barriers to young people.'' 
 Adding to Spain's woes, its government is unable to inject more stimulus and offer further support for job creation while its economy languishes as one of the weakest in Europe. The outlook on Spanish sovereign debt was recently downgraded, and the government is moving to raise taxes and cut spending. 
 The country's budget deficit, which hit 11 percent of gross domestic product this year, is supposed to be within the 3 percent threshold enshrined in the treaty that established the euro. The European Union wants Spain and other European countries relying on the euro to return to that range by 2013. 
 ''Spain is under tremendous pressure from the E.U. and the bond markets,'' Mr. Osterman said. ''They're in a very difficult box.'' 
 To be sure, Spain has traditionally suffered from relatively high unemployment, and at 19.3 percent, its overall rate today is double the 9.8 percent average for the European Union. 
 But the sharp increase among young people is particularly problematic. It has jumped from 17.5 percent three years ago at the height of the boom to the current 42.9 percent. 
 At this level, Spain stands out from other troubled European countries. In Greece, for example, the youth unemployment rate is 25 percent, while Ireland's is 28.4 percent and Italy's is 26.9 percent. 
 Spain is even worse off than countries in Eastern European where youth unemployment has traditionally been high. In Slovakia, for example, unemployment among young people is 27.9 percent. In Poland, youth unemployment is 21.2 percent, down from over 35 percent a few years ago.
 In part, Spain is paying the price for its efforts to make it easier to put young people to work. In recent years, a disproportionate share of Spanish youth were employed on temporary contracts. So they were the easiest to lay off when the economy sank, said Alfonso Prieto, deputy director general of employment studies at the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. 
 During the most prosperous years, a culture of temporary work developed, Mr. Prieto and others explained. Young workers like Mr. Penas became known as ''mil euristas,'' for the 1,000 euros, or $1,438, a month they typically earned. 
 Once looked down upon as temporary, entry-level positions, the few remaining mil eurista jobs are now highly sought, Mr. Herce, the economic consultant, said.
 Besides drawing young Spanish workers out of school, the growth years lured young immigrants by the millions. Many of them are out of work as well. 
 Katy Mejia, for example, moved here seven years ago from Ecuador with her parents, having just finished high school at age 16. She later married a Spaniard and worked in restaurants and bars in downtown Madrid. 
 ''Jobs were plentiful,'' Ms. Mejia said, ''You could pick and choose.'' 
 Today, she is jobless, and her husband is working four hours a day driving a delivery van, forcing them to move in with her family. ''It's difficult to go back to living with your parents when you are married,'' she said. 
 Although low-skilled workers are the hardest hit, Mr. Prieto said, professionals are also suffering. 
 Vanessa Larrosa, who was recently laid off as a veterinarian, lives around the corner from the unemployment office in Santa Eugenia on the outskirts of Madrid. She was used to seeing a line forming in the dark each morning, as peopled huddled in blankets. 
 ''But I personally never expected to be here,'' Ms. Larrosa said. ''I'd like to continue to work as a vet, but I'd be happy with anything.'' 
 Spain is spending roughly 30 billion euros ($43 billion) a year on unemployment benefits, but the money is doing little to prepare younger workers for the future. 
 Mr. Herce said that Spain needed to invest more heavily in vocational education and retraining, and require the jobless to improve their skills. 
 That is what Carlos Herras, 26, is counting on. He is taking a course in renewable energy and hopes to find a job installing solar panels. But at this stage, he too would be happy with almost anything. 
 ''I started working so young,'' he said, ticking off jobs beginning at 14 in a bar, then a hotel and finally in the construction industry until last January. ''I am optimistic. I may not find a job that I want, but I'll find a job.''

HEADLINE: Now for Something Really New

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WILSON and COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
Resolutions come and resolutions go, and enough is said about them on the first day of every January. Real change is the stuff of stories, the stuff of this story: four people doing something truly new in the new year. 
 Not a new personal trainer, or a new pack of Nicorette, or Mandarin classes or a life without swear words. Something bigger -- something thrown at them or something they run toward; something to fear or love or both. 
 A New Limb
 The driver was talking on her cellphone. Wendy Quintiliano, a waitress in Fairfield, Conn., was riding on the back of a motorcycle. It was Sept. 16, 2007. The impact shattered much of Ms. Quintiliano's left leg below the knee. 
 ''I picked up my leg and my whole ankle kind of spun all the way around,'' Ms. Quintiliano recalled. ''The first police officer on the scene was a female. When she saw my leg, she passed out.'' 
 Doctors replaced the shattered bone with a piece from her hip, but the leg was shorter than before. There were sores and multiple infections. Pins and screws and plates broke or bent; her body rejected them. There were crutches and wheelchairs and enough pain medications to make even reading difficult. Ms. Quintiliano had been preparing to start a new career in a nursing home, but working was impossible. ''The only thing I've done for two years is sit around and watch TV,'' she said. 
 This Dec. 16, Ms. Quintiliano, now 40, went to yet another doctor, who cut away a piece of her latest cast to find the flesh so infected it was blackened. ''He said, 'We're going to have to start at the beginning again,' '' she recounted. ''I said, 'I can't do this.' He said, 'How many times have you had surgery?' I said, 'Sixteen.' ''
 She asked him, ''Can't we just remove it?'' 
 He said, ''I think that's the best option.''
 So for Ms. Quintiliano, 2010 begins with one leg instead of two. Soon, there will be a new leg, made of carbon fiber or titanium or plastics or microprocessors, or some combination. 
 ''It's a lot of just being strong,'' she said days before the operation on Monday. ''When I wake up, my leg might not be there, but it's the start of a new life. It's been too long of a road.'' 
 On Christmas Eve, Ms. Quintiliano's family threw a going-away party for her leg and her pain, complete with cake. 
 The company providing her prosthesis, the Hanger Orthopedic Group, introduced her to another amputee, who told Ms. Quintiliano what to expect, like the phenomenon of the phantom limb. And on Monday, doctors cut off the leg.
 ''It really doesn't look that bad,'' she said from the hospital two days afterward. ''It looks better than I thought it would.'' 
 An itch arrived on her phantom limb, but she finds it funnier than anything else. ''I keep trying to reach down and go to itch it and there's nothing there,'' she said. ''I do that at least 10 times a day.''
 A New Job
 In the New York Fire Department's academy for emergency medical technicians, Ralph Dorsainvil is something of the senior trainee. At 41, he is of a different generation from the mostly 20-somethings around him. 
 ''I'm the dad of my class,'' said Mr. Dorsainvil, who is set to finish training in two weeks and start work.
 After a decade at Citigroup, organizing monthly statements mailed to customers, Mr. Dorsainvil, fearing layoffs, took a buyout a year ago.
 Then came unemployment and a lot of cost-cutting. He canceled family vacations, cut down on eating out and gave up premium cable channels. He recently paid off his car but still has a mortgage on his house in Hollis, Queens, where he grew up when the neighborhood was a cradle of hip-hop and home to Run-DMC and LL Cool J (''Same barbershop,'' Mr. Dorsainvil noted.). He has two teenage daughters and two young sons; his wife, Griselda, works maintaining dormitories at St. John's University.
 ''I was going into savings and very nervous and so was my wife,'' he said. ''I'm not saying I was one payment way from homelessness, but we were definitely tightening our belts.''
 Mr. Dorsainvil's starting salary as an E.M.T. will be about $32,000 a year, about $15,000 less than he was making at Citigroup. But there are other perks: the adrenaline rush, a good benefits package and no more shirt-and-tie or tedious hours combing other people's bank statements.
 ''Moneywise it's a step down, but I feel I'm making a difference,'' he said. ''I'm the kind of guy who helps someone on the side of the highway, or collapsed on the street.
 ''They got us on bus-bombing drills, car-extractions, haz-mat jobs and patient triage,'' he added. ''It's never boring or repetitious -- it's a totally new experience.''
 A New Baby
 The young man stood in court Monday morning, the picture of penitence in braces and peach fuzz, clutching a Bible in case the judge sent him back to jail, because he liked to read it in there. The woman in the black robes, Justice Laura A. Ward, listened to his lawyer and then asked him to speak for himself. 
 ''I'm guilty as charged,'' said Raheem Lawrence, 19. 
 But he quickly jumped from the past -- the May mugging in the West Village that led to this robbery charge -- to the future. I'm going to be a father any day now, Mr. Lawrence stammered, in so many words. 
 Justice Ward considered the teenager's remarks, and said, ''I'm going to give you a break here.'' She could have sent him back to jail, but instead gave him five years' probation, threatening to throw away the key if he blew it. Mr. Lawrence was visibly relieved, and walked out with his brother, his mother and his Bible. His daughter is due Feb. 1. 
 ''I just don't want to miss my baby's birth,'' he said in the hallway. ''I'm planning on participating fully.'' 
 The baby's mother, who declined to be interviewed, told Mr. Lawrence about her pregnancy test at 2 a.m. on Aug. 5, the day he was to plead guilty to mugging a man outside the No. 1 train and stealing his iPhone. He was sent to an adolescent wing of Rikers Island. ''I kind of went blank getting the second bit of news,'' he recalled. ''I was still in shock from the first.'' 
 Mr. Lawrence saw the first sonogram image of the baby when he was behind bars. ''I thought it was, like, alien-looking,'' he said. ''I had female officers explain it. They were telling me, 'That's the nose.' Oh, O.K.''
 He is nervous about having a girl. ''They're raising them up way faster than when I was growing up, and I'm not even that old,'' he said. ''The 'daddy's little girl' thing -- I hope she lives the right lifestyle and she's not too many problems. I hope it's not hard. I don't wish for complications.''
 Mr. Lawrence has not attended any childbirth or parenting classes. He did make it to the couple's shower Dec. 19 in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. He made up a name: Nyairra. But the girl's mother gets the final say after seeing the baby for the first time.
 Mr. Lawrence said he wants to teach his daughter about God, and that he would talk to her about his own missteps someday. He imagined the conversation: 
 ''I did some reckless things as a teen. Of course I moved past it. I definitely had to grow up as soon as I found out I was having a baby. I learned a lesson. Hopefully you learn by what I say and not what you do. Don't touch the fire, because it's hot.''
 A New Address
 Cupid doesn't fire an arrow anymore. He finds you on Facebook. 
 Alana Casanova-Burgess was not particularly enjoying what she calls a ''stagnant'' beginning to 2009 when she traveled to South America in March. There, at a hostel, she met a man, Ian Hays, who lived in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, across the river from the Upper East Side apartment where she grew up. There was a time when meeting someone interesting in a Peruvian hostel was not likely to lead anywhere, but Facebook and Skype kept the two in touch in the months and travels that followed, and now change is coming much closer to home. Change in the home itself. 
 Ms. Casanova-Burgess, 22, has lived with her parents her entire life, but for college at Binghamton University; Mr. Hays, 26, has lived with roommates for the last eight years. Next month, they are moving in together, to a yet-unfound apartment, probably in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.
 ''We love each other very much and want to spend time with each other, and it seemed to make sense,'' said Mr. Hays, who has never before shared a place with a significant other. ''We kind of decided to make the plunge because I think we're both emotionally ready.''
 Mr. Hays looks to be something of a find. He described himself as a ''good roommate'' who brings his eye as an interior designer to the home; most of the couple's furniture will be vintage or hand-made. He cooks. And he has a blender that he uses exclusively for cocktails. 
 For her part, Ms. Casanova-Burgess, who is studying journalism in graduate school and working part time at a liquor store, anticipates more space. 
 ''I don't have a desk,'' she said. ''Any surface area space I could put my laptop on or my papers are occupied by parental items.'' 
 And: ''I have a blender I'm looking forward to.''
 Mr. Hays expects Ms. Casanova-Burgess to keep him from his natural tendencies, which lean toward loner. Without her, he would watch more movies at home and shoot more pool in bars.
 ''Alana's nice because she's going to hold me to certain standards,'' he said. ''Getting, like, the nice piece of meat and having a full, proper dinner. She's kind of like a driving force for quality of life.''
 They bought their first piece of art together the other day. It's a big, old poster, like something from a grade school classroom, a depiction of a human cell. ''We're both big dorks, and that's part of the attraction,'' Mr. Hays said. 
 Neither jumped at the chance to psychoanalyze the purchase. They just like the colors. 
 Now for a wall to hang it on.

HEADLINE: Unemployment Claims Fall Unexpectedly

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The number of newly laid-off workers filing claims for unemployment benefits declined unexpectedly last week, another indication that the job market may be healing as the economy slowly recovers. 
 The Labor Department said Thursday that new claims for unemployment insurance fell by 22,000 to a seasonally adjusted 432,000, the lowest since July 2008. That was much better than the rise to 460,000 that Wall Street economists had expected.
 The four-week average, which smoothes fluctuations, fell for the 17th straight week to 460,250, the lowest since September 2008, when the financial crisis intensified. The crisis led to widespread mass layoffs, which sent jobless claims to as high as 674,000 last spring.
 Economists closely monitor initial claims, which are considered a gauge of the pace of layoffs and an indication of companies' willingness to hire new work
 The number of jobless workers continuing to claim benefits dropped 57,000 to 4.9 million, also better than the increase that analysts expected.
 But the so-called continuing claims do not include millions of people who have used up the regular 26 weeks of benefits typically provided by states and are receiving extended benefits for up to 73 additional weeks, paid for by the federal government.
 About 4.8 million people were receiving extended benefits in the week ended Dec. 12, the latest data available, an increase of 200,000 from the previous week. The rise is partly a result of another extension of benefits by Congress in November.
 Among the states, Michigan had the largest increase in claims, with 8,382, which it attributed to layoffs in the auto industry. California, Florida, Iowa and Missouri had the next largest increases. The state data lags behind initial claims by one week.
 Tennessee had the largest decrease, of 2,972, followed by Illinois, Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina.

HEADLINE: Once, Twice, Three Times a Mayor. I Love You, New York.

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Thank you very much and Happy New Year. Muchas gracias y Feliz Ano Nuevo.
 Here we are on yet another inauguration day. The last time we did this, none of you thought you'd see me standing here again, did you? Come on, you can admit it. You had no ways of knowing that I'm the Elaine Stritch of New York politics. Remember that Sondheim number she sings? ''I'm Still Here.''
 I want to thank everyone in this great city of ours. I want to thank everyone who voted for me. I also want to thank everyone who voted for my opponent. You cared enough to take part in the democratic process. 
 Most of all, I want to thank the people who really made this day possible. I'm talking about the City Council.
 To get down to brass tacks, I want to thank the 29 council members who had the courage to extend term limits and make it possible for me and for them to run for office once more. It wasn't easy. Self-interest is never easy. You have to put up with a lot of guff from the quibblers and professional crepe hangers. Those brave council members -- one of whom, sad to say, is a convicted crook on his way to jail -- didn't blink.
 Let me get this out in the open for this one time only. I know that many New Yorkers were disappointed with how I reversed everything that I'd said for years about the sanctity of term limits. I owe them an explanation. I know that the election was close in part because of this issue. It was a tough campaign. I knew it would be. Why else do you think I spent more than $100 million of my own money getting re-elected? I mean, come on!
 But we need problem-solving, not ideology. And I really had a problem.
 What was I supposed to do? Leave office and sit around some foundation signing checks all day? Wait for my once-a-year invitation to Davos? I mean, come on! Any billionaire can wangle an invite to Davos. But would I have been given the chance to speak at that conference in Copenhagen a few weeks ago or go on ''Meet the Press'' or get a shout-out from President Obama if I were just another rich guy and not the mayor of New York? No ways.
 You know the old saying ''When God closes a door, somewhere he opens a window''? Well, God provided. The economy fell apart, thank God. I had the excuse I needed to change the election rules without asking the voters what they thought. I mean, come on! Who knows the buck better than me?
 Chris Quinn went along in a heartbeat. I knew she would. Same with those 28 other council members. The borough presidents hopped on board, too, although I have to admit that a couple of them gave me a laugh the way they went on about the importance of political continuity in the economic crisis. Like we'd be in deep trouble without the borough presidents.
 That reminds me, maybe it's time to change the City Charter and eliminate their jobs. Seriously, do you know anyone who would miss them?
 Anyways, it's time to move on. But first, I want to thank Billy Thompson and Betsy Gotbaum for their service. They could have given me a really hard time every step of the way, but they didn't -- nothing that I couldn't handle, anyways. Yeah, it was pretty outrageous of Billy to say in our debate that I deserved a D-minus as mayor. But who took him seriously? All things considered, he barely laid a glove on me.
 I only hope that the new guys, John Liu and Bill de Blasio, learn from the old guys, no matter how ambitious they are. I'm already thinking of ways to eliminate the public advocate's job. You want to make it easy for me to pull that trigger, Bill? Try giving me a rough time. Go ahead, make my day.
 We've still got a lot to do. I pledge my best to you, the people of New York. This is about you, not about me. So let's talk about you. What do you think of me?
 Old joke. Seriously, we have a ways to go. We need to keep crime down and test scores up. We need to pull ourselves out of this recession and do what we must, no matter how painful, to balance our budget. If we have time, my health commissioner and I will find new things that we don't want you to eat, and ban them.
 I know that many elected officials in the past got the third-term blahs. They went stale. With all humility, I promise you this: I will never become bored. But if I do, I will do my best not to show it, even if it means hiding out in Bermuda.
 Thank you. May God bless New York City. Gracias. Que Dios bendiga la ciudad de Nueva York.

HEADLINE: Studies Find Heavy Heating Oil Has Severe Effect on Air Quality

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
When it comes to finding a major culprit for the tainted air in a wintry New York, one often needs to look no farther than out the window to see a big building spewing black smoke.
 The source is often No. 6 heating oil, the cheapest but most viscous type pumped into aging boilers, or its cousin No. 4 heavy oil, which is only slightly less noxious.
 City officials have already promised to introduce regulations over the next year to phase out both types. But the issue has acquired a bit of urgency since Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his health commissioner, Dr. Thomas Farley, released a comprehensive survey of air quality in the city two weeks ago. 
 The study found the highest levels of fine particles, sulfur dioxide and other pollutants in neighborhoods where many residential and commercial buildings burn No. 4 or No. 6 oil. 
 Now pressure is building on the administration to give buildings a firm 10-year deadline for switching to cleaner oil or to natural gas. Environmental groups and the American Lung Association said the move would significantly reduce soot pollution, alleviating heart and lung ailments. 
 ''This is a simple, common-sense solution to ensure that New York City residents are breathing cleaner air,'' said Michael Seilback, vice president for public policy and communications for the Lung Association in New York State and New York City. 
 City officials say they have been trying to settle on the best approach for ridding buildings of the dirty oil for about a year and expect to issue new rules early this year. 
 Building owners say it can take more than $100,000 to replace oil burners, clean up tanks and switch their heating systems to cleaner oil or to gain access to suitable natural gas pipelines.
 Rohit T. Aggarwala, director of the mayor's Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability, said the city must weigh the costs of a changeover and the availability of natural gas citywide. ''We're working on a fix,'' said Jason Post, a spokesman for the mayor's office. ''We want to do this right.'' 
 The Environmental Defense Fund, a national environmental group, recently issued its own report saying that just 1 percent of all buildings in the city -- about 9,000 large commercial, residential and institutional structures -- create 87 percent of the soot pollution arising from heating oil. (The group has posted a list at www.edf.org/dirtybuildings so New Yorkers can see which kind of oil their buildings burn.)
 If those buildings were to burn cleaner oil, the fund's report said, the amount of airborne pollutants they release would decline by as much as 65 percent to 95 percent. 
 The numbers by which heating oil is classified are based on boiling temperature, composition and other factors. No. 2 heating oil, which is cleaner but more expensive than No. 6 or No. 4, accounts for an estimated 73 percent of the heating oil burned in the city, the environmental group found. 
 Evan Thies, a spokesman for the group, said users of the most polluting fuels tended to be larger buildings that could accommodate huge boilers that generate the heat necessary to burn heavy oil. 
 The dirtiest oils can cost about 60 cents less a gallon, which has been another disincentive for buildings to upgrade their boilers. But in its report, the Environmental Defense Fund said that cleaner fuels improve the efficiency of burners and reduce operating costs, compensating for the up-front costs and the higher price of No. 2 oil. 
 The group, using records from the city's Department of Environmental Protection, which approves boiler permits, points out in its report that heavy oil heats buildings in some of the wealthiest ZIP codes in the city, most of them in Manhattan. 
 The pollution is aggravated by diesel fuel emissions from heavy car and truck traffic in some areas. But Stuart M. Saft, chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, says the assumption that only the rich live in the buildings at issue ignores the reality that even at wealthy addresses, ''there are people living on fixed incomes or on Social Security who bought their apartments 40 years ago.'' 
 Aside from the $100,000 that he estimates it would cost up front for the average 100- to 150-unit building to replace its oil burner and clean up its oil tanks to make the switch, the cost difference between the dirty and cleaner oils is substantial, Mr. Saft said.
 His group, he said, would oppose any phase-out that did not exempt ''functioning'' heating systems, as opposed to those at the end of their life.
 But some buildings are already converting their systems as part of broader environmental efforts.
 Diane C. Nardone, president of the board at 11 Fifth Avenue, a 288-apartment cooperative in two 20-story buildings in Greenwich Village, said it was in the midst of converting to natural gas from two boilers that use No. 6 oil. She said the switch would cost roughly $225,000, which the co-op will be able to cover after refinancing its mortgage.
 But the cooperative expects to recoup the up-front costs in about two years through fuel savings, she said, given that natural gas will be cheaper than oil in the long run.
 ''We understand the impact it will have on the economics of the building and, equally important, on the environment,'' she said. 
 The co-op is also installing two new roofs with vegetation that will absorb rainwater, and energy-efficient windows. Still, Ms. Nardone said that city and state governments needed to offer more financial incentives to help buildings meet any new environmental regulations. 
 ''Give property tax credits, make loans available at low interest, if you want the general population to take the measures that need to be taken to improve the environment,'' she said.
 City officials say older people and young children are particularly vulnerable to air pollution, which can irritate the lungs and worsen conditions like asthma and emphysema, as well as increase the risk of heart attack and premature death. 
 Mindful of the health risks, the city is already converting some of its own heavy-oil-burning boilers to natural gas, after identifying 100 city school buildings burning No. 6 oil in neighborhoods with high asthma rates.

HEADLINE: A City With a Proudly Salty Reputation

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN. 
Sewell Chan, the bureau chief of the City Room blog, is on the road this week, filing dispatches from some of New York State's other cities.

DATELINE: SYRACUSE 

 BODY:
This is a city founded on salt.
 Once a center of typewriter manufacturing but probably best known nowadays for its university, Syracuse lies to the southeast of Onondaga Lake, whose salty deposits stimulated the city's economic growth, particularly from the 1820s to the 1860s. 
 So it seems particularly fitting that there is a museum dedicated to salt, situated in Liverpool, a nearby village on the shore of the lake. 
 The museum is normally closed during the winter, but the kindly staff of the Onondaga County Parks Department, which manages the museum, indulged a visitor from New York City on Thursday morning, during a light snowfall. (Syracuse is one of the snowiest cities in the United States.)
 Inside, one learns that the native Onondagas first discovered the salt springs; that two escaped slaves were recorded boiling brine in brass kettles and selling the salt to the Indians in 1774; and that commercial salt development was begun in 1788 by two Revolutionary War veterans, Asa Danforth and Comfort Tyler, who settled in the area. 
 The state owned and administered the Salt Spring Reservation here from 1797 to 1908, leasing out the land to individuals to build boiling blocks, solar sheds and other salt-making facilities. The state operated water- and steam-powered pump rooms in each of four districts -- Geddes, Liverpool, Salina and Syracuse -- that forced brine water from the lake into tall reservoirs. The state-owned network of rigs, wells, pump houses, pipelines, reservoirs and wharves was accompanied by a regime of state-mandated production quotas, storage in state warehouses, inspection and transport from state wharves. (Anyone who thinks that current government intervention in the economy is intense should look at the history of Syracuse.) 
 Just why was salt so in demand? Among other purposes, it was crucial to keeping meat fresh in the era before electric refrigeration. 
 The heart of the Salt Museum is a reconstructed boiling block -- an area where men worked in 90-degree heat and humidity, 12 hours a day, seven days a week, from April to November, boiling brine to isolate salt. They could produce three to four bushels in five hours. Their work was considered so critical that they were exempted from conscription during the Civil War. 
 The discovery of stronger rock and brine deposits in western New York, Michigan, Texas, Kansas, Utah and elsewhere contributed to the industry's decline. The final blow was a 1926 hurricane that crippled the remaining solar sheds; later that year, the Onondaga Coarse Salt Company, the last manufacturer left, closed after 125 years. All that remains now are street names like Solar and Salina -- and this museum.
 The Salt Museum is on the site of the Sampson Jaqueth Salt Manufactory, built in 1856; part of the original chimney survives, but two-thirds of it is gone. The museum is in a building reconstructed in 1933, during the New Deal era, by the Onondaga County Emergency Work Bureau.

HEADLINE: Wells Fargo Pays 4 Executives $25 Million in Stock Bonuses, Not Cash

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Wells Fargo & Company, the San Francisco-based bank, said Thursday that it gave its chief executive, John G. Stumpf, and three others stock bonuses worth about $25 million, but that none of the executives will receive a cash bonus for 2009. 
 Mr. Stumpf received 379,600 shares, valued at about $10 million. The chief financial officer, Howard I. Atkins; the head of wholesale banking, David A. Hoyt; and the head of home and consumer finance, Mark C. Oman, each received 189,800 shares, worth about $5 million each.
 The stock payouts will vest after three years and only if the bank meets certain performance goals, Wells Fargo said in a statement. The executives will forfeit the payouts if they leave the company for a rival, and they must hold a portion of all their shares for as long as they are employed by Wells Fargo, according to the statement.
 Wells Fargo's move follows that of the Goldman Sachs Group, which in December said it would pay its top managers their 2009 bonuses in stock rather than cash.
 Morgan Stanley also is considering proposals to align pay with long-term performance, through measures like awarding compensation based in part on the bank's share performance relative to peers, according to media reports.
 Banks broadly are seeking to deflect outrage over bonuses, which have been a contentious issue since the federal government handed out billions of dollars in bailout money to shore up banks during the financial crisis.
 Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest United States bank by assets, in December returned the $25 billion it received in October 2008 under the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program.
 But some bank experts have said that returning government funds and increasing stock-based compensation will not necessarily end public outcry over bankers' large bonuses. If banks including Wells Fargo continue to rebound from the financial crisis, their shares -- and the executives' payouts -- could surge.

HEADLINE: The New And Eternal As a Decade Commences

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
A NEW month bequeaths a new year bequeaths a new decade and -- dare anyone hope -- maybe a new lease on life for the economy, which took its toll on the arts in 2009 as it did on everything else. Critics and reporters for The New York Times have peered deeply into January and found cultural offerings that say encouraging things about the year ahead. A new production of Bizet's ''Carmen'' can be seen in repertory at the Metropolitan Opera this month, and Pierre Boulez comes to Carnegie Hall to pick up the baton, not once but twice in January. 
 Almost all the known drawings of the Mannerist master Bronzino go on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Jan. 20, the museum's first exhibition devoted to him. A new Anne Tyler novel arrives in bookstores, along with a biography of Warren Beatty and a much anticipated follow-up to the best seller ''Eat, Pray, Love,'' by Elizabeth Gilbert. Experimental theater colonizes Manhattan, at the Public Theater and other locations, in the form of the Under the Radar Festival, which opens on Wednesday. And on the same day you could watch Willem Dafoe play Elvis -- no not that one, but a ''cured'' vampire by that name in ''Daybreakers,'' the new thriller by Peter and Michael Spierig about the world toward the end of the next decade, 2019, when vampires outnumber humans on earth.
 Or if you like your vampires with guitars, you could opt instead for Vampire Weekend -- which includes nobody even vaguely resembling a succubus -- when that highly praised hometown band returns home for three big shows in Manhattan. (Performing arts and film, video game and television choices are on Pages 2, 3 and 4.) RANDY KENNEDY

HEADLINE: Rose Bowl Hopes to Bet Future on a Makeover

BYLINE: By BILLY WITZ

DATELINE: PASADENA, Calif. 

 BODY:
As parade floats were being prepared nearby and workers busied themselves with final touches to the Rose Bowl, the 87-year-old stadium looked as ready as ever for the two close-ups it will receive in the next week. First, it will host, as it always does, the Rose Bowl game on New Year's Day. Then, six days later, it will be home to the Bowl Championship Series title game.
 But as Darryl Dunn, the general manager of the stadium, stood in the middle of an immaculately manicured field, an enormous red rose painted in the center, his gaze carried beyond the elliptical, tree-lined rim of the Rose Bowl and past the San Gabriel Mountains, which frame it.
 ''This place is almost like a walking museum, there's such great, great history here,'' Dunn said. ''But what about the future? The next 12 months are going to define the next 50 years.'' 
 For Dunn and other officials, after a week of being at the center of the college football world, the real work will begin: completing plans and applying for bonds for a $164 million renovation of the stadium. The project, which would start in January 2011, would be completed four years from now -- in time for the 100th Rose Bowl game and the return of the B.C.S. title game.
 Creating a sense of urgency is the economy. Interest rates and construction costs have fallen in the last year, and the deadline for federal stimulus funds, which the Rose Bowl would be eligible for, is Dec. 31, 2010. 
 ''The window of opportunity to make this work, really, is today,'' said Michael Beck, the city manager of Pasadena, which owns the stadium. ''Two years ago, we couldn't afford to do it. Two years from now, interest rates will be higher and construction costs are likely to be higher. This is the perfect economy to make an investment in.''
 Asked about the wisdom of investing in a stadium, a strategy that has left many municipalities in dire financial straits, Beck conceded there was some risk.
 ''But there's also the other risk,'' Beck said. ''That's the risk of not doing anything.''
 The danger of that strategy is illustrated in Miami, where the Orange Bowl stadium, built in the same era as the Rose Bowl and itself an iconic site, no longer exists.
 It was once home to the Dolphins, the University of Miami and Super Bowls, as well as the Orange Bowl game. But when the Dolphins owner Joe Robbie could not persuade city officials to add suites to the Orange Bowl in the 1980s, he built his own stadium and moved the Dolphins. The Super Bowls followed. Then the Orange Bowl game. And finally, the University of Miami.
 As each tenant left, revenue declined. The stadium eventually deteriorated beyond repair.
 ''Then the question became, what are you going to do with this dinosaur?'' Dunn said.
 In 2008, it was razed to make way for a baseball stadium.
 The question of what to do with the Rose Bowl is one that Dunn has been grappling with since he was hired 10 years ago. The city had recently written off $8.7 million in debt and there were fears that if the N.F.L. were to build a new stadium in Los Angeles, the Rose Bowl could lose its main tenant, U.C.L.A.
 That motivated Pasadena officials in 2003 to pursue a deal with the N.F.L. in which the league would pay for a $500 million renovation of the stadium in exchange for being allowed to operate it.
 But the proposal bitterly divided the community. Residents who lived in the historic homes that surrounded the Arroyo Seco, the narrow canyon in which the bowl sits, were adamantly opposed to bringing N.F.L. crowds into their neighborhood. (The memory of Raiders fans endures.) And preservationists protested that the changes the N.F.L. wanted to make would alter the character of the stadium and jeopardize its status as a National Historic Landmark. They pointed to Soldier Field, whose landmark status was revoked after a renovation that some critics lampooned as a spaceship crashing into the old stadium.
 ''That was a wake-up call because it highlighted what could happen to us,'' said Sue Mossman, executive director of Pasadena Heritage, a preservation group. ''The Rose Bowl would no longer be the Rose Bowl because there was no way to marry the historic qualities that give the Rose Bowl its essence and a new state-of-the-art N.F.L. stadium.''
 The City Council gave $1 million to the Rose Bowl Operating Company, which Dunn manages, to explore other options. He had just about exhausted it by the summer of 2008, when he took his son to see Fenway Park, a place Dunn had visited frequently while growing up in Connecticut.
 Short on money and ideas, Dunn called Janet Marie Smith, who as the Red Sox' vice president for planning and development oversaw the improvements that were made at Fenway after the team was sold in 2002 to John Henry, one of the few prospective owners who did not want a new stadium for the team. They met and soon Smith and her team were in Pasadena as consultants, researching the Rose Bowl, interviewing community leaders and studying the possibilities.
 What helped was that the same conservation ethic that existed in Boston was alive in Pasadena, whose downtown revitalization in the 1980s was pivotal in the city's financial turnaround. If much of Los Angeles is a testament to development run amok, Pasadena is keen on embracing its heritage.
 ''In Southern California, newer is better in many people's minds,'' Mossman said. ''That's why they come here, that's why they want to live here -- to reinvent themselves. It's often identified as the most cutting edge, least traditional place. All this old history nonsense feels out of place for many. But the old neighborhoods, the great architecture, the sense of community are what makes Pasadena a special place. It's why people want to live here, shop here and work here. It's money in the bank.''
 The plan that Smith developed called for more modest improvements and, in keeping with the rest of the neighborhood, for turning the clock back as well as forward.
 The scoreboard at the south end of the stadium will be replaced by a 1940s replica, and at the north end, much of the signage will be stripped away and replaced by a high-definition video board. The bottom 10 rows, with notoriously poor views, will be ripped out along the sidelines and replaced by the hedges that once enveloped the field. Aisles will be added and tunnels widened, allowing for easier access. And the concessions, which ring the building, will be reconfigured to be more efficient and redesigned to reflect the Craftsman-style of the neighborhood.
 ''Some of it is born out of sentiment, but it's also born out of practicality,'' Smith said. ''There's an important reality on communities and sports teams that you don't always have to start over.''
 Perhaps the most critical part of the renovation is the overhaul of the press box, which houses suites. Its height would not change, pleasing the preservationists, but it would extend farther from the stadium, increasing the suite capacity from 600 to 2,500. Those suites, and other premium seating, would help generate $100 million to pay off the bonds, according to preliminary estimates. Other revenue streams are expected to come from advertising around the stadium and selective major events, like a U2 concert earlier this year. There will also be an effort to solicit philanthropic donors, though there remains uncertainty over how much that would generate.
 ''We're a stadium,'' Dunn said. ''We don't have an alumni base.''
 The Tournament of Roses and U.C.L.A. have been supportive, but are also wary that their concerns are met. U.C.L.A. agreed to a 20-year lease after receiving assurances that the locker rooms would be renovated, which they were in 2007, quadrupling to 12,000 square feet. About $43 million remains on bonds from that renovation and earlier projects. 
 In the next two months, Dunn said, the numbers will have to be crunched more firmly to make sure they all add up. 
 ''The funding is the biggest challenge, no question about it,'' Dunn said. ''But what we're doing is modest and incremental. The day you stop reinvesting is the day you start to lose it. We want to make the Rose Bowl better and we've never had a better opportunity.''

HEADLINE: Debate Grows Over Roundup Of Wild Horses In Nevada

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
With helicopters swooping low and slow, wranglers this week began rounding up and corralling wild horses on a vast Nevada range, feeding an intense debate over whether removing the animals helps or hurts the preservation of an enduring symbol of the West.
 In one of the largest such roundups conducted in Nevada, federal officials said they were planning to remove about 2,500 mustangs from an area nearly three times the size of New York City, in the Calico Mountains 100 miles north of Reno. 
 There are too many of the animals in that area, upsetting the balance of natural resources for flora and fauna, including grazing land for cattle, federal officials said. About 140 horses had been removed as of Thursday. After two months of rounding them up and eventually trucking most to pastures in the Midwest, government officials expect 600 to 800 horses will remain.
 ''The fact is right now we have three to five times the population of wild horses that the range can sustain,'' said Bob Abbey, director of the federal Bureau of Land Management, which is overseeing the roundup.
 The roundup of wild horses, and burros as well, has been one of the most contentious issues in the West, where growth, farming, recreation and preservation do not always mesh.
 Horse advocates unsuccessfully sued to block this roundup and celebrities like the singer Sheryl Crow and the actor Viggo Mortensen sent a letter to President Obama last week imploring him to halt it, to no avail.
 On Wednesday, protesters gathered outside the San Francisco offices of Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat who has been sympathetic to the cause in the past but, through a spokesman, would not comment on the roundup. 
 Suzanne Roy, a spokeswoman for In Defense of Animals, which has fought to keep the wild horses on the ranges, said federal officials had tried to cloak the roundup in secrecy by beginning it on inaccessible private land and conducting it during the lull between Christmas and New Year's Day.
 The group also says the helicopters, which federal officials call the most efficient means to guide the herds to the corrals, traumatize the animals. But more than anything, Ms. Roy said, the horses should be allowed to stay put.
 ''Wild horses have tightly knit bands,'' Ms. Roy said. ''This shatters the social structure; foals are separated from their mothers; the horses are put in a very unnatural situation. The whole thing is just a major trauma and terror for these really beautiful horses that have lived peacefully on these lands for hundreds of years.''
 But the land management bureau said the ''gather,'' as it calls it, would ultimately save the lives of horses.
 Unlike other animals, wild horses cannot legally be hunted or slaughtered, and they have no natural predator. When the area gets overpopulated, food becomes scarce and the horses suffer, said Mr. Abbey, the agency director, who expressed exasperation with some animal rights advocates. 
 ''If it were up to them, we would be allowing wild horses to starve to death, which is no way to honor an American icon,'' he said in a telephone interview.
 Most of the older animals are moved to distant pastures that provide lots of room and abundant food. The younger horses are put up for adoption, though the government has struggled to find qualified people who want to adopt, particularly in the recession.
 A goal of the roundup, acknowledged Heather Emmons, a spokeswoman for the agency, was providing access to grazing land for cattle. Some ranchers have pulled cattle from pockets of the range because there has not been enough vegetation, partly because of the overpopulation of horses but also because of a lingering drought.
 Bureau officials said the roundups include safeguards, like a check of the horses by veterinarians. Since Monday, one horse caught in the roundup had to be euthanized because, Mr. Abbey said, it would not have survived the winter because of its advanced age.
 The roundup will give wranglers ample time to corral the large numbers and provide the best access to the horses, before they migrate to more treacherous terrain in the warmer months, Mr. Abbey said.
 The government already keeps 34,000 wild horses and burros captive, mainly in Oklahoma and Kansas. Another 37,000, half in Nevada, roam on bureau territory in 10 states.

HEADLINE: Judge Blocks Furloughs In California

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO 

 BODY:
A California judge on Thursday ruled that Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger abused his discretion in ordering furloughs of state workers, dealing a blow to his administration's efforts to cope with California's fiscal crisis. 
 The judge, Frank Roesch of Alameda County Superior Court, said the administration must halt the furloughs for workers represented by three unions, including Service Employees International Union Local 1000, which represents 95,000 state employees.
 Judge Roesch ruled against Mr. Schwarzenegger's furlough orders on two fronts: He said the administration could not take the action against employees in so-called special fund agencies, or those that receive money from sources other than the state general fund. He also said Mr. Schwarzenegger had overstepped his authority by claiming the furloughs were necessary to deal with a budget emergency.
 Judge Roesch said Mr. Schwarzenegger could overstep the Legislature's normal authority in an emergency only for a temporary period, a period the judge said ended once the Legislature approved the state budget.
 Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, this year ordered most state employees to take three days off a month without pay as the state faced a huge budget deficit. The mandatory furloughs, which began in February and were extended over the summer, affected about 200,000 state workers and were expected to save the state $2 billion.
 A Schwarzenegger spokesman, Aaron McLear, said the judge's ruling would be appealed. An appeal would automatically stay the ruling.
 ''In these tough economic times, there's no reason why state workers should be shielded from the same economic reality that the rest of the state faces,'' Mr. McLear said.
 An S.E.I.U. spokesman, Jim Zamora, said the ruling could affect up to 50,000 employees who work at agencies that do not rely on the general fund.
 ''We are gratified that the judge saw through the governor's smoke screen and ruled that these furloughs are illegal,'' Mr. Zamora said.

HEADLINE: A Busy Year for Judiciary, Roberts Says

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.'s annual report on the state of the federal judiciary has been dominated in recent years by pleas for a raise for judges. This year's report, issued Thursday, took a different approach.
 Aside from an oblique reference to ''critical needs of the judiciary'' that ''remain to be addressed,'' the chief justice's 2009 report focused on demonstrating that the federal courts remained busy and effective. 
 ''When the political branches are faced with so many difficult issues, and when so many of our fellow citizens have been touched by hardship,'' the chief justice wrote, ''the public might welcome a year-end report limited to what is essential: The courts are operating soundly, and the nation's dedicated federal judges are conscientiously discharging their duties.''
 The chief justice's description of the shifting docket of the federal courts reflected some of those difficulties and hardships. Most strikingly, bankruptcy petitions shot up to 1.4 million in 2009, up 35 percent from the previous year. There were increases in 93 of the 94 federal judicial districts. ''Nine districts experienced increases of 60 percent or more,'' Chief Justice Roberts said.
 Cases involving consumer credit outside the bankruptcy system rose, too, by 53 percent. This was, the chief justice wrote, ''fueled in part by the current economic downturn, particularly in the nation's most populous districts.'' 
 Criminal case filings rose 8 percent, to 76,655. That was the biggest number since 1932, the year before the ratification of the Twenty-First Amendment, which repealed Prohibition. In that year, 92,174 cases were filed, many of them for alcohol-related offenses.
 With the exception of charges concerning marijuana, the number of drug cases fell last year. So did the number of gun cases. But cases involving immigration crimes climbed to record levels. The number of defendants charged with immigration crimes, mostly relating to improper re-entry by immigrants or the misuse of visas and entry permits, rose 19 percent, to 26,961. 
 Almost 90 percent of the immigration cases were filed in the southwestern United States.
 The federal trial courts' civil docket grew by 3 percent. Much of the increase was a consequence, the chief justice wrote, ''of a national increase in personal injury cases related to asbestos.'' Most of those cases were filed in the Federal District Court in Philadelphia.
 The federal appeals courts, on the other hand, saw a 6 percent drop in filings. The chief justice said the decline came mainly from a decrease in cases involving the Board of Immigration Appeals. 
 The number of appeals filed in the Supreme Court dropped, too, to 7,738 from 8,241. Some of the decline may be attributable to the very long odds of obtaining Supreme Court review. The court issued 74 signed opinions in the term that ended in June, up from 67 in the previous term. 
 Those numbers suggest that an appeal to the Supreme Court has about a 1-in-100 chance of being heard.
 ''One case from the 2008 term,'' the chief justice blandly noted, ''was reargued later that term.'' He was referring to Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, a major campaign finance case that was argued for a second time in September. The court surprised many election law specialists by closing up shop for the year without deciding the case. 
 The McCain-Feingold campaign finance law, part of which is at risk in the case, requires the court ''to expedite to the greatest possible extent'' challenges to the law.
 In 2003, the court quickly decided a much more complicated case under the law, McConnell v. Federal Election Commission. That case was also argued in September; it was decided by early December.
 The decision in the Citizens United case could arrive as soon as the second week of January.

HEADLINE: After a Year of Tumult at Treasury, Former Bailout Chief Took a Quiet Path to Pimco

BYLINE: By DEVIN LEONARD

 BODY:
The financial crisis did not produce many stars. One of the few was Neel T. Kashkari, the former Bush administration bailout chief.
 A onetime investment banker at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Kashkari became an instant celebrity in October 2008 when he was tapped by Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the Treasury secretary, to run the Troubled Asset Relief Program for banks. He was christened ''the $700 billion man'' for overseeing such a huge amount of banking aid. 
 Power attracts attention. People magazine called Mr. Kashkari, a 35-year-old with a hawk nose and a shaved head, one of the sexiest men alive. When he resigned his post as assistant Treasury secretary on May 1, a few months after the transition to the Obama administration, he seemed to be a highly marketable commodity.
 Shortly after leaving government, he was a guest on the Charlie Rose television program on PBS. 
 ''What's the chance,'' Mr. Rose asked pointedly, ''you are going to go back into the financial sector and make a ton of money?'' 
 ''I'm going to take several months off,'' Mr. Kashkari replied. ''I do plan to go back into the private sector, likely in finance in some capacity, but I have no idea what that's going to be.''
 For a time, Mr. Kashkari did indeed decompress in a cabin not far from Lake Tahoe, in northwest California. 
 Then on Dec. 14, he went to work as head of new investment initiatives at the Pacific Investment Management Company, or Pimco, the powerful bond investment company based in Newport Beach, Calif., whose top executives have boasted of their access to government officials. Alan Greenspan, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, is among its consultants. 
 In hindsight, it's easy to understand Mr. Kashkari's reluctance to discuss his job hunt. He was in a bit of a bind after leaving government. Landing a job at a bank that had taken bailout money would have drawn criticism. 
 But even though Pimco was not a recipient of government aid, Mr. Kashkari's career move raised eyebrows. Bloggers joked about how -- in their view -- he had all along been doing the company's work in Washington. 
 During the crisis, William H. Gross, the founder and co-chief investment officer of Pimco, who is known for his witty letters to investors and his appearances on CNBC, frequently offered advice to the Treasury about how to handle the bailout. 
 At the same time, Pimco's publicly stated strategy was to invest money in areas that would benefit from the government's rescue efforts. The company called this its ''shake hands with the government'' plan.
 The strategy paid off. The company's flagship Total Return Fund turned in a strong performance in 2008. The fund's Class A shares, available to individual investors, were up 4.3 percent -- nine percentage points ahead of comparable bond funds, according to Morningstar. And by late September 2009, Pimco's assets under management had swelled 32 percent, to $940 billion, from the end of 2008. 
 Outsiders consider Mr. Kashkari's addition a natural strengthening of Pimco's ties to government.
 ''Kashkari brings a great deal of potential benefit to Pimco in terms of government knowledge and connections to both parties,'' said Douglas J. Elliott, a Brookings Institution fellow and former managing director at J.P. Morgan. ''He understands what the government is likely to do and has a good understanding of the financial sector. So I can really see why Pimco would want him.''
 Scott Talbott, senior vice president for government affairs with the Financial Services Roundtable, an industry lobbying group, agreed that Pimco could benefit from Mr. Kashkari's recent foray in Washington. ''Why pay the extra dollars that his political experience can command if they aren't going to use it?'' he asked. 
 Neither Pimco nor Mr. Kashkari would discuss how he ended up at the company or how he would be compensated. But people familiar with his job search said he wanted to work for a company where he could start a new business -- just as he had with the relief fund for the federal government. 
 Pimco said in a statement that Mr. Kashkari's first task would be to recruit new employees and help build a new division that would invest in stocks. Two people with direct knowledge of his employment search said that he would not be taking part in the company's investing decisions. In fact, Pimco has hired two former equities portfolio managers from Franklin Templeton Investments to establish the new division's moneymaking approach.
 Mr. Kashkari left Goldman Sachs to become a senior adviser to Mr. Paulson in June 2006. Early on, he worked on housing issues. The people with knowledge of his employment search said that Mr. Kashkari met Mr. Gross while touring the country with the Treasury secretary in December 2007 to assess the country's troubled housing market. 
 Several former Treasury officials said Mr. Gross had frequently been in touch with Mr. Kashkari and others in government about various initiatives. None of those officials or others suggested there was anything improper about those contacts. 
 ''Gross was one of those guys, along with Warren Buffett, who were really interested in trying to give us ideas and be helpful in resolving the crisis,'' said Robert F. Hoyt, a former Treasury Department general counsel under Mr. Paulson. ''They would send memos to Treasury. They weren't ideas we ended up implementing, but they were interesting.''
 It was also hard, however, not to notice that Pimco was a direct beneficiary of the Treasury Department's actions. In 2008, when it appeared that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac might fail, Mr. Gross saw an opportunity. 
 He moved Pimco's flagship Total Return Fund heavily into mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the two agencies. Then he vociferously advocated for the government to rescue them during television appearances on CNBC and elsewhere. On Sept. 7, 2008, the fund's value soared by $1.7 billion when Mr. Paulson announced the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. As part of his government duties, Mr. Kashkari worked on that rescue effort.
 Mr. Gross was also a strong supporter of the troubled asset program, originally envisioned as a way to purchase impaired assets from the nation's ailing banks. He praised the plan on television and in a newspaper op-ed article, and he even offered to manage the government program at no charge. 
 Mr. Kashkari backed the asset purchase plan. Ultimately, though, Mr. Paulson decided to invest the government funds directly in the banks, considering it important to stave off disaster. Mr. Kashkari hired more than 135 lawyers, compliance officers and former bankers to execute the plan, and then had to defend the program on Capitol Hill, where he was sometimes treated like a pinata. 
 In his appearance on Charlie Rose, Mr. Kashkari said that during Congressional hearings he kept an index card in front of him bearing the inscription: ''The louder he yells, the calmer I shall be'' -- referring to any lawmaker who might be questioning him. 
 Mr. Kashkari's successor at the Treasury is Herbert M. Allison Jr., 66, a senior banker with experience at Merrill Lynch and TIAA-CREF before he stepped into the breach at Fannie Mae when the government took control. Partly because the relief fund had largely been distributed before he arrived, Mr. Allison has had a much lower profile than his predecessor.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about the Pacific Investment Management Company's hiring of Neel T. Kashkari, who ran the Troubled Asset Relief Program in the Bush administration, misstated the location of the cabin in which he decompressed after leaving that job a few months after the Obama administration took office. It was near Lake Tahoe in northeast -- not northwest -- California.

HEADLINE: Doubts on Regulation and Renewal Hang Over Wall St.

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY and ERIC DASH

 BODY:
After staging one of the most remarkable comebacks in business history -- because of taxpayer lifelines and other support from Washington -- the giants of the banking industry are entering a new phase of the postbailout period. 
 While, for many Americans, the dark fears of the crisis have given way to indignation over the Lazarus-like recovery at big banks, few on Wall Street expect 2010 to be as profitable as 2009. All told, the half dozen biggest banks have already made more than $50 billion in the first three quarters, and are on track to deliver a year of hefty profits -- and bonuses -- that could rival those of the boom years. 
 But at this pivotal moment, big questions loom: Will the economy stage a robust recovery or just muddle along? Will the stunning rally in the stock market last? As the debate rages over how to prevent future crises, will Washington impose tough new rules on banks? 
 More important, will banks fundamentally change the way they do business, or simply carry on as before? 
 ''That is the larger issue hanging over the industry at this point,'' said Lawrence H. Summers, the chief economic adviser to President Obama. ''I think the view of some in Manhattan and the view from rest of the America, including the administration, is very different.''
 Rarely has the divide been so deep between Wall Street and Main Street. Even as Mr. Obama urges banking executives to do more to help the economy recover, many homeowners and small businesses say banks are reluctant to make loans. 
 The banking industry has throttled back lending for the last 15 months, draining more than $3 trillion of credit from the economy. 
 When housing prices were rising, Peter M. Allen might have had little trouble refinancing the mortgage on his home in Palo Alto, Calif. Now, like millions of Americans, Mr. Allen, 50, is out of work, and the banks are turning him away. 
 ''Things have changed,'' Mr. Allen, an engineer, said. ''They were basically closed for business.''
 As banks enjoy a recovery, lending may slow further as the Federal Reserve shifts its focus from spurring growth to heading off inflation, reversing the current period of ultralow interest rates that has been a boon to banks. Right now, low rates are fattening banks' profit margins, since many lenders are not passing on their own low costs to borrowers. Lending rates will also spike as the government withdraws its trillion-dollar support of the mortgage market in the spring. 
 ''Are they going to kill the housing market?'' said Laurence D. Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, a big money management firm. ''That is an issue.''
 Most banks are hunkering down in anticipation of another big wave of real estate and consumer loan losses. Small and midsize banks are expected to be hit especially hard: They must absorb nearly $900 billion of commercial real estate losses over the next few years, causing several hundred banks to fail.
 The big banks, meanwhile, face a range of new regulations that take effect in 2010. Rules curbing overdraft fees and predatory practices in the credit card business are expected to squeeze the flow of billions of dollars from penalty income. They will also have less wiggle room as regulators require them to hold larger cash reserves, reducing their returns and forcing them to be more conservative.
 That heralds a sharp drop in profits, especially if the ebullient stock and bond markets, which generated billions in trading revenue last year for Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street giants, tapers off in 2010. 
 Analysts say that bank profitability might fall by a third from its precrisis levels, to where it was in the '60s, '70s and '80s. ''We tend to believe it is back to the future,'' said Frederick Cannon, a senior banking analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods.
 Wall Street has responded by beefing up its financial lobby in Washington to win big concessions. Among other things, the industry is working to ease rules governing derivatives and to weaken a proposal for a consumer financial protection agency.
 Already, there is the sense that the political momentum to force meaningful changes has ebbed as banks returned to profits and bonuses last year, and broke free of government control. 
 ''This is no time for a return to business as usual,'' Paul A. Volcker, the chairman of the president's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, said in a recent speech in Germany. ''The rally in world stock markets from recession lows has brought renewed hopes on Wall Street and the City of London for a return to outlandish bonuses for financial operators and a vigorous defense of established vested interests.'' 
 The industry's leading executives insist that they have cleaned up their act and that reforms dragging through Congress will draw a line under the crisis and correct the failings that caused it.
 ''There were significant flaws that came out of financial services,'' said Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase's chairman and chief executive. ''Some things are going to change forever.''
 The question is how much. Exotic financial products, like the so-called C.D.O.-squared, are unlikely to return. Bundled loans, which financed so much of the mortgage boom, will come back as a smaller, more conservative business. 
 Bankers, badly bruised by the crisis, are putting a dagger in the ''Ninja'' loan -- which required ''no income, no job or assets'' to pass muster with a credit officer. After two decades of deregulation, they will now have to contend with more stringent rules.
 Some of the banks are cutting back on their risk-taking. And while they are paying out heavy bonuses, they are making sure they can claw back the paychecks if employees make big losses in the future. 
 James P. Gorman, the next chief executive of Morgan Stanley, a Wall Street firm that nearly went under during the crisis, said: ''There will be real progress in 2010. I am pretty optimistic. The industry understands what has happened and what needs to be done.'' 
 But a year after the crisis, there is still a looming question about how to deal with banks that are too big to fail. 
 Despite heated debate, the government has still not decided how to support a failing bank without pumping in billions of taxpayers' money to avoid contagion in the broader financial system. But the banks that a year ago were too big to fail are now bigger than ever.
 ''Fear has dissipated, greed has returned -- but these structural problems are still there,'' said Peter Nerby, an analyst at Moody's.
 Without a plan for shutting down banks that stumble, the nation's biggest banks still enjoy an implicit guarantee from the government: If they run into trouble the taxpayer will bail them out. 
 Economists worry this is only encouraging them to take risks again, which could mean another crisis in the future.

HEADLINE: Lower Prices Aid In Conservation

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
From the Florida Everglades to the bluffs overlooking the Deschutes River in Oregon, conservationists are snapping up prime property for preservation, often at a fraction of what the asking price was at the real estate market's height.
 On Wednesday, the threatened bog turtle got a reprieve when conservationists scooped up 166 acres of marshland in Frankford Township in northern New Jersey, where developers had planned to build luxury homes. Hours later, city officials and environmentalists in Boise, Idaho, were rejoicing as they closed a deal to protect 1,300 acres of wooded foothills beloved by local hikers.
 The victories reveal a green lining of sorts in a credit crisis that has depressed real estate prices, prompted foreclosures and derailed development projects across the nation. 
 The purchases by conservationists and state and local governments assure that thousands of acres will be put aside in perpetuity for parks, watershed protection or simply preservation of open space.
 ''We are getting a second bite at properties that never should have been developed in the first place,'' said Will Rogers, president of the Trust for Public Land, a national nonprofit group that buys land for preservation. ''We are working on dozens of these deals across the country, and I know other land trusts are as well.''
 Although the real estate bubble burst in 2008, it was only in the last 6 to 12 months that many developers and banks became desperate enough to slash prices deeply enough for the trusts, Mr. Rogers and several other conservationists said. 
 Suki Molina, vice president of the Foothills Conservation Advisory Committee, which joined with the City of Boise in spending $10 million to preserve open space, said her group noticed a change in the way local landowners were approaching the committee early this year. 
 ''The prices were lower,'' Ms. Molina said, ''but what has really changed is the attitude of the developers -- they want to get out. Before this year, they would call, say they had a great piece of land and wanted top dollar. Now, they just want to sell.''
 So what seemed like dream property forever out of their reach -- including waterfront sites near cities or land bordering untouchable parks -- is suddenly attainable.
 In Little Egg Harbor, N.J., north of Atlantic City, Mr. Rogers's group is buying 46 acres covered with pine scrub and marshes for $3.5 million. A year ago, it was priced at $6.2 million after its developer dropped plans for 73 single-family homes as part of a development called the Landings. Now it will become part of the adjacent Edwin Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge. 
 Similarly, officials in New York City announced on Tuesday that a park would be created on a site in Jamaica Bay, Queens, where 21 two-story attached houses with views of water had been planned only a year ago. The bay is polluted yet nutrient-rich, and buffering wetlands are needed there for bird and wildlife protection.
 And in Portland, Ore., 27 acres of grassy and wooded hills at the city's southeastern end that were to become a residential subdivision are now open for hiking, picnicking and dog walking. 
 The land has been added to a city park called Clatsop Butte. It sold for $4.4 million when the market collapsed, down from its estimated worth of $5 million a few months earlier.
 In many cases, the preservation deals are negotiated with banks that have foreclosed on property and are eager to get bad assets off the books.
 Bill Eshenbaugh, a real estate broker in Florida who goes by the promotional moniker the Dirt Dog, said the trusts' endowments often allowed them to pay cash, which banks now require in such cases.
 In 2009, ''we did over $60 million in land deals, and not one penny financed,'' Mr. Eshenbaugh said. ''It was all cash. The trusts can come up with the cash, and cash is what it's all about.''
 Still, while the trusts see more opportunities, they have also been taking in fewer donations since the economic downturn. Local and state governments enlisted to cover part of a purchase or to maintain donated land are usually struggling as well.
 Keith Fountain, director of land acquisition for the Florida chapter of the nonprofit Nature Conservancy, which focuses on preserving large swaths of undeveloped land to protect ecosystems, said the past year's offerings were the best in the 17 years he had pursued properties, among them 500,000 acres that protect rivers feeding the Everglades. 
 But this year, for the first time in two decades, shortfalls led the State of Florida not to budget its annual $300 million for land conservation. Previously, the conservancy had put together deals and the state put up the cash. As a result, Mr. Fountain said, the conservancy has had to pass up some gems. 
 When a preservation purchase succeeds, not every municipality is necessarily happy. Towns may mourn the loss of development that could have generated revenue. 
 Officials in Albemarle County, Va., for example, are frustrated that Forest Lodge L.L.C., a local developer that had permits to build 3,100 houses and apartments on 800 acres of meadows and forest, gave that land and 400 acres more to the state for a park this week in return for tax credits.
 Supervisors had anticipated $38 million in commitments for public improvements from Forest Lodge. What is more, said Dennis Rooker, a member of the board of supervisors, the county spent more than $200,000 in staff time to hammer out that plan.
 But in the long run, said Mr. Rogers of the Trust for Public Land, even developers recognize that newly protected lands can have a positive effect on real estate prices. 
 ''Developers have long seen that conserved land next to a development adds value,'' he said. ''There are genuine economic benefits for everyone that will come out of this.''

HEADLINE: As Tourism and Advertising Slide, Company Struggles to Stay Aloft

BYLINE: By GREGORY DICUM

 BODY:
At high noon on Oct. 25, 2008, the zeppelin Eureka glided over the Golden Gate Bridge, around San Francisco's waterfront, and then south to land lightly at Moffett Field in Mountain View -- the first dirigible to grace the region's skies since the days when Silicon Valley was more famous for its peaches than for its personal computers. 
 Alexandra Hall, the co-founder and chief executive of Airship Ventures, had hoped to make rigid-bodied dirigibles a regular presence in the Bay Area skies once again, ferrying well-heeled tourists on $495 rides above San Francisco Bay, conducting atmospheric experiments and serving as a flying billboard.
But thanks to the recession that began around the time of that maiden launching, Ms. Hall is now trying to figure out how to stay in business, let alone proceed with her plans to expand the zeppelin fleet. 
 ''I don't think we could have picked a worse time to launch a luxury tourism business,'' said Ms. Hall, an astrophysicist and the former head of the Chabot Space and Science Center in Oakland.
 In the first year of operations, Ms. Hall has had to contend with severe contractions in both the company's core sectors -- tourism and advertising -- while doing something nobody has done in more than 70 years: flying a zeppelin in American skies.
 The Eureka, a Zeppelin NT, one of only three in the world, cost about $15 million and took 18 months to build. It is a reminder of the airships that once flew regularly from the Naval Air Station at Moffett Field. The Navy's last rigid dirigible, the Macon, went down in bad weather off Point Sur in 1935. The Navy also flew blimps -- smaller non-rigid aircraft -- from Moffett Field until 1947, when jets supplanted them for offshore surveillance.
 The idea of updating the decades-old technology of rigid airships appealed to Ms. Hall and her husband and co-founder of the company, Brian Hall, who had already started a software company that he still runs. On a trip to Germany, Mr. Hall was surprised and delighted to find that the company Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik had already done it.
 That company was founded by Ferdinand von Zeppelin, the inventor of the rigid dirigible, and grew into a multibillion-euro supplier of construction equipment. In the 1980s, Zeppelin decided to build an updated, semi-rigid version of its flagship called the Zeppelin NT, for ''new technology.'' The first one flew in 1997. 
 Unlike the infamous Hindenburg -- whose hydrogen gas exploded in flames in 1937 at Lakehurst, N.J., killing 36 people and ending the commercial zeppelin business in the United States -- the Eureka is held aloft by inert helium gas. Other modern improvements in the Zeppelin NT include carbon fiber struts, computerized helium management, fly-by-wire controls and custom-designed swiveling engines. 
 At 246 feet long, the Eureka would be dwarfed by the 803-foot Hindenburg, yet it is among the largest objects in the skies today, longer than any passenger jet. The Goodyear Blimp ''Spirit of America'' is 192 feet long.
 The Halls turned to Silicon Valley to raise money, planning to earn revenues through ticket sales, advertising, and scientific and other special missions. The pair eventually raised $12 million, which included money Mr. Hall had earned from his other company, cash from the sale of Ms. Hall's Oakland home and money from four outside investors. Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik provided lease financing.
 Then Ms. Hall scored another coup: she was able to convince the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which currently operates Moffett Field, to keep the Eureka there. The Macon had been housed in Hangar One, the massive grey dome that still looms above the Spanish-style buildings of the main base and is a well-known landmark in the largely uninspiring Silicon Valley landscape. Airship Ventures pays $6,000 a month for part of Hangar Two, which was once home to a squadron of blimps.
 The Bay Area seemed ideal for all three of the company's planned revenue streams. According to census data, one in 10 Bay Area jobs was related to tourism in 2007; the Outdoor Advertising Association of America says the region is the fourth-biggest outdoor advertising market in the country; and the area is home to several big research institutions, including NASA.
 But the timing was atrocious. In the past year, tourism expenditures across the region have declined sharply. According to a new report from PKF, a hospitality industry consulting firm, San Francisco lodging revenues in 2009 declined by about 20 percent from 2008. 
 John duGan, who has operated a helicopter tour company called Bay Aerial for the past decade, said his business was easily down 50 percent. ''Things fell off a cliff,'' Mr. duGan said. 
 Advertising, which Airship Ventures had hoped would yield a quarter of its revenues, has fared no better. Nationwide, outdoor advertising was down 17 percent in the first nine months of the year. Advertising spending over all was down more than 10 percent, and most forecasts do not predict recovery until 2011 at the earliest, especially for expensive placements like the zeppelin. Typical deals using the Eureka start at $250,000 a month, and the ship has flown just two major placements in its first year. 
 Airship Ventures originally expected to earn 60 percent of revenues through ticket sales, but Ms. Hall said the share had ended up being much higher due to the weak advertising and stronger-than-expected demand for private charters. Bay Area residents have also been surprisingly eager to fly -- about 80 percent of the zeppelin's customers are from the region -- cushioning the balance sheet somewhat from the worldwide decline in tourism.
 Most of the 12 seats are filled on each flight, and the company has nearly $750,000 in advance bookings -- an indication of future demand but, under state law, money it cannot touch until passengers actually fly. 
 The flight experience is remarkably casual. The pilots sit in the same space as the passengers. The cabin is reminiscent of a comfortable business jet, but with huge picture windows, some of which open. ''We encourage people to get 'Zep head,' '' Mr. Hall said, ''like a dog sticking its head out of the window of a car.'' (The airship typically cruises at half its top speed of 60 knots, or about 70 miles per hour.)
 The Eureka's motion is stable and smooth, said Brian Kusler, who recently spent nearly a thousand dollars on a pair of tickets for an hourlong flight above San Francisco to celebrate his partner's 40th birthday. ''It was a little scary leaning out the window,'' he said, ''but now I'm hooked.'' 
 Some of the slack demand from tourists and advertisers may be picked up by special missions, which have been growing faster than expected, Ms. Hall said. This fall, the Eureka flew a scientific mission for NASA above the salt ponds in the South Bay. The craft is also slated to hover above the big waves at Mavericks, near Santa Cruz, when the annual surfing competition takes place in the coming weeks.
 For now, the Eureka typically flies five days a week rather than the planned seven, and some of this winter's flights are being operated from Long Beach, where the weather is more reliably friendly.
 So far, Airship Ventures has avoided any layoffs or pay cuts among its staff of 38, which includes two pilots. But in order to stay aloft, it has had to return to its investors for additional financing, and its original plan to order two more Zeppelin NTs -- one for special missions and one for the East Coast -- has been delayed. 
 ''We can continue to ride this out for some time yet,'' Ms. Hall said, ''but not indefinitely.''

 WALLACE RONEY QUINTET (Sunday) ''Jazz'' (HighNote), the most recent release by the trumpeter Wallace Roney, documents a fierce and free-spirited postbop band, a version of which he leads here, with Antoine Roney (his brother) on saxophones, Aruan Ortiz on keyboards, Rashaan Carter on bass and Kush Abadey on drums. At 10:30 p.m., Le Poisson Rouge, 158 Bleecker Street, near Thompson Street, Greenwich Village , (212) 796-0741, lepoissonrouge.com; $15 in advance, $18 on Sunday, free for members. (Chinen)20091231
 JOSH ROSEMAN'S EXTENDED CONSTELLATIONS (Friday) Mr. Roseman is a trombonist given to emphatic solo commentary, but he also enjoys the immersive depths of a large ensemble. This one includes the trumpeters Shane Endsley and Taylor Haskins; the trombonists Curtis Hasselbring and Ryan Snow; the saxophonists Andrew D'Angelo and Marcus Strickland; and a rhythm section with Nir Felder on guitar, Barney McAll on keyboards, Todd Sickafoose on bass and Dan Weiss on drums.

 STRUTTIN' WITH SOME BARBECUE (Friday through Sunday) Here's an irresistible proposition, at least for devotees of meaty groove. Henry Butler, a rollicking pianist, and Donald Harrison, a powerful alto saxophonist, both hail from New Orleans, while their partners in this assembled band -- the trumpeter Sean Jones, the trombonist Wycliffe Gordon, the bassist Ben Wolfe and the drummer Ali Jackson -- have earned their familiarity with the city's native style. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan , (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $35. (Chinen)20091231
 TWO SIDES OF DON BYRON (Sunday) Jazz has many card-carrying eclectics these days, but none more self-assured than the clarinetist Don Byron, who takes a highly serious approach to his multifaceted talent. This aptly named concert will begin with a solo recital by the classical pianist Lisa Moore, who recently released ''Seven'' (Cantaloupe), a digital EP of etudes by Mr. Byron. Then out comes the composer himself, leading a shrewdly rugged combo with George Colligan on piano, Kenny Davis on bass and Billy Hart on drums. At 7 p.m., Le Poisson Rouge, 158 Bleecker Street, near Thompson Street, Greenwich Village , (212) 796-0741, lepoissonrouge.com; $15 in advance, $18 on Sunday. (Chinen)20091231
 DOUG WAMBLE (Monday) Mr. Wamble specializes in a rustic Southern sound, from the bluesy cry of his vocals to the quavering twang of his acoustic guitar. He's a magnetic performer even by himself; in a working band like the one he leads here, with Rich Hinman on pedal-steel guitar and Jeff Hanley on bass, he can be gripping. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Bar Next Door, 129 Macdougal Street, West Village , (212) 529-5945, lalanternacaffe.com; cover, $12, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)20091231

A Call to Arms 
 From Copenhagen
Economics rather than politics will be the main driver of the fight against global warming in 2010. In 2009, the global recession had a greater impact than all the diplomatic efforts that ended in the Copenhagen flop: energy production had not declined on such a scale since 1981, according to the International Energy Agency. 
 Here are five economic reasons for the world to become slightly greener in the coming year (just a few of them could be wishful thinking). 
 First, high oil prices. Costlier crude encourages investments in alternative energy sources. Crude oil has been trading in a fairly narrow -- and reassuringly expensive -- range of $64 to $80 a barrel since June. It is not likely to fall below that level. 
 True, inventories are abundant, and in the longer term Iraqi oil is emerging from the rubble. But there are several reasons to think oil prices will hold up through 2010 and beyond. Demand growth in big emerging nations like China and India is a solid support. Downward pressure on the dollar would probably help sustain prices. And OPEC probably still has enough power to keep prices from plummeting. So while the oil price is not likely to shoot up to recession-inducing highs, it is likely to stay high enough to keep alternative energy resources profitable. 
 Second, the low price of natural gas. Cheap gas encourages utilities to build more gas-fired power plants, which are cleaner than coal-powered ones. The current gas supply glut is not likely to go away soon. Even the always-possible Russia-Ukraine row, or a colder than usual winter, probably would not be enough to raise world prices. 
 Unconventional gas production is expected to rise in the United States. That will force Qatar and other exporters of liquefied natural gas to divert exports from North America to Asia and Europe. The alternative supply should strengthen the hand of European buyers in dealing with their big supplier, Russia. 
 Third, research on, and subsidies for, clean energy continues. The wishful thinking, or reasoned optimism, may be starting here, but Western governments may at last realize that the United Nations-style approach to global warming is doomed to failure. A focus on domestic priorities would lead to more determined public efforts to encourage research in lower-carbon sources of energy, lowering their costs and making them more competitive.
 Fourth, deterrence could achieve what diplomacy could not. The mere prospect of a carbon tax on imports, which the European Union is currently debating, might help concentrate Chinese minds. The World Trade Organization has hinted such a levy would not necessarily run counter to its rules. To forestall this sort of virtuous tariff, China might come forward with serious proposals to curb its own carbon emissions. 
 Finally, carbon prices should rise again. They took a hit after the failure of the Copenhagen conference to achieve much in the way of international cooperation. But steps being taken in several major countries will help make carbon more expensive on the exchanges where emission rights are traded: for example, the cap-and-trade bill in the United States, coupled with the Obama administration's intention to consider carbon emissions as a health hazard, the British government's energy efficiency scheme or France's domestic carbon tax. 
 While these trends could make for a greener year ahead, worrying signals are accumulating for the longer term. If the International Energy Agency is to be believed, without major policy changes the world is on a path for a temperature rise of up to 6 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2100, far above the stated international goal of limiting the rise to 2 degrees Celsius. 
 Growth will resume, pushing energy demand 40 percent higher in 2030 from 2007, with nonindustrialized countries accounting for 90 percent of that increase. Demand for coal, driven by emerging countries' growing needs, will rise faster than demand for other energy sources. 
 At the same time, the financial crisis has depressed energy investment, whether in oil and gas upstream production, or power plants. In other words, by 2030 the world could face the absurd situation of having to cope both with global warming and energy shortages. Green will only prevail if the world's major powers take the Copenhagen dud as a call to arms.

HEADLINE: From Airports to Broadway, Crowds Were Thinner in '09

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The flow of tourists into New York, which has helped fuel the city's growth and stabilize its economy during the recession, fell off in 2009, according to various indicators used by the city.
 The decrease, which would be the industry's first annual decline in eight years, could be seen at the area's three major airports and at Pennsylvania Station, where traffic was down, even counting the mob that gathered for New Year's Eve festivities in Midtown. It also has affected hotels and Broadway theaters, where more rooms and seats went unsold. 
 Officials have not released the city's official year-end figures, but as recently as last summer, they had been predicting a 4.5 percent decline in visitors. And in analyzing the data used by the city in calculating tourism numbers, all of the crucial indicators have declined. 
 At the area's three major airports, for example, the number of passengers was on pace to fall to roughly 100 million for the first time since 2005, preliminary data show. 
 Attendance at Broadway shows for the current season was down 5.2 percent, and the number of delegates attending trade shows at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center was off by about 30 percent through the first nine months of the year.
 As recently as the summer of 2008, the hordes of tourists had been growing so steadily that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg moved up a self-imposed deadline for his goal of having the city draw 50 million visitors a year. He originally said that total could be reached by 2015, then accelerated the plan to 2013.
 But the recession has interrupted the mayor's vision, as businesses large and small have felt the effects of the tourism decline in 2009.
 At Souvenirs on 5th, a gift shop on West 34th Street, Carlos Flores had time to rearrange merchandise just 12 hours before the crystal ball was to begin its descent toward the throng in Times Square. The store was fully stocked with all manner of T-shirts, key chains and other keepsakes expressing a global fondness for the city and, especially, its police force and firefighters. But few were selling -- for the posted $15 or even at a haggler's discount.
 ''My boss is really suffering,'' lamented Mr. Flores, who said he lived in Astoria, Queens, and had been selling souvenirs in the city for 10 years. ''We used to work here, like, 10 guys, now it's just 3 people. This time of year, we used to work 24/7. Now there's no people. They're not spending money.''
 Mr. Flores said a rise in the number of American customers had offset some of the decline in European shoppers, but not nearly enough. 
 City officials have been reluctant to cast the city's tourism numbers in a negative light, and loath to suggest that the mayor's goal might not be met.
 Officials had been forecasting a decline in visitors to about 45 million for the year. That would represent a drop of about 2 million from the 47 million visitors the city estimated for 2008. But Christopher C. Heywood, a spokesman for NYC & Company, the city's tourism marketing arm, declined to say on Thursday whether the final estimate for 2009 would be that low. 
 Tourism officials said the drop-off had been less severe than they had feared after the financial crisis set off a global recession. The weakness of the American dollar, caused in part by the Federal Reserve's efforts to stimulate the economy with historically low interest rates, has helped lure budget travelers from overseas.
 ''We're in a very different place than we were a year ago, but I wouldn't call it a turnaround yet,'' said Emily K. Rafferty, the president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the chairwoman of NYC & Company. ''I'm certainly cautious about saying we've reached a turning point. What I am comfortable saying is that, if anything, things have stabilized to some extent.''
 In 2009, some measures of tourist activity have dropped more sharply. Through the first 10 months of the year, the number of passengers using the region's airports had dropped by almost 6 percent, to 85.6 million, according to data from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
 At that pace, the total for the year would be below 101 million for the first time in four years. The number of passengers peaked at 110 million in 2007. 
 The effect on the city's hotels has been even more pronounced. Through November, the occupancy rate for hotels in Manhattan was 80.6 percent, down from 85.5 percent in the same period of 2008, according to John A. Fox, a senior vice president at PKF Consulting in New York.
 Many more rooms surely would have gone empty if hotels had not slashed their rates. The average rate paid for Manhattan hotel rooms in 2009 was $220, about $70 lower than the previous year, according to PKF.
 ''New York City hotels have substantially recovered occupancy -- but not room rates -- from the very significant downturns that started in the fall of 2008,'' Mr. Fox said. In October and November, the city's hotels sold more rooms than they had in the same months of 2008, though still at significantly lower rates, he added.
 ''I guess I would term it cautiously optimistic that we have hit bottom,'' Mr. Fox said. But he noted that the city is still adding a large number of hotel rooms, which will make it difficult to increase occupancy or rates quickly.
 Mr. Fox said the hotel industry slump would have been worse but for the weakness of the dollar and the aggressive promotional efforts of NYC & Company, which has placed ads and marketing agents around the world.
 Ms. Rafferty said the city's hotels, restaurants, theaters and attractions had worked together to lure visitors with discounts and packages. She said that while attendance at the Met had fallen, it had exceeded expectations in 2009, in part because about one-third of its visitors were from other countries. She said her counterparts at other museums in the city had reported similar results.
 Ms. Rafferty also hinted that despite the recession, the final numbers recorded for 2009 might not be far below the 2008 total, or far off pace to reach the mayor's goal on schedule.
 ''I would say we're pleased, thrilled by 2009,'' she said. ''We go into 2010 thinking it was a job well done.''

HEADLINE: Chinese New Year

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
It's the season when pundits traditionally make predictions about the year ahead. Mine concerns international economics: I predict that 2010 will be the year of China. And not in a good way.
 Actually, the biggest problems with China involve climate change. But today I want to focus on currency policy.
 China has become a major financial and trade power. But it doesn't act like other big economies. Instead, it follows a mercantilist policy, keeping its trade surplus artificially high. And in today's depressed world, that policy is, to put it bluntly, predatory. 
 Here's how it works: Unlike the dollar, the euro or the yen, whose values fluctuate freely, China's currency is pegged by official policy at about 6.8 yuan to the dollar. At this exchange rate, Chinese manufacturing has a large cost advantage over its rivals, leading to huge trade surpluses. 
 Under normal circumstances, the inflow of dollars from those surpluses would push up the value of China's currency, unless it was offset by private investors heading the other way. And private investors are trying to get into China, not out of it. But China's government restricts capital inflows, even as it buys up dollars and parks them abroad, adding to a $2 trillion-plus hoard of foreign exchange reserves.
 This policy is good for China's export-oriented state-industrial complex, not so good for Chinese consumers. But what about the rest of us?
 In the past, China's accumulation of foreign reserves, many of which were invested in American bonds, was arguably doing us a favor by keeping interest rates low -- although what we did with those low interest rates was mainly to inflate a housing bubble. But right now the world is awash in cheap money, looking for someplace to go. Short-term interest rates are close to zero; long-term interest rates are higher, but only because investors expect the zero-rate policy to end some day. China's bond purchases make little or no difference.
 Meanwhile, that trade surplus drains much-needed demand away from a depressed world economy. My back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that for the next couple of years Chinese mercantilism may end up reducing U.S. employment by around 1.4 million jobs.
 The Chinese refuse to acknowledge the problem. Recently Wen Jiabao, the prime minister, dismissed foreign complaints: ''On one hand, you are asking for the yuan to appreciate, and on the other hand, you are taking all kinds of protectionist measures.'' Indeed: other countries are taking (modest) protectionist measures precisely because China refuses to let its currency rise. And more such measures are entirely appropriate.
 Or are they? I usually hear two reasons for not confronting China over its policies. Neither holds water.
 First, there's the claim that we can't confront the Chinese because they would wreak havoc with the U.S. economy by dumping their hoard of dollars. This is all wrong, and not just because in so doing the Chinese would inflict large losses on themselves. The larger point is that the same forces that make Chinese mercantilism so damaging right now also mean that China has little or no financial leverage. 
 Again, right now the world is awash in cheap money. So if China were to start selling dollars, there's no reason to think it would significantly raise U.S. interest rates. It would probably weaken the dollar against other currencies -- but that would be good, not bad, for U.S. competitiveness and employment. So if the Chinese do dump dollars, we should send them a thank-you note.
 Second, there's the claim that protectionism is always a bad thing, in any circumstances. If that's what you believe, however, you learned Econ 101 from the wrong people -- because when unemployment is high and the government can't restore full employment, the usual rules don't apply.
 Let me quote from a classic paper by the late Paul Samuelson, who more or less created modern economics: ''With employment less than full ... all the debunked mercantilistic arguments'' -- that is, claims that nations who subsidize their exports effectively steal jobs from other countries -- ''turn out to be valid.'' He then went on argue that persistently misaligned exchange rates create ''genuine problems for free-trade apologetics.'' The best answer to these problems is getting exchange rates back to where they ought to be. But that's exactly what China is refusing to let happen.
 The bottom line is that Chinese mercantilism is a growing problem, and the victims of that mercantilism have little to lose from a trade confrontation. So I'd urge China's government to reconsider its stubbornness. Otherwise, the very mild protectionism it's currently complaining about will be the start of something much bigger.

HEADLINE: Teahouses' Unique Blends Are Not Just in the Cup

BYLINE: By GREGORY DICUM

 BODY:
At Om Shan Tea, the air is filled with the clatter of small earthenware teapots, the sound of ethereal gongs and flutes and quiet animated conversation. Tea drinkers cluster on reed stools around low tables surrounded by antiques from tea-drinking lands.
 Oshan Anand, the owner of this year-old teahouse in the Mission district of San Francisco, sits at an antique tea table of dark wood and stone and pours tiny cups of pu-erh, the aged Chinese tea that, like wine, is often known by region and vintage. 
Om Shan Tea is the newest of a breed of Bay Area teahouses that are reimagining the world's ancient and diverse tea drinking customs for modern tea drinkers. Each is an expression of the founders' sensibilities, and each draws fervid followers.
 Samovar, in the Castro, makes tea drinking a stylish affair. Teas from around the world are served as they are in their home countries: Japanese maki bowls of rice and seaweed with ryokucha brown rice tea ($17), English tea service with scones and Devonshire cream ($19), Chinese tea with dumplings ($19) and masala chai with curry ($17). Russian tea is poured from a gleaming samovar ($9 for a bottomless cup).
 ''We bring the world's tea traditions under one roof,'' said Jesse Jacobs, who opened Samovar in 2001. ''It's contemporary and hip but also respecting tradition.''
 Visitors to Numi Tea Garden in Oakland can enjoy a tea ceremony that involves small clay pots on a bamboo tray next to a Buddha figurine and a set of tools. 
 ''You get the Buddha's belly all wet for good luck,'' said Ahmed Rahim, an owner of the Numi Organic Tea company who developed this whimsical take on traditional Chinese tea ceremonies. 
 The Bay Area loves its coffee, but there is a certain sameness to its coffeehouses. Its teahouses, though, all seem to have unusual offerings. Menus include rare teas and obscure herbs, with teatime snacks from around the world that are hearty enough to make a light meal. 
 Though many occupy spaces that used to be coffeehouses, it's too early to call tea drinking a trend that will replace espresso anytime soon. Instead, it's a parallel, calmer universe.
 When people double-park outside Samovar and run in for a cup to go, the way many are accustomed to grab lattes with one nervous eye out for a parking ticket, ''we give them a free chai sample,'' Mr. Jacobs said, ''and they go park and come back.''
 ''That's the philosophy of tea,'' he said. ''It's about stopping for one moment and taking assessment of your surroundings.'' 
 The original Samovar was so distinctive and enjoyable that the city invited Mr. Jacobs to open a branch in Yerba Buena Gardens to replace a Starbucks in 2006, and the San Francisco Zen Center asked him this year to open a teahouse in a space it owns across the street. 
 Numi Tea Garden is near the offices and warehouses of Numi Organic Tea, which Mr. Rahim founded 10 years ago with a sibling. The teahouse serves more than 80 kinds of tea and herbal teas -- everything that Numi sells, Mr. Rahim said. 
 Roy Fong, a tea importer and wholesaler, is something of a father figure to the fine-tea scene. He opened Imperial Tea Court in Chinatown in 1993 so he could serve teas that were too good for the mass market. 
 That location closed, but at locations in San Francisco's Ferry Building and Berkeley's Gourmet Ghetto, aficionados can try monkey-picked Tieguanyin Oolong or pu-erhs he has aged himself for two decades, producing a distinctive Bay Area flavor profile unlike any aged in China.
 At Imperial Tea Court, tea is served either in a lidded cup called a gaiwan ($5 or $8) or in the full Gong Fu presentation ($12), an elaborate affair that Mr. Fong and his staff are happy to explain at length. Various vessels of fine Yixing clay are brought together to produce an endless stream of tiny cups of clear, warm subtlety.
 Mr. Fong offers everything from a quick glass of custom red iced tea ($3) to the full three-hour Chinese tea ceremony ($50 a person, 10 people minimum, by appointment). Each location has a different menu of organic Chinese teahouse food that is lighter and more refined than most Chinese fare. In particular, the Berkeley location's hand-pulled Northern-Chinese-style organic noodles ($10) stand out.
 If there is anything these teahouses share, it is a feeling of hospitality and a sense of community. ''I see a lot of connections being made around the tea bar,'' said Mr. Anand of Om Shan Tea. 
 The low-key approach seems to make sense. Mr. Fong said sales had been brisk in spite of the economy. ''There has been no recession for me at all,'' he said.
 Mr. Fong is expanding on land outside the city, where he hopes to grow tea and open what he says will be his last teahouse.
 Mr. Jacobs is also upbeat, but his plans for Samovar are less grand. ''I'm just going to have tea,'' he said. ''And if I do it right, people will come to me. That's the growth plan.''
 ON THE BOIL: Here are some of the more interesting teahouses in the Bay Area: IMPERIAL TEA COURT 1511 Shattuck Avenue (Vine Street), Berkeley, (510) 540-8888; and 1 Ferry Building Plaza, San Francisco, (415) 544-9830; imperialtea.com.

HEADLINE: Asia Free-Trade Zone Raises Hopes, and Some Fears About China

BYLINE: By LIZ GOOCH

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia 

 BODY:
When the clock struck midnight on New Year's Eve, China and 10 Southeast Asian nations ushered in the world's third-largest free-trade area. While many industries are eager for tariffs to fall on things as diverse as textiles, rubber, vegetable oils and steel, a few are nervously waiting to see whether the agreement will mean boom or bust for their businesses.
 Trade between China and the 10 countries that make up the Association of Southeast Asian Nations , also known as Asean, has soared in recent years, to $192.5 billion in 2008, from $59.6 billion in 2003. The new free-trade zone, which will remove tariffs on 90 percent of traded goods, is expected to increase that commerce still more. 
 The zone ranks behind only the European Economic Area and the North American Free Trade Area in volume. It encompasses 1.9 billion people. The free-trade area is expected to help Asean countries increase exports, particularly those with commodities that resource-hungry China desperately wants.
 The China-Asean free trade area has faced less vocal opposition than the European and North American zones, perhaps because tariffs were already low and because it was unlikely to alter commerce patterns radically, analysts say. 
 However, some manufacturers in Southeast Asia are concerned that cheap Chinese goods may flood their markets, once import taxes are removed, making it more difficult for them to retain or increase local market shares. Indonesia is so worried that it plans to ask for a delay in removing tariffs from some items like steel products, textiles, petrochemicals and electronics.
 ''Not everyone in Asean sees this F.T.A. as a plus,'' said Sothirak Pou, a visiting senior research fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.
 Asean and China have gradually reduced many tariffs. However, under the free-trade agreement -- which was signed in 2002 -- China, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei will have to remove almost all tariffs in 2010.
 Asean's newest members -- Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar -- will gradually reduce tariffs in coming years and must eliminate them entirely by 2015. 
 Most of the goods that will become tariff-free in January -- including manufactured items -- are currently subject to import taxes of about 5 percent. Some agricultural products and parts for motor vehicles and heavy machinery will still face tariffs in 2010, but those will gradually be phased out.
 In recent years, China has overtaken the United States to become Asean's third-largest trading partner after Japan and the European Union. The overall trade balance has shifted slightly in China's favor, although there are significant differences among Southeast Asian countries' trade balances, said Thomas Kaegi, head of macroeconomic research for the Asia-Pacific region at UBS Wealth Management.
 Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand have only small trade deficits with China, while Vietnam's has grown substantially. In 2008, Vietnam exported items worth $4.5 billion to China but imported about $15.7 billion worth of Chinese goods. 
 In Indonesia, the textile and steel industries are particularly nervous about lifting the tariffs, prompting the government to say that it would ask for a delay on some provisions. No time frame for submitting the request was given, but the Asean secretariat said it had not yet received an official request. 
 While competing with more Chinese imports may pose new challenges for Asean manufacturers, analysts say increasing their access to the 1.3 billion people of China could produce significant benefits. 
 Rodolfo C. Severino, who was secretary general of Asean from 1998 to 2002, identified Malaysia -- which already exports palm oil, rubber and natural gas to China -- as one country that might benefit the most from the removal of tariffs. 
 But nations like Vietnam that focus on the production of cheap consumer goods are more likely to be hurt, said Mr. Severino, head of the Asean Studies Center at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore. 
 Those countries may need to look for new export products and identify new niche markets, he said: ''This is the nature of competition.''
 Song Hong, an economist, expects China to import more agricultural goods, like tropical fruit, from countries like Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam when the trade area takes effect. That could hurt Chinese farmers in southern provinces like Guangxi and Yunnan, said Mr. Song, director of the trade research division at the Institute of World Economics and Politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing.
 Mr. Sothirak, who was Cambodia's minister of industry, mines and energy from 1993 to 1998, said the removal of tariffs might help increase Cambodia's agricultural exports to China. Cambodia needs to diversify its export markets because its exports to the United States and Europe have declined, he said.
 While he does not hold much hope that Cambodian textile exports would be able to compete with China's highly developed garment industry, he said he believed the free trade area might entice more Chinese garment factories to set up operations in Cambodia, where production costs and labor were cheaper.
 Pushpanathan Sundram, deputy secretary general of Asean for Asean Economic Community, acknowledged that there would be ''some costs involved'' for some countries when the free trade area took effect, but he said he believed China and Asean would ''mutually benefit.''
 Despite the expectations for increasing trade, Mr. Severino predicted that the introduction of the trade zone would not be a ''breakthrough event'' setting off a dramatic surge in commerce come January. 
 ''There are many factors that traders and investors consider, and the trend has been going this way anyway,'' he said. ''What this does is to send out good signals and show the determination of governments to make things easier.''

HEADLINE: In Senate Race, the State G.O.P. Is Digging Its Own Hole

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
James Warren is a longtime Chicago journalist and the publisher of The Chicago Reader.

 BODY:
The Republican primary for President Obama's old United States Senate seat is so consumed by closets, it should be sponsored by Bed Bath & Beyond.
 Is Representative Mark Steven Kirk, a Republican respectfully feared by the White House, gay? Amid the recession, the health care debate and wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, this question is the 800-pound pink elephant in the G.O.P. room.
It's why the Illinois Republican Party, only six years after desperately airlifting Alan Keyes from Maryland to run for the Senate against Mr. Obama, risks another act of self-immolation -- thanks to zealots on its right flank and Andy Martin, a bomb-throwing lightweight. The victim could be Mr. Kirk. 
 Mr. Martin started running radio advertisements in which he mentioned a ''solid rumor'' that Mr. Kirk was gay, as well as claiming that Ray True, the Lake County Republican leader, had said Mr. Kirk had ''surrounded himself with homosexuals.'' The mainstream news media then reported on the advertisements. 
 The same unconfirmed rumors about Mr. Kirk's sexual orientation have been regurgitated quite a bit by the ideological swamp that is the blogosphere. Then there is the right wing's overriding rage that Mr. Kirk, who represents a moderate north suburban district, supports abortion rights.
 The diehards appear to believe that anything is fair game when it comes to preventing what they deem murder. 
 Mr. Martin is the vessel of the venom. He is a frequent candidate with a history of stridently anti-Jewish comments. As a law school graduate named Anthony Martin-Trigona, he was rejected for entry to the Illinois bar due to a psychiatric finding of a ''moderately severe character defect manifested by well-documented ideation with a paranoid flavor and a grandiose character.'' 
 He was a nasty critic of Mr. Obama's presidential campaign, helping to spread the lie of his being Muslim, and was central to a Fox News Channel schlock-umentary, ''Obama and Friends: The History of Radicalism,'' hosted by Sean Hannity. Described as an ''author and journalist,'' Mr. Martin was given a national forum to assert without rebuttal that Mr. Obama trained to overthrow the government. Rarely has the emptiness of the channel's ''fair and balanced'' mantra been more vivid. 
 A Kirk spokesman said the accusation in the radio advertising was false. Mr. True concedes commenting on a radio program that unidentified Kirk staff members had a ''special orientation.'' But it's only now that Patrick Brady, the party's state chairman, has said that Mr. Martin ''will no longer be recognized as a legitimate Republican candidate by the Illinois Republican Party.''
 What took so long?
 Meanwhile, the gay-baiters don't understand why the White House wanted Lisa Madigan, the state's attorney general, to run for the Democrats. It wasn't merely doubts about the Democratic field, notably Mr. Obama's basketball buddy, Alexi Giannoulias, the state treasurer; it believed the capable Mr. Kirk is a formidable rival. 
 For sure, he has very expediently tacked to the right to win over conservatives, who dominate a statewide primary. Thus, having voted for so-called cap-and-trade legislation, he now opposes the plan to tax pollution tied to global warming.
 And the man who kept light-years away from a radioactive President George W. Bush during his last Congressional race has now lobbied for the support of Sarah Palin. So far, the gun-loving conservative Ms. Palin has stayed clear of the race.
 Mr. Kirk has been a hard-working congressman and even carried water for Democrats, notably Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago, when Mr. Kirk helped push legislation to modernize and expand O'Hare International Airport. He has lured donations from fat cats who would normally be in the Democratic fold.
 When the Republicans ran Congress, and Illinois's own J. Dennis Hastert was House speaker, Mr. Kirk was a real player. He still is. 
 His private life is his private life. If he is keeping a dark secret, he is not being an obvious hypocrite. Mr. Kirk, who is divorced, voted against a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage and supported legislation to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 
 He may be the Republican Party's strongest candidate for statewide office in years. His tactical error might be seeking the allegiance of folks in the same swamp now trying to sully him. 
 In New York, they tend to sock you in the nose. In Washington, they stab you in the back. In Illinois, they apparently go for the groin.

HEADLINE: Mr. Bloomberg's Third Term

 BODY:
In the last 100 years, only three New York City mayors have served three terms. After spending more than $100 million to become the fourth, Michael Bloomberg boasted on election night that he would challenge the conventional wisdom, and the historical record, that third-term mayors are too tired and too jaded to serve the city or themselves terribly well.
 Mr. Bloomberg, who will be sworn in on Friday, has already accomplished a good deal and is always eager to prove the pundits wrong. This time, it will be harder. 
 The political climate is a lot less welcoming. If the mayor isn't tired, many New Yorkers are tired of him, especially after he helped overturn term limits -- a misguided but popular city law. His re-election was a squeaker, for all the money and the army of advisers. 
 Mr. Bloomberg's biggest personal challenge will be to tame his imperious nature. The city has serious problems, starting with the economy, and he will have to deliver bad news to New Yorkers in coming months. 
 That means that the mayor will have to work harder than he has in the past to rally support from the City Council (many members already see him as a lame duck). And he will have to concentrate more on rallying public support. He will need to reach out, to hold more town hall meetings, to be accessible and allow New Yorkers to give their unvarnished opinions. And when they do, he needs to listen. This is not Mr. Bloomberg's strong suit, but he will have to get better at it.
 The mayor's biggest policy challenge this year will be wrestling with a $4.1 billion deficit in his next city budget. Tax revenues are disappointing, and the state's fiscal situation is catastrophic, which means that support from Albany will only go down. 
 Next year's budget is due at the end of June, but Mr. Bloomberg wisely has already started cutting. He has targeted $550 million in savings for this fiscal year and is planning to reduce spending by $1.2 billion in the following one. New Yorkers will soon start to feel the squeeze -- with fewer new parks and playgrounds, leaner school budgets, less child care support and personnel cuts, including uniformed forces. 
 As a businessman, the mayor has the right skills to keep the $60 billion budget balanced. As a billionaire, who thrives in Manhattan's social stratosphere, he has to be especially careful about how he explains the need for sacrifices by others. He should take extra care to ensure that cuts do not weigh heaviest on the needy and make certain that struggling families and city businesses both have a decent chance to survive. It will be a tough balancing act, financially and politically.
 New York City schools are better today in many crucial ways than when Mr. Bloomberg took over. The old, ineffective Board of Education shed chancellors with dizzying frequency. After the State Legislature finally scrapped the board and gave the mayor control of the schools, he brought much-needed stability. He has also swept away the bureaucratic underbrush, strengthened the teacher corps and increased teachers' salaries.
 Shortly after the November election, the mayor directed the schools chancellor, Joel Klein, to start using student performance data to determine teacher tenure. It is a sound approach, as long as it is done carefully and fairly. That directive also sent an important signal to the teachers' unions that Mr. Bloomberg is now ready to demand more for their enhanced salaries. He also wants bad teachers out of the classroom and off the payroll. In all, the mayor's education policies have been a good thing for students, but he and his school officials still have to spend more time listening to concerned parents.
 Like all mayors, Mr. Bloomberg wants his share of monuments. He already has waterfront parks, two finished stadiums, a slew of high rises and tantalizing possibilities on Governors Island. Going forward, it will be hard for the public to stomach any big giveaways like Yankee Stadium, which, at the mayor's urging, got billions of dollars of support, including taxpayer-backed debt, tax breaks and the use of city parkland. 
 ''It's a time for singles, not home runs,'' said Mitchell Moss, a professor at New York University and informal adviser to the mayor. Mr. Bloomberg should use his business acumen to push for more developments with housing for moderate-income residents and public workers. The next time some bigwig wants a stadium or a fat new zoning change, the mayor should take care to demand more parks and public facilities as part of the deal. The bottom line for any development should be that it helps out more than the developer's bottom line.
 Given his history -- the anti-smoking campaign, the advances against trans fats and the calorie counts in restaurants -- Mayor Bloomberg can be expected to aim in the right direction on health care. Other areas worthy of more focus are asthma, obesity and diabetes. 
 The environment is a tougher climb. The latest report on air quality from the city's health department is especially alarming: it showed unhealthy levels of pollution in high-population areas throughout the city. Mr. Bloomberg should revive his fight in Albany for some form of congestion pricing. 
 Cars are a big problem, but so are all of those buildings spewing black smoke. The Council approved an initiative that helps move toward Mr. Bloomberg's goal of cutting 30 percent of the city's carbon output by 2030. But it only requires large buildings to audit their energy use, not upgrade the equipment if they find problems. The hope is that once they see the numbers, owners will decide to invest in improvements to save both energy and money. That may work. But if the economy improves for real estate, the mayor should revive his idea of requiring owners to do what is needed to clear the air. 
 We have confidence in Mr. Bloomberg. He is a smart leader with sound priorities. The next four years will test his political skills -- his ability to work with a State Legislature that would try anyone's patience and Washington politicians who take more money from the city than they give back. Most of all, he will have to persuade all New Yorkers that, even in a time of sacrifices, he is truly on their side.

HEADLINE: Paris, Milan, Tokyo. Tokyo?

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI; Moshe Komata contributed to this report.

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Japan's trailblazers of street fashion are the envy of Western designers, spawning Web sites filled with snapshots of Tokyo youngsters in the latest distressed jeans or psychedelic stockings.
 With city sidewalks as their catwalks, young Japanese flaunt carefully layered tops and thigh-high boots sporting labels like Galaxxxy, Phenomenon and Function Junction.
 But most of Tokyo's clothing designers have not figured out how to cash in on the city's fashion sense. Only a handful of Japanese brands, like A Bathing Ape or Evisu Jeans, have gained traction beyond the nation's shores. Chic local labels like Fur Fur and Garcia Marquez Gauche remain mostly unknown outside Japan. 
 Experts say that the nation's fashion industry is too fragmented and too focused on the domestic market to make it overseas.
 ''For much of this decade, fashion trends have started in Japan and gone global. But Japanese brands don't even realize that,'' said Loic Bizel, a French-born fashion consultant based in Tokyo. Japan ''generates trends and ideas, but it stops there,'' he said. ''Many brands are not even interested in going overseas.''
 So each season, Mr. Bizel takes fashion industry buyers from America and Europe -- mass clothiers like Hennes & Mauritz of Sweden and Topshop of Britain -- to buy up bagfuls of the latest hits. The designs are then whisked overseas to be reworked, resized, stitched together and sold under Western labels.
 In that business model, there is little financial gain for Japan. In 2008, Japan's clothing and apparel-related exports came to a mere $416 million, dwarfed by the $3.68 billion exported by American apparel companies, and a tiny fraction of China's $113 billion.
 Meanwhile, Japan's domestic apparel industry is on the decline. It shrank 1.3 percent, to 4.37 trillion yen ($48 billion), in 2008, and is expected to post a steeper decline for 2009 as recession-weary consumers and an aging population cut back sharply on spending.
 ''Japanese fashion might be considered cutting-edge, but overseas markets have been largely elusive,'' said Atsushi Izu, an analyst at the Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo. ''Japan's fashion industry is very fragmented, and most companies lack the resources and know-how to bring their brands to foreign markets.'' 
 The government is trying to help. Earlier this year, the Foreign Ministry dispatched a group of suit-clad officials to Tokyo's hip Harajuku neighborhood to survey the latest trends, part of an effort to promote Japanese fashion overseas. After interviews with shoppers and sales clerks, the ministry came up with a battle plan: to appoint three young trendsetters as ''ambassadors'' of Japanese chic, charged with extending the industry's reach overseas and piquing interest in Japanese brands.
 One ambassador, Misako Aoki -- a model known in Tokyo for her Lolita look of frilly Rococo-inspired dresses paired with platform shoes -- has been dispatched to France, Spain, Russia and Brazil, where she has attended expos and hosted fashion talk shows in her trademark floppy bow tie and frilly smock. 
 ''I hope that Lolita fashion and Japanese fashion in general will raise your interest in Japan,'' Ms. Aoki said in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in November after starring in a Lolita fashion show organized by the Japanese embassy. (Although Lolita style is a reference to the Vladimir Nabokov novel ''Lolita,'' its look is more covered-up Victorian schoolgirl than skin-baring teenage vixen.)
 The trade ministry has also helped revamp the twice-yearly Tokyo Collection and started inviting foreign journalists to come on the government's dime. For the first time this year, the collection, renamed Japan Fashion Week, sponsored a splinter fashion event in New York to showcase Japanese designers, and it has planned another runway show in New York in mid-February.
 ''Japanese fashion has so much global potential,'' says Kenjiro Monji, director general of the Foreign Ministry's Public Diplomacy Department, who oversees Japan's cultural push overseas. 
 But the government's efforts have won it few fans in the fashion industry. Besides Ms. Aoki, the two other fashion ambassadors chosen by the government are a woman who likes to dress up in cute high school uniforms and another who mixes and matches secondhand clothes. Promoting such niche tastes does little to help the wider fashion industry, many say. 
 And Japan Fashion Week remains a relative nonevent filled with relatively obscure designers like Motonari Ono and Kazuhiro Takakura. Ambitious young designers hoping to follow in the footsteps of Japanese greats like Issey Miyake, Yohji Yamamoto and Rei Kawakubo may have to do what they did: pass over Tokyo's shows for those in Paris.
 Meanwhile, local favorites like Fur Fur -- a new brand that mixes airy cotton frocks with distressed trench coats -- have neither the expertise nor the resources to market overseas. Despite rave reviews from industry insiders, it has only one small store in Tokyo.
 ''Of course, taking my brand overseas is a dream,'' said Fur Fur's designer, Aya Furuhashi. ''But to be honest, that's really beyond us right now.''
 What Japan's fashion industry needs is more concrete help in marketing and setting up shop overseas, experts say. The government could also play a larger role helping Japanese labels protect their intellectual property rights, they say. 
 There are some promising signs. With government support, the start-up Xavel, which runs fashion shows that let women order outfits in real time using their cellphones, has opened shows in Paris and Beijing.
 Fast Retailing, which sells the Uniqlo brand, has also been flexing its muscles overseas. Uniqlo, Japan's answer to Gap, has roots in suburban outlets and does not have the level of respect among young fashion fans that many of Japan's hipper brands do. But with ample funds and aggressive pricing on its fleece jackets and shirts, Uniqlo has expanded, with 92 stores worldwide. 
 Tadashi Yanai, chief executive of Fast Retailing, has said he hopes to build it into the world's biggest apparel company, with sales of 5 trillion yen in 2020. 
 ''We are part of a global economy,'' Mr. Yanai said at a recent forum. ''We cannot look inward.''

HEADLINE: Steady Savers Still Came Out Ahead

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
It was the age of zeroes, the epoch of naughts, an era when we started with something and added just about nothing.
 At least that's what stock market commentators have been gravely telling us for at least a year. The 2000s, they argue, was a lost decade. And at first glance, they appear to have gotten it exactly right. 
 If you invested $100,000 on Jan. 1, 2000, in the Vanguard index fund that tracks the Standard & Poor's 500, you would have ended up with $89,072 by mid-December of 2009. Adjust that for inflation by putting it in January 2000 dollars and you're left with $69,114.
 But that is not how most real people invest. They don't pour everything they have into just one type of asset and then add nothing to it for 10 years. Instead, they buy stocks of all sorts, and bonds and perhaps other things, too. And many millions of them dutifully add more money regularly, usually into a retirement account that they won't touch for longer than a decade. 
 For those people, it was not a lost decade at all. Even those who started with a low six-figure balance could have doubled their total savings in the last 10 years.
 How? Consider a few decade-long scenarios that I asked Vanguard to run using its low-cost index mutual funds. In each, we assumed that the money was in a tax-deferred account and that the account owner reinvested any dividends.
 First of all, even people who put all of their money in stocks rarely invest only in the big American names that make up the S.& P. 500. 
 So say you put $50,000 in the much broader Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund at the beginning of the decade. Then, for exposure to equities outside the United States, you put another $50,000 into Vanguard's Total International Stock Index Fund.
 As of mid-December, your $100,000 would have grown to $109,334, though that is just $84,921 when you take inflation into account. Still pretty dismal, though it shows the importance of diversification even within a broad category like stocks. 
 Now, consider a much more realistic scenario, with 50 percent of the money in bonds. If the decade begins with $25,000 in each of the domestic and international stock funds and $50,000 in Vanguard's Total Bond Market Index Fund, you end it with $145,619, or $112,971 in 2000 dollars. 
 That's how retirees, with a fairly aggressive 50 percent chunk of the portfolio in stocks, might have fared if they had been hoarding some investments while living mostly off Social Security and a pension or annuity. (For those who were spending down a portfolio with this aggressive allocation, there is no salve except the hope that what they have left will continue to bounce back.)
 But if you're not yet retired, you were probably adding money to your portfolio throughout the decade. Let's say you started with the same $100,000 and the identical 25/25/50 asset allocation from the previous scenario. Now, imagine that you added $1,000 a month and then rebalanced your account annually so that you began each new year with that original allocation.
 The result? You ended up with $313,747, or $260,102 in January 2000 dollars. Hardly a lost decade at all.
 Your own balance may be much different from this. But if you're moderately affluent, reasonably diligent and began the decade in your 30s or 40s (or were a bit older and got a late start in getting serious about retirement savings), this scenario won't be that far off. 
 It's easier to hit that $1,000 monthly saving if you have an employer matching some of your contributions. And consistent saving depends in large part on avoiding unemployment, which hasn't been easy. 
 Even if your income continues uninterrupted, you can't lose your nerve either. Plenty of people take their money out of stocks and put it into cash when the stock market falls. Then, they don't put it back in until long after the recovery begins. 
 This can cost you whole percentage points in annual returns, which add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars over a lifetime. Indeed, investors in the hot fund of the moment will often earn returns way lower than the fund's ads proclaim, though Vanguard index fund investors tend to be more of the slow and steady type. 
 And it's that lifetime that's important. The recent focus on the past decade's performance is misguided for all sorts of reasons. 
 First of all, 10 years is not a particularly long time horizon. Retirement investors may begin saving at 22 and have money in stocks at 82. People who open 529 college savings accounts upon the birth of a child will keep them open for at least two decades and possibly longer. 
 A decade is a particularly short period of time for anyone who will need the money at the end of it. If that's the case, the majority of it probably shouldn't be in stocks in the first place, which would make the 10-year S.& P. 500 return less relevant. 
 Finally, this particular decade happened to start at an enormously overvalued moment. According to data from the Yale economist Robert J. Shiller, as of January 2000, the 10-year S.& P. 500 price-earnings ratio stood at 43.77, a month removed from its record high. 
 As a result, a lot of the lost decade hand-wringing is merely a result of this coincidence of the calendar. The 10-year performance figures may not look like such a lost decade a year or two from now, when the tally begins in 2001 or 2002 and the S.& P. 500 was at much lower levels. 
 The real danger in the lost-decade rhetoric is that it could scare people away from stocks permanently. Again, the long term is what matters to most stock investors. And according to Vanguard, the S.& P. 500's worst 45-year run, for the period ending in September 1974, produced an average annual return of 6.53 percent. 
 Many of us could live with that, but stocks may not do even that well for the next 45 years. Near the stock market's nadir in 2009, Robert D. Arnott of Research Affiliates scared a number of readers half to death by noting in an article in The Journal of Indexes that from February 1969 to February 2009, investors in 20-year Treasury bonds outperformed the S.& P. 500. 
 Stocks have since pulled ahead again, but Mr. Arnott's larger point still stands -- that the reward you're supposed to get for the added risk of investing in stocks can seem awfully elusive in some contexts.
 No one knows which asset class will outperform the others over the next 10 (or 45) years. That's why it's important to invest in more than just stocks, and why a bad stretch for certain stocks may not matter as much as it first appears. 
 Few of us have the long-term investing prowess to pick the right moment for the right stocks. But persistence has its own rewards. Savers are never losers, even if some stocks have let us all down in the short term.

HEADLINE: Telecom Company to Pay $3 Million in China Bribe Case

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
UTStarcom, an American telecommunications company, has agreed to pay $3 million in fines after United States law enforcement officials accused it of a long-running scheme to bribe officials of China and other countries with cash, travel junkets and other gifts.
 The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which both issued statements on Thursday, said that from 2002 to 2007, UTStarcom paid about $7 million for hundreds of trips by employees of China's government-owned telecommunications companies to visit the United States for ''training'' sessions that were often sightseeing vacations to Hawaii, Las Vegas and other tourist locations. 
 The company also offered jobs to the family members of clients, paid them to attend universities, secured their travel visas and arranged for a ''consultant'' to bribe a Mongolian official to win a contract, the American officials said.
 The actions appeared to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which forbids bribing foreign government officials, the officials said.
 Those officials did not say why UTStarcom and its executives were not prosecuted.
 Often, American officials choose not to prosecute because it is difficult to prove a case beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, they often opt to pressure companies to reform their operations and pay large fines.
 In a statement released on Thursday, UTStarcom said it took responsibility for the actions listed in the government complaint. A company spokesman could not be reached for comment on Thursday.
 The settlement is a window into how global companies sometimes do business in China, where bribery and corruption are widespread.
 Every year, tens of thousands of Chinese officials are arrested and accused of corruption. Many legal experts say that steering clear of bribery here has become increasingly difficult, largely because government officials control access to the country's booming economy.
 Two years ago, Lucent Technologies, the American telecommunications giant, settled a similar case with the S.E.C. after it was accused of spending $10 million from 2000 to 2003 to pay for about 1,000 employees of Chinese government-owned telecommunications companies to inspect its plants and attend training sessions. Instead, the groups traveled to Las Vegas, Disneyland, the Grand Canyon and other tourist sites.
 And just this week, China Mobile, one of China's biggest telecommunications companies, removed its vice chairman because of ''serious economic crimes.''
 For UTStarcom, which is based in Alameda, Calif., China is a crucial market. One of the company's founders is a Chinese-born American, and most of the company's operations and employees are based in China.
 UTStarcom, which sells networking and broadband equipment, has for the last decade sold large quantities of goods to three of China's biggest government-owned telecommunications companies: China Netcom, China Telecom and China Mobile.
 S.E.C. officials said employees from many of the company's big Chinese clients accepted bribes.
 Apparently eager to maintain or increase its sales, UTStarcom engaged in complex frauds to please its customers here, American officials said.
 Company executives arranged for Chinese officials and their relatives to travel to the United States and falsely recorded some of those trips as ''training sessions,'' even though no training took place, the officials said.
 The S.E.C. said there were also ''lavish gifts and all-expense-paid executive training sessions'' in the United States for customers.
 ''This was apparently a standard practice,'' said Steven D. Buchholz, a lawyer with the S.E.C.'s San Francisco office.
 Sometimes, the government said, customers were given cash allowances, and on other occasions, UTStarcom put a Chinese official's relative on the payroll, even though that person never worked at the company. The company ''paid and provided benefits to at least three of these individuals for a period of two years each as if they were real employees, even though they never worked,'' the S.E.C. said in its complaint.
 The settlement comes at a difficult time for UTStarcom. The company is suffering through a sharp downturn in sales. It lost over $185 million in the first three quarters of 2008 and recently sold one of its plants in China.

HEADLINE: In the Shadows, Day Laborers Left Homeless as Work Vanishes

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
Carlos Ruano was down to his last $50 when his landlord kicked him out in September because he could no longer pay rent. He sent the money to his wife and children in Guatemala and spent the night riding the E train, which has a nickname among his fellow day laborers in Woodside, Queens: ''hotel ambulante,'' Spanish for roving hotel.
 Mr. Ruano, 38, who had drawn his living from 69th Street and Broadway for six years, has been on the streets since. He and other hard-luck day laborers have slept wherever they can: in the emergency room at Elmhurst Hospital Center, in unfinished buildings abandoned by bankrupt developers and under bridges along the freight railroad tracks that slice through western Queens, where dirty mattresses and work boots lay on the rocky ground one recent morning. 
 ''The only reason we don't go hungry is because there are people who offer us food,'' Mr. Ruano said on a snowy Saturday as he clutched a cup of soup from a group of Pentecostals feeding day laborers at a park on Woodside Avenue. 
 With their isolation and day-to-day existence, the laborers are perhaps the most invisible and hardest-to-reach victims of the recession, advocates and city officials say. 
 No one knows for sure how many have become homeless since the downturn brought construction projects to a virtual standstill and sapped them of jobs that once paid as much as $200 a day. Most of them are illegal immigrants who may be on the streets one day and off the next, depending on their work.
 The rules of the shelter system do not suit them, they said. They might be placed too far from the job pickup site or miss curfew if a job runs too late or is too far from the shelter. 
 Afraid that their immigration status might be exposed -- outreach workers might ask for identification, though the shelters are open to everyone -- they say they would rather sleep outside. 
 ''We're still learning about this population, about their needs,'' said Robert V. Hess, the city's commissioner of homeless services.
 To the day laborers clustered on and around 69th Street from Broadway to Queens Boulevard, the downturn came on suddenly: There was work one week, and then there was not. 
 And for what little work there is, they have more competition -- from men who used to be steady hands on roofing, painting and other construction crews and men who lost their full-time jobs in restaurants, at landscaping companies and in garages. 
 With more people at the corners, day laborers said, contractors will hire whoever agrees to work for the lowest pay.
 ''We've all learned the meaning of the law of supply and demand the hard way,'' said Roberto Meneses, 48, a day laborer from Mexico who has been trying to organize his peers under a fledgling group called United Day Laborers of Woodside. 
 They have had to adapt just as fast as they had learned to install drywall and unclog pipes. One man said he spent 20 days picking apples at a farm near Buffalo in November to earn some cash. Others started to make do with one meal a day. Many are no longer able to send money home.
 Ignacio Sanchez, 50, who has a wife and three children in Mexico, said a week before Christmas that he had worked once since the beginning of the month. Rodrigo Saldana, 41, who has a wife and five children in Ecuador, said he had not worked at all last month. Both said they had spent nights sleeping on the train or by the railroad tracks. 
 ''Do you want to know what the worst part is?'' Mr. Saldana said. ''My wife says I'm lying when I tell her there's no more work in New York.'' 
 Early last month, homeless-outreach workers from the city met with organizations that serve immigrant communities to hear about their work and to ask questions: Where could they go for free immigration advice? Can an illegal immigrant who has no ID get a new one at a consulate? 
 ''There are a lot of practical issues that are very unique to the undocumented, to day laborers,'' said Valeria Treves, executive director of New Immigrant Community Empowerment in Jackson Heights, Queens, one of the groups that attended the meeting. ''But these guys also have incredible emotional needs.''
 Sipping coffee at a Colombian bakery on Roosevelt Avenue, Mr. Saldana, Mr. Sanchez and Carlos Orellana, an Ecuadorean who has worked for 14 years as a day laborer, told of the sadness of being far from their children, whom they have watched grow in pictures that come with the occasional letter from home.
 At least there was a sense of empowerment while they were able to provide for them, they said. ''We were the men of the family,'' said Mr. Orellana, 40. But now that they have no money, all they are left with is disappointment and shame, he said.
 By the railroad tracks, the ground was sprinkled with the instruments of coping: empty beer bottles, a tattered Bible, a crumpled picture of a young boy. A toy skull hovered over a mattress, dangling from a string tied to the tip of a rod, in a sight at once funny and macabre. 
 During the day, the place was empty. The only noise came from the hum of passing cars on the streets above and the rumble of the 7 train, visible in the distance.
 ''That's how we live,'' Mr. Orellana said.
 His eyes cast on the tracks beneath his feet, Mr. Sanchez interjected, ''This is no life.''

HEADLINE: South Korea's Exports Surged Last Month

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
South Korea's exports increased in December at the fastest rate in 17 months, adding to signs that the country's economy is recovering from the global recession. Overseas shipments gained 33.7 percent in December from a year earlier, to $36.2 billion, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy said Friday. That was more than the median 27.9 percent forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 10 economists. Imports rose 24 percent, to $32.9 billion, for a trade surplus of $3.3 billion. For 2009, the country's trade surplus reached a record $41 billion as imports dropped 25.8 percent while exports declined 13.8 percent, the ministry said in a statement. Exports to China, the biggest buyer of South Korean goods, surged 74.4 percent in the first 20 days of December, the ministry's report showed. Shipments to the United States rose 8.7 percent and shipments to Europe gained 49.4 percent over the same period. Shipments of semiconductors and display panel exports more than doubled last month, the government said. Petrochemical exports gained 61.1 percent.

HEADLINE: Time Warner And Fox Reach A Cable Deal

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
The News Corporation and Time Warner Cable struck a deal just in time for the Sugar Bowl.
 The two companies said Friday evening that they had agreed on new terms for a contract covering Fox stations in New York, Los Angeles, Orlando and other markets, averting a blackout of the weekend's college bowl games in millions of homes. They did not disclose the terms.
 The deal between the News Corporation and Time Warner caps weeks of sparring over the price that the cable company -- and by extension its customers -- should pay to watch Fox, ahead of an end-of-the-year contract expiration. 
 Analysts had expected that the deal would set a new high-water mark for local TV stations that want sizable subscriber fees in exchange for so-called retransmission rights.
 In tense negotiations with Time Warner Cable, Fox had demanded about a dollar a subscriber per month, far more than other stations have received. Time Warner Cable thought 30 cents was more reasonable, said people briefed on the talks who insisted on anonymity because the specifics of the talks were confidential.
 Most likely, the two companies reached a compromise on the price, but both refused to comment Friday on the figure.
 ''We're pleased that, after months of negotiations, we were able to reach a fair agreement with Time Warner Cable -- one that recognizes the value of our programming,'' said Chase Carey, the president of News Corporation, in a statement.
 Time Warner Cable's president, Glenn Britt, called it a ''reasonable deal.''
 Meanwhile, customers of another major cable operator, Cablevision, were reminded Friday of what can happen when carriage talks break down. The Food Network and HGTV were unexpectedly removed from Cablevision's lineups in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut shortly after the stroke of midnight, sending angry customers to their keyboards and phones to demand answers. Cable and satellite operators pay media firms for the right to carry channels, and those fees are reflected in customers' bills.
 Cable operators have historically resisted paying directly for the right to retransmit stations, but they have softened their stance in recent years, and some stations now receive between 10 cents and 40 cents a month per subscriber. 
 Fox asserted it deserved more. Rupert Murdoch, the News Corporation chairman, has positioned the company as a leader in ''creating an economic template for the future.'' Every cent represents millions of dollars in monthly revenue.
 Analysts say the Fox station group's aggressive stance could benefit other broadcasters. In a report last month, analysts at UBS said the current dispute was ''likely a harbinger of things to come as consumers have more alternatives to cable than ever before,'' giving programmers more leverage in negotiations.
 The big fee for Fox was part of a larger package of News Corporation channel renewals, which put cable channels like FX at similar risk of vanishing from Time Warner Cable systems, at least temporarily.
 Fee negotiations are usually conducted discreetly, and deals are often completed close to their deadlines without viewers ever knowing. But Fox's clash with Time Warner Cable broke out in public in November when the cable operator started a campaign to hold the line on programmer fee increases. 
 Some networks, it said on its Web site, ''are trying to boost their bottom line by squeezing cable TV viewers like you -- and threatening to pull the plug on popular shows if we don't roll over.''
 Networks say the fee increases are a matter of survival -- or at least are necessary to keep producing quality programming.
 Time Warner Cable representatives traveled to Los Angeles for talks with News Corporation early in the week. Under pressure from the government and from viewers to stave off a blackout, representatives for both sides met in a conference room on the Fox studio lot at 10 a.m. Pacific time on Thursday, and talks continued through Friday evening, said an executive briefed on the talks who was not authorized to speak publicly. 
 The Fox negotiators had the option to pull the plug after the contract expired early Friday morning, but they decided to keep talking. 
 On the other side, the Food Network and HGTV outage affected about 3.1 million subscribers in the New York metropolitan area on Friday. The owner of the popular channels, Scripps Networks, says it deserves more cash for them. ''The distribution rates Cablevision pays for Food and HGTV are among the lowest in the industry,'' said Kenneth W. Lowe, the chief executive of Scripps Networks Interactive. 
 According to the research firm SNL Kagan, distributors pay about 8 cents on average for Food Network and 13 cents for HGTV. Scripps was believed to be asking for about triple that amount, or roughly 25 cents for Food and 40 cents for HGTV. 
 Cablevision took a hard line in its own statement Friday, saying that it had ''no expectation of carrying'' Scripps's programming again, ''given the dramatic changes in their approach to working with distributors to reach television viewers.''
 Scripps's contracts with Time Warner Cable also expired on Dec. 31, but those two companies continued talking into the new year without an interruption in programming.

HEADLINE: For Stocks in the Developed World, It Was a Decade of Zeros

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
It was a decade that began with such promise. Stock markets in Europe and America ended the 1990s at record levels, and even bedraggled Japan was at a two-year high. ''Dow 36,000'' was on some best-seller lists.
 Instead, it became a decade that richly earned the name ''the zeros.'' For the entire developed world, that was just about the decade's total return. 
 The United States stock market lagged even that modest return. According to the MSCI indexes, which measure virtually all stock markets using consistent criteria, an investor in the American market who reinvested all dividends -- and who somehow avoided all taxes and transaction costs for the decade -- would have ended 2009 with 12 percent fewer dollars than when the decade began. That is an annual return of negative 1.3 percent.
 Even that calculation understates the sad news for stock investors. Because of inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, a 2009 dollar is worth about 78 cents in 1999 dollars.
 Over all, the developed world did manage to rise a puny 2.3 percent, or an annual rate of 0.2 percent, not enough to offset the transaction costs any investor would have faced, and far below inflation.
 Those figures are measured in dollars to assure international comparability. The dollar also weakened over the period, meaning that the apparent returns were even worse when measured in other currencies.
 Of course, things looked much worse a year ago. 
 In 2009, stock markets around the world recovered strongly after hitting bottom in late winter. For the year, the American index was up about 27 percent and the developed world rose about 31 percent.
 But it was a different story for emerging markets, which actually did emerge. When the decade began, China had the 43rd-largest stock market in the world, trailing such countries as the Philippines, Peru and Poland. At the end of the decade, its market capitalization ranked ninth in the world, having passed countries like Brazil, Spain and Italy.
 Much of that growth was the result of new issues, as China partly privatized many government-owned enterprises. But an investor in Chinese stocks over the decade would have earned more than 150 percent, or a compounded 9.7 percent.
 Among emerging markets, that return was actually a little below average. As a group, emerging markets gained about 160 percent, or 10.1 percent a year. Brazil's market grew more than 500 percent, or 20 percent a year. India climbed at an annual rate of 14.1 percent, for a total gain of more than 270 percent.
 Among the developed countries, the best performers for the decade were those that were most dependent on natural resources, whose prices generally rose, in part because of additional demand from expanding economies in emerging markets. Canada's stock market more than doubled, providing an annual return of 9.2 percent, while Australia's tripled, giving investors an annual return of 12.7 percent.
 Just as few forecasters predicted the sad performance of most developed countries, so, too, did few foresee the gains for emerging markets. In 1999, memories were fresh of the Asian currency crisis and Russian default, which scared some investors away. There was also talk of a ''digital divide,'' in which the rich countries would profit from the Internet while poorer ones could not afford the needed infrastructure.
 As it happened, the lessons of the Asian currency crisis served many emerging countries well, by encouraging them to amass large reserves of foreign currency, principally dollars. To do that, they sought to keep their currencies undervalued to encourage exports, and as a group they succeeded.
 In the United States, and to some extent Europe, the end of the technology stock bubble brought on a recession, which was worsened by the reaction to the shock of Sept. 11, 2001. The Fed responded by driving interest rates to historic lows and keeping them there longer than now appears to have been wise.
 Low interest rates stimulated consumer demand and caused Americans to buy more things, many of them imported. At the same time, the low rates, combined with a lowering of credit standards by mortgage issuers, caused home prices to soar, providing more consumer spending power as homeowners refinanced their loans and extracted equity.
 When the party stopped in America, many emerging countries were well equipped to deal with the sudden difficulty in finding loans. With large foreign currency reserves, they were lenders, not borrowers.
 The MSCI world indexes have a relatively short history, but the similar Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in the United States dates back to 1928. The decade of the zeros was the first decade ever that the S.&. P. 500 had a negative total return. Prices fell in the 1930s, but dividends moved the index narrowly into positive territory.
 Bring on the teens. Please.

HEADLINE: U.S. Reaction To Swine Flu: Apt and Lucky

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

 BODY:
Although it is too early to write the obituary for swine flu, medical experts, already assessing how the first pandemic in 40 years has been handled, have found that while luck played a part, a series of rapid but conservative decisions by federal officials worked out better than many had dared hope.
 The outbreak highlighted many national weaknesses: old, slow vaccine technology; too much reliance on foreign vaccine factories; some major hospitals pushed to their limits by a relatively mild epidemic. 
 But even given those drawbacks, ''we did a lot of things right,'' concluded Dr. Andrew T. Pavia, chairman of the pandemic flu task force of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. 
 Federal officials deserve ''at least a B-plus,'' said Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University's medical school.
 Even Dr. Peter Palese, a leading virologist at Mount Sinai Medical School, who can be a harsh critic of public policies he disagrees with, called the government's overall response ''excellent.''
 About 10,000 people had died by mid-November, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated; the pandemic seems unlikely to reach even the lower end of a forecast of 30,000 to 90,000 deaths made in August by the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology. 
 The virus and the vaccine cooperated. While the former proved highly transmissible in children, it was only rarely lethal, remained susceptible to drugs and has not thus far mutated into an unpredictable monster. Vaccine supply was a problem, but one small dose was enough. (By contrast, an experimental avian flu vaccine protected people only when it was six times as strong.) 
 For that reason, the relatively cautious decisions by the nation's medical leadership contained the pandemic with minimal disruption to the economy. 
 For example, in the early days, they ignored advice to close the Mexican border and pre-emptively shut school systems. They released part of the national Tamiflu stockpile, but did not give it to millions of healthy people prophylactically, as Britain did. They ordered vaccine made with a 50-year-old egg technology rather than experimental methods. They bought adjuvants -- chemical ''boosters'' -- that could have stretched the first 25 million vaccine doses into 100 million, but did not use them for fear of triggering a backlash among Americans made nervous by the messages of the antivaccine movement.
 To alert the public without alarming it, a stream of officials -- from doctors in the navy blue and scrambled-eggs gold of the Public Health Service to a somber President Obama in the White House -- offered updates, at least twice a week for months. 
 It is now clear that this is the least lethal modern pandemic. The flu appears to kill about one of every 2,000 people who get it, American researchers say. (British researchers found half that death rate.) By contrast, the Spanish flu of 1918 killed about 50 of every 2,000, and the 1957 and 1968 pandemics killed about 4 of every 2,000. 
 The flu has reached more than 200 countries and is still peaking in places like Eastern Europe and Russia. Even though there was no vaccine yet, it killed fewer than expected during the Southern Hemisphere's winter, June through August.
 Officials in the United States conceded that some mistakes were made. 
 For example, they could have spotted the new virus earlier if there had been better cooperation with Mexico. In late April, the United States isolated it in samples from Texas and California just as Canadian officials were testing Mexican ones. The outbreak probably began in rural Mexico in January, but was spotted only when thousands fell ill in late March or early April in Mexico City.
 The C.D.C. tests viruses in Southeast Asia, where new flus are usually born. ''This time,'' said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the C.D.C. director, ''one happened to emerge in a place where we don't have a surveillance system.''
 Also, the government predicted in early summer that it would have 160 million vaccine doses by late October. It ended up with less than 30 million, leading to a public outcry and Congressional investigations. 
 ''Imagine if they'd managed the expectations better,'' said Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. ''If they'd said, 'We won't have any till December,' and had some in October, they would have looked like heroes.''
 Robin Robinson, chief of vaccine purchasing for the Department of Health and Human Services, was the most overly optimistic. In an interview, Dr. Robinson said he had actually tried to be conservative, assuming that manufacturers would get 1.4 doses per egg, when they typically got two or more.
 Until the eggs could be tested in August, ''we didn't know that we had one of the poorest-producing viruses in the last 50 years,'' he said. Good batches had 0.6 doses per egg, he said, bad ones had 0.2.
 If he had it to do over again, he said, ''I'd factor in the worst-case scenario -- which was 2009.''
 Another controversial decision -- sending a few early vaccine doses to Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs and Citibank -- was more of a bad public relations move than a bad public health one, experts said. That choice was made by the New York City Health Department, ''and we made the decision not to second-guess local health authorities,'' Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of health and human services, said in an interview.
 The government allotted vaccine to states based on population size. Some local health officials had thousands line up in parking lots for shots, some sent teams into schools and some relied on private doctors.
 Distribution of the vaccine could have been focused more precisely, experts said, directing it to hospitals first, or to doctors treating children and pregnant women, or to cities with big outbreaks. 
 ''I still think sending it out on a per capita basis was the fairest and most equitable way,'' Ms. Sebelius said. 
 The early combination of fears about the vaccine and anger over shortages, said Dr. Paul Offit, chief of infectious diseases at Children Hospital of Philadelphia, reminded him of an old Borscht Belt joke: ''The food at this resort is so terrible,'' one patron complains. ''Yes,'' agrees her companion. ''And such small portions!''
 One real triumph, several experts said, was how little damage misinformation did. In 1976, many people refused shots after three elderly Pittsburgh residents died shortly after getting theirs; it took the C.D.C. five days to explain that it was just a coincidence. 
 This time, many rumors arose but were quickly debunked: That thousands had died in Mexico. That the virus had circulated in the Midwest for a decade, undetected. That it had escaped from a laboratory. That seasonal flu shots made catching swine flu more likely. That flu shots did not work or caused autism. That the administration would make them mandatory. That Tamiflu resistance was widespread in Northern California. That a flu shot had disabled a Washington Redskins cheerleader, or that she was cured by chelation therapy by a doctor associated with the antivaccine movement. That mutant killer flu strains were circulating in Argentina or Ukraine or North Carolina. 
 The debunking succeeded, Dr. Osterholm said, ''despite the fact that there are many fewer reporters who understand medical issues than there used to be.''
 This time, both the C.D.C. and the World Health Organization responded quickly to almost every rumor. At the epidemic's height, they held several news conferences a week, taking questions by phone from all over the world.
 They also invited dozens of reporters to daylong seminars on influenza at C.D.C. headquarters in Atlanta and to exercises around the country led by the former anchorman Forrest Sawyer, at which they debated, for example, whether a miscarriage by one woman after getting a flu shot was a big scoop or a nonstory. 
 Remaining to be seen is what effect the pandemic has had on Americans' feelings about vaccines.
 Dr. Frieden said he thought a victory over the antivaccine movement had been scored. Nearly 60 million people have been vaccinated, including many pregnant women and children, with no surge in side effects. 
 John P. Moore, an AIDS researcher at Weill Cornell Medical College, was less sure. Dr. Moore, who spent years fighting AIDS denialism, has called skepticism about flu vaccine ''an unholy alliance of the left and right'' because it joined the liberal natural-medicine proponents with anti-big-government conservatives.
 ''It's hard to say if it hurt or helped,'' Dr. Moore said, pointing out that polls still show a large minority of Americans rejecting the vaccine. ''As with AIDS, people have to die before others understand the consequences of ignoring science-based medicine.''

HEADLINE: The Art of the Deal

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI. 
Judith H. Dobrzynski, a former reporter and editor at The Times, is a writer.

 BODY:
THE squeeze is on. Museums everywhere are having trouble making ends meet, what with the overblown expansions they've made, the decline in investment income and the steep drop-off in contributions from foundations and individuals. Many have cut staff, frozen pay, trimmed exhibition schedules and slowed or stopped acquisitions. For some, that may not be enough: the American Folk Art Museum, to cite one example, recently admitted that it isn't making debt payments.
 What's next? In some corners, there's fear that museum officials will do what is absolutely forbidden by art-world rules: raise operating cash with a sale of artwork. Already some respected figures -- David Gordon, former head of the Milwaukee Art Museum, and Richard Armstrong, director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, for example -- are saying that the rule against selling art for any purpose other than buying more art is wrong. 
 But the mere mention of art sales for operating money turns some purists purple with apoplexy, and could restart the uproar that occurred last year when Brandeis University bruited but backtracked from the idea of selling works from its Rose Art Museum, eventually prompting Jehuda Reinharz, the university president, to step down. Just before that, the National Academy Museum sold two Hudson River School paintings to pay its bills, eliciting tough sanctions from the normally hands-off Association of Art Museum Directors. 
 Many people don't understand the problem. If the choice is between allowing a museum to fail (or make crippling cutbacks) and selling some art, what's the big deal? Sell art! Most museums, after all, hold many works they have no room to display and stuff them into back rooms and off-site storage facilities. If museums are allowed to cull their collections to raise money to buy more art, why can't they sell those very same pieces to solve their financial problems?
 The big deal is this: The strict constructionists believe that once selling art to cover operating costs is allowed, it will become the first resort in bad times, not the last. 
 On that score, they may be right. It's human nature to test the line and, having gotten away with something, to do it again. Some museum trustees and other large donors are themselves stretched, relatively speaking, by this recession and can't or won't increase their gifts. Yet no one knows when the economy will restore investment portfolios and bank accounts to their previous health. The money has to come from somewhere. 
 Maybe it's best to amend the unwritten sales ban, but not end it. What if a museum had to argue its case for de-accessioning art before an impartial arbitrator? 
 This neutral party would need to be schooled in art, art law and nonprofit regulations. 
 Moreover, the museum would need to open its financial books completely, so that the arbitrator could see that all other reasonable avenues of fund-raising, as well as cutbacks, had already been exhausted. And it would need to open its cataloguing records and storerooms, to show that the departure of the works in question would not irreparably damage the collection and that no donor agreements would be violated. 
 Most important, as part of any deal permitting the sale of art, the de-accessioning museum would have to offer the works to other museums first. If it received no offers, it could sell the pieces via a public auction -- and any American museum would then have the opportunity to match a winning bid if it promised to keep the work in a public collection. 
 Who would administer this system? There's no regulatory agency for art museums. For large museums, the Association of Art Museum Directors could step up to the plate. For university museums, the Association of College and University Museums and Galleries could do the job. Likewise, the American Association of Museums, which accredits a larger spectrum of museums, might need to play a role. Each would hire professional arbitrators when necessary. 
 If those groups wouldn't do the job, it could fall to a state agency, a charities bureau or the attorney general's office, whichever oversees nonprofits. 
 Museums' money troubles are unlikely to disappear soon. And until they do, de-accessioning shouldn't be impossible -- just nearly so.

HEADLINE: A Nation of Do-It-Yourself Lawyers

BYLINE: By JOHN T. BRODERICK Jr. and RONALD M. GEORGE. 
John T. Broderick Jr. is the chief justice of New Hampshire. Ronald M. George is the chief justice of California.

 BODY:
AMERICA'S courts are built on a system of rules and procedures that assume that almost everyone who comes to court has a lawyer. Unfortunately, the reality is quite different. An increasing number of civil cases go forward without lawyers. Litigants who cannot afford a lawyer, and either do not qualify for legal aid or are unable to have a lawyer assigned to them because of dwindling budgets, are on their own -- pro se. What's more, they're often on their own in cases involving life-altering situations like divorce, child custody and loss of shelter. 
 As the economy has worsened, the ranks of the self-represented poor have expanded. In a recent informal study conducted by the Self-Represented Litigation Network, about half the judges who responded reported a greater number of pro se litigants as a result of the economic crisis. Unrepresented litigants now also include many in the middle class and small-business owners who unexpectedly find themselves in distress and without sufficient resources to pay for the legal assistance they need. 
 As judges, we believe more needs to be done to meet this growing challenge: an inaccessible, overburdened justice system serves none of us well. California took a major step forward in October when it became the first state to recognize as a goal the right to counsel in certain civil cases. (The state also committed to a pilot project, financed by court fees, to provide lawyers for low-income citizens in cases where basic human needs are at stake.) 
 But this is only a beginning. It is essential that we promote other efforts to close the ''justice gap.'' 
 One such effort involves the ''unbundling'' of legal services. Forty-one states, including California and New Hampshire, have adopted a model rule drafted by the American Bar Association, or similar provisions, which allow lawyers to unbundle their services and take only part of a case, a cost-saving practice known as ''limited-scope representation'' that, with proper ethical safeguards, is responsive to new realities. 
 Traditionally, lawyers have been required to stay with a case from beginning to end, unless a court has excused them from this obligation. Now, in those states that explicitly or implicitly allow unbundling, people or businesses can hire a lawyer on a limited basis to help them fill out forms, to prepare documents, to coach them on how to present in court or to appear in court for one or two hearings. 
 For example, a lawyer could advise a client in a divorce proceeding about legal principles governing the division of marital assets or provide assistance in calculating child-support obligations. A lawyer might also draft pleadings or legal memos or provide representation at a hearing to obtain a domestic-violence restraining order. 
 What could be wrong with this? Well, some lawyers have expressed concern that limited legal representation will encourage litigants to dissect their cases in an effort to save money, sacrificing quality representation that the litigant might otherwise be able to afford. We have also heard the argument that by offering too much assistance to self-represented litigants, the courts themselves are undermining the value of lawyers and the legal profession. Apparently, some are concerned that the court system will become so user-friendly that there will be no need for lawyers. 
 We respectfully disagree. Litigants who can afford the services of a lawyer will continue to use one until a case or problem is resolved. Lawyers make a difference and clients know that. But for those whose only option is to go it alone, at least some limited, affordable time with a lawyer is a valuable option we should all encourage. 
 In fact, we believe that limited-scope-representation rules will allow lawyers -- especially sole practitioners -- to service people who might otherwise have never sought legal assistance. We also believe that carefully drafted ethical rules allowing lawyers to handle part of a case give the legal profession an opportunity to help the courts address the ever-growing number of litigants who cross our thresholds. This cause has special relevance now as state courts are faced with serious cutbacks in financing, forcing some to close their doors one day a week or a month, lay off front-line staff members and delay jury trials. None of this bodes well for the judicial system or for those seeking to vindicate their rights through the courts, whether they have a lawyer or not. 
 We need members of the legal profession to join with us, as many have done, in meeting this challenge by making unbundled legal services and other innovative solutions -- like self-help Web sites, online assistance programs and court self-help centers -- work for all who need them. If we are to maintain public trust and confidence in the courts, we must keep faith with our founding principles and our core belief in equal justice under the law.

PERSON: James L. Goddard 

HEADLINE: James L. Goddard, Crusading F.D.A. Leader, Dies at 86

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Dr. James L. Goddard, who as a brash, crusading commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration in the 1960s helped revolutionize the federal government's methods of evaluating drugs, died Dec. 18 in Laguna Woods, Calif. He was 86.
 His son, Bruce, said the cause was a brain hemorrhage. 
 From 1966 to 1968, Dr. Goddard, serving under President Lyndon B. Johnson, strove to put the F.D.A. on a sounder scientific footing to better serve the consumer. He cracked down on exaggerated drug advertising and delayed approval of new drug applications until manufacturers had backed them up with more laboratory and clinical testing. And he campaigned to take ineffective drugs off the market.
 The New York Times Magazine called him ''a wild-eyed crusader with a battle-ax flailing boldly.''
 Several months after he assumed leadership of the agency, Dr. Goddard spoke to pharmaceutical executives and suggested that many were dishonest in their applications for new drugs. He threatened that the industry might be ''altered beyond your present fear.''
 ''If this sounds alarming,'' he said, ''it is because, frankly, I am alarmed.''
 Historians and journalists say the effect was to push the F.D.A. into a new era.
 ''James Goddard marks the demarcation between the old F.D.A. -- that had no MDs, no strong standards of evidence and largely subservient relations with the pharmaceutical industry -- and the new F.D.A. that was headed by an energetic doctor, enforced strong standards of evidence and became an advocate for the public's health,'' said one journalist, Philip J. Hilts.
 Mr. Hilts, author of ''Protecting America's Health: The F.D.A., Business and One Hundred Years of Regulation'' (University of North Carolina, 2003), called Dr. Goddard one of the three or four best commissioners in the history of the agency.
 Fran Hawthorne, author of ''Inside the F.D.A.: The Business and Politics Behind the Drugs We Take and the Food We Eat'' (Wiley, 2005) said in an interview Thursday that before Dr. Goddard, the first physician to lead the agency in a generation, the F.D.A. was ''small and toothless.'' Ms. Hawthorne said he ''brought the F.D.A. into the modern age.''
 In one instance Dr. Goddard wrote and put into effect legislation calling for drugs to be tested for efficacy as well as for safety. The law, enacted by Congress in 1962, mandated scientific testing of all new drugs to see if they worked, as well as testing of drugs introduced before 1962 for both safety and efficacy. He contracted the National Academy of Sciences to review 4,000 already-introduced drugs.
 Dr. Goddard banned 250 antibiotic preparations, particularly throat lozenges, from the market because drug makers had not proved their effectiveness. He started an investigation of possible criminal violations in the testing of new drugs.
 He also longed to test drugs against one another to make sure that any new drug functioned better than ones already approved. For political and economic reasons, Mr. Hilts said, the proposal never gained traction.
 James Lee Goddard was born on April 24, 1923 in Alliance, Ohio, served in the Army during World War II and completed his medical degree at George Washington University in 1949. After a brief stint in private medical practice, he joined the Public Health Service in 1951, interrupting this work to earn a master's degree in public health from Harvard in 1955.
 In the latter half of the 1950s, he studied automobile safety for New York State and the federal government, doing research that helped buttress the push for mandatory seatbelts. He moved on to the Federal Aviation Agency, where as medical director he did research that resulted in the compulsory retirement age of 60 for pilots.
 In 1962, he was named assistant surgeon general and chief of the Communicable Disease Center (now the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) in Atlanta. At 39, he was its youngest chief ever. 
 In August 1965, John W. Gardner, secretary of health, education and welfare, set up an advisory committee to reorganize the F.D.A., where morale was low. He decided that Dr. Goddard should lead the way. Dr. Goddard accepted, even though he had made it clear that he wanted to be surgeon general.
 Dr. Goddard quickly buoyed the agency, Science magazine said in June 1966. ''He has apparently created a spirit not unlike that of the early days of the Peace Corps or the poverty program,'' the magazine wrote, ''drawing on people who recognize the hardships but want to be in on the fight.''
 Drug industry executives complained to the White House about Dr. Goddard's aggressive approach. His penchant for offhand remarks offended many and helped him with almost no one. He garnered substantial publicity by saying alcohol was probably more dangerous than marijuana.
 Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, a former pharmacist, was upset when Dr. Goddard remarked that the corner drugstore was probably a fading institution. When pharmacists offered $100,000 to the Democrats' 1968 campaign with the suggestion that Dr. Goddard was expendable, Humphrey and President Johnson were receptive, Mr. Hilts said.
 Dr. Goddard joined the pharmaceutical industry as an executive, then as a consultant. From 1970 to 1972, he directed the Ford Foundation's family planning program in India.
 Dr. Goddard's first marriage, to Mildred Miller, ended in divorce. His wife, Marjorie, died before him. In addition to his son, he is survived by his daughters Margaret Goddard and Tricia Mikle; his stepdaughter, the singer-guitarist Bonnie Raitt; his stepson, David Raitt; eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
 Dr. Goddard's brash style showed itself at the Federal Aviation Agency after he learned that no flying qualifications were required for hot-air balloon pilots. He applied for and got a license, and even made a few balloon flights. The F.A.A. soon set qualifications for balloonists.

HEADLINE: Hands Off the Watershed

 BODY:
New York City has now officially registered its ringing opposition to a proposal by state regulators to allow natural gas drilling in the watershed that supplies drinking water to more than eight million city residents. Albany should amend its proposal and put the area permanently off limits to drilling. 
 The watershed covers roughly a million acres of farms, forests, lakes and streams northwest of the city. Its subsurface rock formations contain rich deposits of natural gas and are part of a much larger geologic formation known as the Marcellus Shale, which runs northward from West Virginia into New York's southern tier. 
 The state wants to exploit this resource because it could add to the region's energy supplies and give a much-needed lift to the upstate economy. But the watershed contains just one-tenth of the state's known gas deposits. That means New York would not be giving up all that much if it does the right thing and bans drilling there.
 Last fall, Albany issued a thick set of rules intended to regulate drilling. Environmentalists and city officials immediately cautioned that while carefully regulated drilling could proceed in other parts of the state with minimal environmental damage, it would be foolish to risk the city's water supply. 
 A new report commissioned by the city, and written by scientists and engineers who specialize in gas drilling, confirms those fears. It says that the drilling process -- which is done by injecting water and chemicals at high pressure into the rock formations -- ''creates a substantial risk of chemical contamination and infrastructure damage.'' That, in turn, could force the city to build a $10 billion filtration plant and negate the sizable investment it has already made to keep the watershed clean. Mayor Michael Bloomberg is to be commended for commissioning the report and demanding a quick turnaround. 
 The good news is that the Chesapeake Energy Corporation, believed to be the largest leaseholder in the watershed, has already announced that it will not drill there. But its decision is voluntary and not binding on other companies. The only sure way to guarantee the protection of the watershed, and New York City's supply of drinking water, is to quarantine the area.

HEADLINE: To Overhaul Immigration, Advocates Alter Tactics

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
Lacing up new pairs of walking shoes with a flourish, four immigrant students set out on foot from downtown Miami on Friday, starting a four-month walk to Washington to protest what they called the Obama administration's lack of action on legislation granting legal status to illegal immigrants.
 Three of the four protesters, who are current or former students at Miami Dade College, do not have legal-resident status and risk detention by immigration authorities during the 1,500-mile walk. 
 The students' trek showed the resolve and also some limitations of groups supporting an immigration overhaul that would include measures to legalize illegal immigrants. Those groups said this week that they would start a national campaign in January to pressure President Obama to push for the overhaul before midterm elections in November. 
 But as immigration enforcement has continued at a steady pace during the first year of the Obama administration, many illegal immigrants are clinging to jobs and families in this country and may be afraid to participate in public demonstrations. With unemployment holding at 10 percent, immigrant advocates acknowledge that their campaign could awaken passionate opposition in Congress and around the country. 
 The students in Miami said in a statement that they decided to begin their walk because they had a ''deep desire and need for complete citizenship'' after they reached dead-ends in school or work because of their lack of legal immigration status. The protesters include Carlos Roa, 22, who was 2 years old when his parents brought him here from Venezuela, and Felipe Matos, 23, sent from Brazil by his mother when he was 14. They say they support proposals in overhaul bills that would open a path to citizenship for students who came to this country illegally when they were young. 
 Mr. Matos, a former student government president at Miami Dade, said he had been accepted by Duke University but had not been able to attend because his lack of legal status prevented him from getting financial aid. Trained as a teacher, he has not been able to take a job without a valid Social Security number. 
 Starting with a small but noisy send-off at noon by about 100 people on the steps of a landmark building in Miami known as the Freedom Tower, the students said they would walk about 16 miles a day, stopping to sleep at churches and immigration centers. They hope to reach Washington in May. 
 They said they had concluded that the exposure to immigration agents on the walk was not much greater than what they faced in their daily lives. 
 ''We are aware of the risk,'' Mr. Matos said by telephone. ''We are risking our future because our present is unbearable.'' 
 The case of a third student marcher, Gaby Pacheco, 24, an Ecuadorean, and her family is on appeal in immigration court. The fourth student, Juan Rodriguez, a Colombian who is 20, said he was not at risk because he became a legal resident in 2008, after 13 years in this country. 
 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials did not respond to requests by telephone and e-mail for comment on Friday. 
 Elsewhere, immigrant groups have been trying other tactics to push for reform, after an overhaul bill they supported was defeated in the Senate in 2007 by a huge surge of voter opposition. In November the groups organized a mass conference call on which, they said, more than 60,000 participants on mobile phones spoke with Representative Luis V. Gutierrez, Democrat of Illinois, to discuss an overhaul proposal. Mr. Gutierrez introduced the bill in the House last month. 
 In California, where hundreds of thousands of immigrants joined demonstrations in 2006, advocacy groups have shifted their focus, said Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. Now the groups are working to send immigrants who are voters to pay frequent visits to federal lawmakers who have not supported an overhaul.
 The Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, a group in Chicago, is preparing rallies for mid-January with labor unions and African-American churches, hoping to persuade American workers that immigrants would be less likely to undercut wages if they had legal status and could participate openly in unions.
 Republican lawmakers said they remained confident that they could defeat any overhaul proposal. They said it would be political folly for the Obama administration to propose a huge legalization program for illegal immigrants when so many Americans are out of work.
 ''Allowing millions of illegal immigrants to stay and take jobs away from citizens and legal immigrants is like giving a burglar a key to the house,'' said Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, the senior Republican on the House Judiciary Committee.

HEADLINE: In Humble Tones for Third Term, Mayor Says His Job Is to Listen

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN; Nate Schweber contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Michael R. Bloomberg on Friday became only the fourth mayor in New York City history to take office for a third term, striving in his inaugural address to repair damage caused by his campaign to overturn term limits and to make clear that his administration would not run out of ideas.
 Through his first eight years, Mr. Bloomberg was hardly known for introspection, much less humility. But on Friday, he sought to strike a more conciliatory tone. As he stood on a dais set atop the steps of City Hall, he said, ''The building behind me is yours, and the job in front of me is to listen and to lead.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's tone suggested an acknowledgment of the resentment many New Yorkers expressed over the way he spent more than $102 million -- a record-shattering amount -- to win by a surprisingly small margin in November. 
 ''I recognize -- I understand -- that this term is a special opportunity,'' he said. 
 Mr. Bloomberg, who at 67 looks grayer and thinner than when he first entered politics not long after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, seemed to speak as much to history as he did to an audience estimated at 2,500.
 In the most overt effort to show that his administration would strive to remain creative, he declared that the top deputy in every agency would spend three weeks in another agency -- an idea that he said he had adopted at the financial services firm he founded, Bloomberg L.P. The deputies would then report directly to Mr. Bloomberg ''to break down the bureaucratic barriers that all too often impede innovation, compromise customer service and cost taxpayers money.''
 ''This is not a game of musical chairs,'' he said. ''This is a management challenge, and a unique opportunity for collaboration and innovation.'' And, he added, ''As I tell everyone I hire, don't screw it up.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's idea was applauded, at first blush, by some people who have had no difficulty criticizing his policies. These include Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, and Councilman Robert Jackson, who represents a district in Upper Manhattan.
 ''I hope it's not a gimmick,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''I think it's a bold step in the right direction. He has to take the bold initiatives in order not to be a lame-duck third-term mayor. If they truly make real recommendations and not be afraid, then they're doing their jobs.''
 Mr. Bloomberg shared the stage with the city's new comptroller, John C. Liu, the first Asian-American to win citywide office, and the new public advocate, Bill de Blasio. Two former mayors, Edward I. Koch, the last to hold a third term, and David N. Dinkins, were also on hand, as were members of Congress, legislators and local officials.
 While Mr. Bloomberg touched on a number of issues, from schools to the middle class, and spoke the words ''innovation'' and ''fresh'' more than a dozen times, he offered no specific proposals to tackle problems, simply vowing to disprove conventional wisdom about third terms being devoid of energy.
 His address capped a day that was deliberately much more understated and self-conscious than his previous two inaugural celebrations. There was, for instance, no traditional post-inaugural party. Nor did the mayor approach the stage in a grand red-carpet fashion. Instead, he walked out from behind a blue curtain from inside City Hall. 
 And arguably the only celebrity in sight was none other than the mayor himself. In previous years, the inauguration included stars like Liza Minnelli, Bette Midler, Wynton Marsalis and Barbara Walters. This time, the mayor tapped six students from Newcomers High School in Long Island City, Queens, all immigrants, to preside over the ceremonies.
 The mayor even began his day by donning a black turtleneck sweater that read ''I NYC,'' and helping to prepare green beans and slice onions at a Brooklyn soup kitchen. It was part of a daylong effort to promote a service campaign in the city.
 Mr. Bloomberg later traveled to Staten Island's borough hall to assemble care packages for soldiers; to Long Island City to sort donated supplies for schools and cultural groups; then to Hunts Point, in the Bronx, to help paint a mural at a recreation center.
 At the inauguration, which began about 12:15 p.m., Mr. Bloomberg was preceded by Mr. Liu and Mr. de Blasio, both Democrats who are widely viewed as potential mayoral contenders in 2013. Mr. Bloomberg is an independent who ran on the Republican line in November.
 When it was Mr. Bloomberg's turn to recite the oath of office, he was flanked by his daughters, Emma and Georgina, and his companion, Diana L. Taylor. His mother, Charlotte, who turns 101 Saturday, did not make the inauguration for the first time, but he planned to return home to the Boston area on Saturday to visit her. Mr. Bloomberg's speech lasted just under 14 minutes -- the shortest of his three inaugural addresses -- and was delivered under gray skies but in relatively warm weather given the season. 
 He promised to push for comprehensive immigration reform, in a manner similar to his efforts to battle illegal guns nationwide.
 ''With leaders from across the country, we will assemble a bipartisan coalition to support President Obama's call for comprehensive immigration reform that honors our history, upholds our values and promotes our economy,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. At his service stop in the Bronx, Mr. Bloomberg was more blunt, calling people who want to curb immigration ''stupid.'' Mr. Bloomberg also promised to establish a new service for small businesses to ''get the answers and services they need, all in one place,'' to spur entrepreneurship.
 One issue that Mr. Bloomberg did not address in great detail was the economy, even though he cited his expertise in financial matters as a rationale for his controversial decision in 2008 to push to overturn term limits.
 Then again, his aides also note that Mr. Bloomberg is expected to reveal more substantive proposals in his State of the City address in a few weeks. Several weeks after that, he is expected to unveil his budget proposal for the fiscal year beginning in July, in which the city faces a multibillion-dollar deficit, high rates of home foreclosures and a 10 percent unemployment rate.
 But, as is customary with such addresses, Mr. Bloomberg closed on an optimistic, and more self-effacing, note, saying, ''No matter where you live and work, no matter what your race or roots, no matter who you love, who you worship, or who you voted for, I pledge to be your mayor.''

HEADLINE: Clintons Release 2009 Donor List for Ex-President's Charitable Foundation

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Foreign countries, including Norway and Oman, have contributed to former President Bill Clinton's charity, and donors including Donald Trump, the Coca-Cola Company and the Elton John AIDS Foundation pitched in as Hillary Rodham Clinton served her first year as secretary of state in 2009. 
 A donor list released Friday by the William J. Clinton Foundation shows that in all, Norway has given $10 million to $25 million to the charity since its founding roughly a decade ago. Oman gave $1 million to $5 million. The list gave only cumulative ranges rather than precise donations and did not say how much each contributor gave last year.
 The Clintons agreed to disclose the names of donors to the foundation annually to address concerns about potential conflicts of interest between the former president's fund-raising efforts abroad and Mrs. Clinton's role in helping to direct Obama administration foreign policy.
 President Obama made the disclosure a condition of his selection of Mrs. Clinton for the post. When the first list was released in December 2008, the two senior lawmakers on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, said the disclosure was ''designed to establish greater transparency and predictability with regard to the activities of the Clinton Foundation in the context of Senator Clinton's service as secretary of state.''
 The William J. Clinton Foundation works in the United States and around the world on issues like climate change, economic development and health care, particularly H.I.V. and AIDS. It also runs the Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock, Ark., which includes Mr. Clinton's presidential library.
 Last year's donors included the Saudi Arabian businessman Nasser al-Rashid, who has given at least $1 million to the foundation; professional golf's PGA Tour Inc., which donated $50,001 to $100,000 over all; and Mr. Trump, who has given $50,001 to $100,000 over all.
 Several foreign governments that appeared in the foundation's first disclosure in 2008 did not give last year.

HEADLINE: GOLF: Tiger Slam, Tiger Effect, Then Scandal

BYLINE: By LARRY DORMAN

 BODY:
The major professional golf circuits each ended the decade with significant shake-ups that could alter the competitive landscape. The two very different events occurred outside the competitive arena: the fall from grace of the PGA Tour superstar Tiger Woods and the replacing of the ousted L.P.G.A. commissioner, Carolyn Bivens, with Michael Whan.
 The L.P.G.A. desperately needs to compete for sponsorship dollars in a tight economy, and Whan, a successful entrepreneur with strong ties to the tight-knit golf community, has impressed insiders with his savvy and charm. Those commodities were in short supply during the Bivens regime, which was marked by loss of sponsors and contentious relationships with longtime constituents. 
 The L.P.G.A. enters 2010 with a strong hand. Although Annika Sorenstam, its career money leader, is happily in retirement, the four-year domination of Lorena Ochoa is now challenged by a strong Korean contingent led by Jiyai Shin. After a long wait, Michelle Wie has emerged as a legitimate contender.
 Conversely, for the first time in its long reign as the gold standard of sponsor-based sports organizations, the PGA Tour has seen the image of one of its squeaky-clean athletes tarnished by a sex scandal that has cost Woods multimillion-dollar endorsement deals with major corporations. 
 The long-term effect on the tour from Woods's loss of sponsorships, if any, will probably not become evident for years. But the effect on Woods will be apparent when he resumes competition because all discussions about the past decade in golf -- landmark events, singular performances, notable achievements -- must begin and end with him.
 Lost in the reverberating noise about Woods's affairs was his decade of unsurpassed golf excellence, which began 10 summers ago on the Monterey Peninsula, where he carved his magnum opus on the Pebble Beach Golf Links. Measured against history, Woods's win at the centennial United States Open by a still-shocking 15-stroke margin will not likely be eclipsed. 
 Woods, 34, is in what should be the prime of a golf career that was just beginning to soar into the stratosphere at the turn-of-the-century Open. Viewed through the prism of today, 2000 almost takes on sepia tones, like grainy black-and-white photos in a fraying album. Then, the only controversy concerned Woods's decision to play a practice round rather than attend a ceremony for the 1999 Open champion, Payne Stewart, who was killed in a plane crash four months after his victory.
 Woods said he did not want to interrupt his regular routine. Though a few players rolled their eyes, no one criticized his decision when Sunday rolled around. Not even Woods's ear-burning, obscenity-laced diatribe after a drive onto the rocks at the 18th hole Saturday could detract from what he had done.
 With his baggy golf shirts flapping in the wind, Woods went around Pebble Beach like a man in a trance. He did not three-putt a single green. He made a triple-bogey, but barely changed the expression on his face. 
 At one point in the Saturday broadcast, when Woods pulled off another impossible shot from the rough, an NBC broadcaster said, almost plaintively, ''It's just not a fair fight.''
 It was not. Woods was the only golfer in the field to break par. He shattered the previous record for margin of victory in an Open, set in 1899, by four strokes. To comprehend the magnitude of a 15-stroke margin, it helps to know that the average United States Open margin of victory, starting with the first Open in 1895 through the 2009 event, was 1.789 stokes, which includes Woods's 15-stroke win.
 Padraig Harrington neatly summed up the reaction of Woods's peers to the accomplishment.
 ''I looked at the scoreboard in total wonderment,'' he told Sports Illustrated.
 The United States Golf Association records that Woods tied or broke at Pebble Beach included largest lead after 36 holes (six strokes); lowest 36-hole score (134, tied with Jack Nicklaus, T. C. Chen and Lee Janzen); largest 54-hole lead (10); lowest 72-hole score (272, tied with Nicklaus and Janzen); most strokes under par (12, tied with Gil Morgan, who reached that total in the third round in 1992 but finished tied for 13th); and largest margin of victory.
 He followed up the win at Pebble Beach with an eight-stroke victory at the British Open at St. Andrews. He also won the P.G.A. Championship and, when he added the 2001 Masters, held all four major championship titles simultaneously. He called that the Tiger Slam. It also may be as close as anyone comes to winning the modern Grand Slam.
 Woods won 56 PGA Tour events from 2000 to 2009 and another 8 worldwide. He won 12 of his 14 major championships. 
 It was a 10-year run that was, for sheer volume of wins, unlike any in the history of the sport, and it all began when he was 24 and just starting to demonstrate the difference between him and everyone else. 
 At the second major championship of the first decade of the new millennium, Woods set a record that seemed destined to stand alongside Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak as a record that will outlive him. Nothing that had happened before, nothing that has happened since and nothing that will happen in the future is likely to change that.

HEADLINE: U.S. Loan Effort Is Seen As Adding To Housing Woes

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

 BODY:
The Obama administration's $75 billion program to protect homeowners from foreclosure has been widely pronounced a disappointment, and some economists and real estate experts now contend it has done more harm than good.
 Since President Obama announced the program in February, it has lowered mortgage payments on a trial basis for hundreds of thousands of people but has largely failed to provide permanent relief. Critics increasingly argue that the program, Making Home Affordable, has raised false hopes among people who simply cannot afford their homes. 
 As a result, desperate homeowners have sent payments to banks in often-futile efforts to keep their homes, which some see as wasting dollars they could have saved in preparation for moving to cheaper rental residences. Some borrowers have seen their credit tarnished while falsely assuming that loan modifications involved no negative reports to credit agencies. 
 Some experts argue the program has impeded economic recovery by delaying a wrenching yet cleansing process through which borrowers give up unaffordable homes and banks fully reckon with their disastrous bets on real estate, enabling money to flow more freely through the financial system. 
 ''The choice we appear to be making is trying to modify our way out of this, which has the effect of lengthening the crisis,'' said Kevin Katari, managing member of Watershed Asset Management, a San Francisco-based hedge fund. ''We have simply slowed the foreclosure pipeline, with people staying in houses they are ultimately not going to be able to afford anyway.''
 Mr. Katari contends that banks have been using temporary loan modifications under the Obama plan as justification to avoid an honest accounting of the mortgage losses still on their books. Only after banks are forced to acknowledge losses and the real estate market absorbs a now pent-up surge of foreclosed properties will housing prices drop to levels at which enough Americans can afford to buy, he argues.
 ''Then the carpenters can go back to work,'' Mr. Katari said. ''The roofers can go back to work, and we start building housing again. If this drips out over the next few years, that whole sector of the economy isn't going to recover.'' 
 The Treasury Department publicly maintains that its program is on track. ''The program is meeting its intended goal of providing immediate relief to homeowners across the country,'' a department spokeswoman, Meg Reilly, wrote in an e-mail message.
 But behind the scenes, Treasury officials appear to have concluded that growing numbers of delinquent borrowers simply lack enough income to afford their homes and must be eased out. 
 In late November, with scant public disclosure, the Treasury Department started the Foreclosure Alternatives Program, through which it will encourage arrangements that result in distressed borrowers surrendering their homes. The program will pay incentives to mortgage companies that allow homeowners to sell properties for less than they owe on their mortgages -- short sales, in real estate parlance. The government will also pay incentives to mortgage companies that allow delinquent borrowers to hand over their deeds in lieu of foreclosing. 
 Ms. Reilly, the Treasury spokeswoman, said the foreclosure alternatives program did not represent a new policy. ''We have said from the start that modifications will not be the solution for all homeowners and will not solve the housing crisis alone,'' Ms. Reilly said by e-mail. ''This has always been a multi-pronged effort.''
 Whatever the merits of its plans, the administration has clearly failed to reverse the foreclosure crisis.
 In 2008, more than 1.7 million homes were ''lost'' through foreclosures, short sales or deeds in lieu of foreclosure, according to Moody'sEconomy.com. Last year, more than two million homes were lost, and Economy.com expects that this year's number will swell to 2.4 million.
 ''I don't think there's any way for Treasury to tweak their plan, or to cajole, pressure or entice servicers to do more to address the crisis,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com. ''For some folks, it is doing more harm than good, because ultimately, at the end of the day, they are going back into the foreclosure morass.''
 Mr. Zandi argues that the administration needs a new initiative that attacks a primary source of foreclosures: the roughly 15 million American homeowners who are underwater, meaning they owe the bank more than their home is worth. 
 Increasingly, such borrowers are inclined to walk away and accept foreclosure, rather than continuing to make payments on properties in which they own no equity. A paper by researchers at the Amherst Securities Group suggests that being underwater ''is a far more important predictor of defaults than unemployment.'' 
 From its inception, the Obama plan has drawn criticism for failing to compel banks to write down the size of outstanding mortgage balances, which would restore equity for underwater borrowers, giving them greater incentive to make payments. A vast majority of modifications merely decrease monthly payments by lowering the interest rate.
 Mr. Zandi proposes that the Treasury Department push banks to write down some loan balances by reimbursing the companies for their losses. He pointedly rejects the notion that government ought to get out of the way and let foreclosures work their way through the market, saying that course risks a surge of foreclosures and declining house prices that could pull the economy back into recession.
 ''We want to overwhelm this problem,'' he said. ''If we do go back into recession, it will be very difficult to get out.''
 Under the current program, the government provides cash incentives to mortgage companies that lower monthly payments for borrowers facing hardships. The Treasury Department set a goal of three to four million permanent loan modifications by 2012.
 ''That's overly optimistic at this stage,'' said Richard H. Neiman, the superintendent of banks for New York State and an appointee to the Congressional Oversight Panel, a body created to keep tabs on taxpayer bailout funds. ''There's a great deal of frustration and disappointment.''
 As of mid-December, some 759,000 homeowners had received loan modifications on a trial basis typically lasting three to five months. But only about 31,000 had received permanent modifications -- a step that requires borrowers to make timely trial payments and submit paperwork verifying their financial situation.
 The government has pressured mortgage companies to move faster. Still, it argues that trial modifications are themselves a considerable help.
 ''Almost three-quarters of a million Americans now are benefiting from modification programs that reduce their monthly payments dramatically, on average $550 a month,'' Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said last month at a hearing before the Congressional Oversight Panel. ''That is a meaningful amount of support.''
 But mortgage experts and lawyers who represent borrowers facing foreclosure argue that recipients of trial loan modifications often wind up worse off.
 In Lakeland, Fla., Jaimie S. Smith, 29, called her mortgage company, then Washington Mutual, in October 2008, when she realized she would get a smaller bonus from her employer, a furniture company, threatening her ability to continue the $1,250 monthly mortgage payments on her three-bedroom house.
 In April, Chase, which had taken over Washington Mutual, lowered her payment to $1,033.62 in a trial that was supposed to last three months. 
 Ms. Smith made all three payments on time and submitted required documents, Chase confirms. She called the bank almost weekly to inquire about a permanent loan modification. Each time, she says, Chase told her to continue making trial payments and await word on a permanent modification.
 Then, in October, a startling legal notice arrived in the mail: Chase had foreclosed on her house and sold it at auction for $100. (The purchaser? Chase.)
 ''I cried,'' she said. ''I was hysterical. I bawled my eyes out.''
 Later that week came another letter from Chase: ''Congratulations on qualifying for a Making Home Affordable loan modification!'' 
 When Ms. Smith frantically called the bank to try to overturn the sale, she was told that the house was no longer hers. Chase would not tell her how long she could remain there, she says. She feared the sheriff would show up at her door with eviction papers, or that she would return home to find her belongings piled on the curb. So Ms. Smith anxiously set about looking for a new place to live. 
 She had been planning to continue an online graduate school program in supply chain management, and she had about $4,000 in borrowed funds to pay tuition. She scrapped her studies and used the money to pay the security deposit and first month's rent on an apartment.
 Later, she hired a lawyer, who is seeking compensation from Chase. A judge later vacated the sale. Chase is still offering to make her loan modification permanent, but Ms. Smith has already moved out and is conflicted about what to do.
 ''I could have just walked away,'' said Ms. Smith. ''If they had said, 'We can't work with you,' I'd have said: 'What are my options? Short sale?' None of this would have happened. God knows, I never would have wanted to go through this. I'd still be in grad school. I would not have paid all that money to them. I could have saved that money.''
 A Chase spokeswoman, Christine Holevas, confirmed that the bank mistakenly foreclosed on Ms. Smith's house and sold it at the same time it was extending the loan modification offer.
 ''There was a systems glitch,'' Ms. Holevas said. ''We are sorry that an error happened. We're trying very hard to do what we can to keep folks in their homes. We are dealing with many, many individuals.''
 Many borrowers complain they were told by mortgage companies their credit would not be damaged by accepting a loan modification, only to discover otherwise. 
 In a telephone conference with reporters, Jack Schakett, Bank of America's credit loss mitigation executive, confirmed that even borrowers who were current before agreeing to loan modifications and who then made timely payments were reported to credit rating agencies as making only partial payments.
 The biggest source of concern remains the growing numbers of underwater borrowers -- now about one-third of all American homeowners with mortgages, according to Economy.com. The Obama administration clearly grasped the threat as it created its program, yet opted not to focus on writing down loan balances.
 ''This is a conscious choice we made, not to start with principal reduction,'' Mr. Geithner told the Congressional Oversight Panel. ''We thought it would be dramatically more expensive for the American taxpayer, harder to justify, create much greater risk of unfairness.''
 Mr. Geithner's explanation did not satisfy the panel's chairwoman, Elizabeth Warren.
 ''Are we creating a program in which we're talking about potentially spending $75 billion to try to modify people into mortgages that will reduce the number of foreclosures in the short term, but just kick the can down the road?'' she asked, raising the prospect ''that we'll be looking at an economy with elevated mortgage foreclosures not just for a year or two, but for many years. How do you deal with that problem, Mr. Secretary?''
 A good question, Mr. Geithner conceded.
 ''What to do about it,'' he said. ''That's a hard thing.''

HEADLINE: On Your Left, Another Relic of the Bust

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

DATELINE: CAPE CORAL, Fla. 

 BODY:
 FELLOW adventurers, refugees from winter and armchair archaeologists, we are here on this shiny green tour bus to embark on a safari of sorts. We'll be exploring the local habitat, as upended and reconfigured by an epochal real estate fiasco.
 Our guide, Marc Joseph, stalks wildlife of the white-elephant variety. A real estate agent, he specializes in houses that proved financially disastrous for someone -- the banker, the homeowner, the American taxpayer, often all three. Mr. Joseph's bus is emblazoned with red letters spelling the name of this thrill ride: ForeclosureToursRUs.com.
 As we navigate this speculator's paradise turned financial wasteland, Mr. Joseph stands at the front of the bus in a green polo shirt, highlighting specimens like this one: a white stucco house fronted by palm trees and topped by a Spanish tile roof on a canal emptying into the Gulf of Mexico. It last sold in 2005 for $850,000. Yours today for $273,000. 
 ''How much cheaper does it have to go before you say, 'Well, that's just craziness,' '' Mr. Joseph beseeches as our tour group -- mostly retirees from up North, basking in Bermuda shorts on another December day stolen from winter -- examines the swimming pool and the Jacuzzi. ''I'm telling you now, your opportunity is banging at your door.''
 Yes, it has come to this in Cape Coral, a reluctant symbol for the excesses of the great American real estate bubble: foreclosed homes served up as tourist attraction. The struggles and pain that produced this ecosystem are neatly masked by the newly installed granite countertops, pristine carpets and fresh coats of paint that now ornament many properties on the tour.
 I am on the bus because, two years earlier, I spent a week here looking at the myriad ways in which plunging home prices were undermining the American dream. Cape Coral and the Fort Myers metropolitan area were confronting an especially potent cauldron of troubles. Unemployment was soaring, and tax revenue was plunging, forcing cuts in government services and intensifying anxiety. 
 Now I am back to see what has happened.
 The dominant pursuit of the moment here is cleaning up The Mess left behind by the era of easy money. The Mess is found in the glut of vacant commercial spaces; in the local unemployment rate, now pushing 14 percent; and in the discarded furniture at curbside and the overgrown front lawns left by some of those relinquishing their homes to foreclosure.
 ''We've been at the epicenter of this,'' says Frank Cassidy, a retired Los Angeles police officer who heads Cape Coral's code enforcement division, which carts away much of the detritus. ''We're the front line on blight.''
 He lays out a satellite map showing the city of Cape Coral, a thumb-shape expanse jutting into the gulf. It shows 64,571 single-family homes. Each one touched by foreclosure over the last three years is marked red, as if the city were stricken with a rash: 18,575 red dots pockmark the map. 
 Kristy Clifton -- at 30, the youngest member of the code enforcement team -- patrols northwestern Cape Coral in her white Ford Taurus, summoning colleagues to help with the latest clean-out.
 This is not work for the squeamish. Some people depart in a rage, leaving graffiti on living room walls (profane suggestions about how bankers might rearrange their anatomy), mounds of trash, dirty diapers, even piles of human excrement.
 ''It's pretty gross,'' says Ms. Clifton. 
 As she gathers the artifacts of lives gone wrong and deposits them into Dumpsters, she wonders what happened. ''People can just up and leave, and it seems like they leave their whole lives behind,'' she says. ''Army medals. Photo albums. Framed photos of children. Cribs. Toys. I don't know if they don't have anywhere to go or anywhere to put this stuff. But you'd think that pictures of your kids you'd take.''
 THE MESS is the product of The Story, the fable that waterfront living beyond winter's reach exerts such a powerful pull that it justifies almost any price for housing. The Story propelled the orgy of borrowing, investing and flipping that dominated life here and in other places where January doesn't include a snow blower. 
 The Story lost its magic amid the realization that speculators had simply been selling to other speculators, making the real estate market look like a Ponzi scheme. The ensuing crash was breathtaking. By the winter of 2007, median housing prices in Cape Coral and the rest of Lee County had fallen to about $215,000, down from a high of $278,000 in 2005. By October 2009, they had fallen to near $92,000. 
 Somewhere on that long, steep downhill path, what was once portrayed here as a momentary if wrenching setback seeped into the community's bones, embedding lowered expectations and fear.
 The first time I visited in 2007, James W. Browder, the Lee County schools superintendent, had recently scrapped plans to construct seven new schools. When I visited last month, he detailed how one-fourth of his elementary schools were now sending home weekly backpacks of food with students.
 ''One elementary school principal noticed parents going into schools with kids in the morning and sitting down in the cafeteria with them,'' Mr. Browder said. ''Then they noticed parents eating breakfast off kids' plates. And then they noticed parents taking scraps home.''
 In Texas, the all-consuming gauge of prosperity is the price of a barrel of oil. Here, it was once the value of a developable parcel of land. Today, it is the volume of foreclosures.
 At the end of 2007, the pace was already grim here, with foreclosures running at 1,100 a month, a more than fivefold increase from early that year, according to RealtyTrac, a real estate research firm. By late 2008, the pace had quickened again, to about 2,000 a month. 
 By the fall of 2009, foreclosures had fallen to about 1,400 a month, prompting hopes that the worst was over. But real estate agents and mortgage brokers wary of optimism are focusing on a new term that has entered the housing lexicon: ghost inventory. Banks appear to be sitting on thousands of homes caught in limbo, neither foreclosing nor receiving any payments. 
 ''We're not in a recession,'' says Bobby Mahan, an amiable broker here, describing conditions in the area. ''We're in a depression.''
 Two years ago, Mr. Mahan's office, Selling Paradise, displayed a sign that seemed unusual at the time. It invited customers to come in for a free list of available foreclosed properties. Now, nearly every surviving real estate agent seeks business with such signs. 
 Out in Lehigh Acres, a sprawling empire of cookie-cutter ranch houses, agents once worked in a strip of model properties, waiting in pristinely carpeted living rooms with plates of cookies for prospective buyers. Today, many of the models have themselves succumbed to foreclosure. Those still going are draped in banners offering foreclosure expertise.
 Prices are now so low that inventory is moving. From the beginning of last year through October, the Fort Myers metropolitan area had already had 14,000 sales of single-family homes -- more than in all of 2007 and 2008 combined. Roughly three-fourths of the deals were foreclosed homes and short sales, in which property sells for less than the bank is owed. 
 Yet about three-fourths of the buyers have been paying cash, an apparent indication that most are investors, not ordinary homeowners.
 ''That doesn't give me a lot of confidence,'' says Cape Coral's newly elected mayor, John Sullivan. ''Where are they going to sell these properties? The party's over.''
 For a select few, however, the party rages on. 
 Allen Olofson-Ring, a clean-cut, sandy-haired, Harvard-educated real estate agent from Boston, is enjoying his best year since entering the local real estate business seven years ago. He has parlayed longstanding relationships with mortgage companies -- Chase, in particular -- into the acquisition of exclusive rights to selling their foreclosed properties.
 Back in 2006, the end of the bubble, Mr. Olofson-Ring sold about 27 properties for a total value of roughly $14 million. By December, he was on pace to complete 800 deals valued at $41 million. ''These are the greatest times,'' he says.
 When he gets new listings, he visits the properties to see whether they are occupied. To get inside, he uses the tools that fill the trunk of his Nissan Altima: a power drill, specialty keys, flathead screwdrivers.
 ''It can get wild,'' he says. ''We're about to break in the house -- no, rephrase that -- gain entry, and some guy comes out half-naked and says, 'What you doing in my house, boy?' ''
 When he encounters residents, he offers them cash to vacate, from $500 to $3,000, while threatening eviction if they stay. Then, he puts the houses on the market, priced to sell.
 ''I get numb to it, I guess, because I've done so many,'' he says. ''It's a little surreal. You feel bad. It gnaws at you. At the same time, what are you going to do? Life goes on.''
 What are you going to do? This question has insinuated itself seemingly everywhere here, like a soundtrack stuck on an infinite loop. 
 Dave Robison has lived in northwest Cape Coral since 2002, when he moved down from Cincinnati, paying $160,000 for his house. He figured that he would stay until his house fetched enough to allow him to retire full time in Mexico. Now, he bitterly regrets that he didn't cash in back in 2005, when the house was worth perhaps $400,000. 
 He walks his two greyhounds past a tan stucco house on the corner, where the grass on the lawn reaches three feet high, possibly sheltering possums and snakes. An official abatement notice is tacked to the front door, ordering the owner -- someone in Reseda, Calif. -- to cut the grass. A house across the street is similarly forlorn. 
 ''You think you've got something and you don't,'' says Mr. Robison. ''There's nothing you can do but just ride it out.''
 Farther down the block, another house sits cloaked in overgrown shrubbery with yet another abatement notice tacked to the door. Two years ago at this very house, I met the two women who were then living there -- Elaine and Charlene Pellegrino -- a mother and daughter. They were sifting through the belongings of Elaine's husband, Charlene's father, who had recently died, leaving them with two troubled businesses to run and debts they couldn't manage.
 Elaine Pellegrino, then 53, was disabled, living on Social Security. Her daughter was jobless. They had resigned themselves to losing their home and had stopped making the mortgage payments. Yet they were cognizant that they could stay for many months as their case worked its way through a local court system already overwhelmed by foreclosures. 
 Now their days there have ended. Tax documents sit in a rain-matted stack in front of the garage. A ''for sale'' sign lies warped and discarded in the weeds. 
 Inside the house, bills are scattered across the floor with playing cards, a March 2008 TV Guide and the innards of a VCR. A plastic trash bag brimmed with foreclosure documents. Behind the house, green slime chokes the swimming pool -- the same green slime that now colonizes countless pools left to the elements in South Florida. 
 The Pellegrinos moved out in July 2008, Charlene explains. A bathroom pipe had burst, and mold had grown on the walls. She and her mother couldn't afford repairs.
 The strangest thing was how the bank implored them to stay, she says. Even after it became clear that they were not going to pay their mortgage, the bank figured that it would be better having them there to deter scavengers who would strip out the cabinets, the wiring, the toilets.
 ''They wanted us to stay on indefinitely,'' Charlene says. ''It was weird.''
 When the Pellegrinos left, they found an upside to the bust: the seemingly limitless array of affordable rentals. 
 After walking away from their house and its $1,500 monthly mortgage payments, they rented a nearby four-bedroom home for $950 a month. Now Charlene, earning $2,400 a month as a home health worker, has designs on moving to a better place still, for $700 a month.
 KEVIN JARRETT is also on the move, adding his own house to the growing stock of local ghost inventory. 
 Circumstances were already dire for Mr. Jarrett, a real estate agent, when I met him two years ago. He and his wife had arrived from Illinois in the mid-1990s, aggressively borrowing as they snared four properties. The peak came in the summer of 2007, when they paid $730,000 for a waterfront home in Cape Coral.
 By the end of that year, Mr. Jarrett hadn't closed a deal in months. He was falling behind on the mortgages for all four of his properties and had dropped his health insurance.
 ''Here we are, two years later, and there's no end to this,'' he says, leaning into a booth at the University Grill, a steak-and-lobster place he used to enjoy regularly during the boom years. ''I make a mean Hamburger Helper now.''
 Deals have shrunk to almost nothing. Three of his four homes have been lost to foreclosure. He remains in the place on the water in Cape Coral, though he has not made a payment in roughly two years. ''Sometimes I think they just lost my file,'' he says.
 The house is mostly empty, owing to impromptu yard sales he conducts to keep food on the table. The piano, the sofa, the coffee table, the dining room table and chairs: all gone. His living and dining rooms are devoid, save for one piece of art he cannot bear to surrender: a statuette of Don Quixote. 
 ''You know, dream the impossible dream,'' he says. ''It's just one of those little remnants to keep dreaming, because if you don't dream, you don't get anything.''
 His wife left in July 2008, he says, taking their daughter back to Illinois. (''Not having the finances to sustain the lifestyle you had is very trying on a relationship,'' he says.)
 Last winter, a repo man came for Mr. Jarrett's boat, a 22-foot Hurricane power cruiser. In the spring, he sold his beloved yellow 2001 Corvette convertible for $13,500, paying $5,300 for a used 2000 Cadillac.
 Still boyish-looking at 50 despite his graying hair, Mr. Jarrett is starting over, moving down the coast to Marco Island, where houses sell for much more than they do here. A friend is offering a place to stay. His employer, Keller Williams, promises a desk in its local office.
 He is full of gratitude, yet deeply unsettled by the reality that he is walking away from his dream home. 
 ''You're admitting failure,'' he says. ''You signed a note and now you're not paying. As a human being, you have to process this. It's as tough as going through a divorce. You promised to be with this woman, but in the end, it wasn't working. Your neighbor is paying their mortgage every month. You feel that stigma that you're a loser.''
 He mows the lawn and trims the trees, in place of the landscaping service he gave up long ago. ''I try to somewhat justify my existence here by knowing that the bank is not getting a distressed property,'' he says. 
 On a recent morning, he turned the knob on his bathroom sink to wash his hands and discovered that the water had been shut off for lack of payment.
 ''What I've learned is the strength that you can reach down and get,'' he says. ''I'm the same guy. No matter what I had, I'm the same guy.''
 THE MESS is not without its spiritual element: the cleansing power of separation from worldly possessions. Marina memberships are no longer so abundant, yet Cape Coral is enjoying a bumper harvest in these taking-stock-of-what-matters moments. 
 Michael Pfaff and his wife, Diane, still mourn the loss of the 40-foot catamaran they owned back when he was bringing in huge commissions as a mortgage broker. But they still enjoy the water, albeit from a motorized rowboat.
 ''We've been poor together, and we've been rich together,'' Mr. Pfaff says. ''It doesn't matter that much to us. We prefer to be rich, though.''
 Getting rich is a feat best accomplished here today by tapping into the inventory spawned by the unfortunate end to other people's richness. 
 This is the sort of opportunistic thinking that prompted Mr. Joseph -- our tour guide on today's foreclosure safari -- to buy a bus on Craigslist. After he bought the vehicle, which had previously been used to ferry parishioners to a Baptist church, he had it painted green, then added his new tour-company logo in red. (Another employer of the '''R' Us'' designation, Toys 'R' Us, threatened legal action to force him to find another name, Mr. Joseph tells riders on his bus. He says he has agreed to change the name in the next few months.) 
 Tanned and sinewy with sunglasses nesting in his hair, Mr. Joseph looks and sounds like the comedian Ray Romano, minus the agita. He deals primarily in houses owned by Fannie Mae, the government-backed mortgage financier. He cleans and sometimes renovates them before putting them on the market, clearing away The Mess in the service of selling an updated version of The Story.
 On a recent tour, eight potential buyers occupied the upholstered bench seats of his bus. 
 Norm Tardie, a semiretiree down from Vermont, is hunting for bargain investments. A retired heating and air-conditioning contractor from Massachusetts in a yellow Hawaiian shirt is looking for a possible vacation place. 
 Mr. Joseph indulges the classic shtick of the Florida sales pitch.
 ''Where we from?'' he asks one couple, who conveniently hail from Illinois. 
 ''How cold is it in Illinois today?'' he asks.
 Impressively cold.
 ''So we appreciate where we're at today,'' he says. ''That's the way we want you to feel when you walk into a house.''
 These prices cannot last! This is Mr. Joseph's essential message, one he expresses in a multitude of ways. ''You cannot purchase the bricks and mortar, and build a house for what they're selling for.''
 He lavishes particular attention on Paulette O'Rourke, a tan, reddish-blond retiree from Cincinnati, whose pink nails and enthusiasm make her seem game. She just bought one house here, and she likes the thought of owning another, as an investment. 
 Not unimportantly, she has cash, roughly $100,000 in retirement funds from her old hospital job.
 ''You call up your financial guy,'' Mr. Joseph is saying, adopting the tones of the liberation theologian. ''You say, 'I want to sell all my stocks and mutual funds,' and you're done. You call him up and say: 'I'm taking control. I want to buy a house in Florida.' ''
 This idea is germinating as Ms. O'Rourke admires the swimming pool and the white ceramic tile at a house that sold for $350,000 three years ago and is now on the market for $164,500.
 ''It is that opportunity,'' Mr. Joseph is saying. ''It is that time.''

HEADLINE: Ten for the Next Ten

BYLINE: By BONO

DATELINE: Dublin 

 BODY:
 IF we have overindulged in anything these past several days, it is neither holiday ham nor American football; it is Top 10 lists. We have been stuffed full of them. Even in these self-restrained pages, it has been impossible to avoid the end-of-the-decade accountings of the 10 best such-and-suches and the 10 worst fill-in-the-blanks. 
 And so, in the spirit of rock star excess, I offer yet another.
 The main difference, if it matters, is that this list looks forward, not backward. So here, then, are 10 ideas that might make the next 10 years more interesting, healthy or civil. Some are trivial, some fundamental. They have little in common with one another except that I am seized by each, and moved by its potential to change our world. 
 Intellectual Property Developers
 Caution! The only thing protecting the movie and TV industries from the fate that has befallen music and indeed the newspaper business is the size of the files. The immutable laws of bandwidth tell us we're just a few years away from being able to download an entire season of ''24'' in 24 seconds. Many will expect to get it free. 
 A decade's worth of music file-sharing and swiping has made clear that the people it hurts are the creators -- in this case, the young, fledgling songwriters who can't live off ticket and T-shirt sales like the least sympathetic among us -- and the people this reverse Robin Hooding benefits are rich service providers, whose swollen profits perfectly mirror the lost receipts of the music business.
 We're the post office, they tell us; who knows what's in the brown-paper packages? But we know from America's noble effort to stop child pornography, not to mention China's ignoble effort to suppress online dissent, that it's perfectly possible to track content. Perhaps movie moguls will succeed where musicians and their moguls have failed so far, and rally America to defend the most creative economy in the world, where music, film, TV and video games help to account for nearly 4 percent of gross domestic product. Note to self: Don't get over-rewarded rock stars on this bully pulpit, or famous actors; find the next Cole Porter, if he/she hasn't already left to write jingles.
 Return of the Automobile as a Sexual Object
 How is it that the country that made us all fall in love with the automobile has failed, with only a few exceptions, to produce a single family sedan with the style and humor and grace of the cars produced in the '40s, '50s and '60s? Put aside the question of whether those models were male (as in longer, lower and wider, Dr. Freud) or female (as in fender skirts, curvy belt lines and, of course, headlights). Either way, they all had sex appeal. (In Ireland in the '70s, it was the E-Type Jag that made sense of puberty.) Today, however, we have the mundanity of our marriage to the minivan and the S.U.V. and long-term relationships with midsize cars that are, forgive me, a little heavy in the rear cargo hold.
 Are aerodynamics to blame? Economics? Or that most American of inventions, design by committee? It hurts me to say this about democracy (and I know because my band is one), but rarely does majority rule produce something of beauty. 
 That's why the Obama administration -- while it still holds the keys to the big automakers -- ought to put some style fascists into the mix: the genius of Marc Newson ... Steve Jobs and Jonny Ive from Apple ... Frank Gehry, the architect, and Jeff Koons, the artist. Put the great industrial designers in the front seat, right along with sound financial stewardship ... the greener, the cleaner, the meaner on fossil fuels, the sexier for me. Check out the Tesla or the Fisker Karma car, designed by the same team that gave the world the Aston Martin.
 Festival of Abraham
 Here's something that could never have happened in the Naughts but will maybe be possible in the Tweens or Teens -- if there's a breakthrough in the Mideast peace process. The idea is an arts festival that celebrates the origin of the three Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Every year it could be held in a different location; Jerusalem would obviously be the best place to start. 
 In Ireland, at the height of the ''Troubles,'' it was said that the only solution for rabid sectarianism was to let 1,000 punk-rock bands bloom: music helped create a free space for dialogue (of a high-volume variety). So no politicians allowed. Artists only.
 An Equal Right to Pollute (and the Polluter-Pays Principle)
 In the recent climate talks in Copenhagen, it was no surprise that developing countries objected to taking their feet off the pedal of their own carbon-paced growth; after all, they played little part in building the congested eight-lane highway of a problem that the world faces now. 
 One smart suggestion I've heard, sort of a riff on cap-and-trade, is that each person has an equal right to pollute and that there might somehow be a way to monetize this. By this accounting, your average Ethiopian can sell her underpolluting ways (people in Ethiopia emit about 0.1 ton of carbon a year) to the average American (about 20 tons a year) and use the proceeds to deal with the effects of climate change (like drought), educate her kids and send them to university. (Trust in capitalism -- we'll find a way.) As a mild green, I like the idea, though it's controversial in militant, khaki-green quarters. And yes, real economists would prefer to tax carbon at the source, but so far the political will is not there. If it were me, I'd close the deal before the rising nations want it backdated. 
 A Person (Dr. William Li) and a Word (Angiogenesis)
 Angiogenesis is the process by which new blood vessels grow. This is good -- except when it's very bad, as in the case of cancerous tumors. Blood vessels are their supply lines. Dr. William Li of the Angiogenesis Foundation has called research in this realm the ''first medical revolution of the 21st century,'' and he should know. (I shouldn't, given my lack of a medical pedigree, but I learned about it from my bandmate the Edge, who supports Dr. Li's foundation.) Work on angiogenesis inhibitors is at the vanguard. In a world worrying about whether it can afford health care, advances in prevention are at a premium.
 Factoid: Cancers start as tiny nests of malignant cells that do not enlarge until they recruit new vessels to deliver oxygen and nutrients; then a cancer can expand 16,000 times in only two weeks.
 Taking the Fight to Rotavirus
 The thing is, they exist, these vaccines. They're not a mere hope, like an AIDS vaccine. And one of the brightest bits of news in 2009 is that rotavirus vaccines have been shown to work not only in nations with low child mortality, but in the poorest countries, where diarrhea (not a killer in our house) caused by rotavirus infections takes the lives of 500,000 children a year. The World Health Organization just this summer issued a strong recommendation that rotavirus vaccinations be part of every nation's immunization program. From this vantage point, I like the look of the next decade.
 Matter Doesn't Matter
 God, it appears, is a Trekkie. (God help us.) 
 Dr. Anton Zeilinger, an Austrian physicist, is becoming a rock star of science for his work in quantum teleportation, which I know very little about but which I think I may have achieved backstage one night in Berlin in the early 1990s. At any rate, it seems to have something to do with teleporting properties or bits of information, not physical objects; even though Dr. Zeilinger plays down the possibility of a ''Star Trek'' moment, his breakthroughs are catching the attention of the nonscientific world for their metaphysical implications. His own version of E=mc2 ends in a cosmic punch line: that when it comes to the origin of the universe, information matters more than matter.
 Could it be that God is a nerd?
 People Power and the Upside-Down Pyramid
 A lot of us have seen or lived the organizational chart of the last century, in which power and influence (whether possessed by church, state or corporation) are concentrated in the uppermost point of the pyramid and pressure is exerted downward. But in this new century, and especially in some parts of the developing world, the pyramid is being inverted. Much has been written about the profits to be made at the bottom of the pyramid; less has been said about the political power there. Increasingly, the masses are sitting at the top, and their weight, via cellphones, the Web and the civil society and democracy these technologies can promote, is being felt by those who have traditionally held power. Today, the weight bears down harder when the few are corrupt or fail to deliver on the promises that earned them authority in the first place.
 The world is taking notice of this change. On her most recent trip to Africa, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton bypassed officials and met instead with representatives of independent, nongovernmental groups, which are quickly becoming more organized and more interconnected. For example, Twaweza, a citizen's organization, is spreading across East Africa, helping people hold local officials accountable for managing budgets and delivering services. (Twaweza is Swahili for ''we can make it happen.'')
 Viva la (Nonviolent) Revolucion
 ''As someone who stands here as a direct consequence of Dr. King's life work,'' President Obama said in his Nobel acceptance speech, ''I am living testimony to the moral force of nonviolence.'' 
 So, he might have added, are the Germans and Eastern Europeans who came out a couple of months ago to celebrate the anniversary of the fall of the Wall. And so are the brave Iranians who continue to take to the streets despite the certainty of brutal repression. Like Neda Agha Soltan, they are living (and bleeding and dying) testimony. 
 The start of the decade ought to be a time for a little bit of hope -- not the wispy stuff, but battle-hardened hope, forged in the grim, purposeful spirit of the times. So I'll place my hopes on the possibility -- however remote at the moment -- that the regimes in North Korea, Myanmar and elsewhere are taking note of the trouble an aroused citizenry can give to tyrants, and that people in places filled with rage and despair, places like the Palestinian territories, will in the days ahead find among them their Gandhi, their King, their Aung San Suu Kyi. 
 The World Cup Kicks Off the African Decade
 It's getting easier to describe to Americans the impact of the World Cup -- especially the impact it will have in Africa, where the tournament is to be held this summer. A few years ago, Ivory Coast was splitting apart and in the midst of civil war when its national team qualified for the 2006 jamboree. The response was so ecstatic that the war was largely put on hold as something more important than deathly combat took place, i.e. a soccer match. The team became a symbol of how the different tribes could -- and did -- get on after the tournament was over. 
 This time round, for the 2010 World Cup, naysayers thought South Africa could not build the stadiums in time. Those critics should be red-faced now. South Africa's impressive preparations underline the changes on the continent, where over the last few years, 5 percent economic growth was the average. Signs point to a further decade of growth to come. Canny investors will put more capital there. This in turn has the potential to shore up fragile young democracies across the continent. 
 It would be fitting if Nelson Mandela, who has done more than anyone for Africa's rising, would kick off the opening ceremonies. If he shows up, the world will weep with joy.

HEADLINE: A Fraternal Twin For a Seminary

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
IN the middle of Chelsea, an area known historically for artists and more recently for luxury condominiums, there is something unexpected: an active theological seminary that's been in the neighborhood since the 1820s. 
 Recently, the General Theological Seminary of the Episcopal Church has taken a cue from its surroundings in the interest of raising cash: an apartment building called the Chelsea Enclave has gone up on its grounds. It is scheduled for completion next month. 
 The Chelsea Enclave apartments and the seminary take up a full city block. The new structure stretches from 20th to 21st Street along Ninth Avenue and the seminary winds across 20th Street, up 10th Avenue, and back toward Ninth Ave along 21st Street. Hidden in the center of the buildings is the seminary's garden, called the Close -- a secluded courtyard that is home to American elms and manicured grass, and feels closer to New England than it does to the C train. 
 ''We present every building as exotic and unique,'' said James Lansill, a senior managing director at Corcoran Sunshine, the brokerage handling sales. ''But this building has something that no one else has, and that is the view of the Close.'' 
 The Chelsea Enclave is a seven-story, 53-unit luxury condop with spacious one- to four-bedroom apartments, high-end finishes and a garage. The building's exterior, which was subject to approval by the Landmark Preservation Commission because the seminary is part of the Chelsea Historic District, was designed by Polshek Partnership Architects. It is made of glass and a red brick that matches the seminary buildings almost perfectly. 
 The apartments run between $1.325 million and $10.75 million; a round of price cuts in April ranging from 6 to 14 percent brought the building to its current numbers. 
 The Chelsea Enclave opened for advance sales on Sept. 15, 2008, the day Lehman Brothers collapsed and the economy went into a tailspin. In addition to that painfully bad timing, the building was still under construction, and potential buyers had to content themselves with renderings and models. In recent years, plans and pretty pictures used to be enough for deals to go forward. Not anymore.
 ''Buyers literally refuse to buy in presales,'' Mr. Lansill said. ''People just don't believe the lobby is going to be nice, they don't believe that the apartments are going to have good finishes until they see it.'' 
 Now, however, there are things to see and tires to kick. In the last three months, since around the time the lobby was finished and model apartments were available for show, six apartments have sold. That brings the total of apartments in contract up to 13, with another unit closed and one contract pending. 
 This project, like almost all new construction, is in a difficult position: Until a certain percentage of apartments have sold, many banks are unwilling to make loans to people who want to buy there.
 ''It's a little bit of a chicken-and-egg problem,'' said Melissa Cohn, the president of Manhattan Mortgage. ''In order to get the deals done, you need to get buyers into the building. But banks have been hesitant to let buyers into the building.'' 
 Nonetheless, Ms. Cohn says, some lenders are willing to take the plunge on this project -- she arranged one of the sales in the building herself -- though they demand a higher interest rate. 
 Slow presales have not been the only hitch at the Chelsea Enclave. The proposed size of the building caused quite a stir in the planning stages a few years ago. 
 Originally, the seminary and the project's developer, the Brodsky Organization, envisioned a 17-story building replacing a mid-20th-century building called Sherrill Hall. 
 A building that tall, however, required special approval, because this part of Chelsea has a height restriction of 75 feet. The proposed skyscraper hit stiff resistance from the community board and local politicians. 
 ''They came forward with this out-of-scale building,'' State Senator Tom Duane said. ''This is the core of not just the historic district, but of the whole neighborhood. We fought them and we won.'' 
 Eventually, the Brodsky Organization and the seminary settled for the standard seven-story limit and signed a land lease for 99 years and about $30 million, paid upfront. 
 Though sales are slow, construction continues on schedule. And if it takes years to sell the entire building?
 ''So be it,'' said Daniel Brodksy, a managing partner at the Brodsky Organization. ''Our family has been in the real estate business for three generations, and we've never dropped a project. We've lived through great markets and through lousy markets. We've always held onto our buildings.''

HEADLINE: A Town Where Sellers Smile

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
NEWINGTON
 SITUATED just below the city of Hartford, the midsized community of Newington lacks the pristinely kept historic districts, scenic rivers and executive neighborhoods prized by many of its suburban neighbors. What it has to offer is more practical: easy access to major highways, lots of modest houses on equally modest lots and a competitive property tax rate. 
 ''The biggest word you can use to describe Newington is 'comfortable,' '' said Cathleen Hall, who has lived and sold homes here for 26 years, most recently as an agent with Prudential Connecticut. ''No pretension.'' 
 It turns out, however, that in an otherwise hobbled housing market, being good enough can be very good. Last month Amy Bergquist, an agent with William Raveis who tracks sales data on her blog, Greater Hartford Real Estate, singled out Newington as the only one of 17 area towns that has actually cycled back into a seller's market for single-family homes. 
 That means that at the current pace of sales, homes now on the market in Newington can be expected to sell within three months, an enviable condition at a time when some towns are still saddled with a year's worth of inventory -- or more.
 Newington has maintained its solitary status for six consecutive months, long enough to cause Ms. Bergquist to remark to her readers, ''Man, I wish I had a house in Newington to sell.''
 By comparison, Connecticut Multiple Listing Service data indicated that 11 other area towns are in a neutral market (three to six months of inventory). Five, including the pricey communities of Avon and Farmington, are still in a buyers' market, meaning that the abundance of homes for sale gives buyers the upper hand in negotiations. 
 In an interview, Ms. Bergquist ticked off a number of reasons for the Newington anomaly: highway accessibility, a ''decent'' school system and ''every big-box store you could imagine.'' She and other agents agreed, however, that if they had to name the single most significant reason for the healthier sales pace, they would pick price.
 Newington stands out from competing communities in that the majority of its single-family homes are priced below $300,000 -- the sweet spot for the first-time buyers lured into the market by low mortgage rates and the federal housing tax credit. 
 ''Newington is representative of Middle America,'' said Mayor Jeff Wright, who grew up in town and bought his first property here in 1997. ''We don't have a lot of people that are ultrawealthy, and we don't have a lot of people who are ultrapoor.'' 
 As a comparison, take, for example, West Hartford, Newington's neighbor to the north. The price range for the 170 or so single-family houses on the market there recently stretched from a low of $107,000 up to $2.45 million, Evan L. Berman said, an owner of ERA Broder Group. The median list price was $329,000. 
 The price range across the 70 or so houses listed in Newington was far more compressed: $104,000 to $569,000, with a median of $249,900. 
 ''Newington has more reasonably priced homes, more consistently affordable homes,'' Mr. Berman said. 
 It's not that prices in Newington have declined significantly over the past three years; Ms. Hall estimated a maximum drop-off of 12 percent. But then again Newington, true to its middle-of-the-road status, had never experienced the steep increases of other towns.
 That was dictated, at least in part, by the community's housing stock. With roughly 12,000 households squeezed into its 13 square miles, Newington is more densely developed than most surrounding towns: only 8 percent of its land remains undeveloped. Most streets are lined with pre-1980 homes built on fairly small, closely spaced lots. 
 Judging from the properties on the market, houses larger than 2,000 square feet are still the exception. More typical are the three-bedroom ranch on a half acre with a two-car garage listed for $249,900; or the three-bedroom one-bath Cape on a quarter acre for $199,000, a price that acknowledges the need for updates. 
 Fixer-uppers listed earlier this year at even lower prices prompted bidding wars between investors who saw turnaround potential in the homes, and buyers who wanted to live in them, Ms. Hall said. She received 12 offers for a house that needed a kitchen, a bathtub and a furnace. Originally listed for $129,900, the house eventually sold for $141,000, she said. 
 Condominium and apartment complexes are spread throughout the neighborhoods -- which, as Ms. Hall pointed out, further stabilizes the market by making it easier for residents to move up or scale back without leaving town. 
 Such was the case with Mayor Wright and his wife, Marina, who started out in a three-bedroom condo in Newington before moving up to a single-family home in his childhood neighborhood. He certainly hadn't planned on living next door to his parents, but while at their house for dinner one night, Mr. Wright learned that their neighbor was about to list his house. He and his wife went next door to take a look. They made up their minds on the spot.
 ''We ended up buying it right there, over a homemade glass of wine,'' Mr. Wright said.

HEADLINE: Listening to Braille

BYLINE: By RACHEL AVIV. 
Rachel Aviv is a Rosalynn Carter fellow for mental-health journalism with the Carter Center and writes frequently on education for The Times.

 BODY:
AT 4 O'CLOCK each morning, Laura J. Sloate begins her daily reading. She calls a phone service that reads newspapers aloud in a synthetic voice, and she listens to The Wall Street Journal at 300 words a minute, which is nearly twice the average pace of speech. Later, an assistant reads The Financial Times to her while she uses her computer's text-to-speech system to play The Economist aloud. She devotes one ear to the paper and the other to the magazine. The managing director of a Wall Street investment management firm, Sloate has been blind since age 6, and although she reads constantly, poring over the news and the economic reports for several hours every morning, she does not use Braille. 
''Knowledge goes from my ears to my brain, not from my finger to my brain,'' she says. As a child she learned how the letters of the alphabet sounded, not how they appeared or felt on the page. She doesn't think of a comma in terms of its written form but rather as ''a stop on the way before continuing.'' This, she says, is the future of reading for the blind. ''Literacy evolves,'' she told me. ''When Braille was invented, in the 19th century, we had nothing else. We didn't even have radio. At that time, blindness was a disability. Now it's just a minor, minor impairment.''
 A few decades ago, commentators predicted that the electronic age would create a postliterate generation as new forms of media eclipsed the written word. Marshall McLuhan claimed that Western culture would return to the ''tribal and oral pattern.'' But the decline of written language has become a reality for only the blind. Although Sloate does regret not spending more time learning to spell in her youth -- she writes by dictation -- she says she thinks that using Braille would have only isolated her from her sighted peers. ''It's an arcane means of communication, which for the most part should be abolished,'' she told me. ''It's just not needed today.''
 Braille books are expensive and cumbersome, requiring reams of thick, oversize paper. The National Braille Press, an 83-year-old publishing house in Boston, printed the Harry Potter series on its Heidelberg cylinder; the final product was 56 volumes, each nearly a foot tall. Because a single textbook can cost more than $1,000 and there's a shortage of Braille teachers in public schools, visually impaired students often read using MP3 players, audiobooks and computer-screen-reading software.
 A report released last year by the National Federation of the Blind, an advocacy group with 50,000 members, said that less than 10 percent of the 1.3 million legally blind Americans read Braille. Whereas roughly half of all blind children learned Braille in the 1950s, today that number is as low as 1 in 10, according to the report. The figures are controversial because there is debate about when a child with residual vision has ''too much sight'' for Braille and because the causes of blindness have changed over the decades -- in recent years more blind children have multiple disabilities, because of premature births. It is clear, though, that Braille literacy has been waning for some time, even among the most intellectually capable, and the report has inspired a fervent movement to change the way blind people read. ''What we're finding are students who are very smart, very verbally able -- and illiterate,'' Jim Marks, a board member for the past five years of the Association on Higher Education and Disability, told me. ''We stopped teaching our nation's blind children how to read and write. We put a tape player, then a computer, on their desks. Now their writing is phonetic and butchered. They never got to learn the beauty and shape and structure of language.''
 For much of the past century, blind children attended residential institutions where they learned to read by touching the words. Today, visually impaired children can be well versed in literature without knowing how to read; computer-screen-reading software will even break down each word and read the individual letters aloud. Literacy has become much harder to define, even for educators.
 ''If all you have in the world is what you hear people say, then your mind is limited,'' Darrell Shandrow, who runs a blog called Blind Access Journal, told me. ''You need written symbols to organize your mind. If you can't feel or see the word, what does it mean? The substance is gone.'' Like many Braille readers, Shandrow says that new computers, which form a single line of Braille cells at a time, will revive the code of bumps, but these devices are still extremely costly and not yet widely used. Shandrow views the decline in Braille literacy as a sign of regression, not progress: ''This is like going back to the 1400s, before Gutenberg's printing press came on the scene,'' he said. ''Only the scholars and monks knew how to read and write. And then there were the illiterate masses, the peasants.''
 UNTIL THE 19THCENTURY, blind people were confined to an oral culture. Some tried to read letters carved in wood or wax, formed by wire or outlined in felt with pins. Dissatisfied with such makeshift methods, Louis Braille, a student at the Royal Institute for Blind Youth in Paris, began studying a cipher language of bumps, called night writing, developed by a French Army officer so soldiers could send messages in the dark. Braille modified the code so that it could be read more efficiently -- each letter or punctuation symbol is represented by a pattern of one to six dots on a matrix of three rows and two columns -- and added abbreviations for commonly used words like ''knowledge,'' ''people'' and ''Lord.'' Endowed with a reliable method of written communication for the first time in history, blind people had a significant rise in social status, and Louis Braille was embraced as a kind of liberator and spiritual savior. With his ''godlike courage,'' Helen Keller wrote, Braille built a ''firm stairway for millions of sense-crippled human beings to climb from hopeless darkness to the Mind Eternal.''
 At the time, blindness was viewed not just as the absence of sight but also as a condition that created a separate kind of species, more innocent and malleable, not fully formed. Some scholars said that blind people spoke a different sort of language, disconnected from visual experience. In his 1933 book, ''The Blind in School and Society,'' the psychologist Thomas Cutsforth, who lost his sight at age 11, warned that students who were too rapidly assimilated into the sighted world would become lost in ''verbal unreality.'' At some residential schools, teachers avoided words that referenced color or light because, they said, students might stretch the meanings beyond sense. These theories have since been discredited, and studies have shown that blind children as young as 4 understand the difference in meaning between words like ''look,'' ''touch'' and ''see.'' And yet Cutsforth was not entirely misguided in his argument that sensory deprivation restructures the mind. In the 1990s, a series of brain-imaging studies revealed that the visual cortices of the blind are not rendered useless, as previously assumed. When test subjects swept their fingers over a line of Braille, they showed intense activation in the parts of the brain that typically process visual input. 
 These imaging studies have been cited by some educators as proof that Braille is essential for blind children's cognitive development, as the visual cortex takes more than 20 percent of the brain. Given the brain's plasticity, it is difficult to make the argument that one kind of reading -- whether the information is absorbed by ear, finger or retina -- is inherently better than another, at least with regard to cognitive function. The architecture of the brain is not fixed, and without images to process, the visual cortex can reorganize for new functions. A 2003 study in Nature Neuroscience found that blind subjects consistently surpassed sighted ones on tests of verbal memory, and their superior performance was caused, the authors suggested, by the extra processing that took place in the visual regions of their brains. 
 Learning to read is so entwined in the normal course of child development that it is easy to assume that our brains are naturally wired for print literacy. But humans have been reading for fewer than 6,000 years (and literacy has been widespread for no more than a century and a half). The activity of reading itself alters the anatomy of the brain. In a report released in 2009 in the journal Nature, the neuroscientist Manuel Carreiras studies illiterate former guerrillas in Colombia who, after years of combat, had abandoned their weapons, left the jungle and rejoined civilization. Carreiras compares 20 adults who had recently completed a literacy program with 22 people who had not yet begun it. In M.R.I. scans of their brains, the newly literate subjects showed more gray matter in their angular gyri, an area crucial for language processing, and more white matter in part of the corpus callosum, which links the two hemispheres. Deficiencies in these regions were previously observed in dyslexics, and the study suggests that those brain patterns weren't the cause of their illiteracy, as had been hypothesized, but a result.
 There is no doubt that literacy changes brain circuitry, but how this reorganization affects our capacity for language is still a matter of debate. In moving from written to spoken language, the greatest consequences for blind people may not be cognitive but cultural -- a loss much harder to avoid. In one of the few studies of blind people's prose, Doug Brent, a professor of communication at the University of Calgary, and his wife, Diana Brent, a teacher of visually impaired students, analyzed stories by students who didn't use Braille but rather composed on a regular keyboard and edited by listening to their words played aloud. One 16-year-old wrote a fictional story about a character named Mark who had ''sleep bombs'':
 He looked in the house windo that was his da windo his dad was walking around with a mask on he took it off he opend the windo and fell on his bed sleeping mark took two bombs and tosed them in the windo the popt his dad lept up but before he could grab the mask it explodedhe fell down asleep.
 In describing this story and others like it, the Brents invoked the literary scholar Walter Ong, who argued that members of literate societies think differently than members of oral societies. The act of writing, Ong said -- the ability to revisit your ideas and, in the process, refine them -- transformed the shape of thought. The Brents characterized the writing of many audio-only readers as disorganized, ''as if all of their ideas are crammed into a container, shaken and thrown randomly onto a sheet of paper like dice onto a table.'' The beginnings and endings of sentences seem arbitrary, one thought emerging in the midst of another with a kind of breathless energy. The authors concluded, ''It just doesn't seem to reflect the qualities of organized sequence and complex thought that we value in a literate society.''
 OUR DEFINITION of a literate society inevitably shifts as our tools for reading and writing evolve, but the brief history of literacy for blind people makes the prospect of change particularly fraught. Since the 1820s, when Louis Braille invented his writing system -- so that blind people would no longer be ''despised or patronized by condescending sighted people,'' as he put it -- there has always been, among blind people, a political and even moral dimension to learning to read. Braille is viewed by many as a mark of independence, a sign that blind people have moved away from an oral culture seen as primitive and isolating. In recent years, however, this narrative has been complicated. Schoolchildren in developed countries, like the U.S. and Britain, are now thought to have lower Braille literacy than those in developing ones, like Indonesia and Botswana, where there are few alternatives to Braille. Tim Connell, the managing director of an assistive-technology company in Australia, told me that he has heard this described as ''one of the advantages of being poor.'' 
 Braille readers do not deny that new reading technology has been transformative, but Braille looms so large in the mythology of blindness that it has assumed a kind of talismanic status. Those who have residual vision and still try to read print -- very slowly or by holding the page an inch or two from their faces -- are generally frowned upon by the National Federation of the Blind, which fashions itself as the leader of a civil rights movement for the blind. Its president, Marc Maurer, a voracious reader, compares Louis Braille to Abraham Lincoln. At the annual convention for the federation, held at a Detroit Marriott last July, I heard the mantra ''listening is not literacy'' repeated everywhere, from panels on the Braille crisis to conversations among middle-school girls. Horror stories circulating around the convention featured children who don't know what a paragraph is or why we capitalize letters or that ''happily ever after'' is made up of three separate words. 
 Declaring your own illiteracy seemed to be a rite of passage. A vice president of the federation, Fredric Schroeder, served as commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration under President Clinton and relies primarily on audio technologies. He was openly repentant about his lack of reading skills. ''I am now over 50 years old, and it wasn't until two months ago that I realized that 'dissent,' to disagree, is different than 'descent,' to lower something,'' he told me. ''I'm functionally illiterate. People say, 'Oh, no, you're not.' Yes, I am. I'm sorry about it, but I'm not embarrassed to admit it.''
 While people like Laura Sloate or the governor of New York, David A. Paterson, who also reads by listening, may be able to achieve without the help of Braille, their success requires accommodations that many cannot afford. Like Sloate, Paterson dictates his memos, and his staff members select pertinent newspaper articles for him and read them aloud on his voice mail every morning. (He calls himself ''overassimilated'' and told me that as a child he was ''mainstreamed so much that I psychologically got the message that I'm not really supposed to be blind.'') Among people with fewer resources, Braille-readers tend to form the blind elite, in part because it is more plausible for a blind person to find work doing intellectual rather than manual labor. 
 A 1996 study showed that of a sample of visually impaired adults, those who learned Braille as children were more than twice as likely to be employed as those who had not. At the convention this statistic was frequently cited with pride, so much so that those who didn't know Braille were sometimes made to feel like outsiders. ''There is definitely a sense of peer pressure from the older guard,'' James Brown, a 35-year-old who reads using text-to-speech software, told me. ''If we could live in our own little Braille world, then that'd be perfect,'' he added. ''But we live in a visual world.''
 When deaf people began getting cochlear implants in the late 1980s, many in the deaf community felt betrayed. The new technology pushed people to think of the disability in a new way -- as an identity and a culture. Technology has changed the nature of many disabilities, lifting the burdens but also complicating people's sense of what is physically natural, because bodies can so often be tweaked until ''fixed.'' Arielle Silverman, a graduate student at the convention who has been blind since birth, told me that if she had the choice to have vision, she was not sure she would take it. Recently she purchased a pocket-size reading machine that takes photographs of text and then reads the words aloud, and she said she thought of vision like that, as ''just another piece of technology.''
 The modern history of blind people is in many ways a history of reading, with the scope of the disability -- the extent to which you are viewed as ignorant or civilized, helpless or independent -- determined largely by your ability to access the printed word. For 150 years, Braille books were designed to function as much as possible like print books. But now the computer has essentially done away with the limits of form, because information, once it has been digitized, can be conveyed through sound or touch. For sighted people, the transition from print to digital text has been relatively subtle, but for many blind people the shift to computerized speech is an unwelcome and uncharted experiment. In grappling with what has been lost, several federation members recited to me various takes on the classic expression Scripta manent, verba volant: What is written remains, what is spoken vanishes into air.

HEADLINE: A Quiet Pocket of SoHo

BYLINE: By CHRISTIAN L. WRIGHT

 BODY:
AT 11:30 on a Friday morning in December, SoHo was teeming. 
 On Broadway, Topshop overflowed with the aggressively chic; getting to the shoe racks at Bloomingdale's required at least one strategic hip-check; at Uniqlo, there were more people poring over the skinny jeans and affordable cashmere than there are gulls above a successful trawler. And never mind the sidewalk; it was an impossible-to-navigate sea.
 Meanwhile, just one block east, all was quiet on Crosby Street. Along the narrow cobblestone path, the solitude was pierced only by the UPS man waving to the doorman as he passed by 30 Crosby and a slim fellow in a well-cut car coat walking his Rhodesian Ridgeback. By afternoon, when the fireplaces were lighted at Savoy, the restaurant on the corner of Prince Street and Crosby, the pedestrian traffic hurrying to the east and to the west was heavy, but only a girl in a knit cap carrying a big bolt of fabric turned south onto Crosby, into the eastern territory of the SoHo-Cast Iron Historic District. 
 ''Crosby Street is just off the beaten track,'' said Craig Markham, the director of marketing and public relations for Firmdale Hotels, the London-based company that opened the Crosby Street Hotel in September. ''It's a little bit quirky.'' 
 Indeed, when the Firmdale sales team started introducing the new hotel to long-established, top-level travel agents in New York City, some said, ''Now, where exactly is Crosby Street?''
 The new hotel seems to be the crowning touch of the five-block stretch of Crosby that runs south of Houston Street to Howard Street, where the tourists don't really seem to go, where residential real estate prices hover around $5 million per condo, where unusual shops manage to thrive and where the atmosphere is very much old SoHo: sleepy, arty, industrial, mysterious. 
 The nonprofit Housing Works Bookstore Cafe anchors the northern end; the coveted designer Derek Lam just opened a gleaming glass-front shop at the southern end; and along the way are the unspoiled details of a bygone era. 
 There are red brick buildings marked with the backward Z's of old fire escapes, cast-iron facades of 19th-century factories that don't rise over 10 stories, great big warehouse windows and slate-tiled roofs that borrow from European design. There are antiques and objets to be found (like an initialed Saxon armorial beaker, c. 1720, or a perfectly plausible daddy longlegs made of blown glass at De Vera), and funny little storefronts -- Saturdays Surf NYC, Michele Varian housewares, N 33 Crosby tapas bar -- that could easily be mistaken for private residences. 
 Stepping onto Crosby Street is a bit like entering a botanical garden in the middle of an urban throng. Minus the flowers, of course. Against some odds, Crosby Street has managed its revitalization without losing its character.
 When Lucy Wallace Eustice, a founder and an owner of the handbag company M Z Wallace, opened her first shop in 2000, she chose Crosby ''because of its character -- the forgotten street of SoHo.'' Megabrands like Chanel and Apple have opted for coordinates closer to the heart of SoHo, while the one-off stores along Crosby hark back to the days when artists lived and worked in the loft spaces and Dean & Deluca was just a small grocery known as Giorgio's. 
 Not so long ago, Crosby was little more than a supply street to the big buildings on Broadway (shoppers don't seem to notice that there's an alternate entrance to Bloomingdale's on Crosby that's much more low-key than the main doors on Broadway), and in fact, the street's backdoor status may have served to protect it. 
 Three years ago, when Nathan Kornfeld bought his 4,000-square-foot full-floor loft at No. 30, between Broome and Grand Streets, he didn't know the street well enough to realize how lucky he was. 
 ''The Upper East Side is really dense and not as casual,'' said Mr. Kornfeld, a partner at the private equity firm Patron Capital. ''We looked in TriBeCa, but this was the best value. There are not a lot of lofts of this vintage and this size. It's kind of unique.'' 
 Apartment 3A at 30 Crosby Street, a 4,100-square-foot open loft with pine floors, single slab marble countertops and a fireplace, is currently for sale for $4.9 million.
 Residential real estate at the high end has suffered during the recent economic downturn and, according to industry analyses, no neighborhood has been immune. Corcoran reports that in the third quarter of 2009, the median price of an apartment in Manhattan was $799,000, an 18 percent drop from the year before. 
 These days, properties on Crosby Street are selling well above market average. For instance, a 2,678-square-foot second-floor apartment in the six-unit Bayard House at 76 Crosby went quickly into contract this month for $4.35 million, or $1,624 per square foot (the third-quarter median was $1,012). 
 And a four-bedroom duplex at 55 Crosby is on the market for $5.8 million. It offers 25-foot ceilings and the fact that the architect Frank Gehry once owned it. On the other hand, the 6,000-square-foot penthouse reconfigured into a flaming, soaring rock 'n' roll vision by the singer Lenny Kravitz and his designer, Benjamin Noriega-Ortiz, at 30 Crosby has languished on the market at $14.9 million.
 While the rest of SoHo has changed drastically, even in recent years, Crosby Street has resisted commercial transformation. Peter Hoffman, who opened the restaurant Savoy in 1990 -- arriving in the neighborhood long before Balthazar and with a then-idiosyncratic farm-to-fork notion -- remembers a different time and place. ''The block between Prince and Houston in the early '90s -- there was a lot of crack getting smoked there,'' he said. 
 For many years, his light on the corner of the dark street was a beacon. Now, of course, there's the MoMA Design Store opposite. And just a block down, a black GMC Yukon idles outside the set-back entrance to the Crosby Street Hotel, where rates start at $495 a night. Construction on the 270-room Mondrian Hotel (scheduled to open early this year) -- which will rise above downtown Manhattan from 150 Lafayette Street, the thoroughfare that runs parallel, to the east -- may be a harbinger of change.
 But for now, Crosby remains a little residential secret, sandwiched between commercial boulevards. ''It's very quiet,'' Mr. Kornfeld said. ''Unless it gets rowdy at N.''

HEADLINE: Why Twitter Will Endure

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR. 
David Carr is a reporter for the culture section of The New York Times and the Media Equation columnist for the business section. He tweets at http://twitter.com/carr2n, where his character emerges in 140 characters.

 BODY:
I can remember when I first thought seriously about Twitter. Last March, I was at the SXSW conference, a conclave in Austin, Tex., where technology, media and music are mashed up and re-imagined, and, not so coincidentally, where Twitter first rolled out in 2007. As someone who was oversubscribed on Facebook, overwhelmed by the computer-generated RSS feeds of news that came flying at me, and swamped by incoming e-mail messages, the last thing I wanted was one more Web-borne intrusion into my life.
 And then there was the name. Twitter.
 In the pantheon of digital nomenclature -- brands within a sector of the economy that grew so fast that all the sensible names were quickly taken -- it would be hard to come up with a noun more trite than Twitter. It impugns itself, promising something slight and inconsequential, yet another way to make hours disappear and have nothing to show for it. And just in case the noun is not sufficiently indicting, the verb, ''to tweet'' is even more embarrassing. 
 Beyond the dippy lingo, the idea that something intelligent, something worthy of mindshare, might occur in the space of 140 characters -- Twitter's parameters were set by what would fit in a text message on a phone -- seems unlikely.
 But it was clear that at the conference, the primary news platform was Twitter, with real-time annotation of the panels on stage and critical updates about what was happening elsewhere at a very hectic convention. At 52, I succumbed, partly out of professional necessity.
 And now, nearly a year later, has Twitter turned my brain to mush? No, I'm in narrative on more things in a given moment than I ever thought possible, and instead of spending a half-hour surfing in search of illumination, I get a sense of the day's news and how people are reacting to it in the time that it takes to wait for coffee at Starbucks. Yes, I worry about my ability to think long thoughts -- where was I, anyway? -- but the tradeoff has been worth it.
 Some time soon, the company won't say when, the 100-millionth person will have signed on to Twitter to follow and be followed by friends and strangers. That may sound like a MySpace waiting to happen -- remember MySpace? -- but I'm convinced Twitter is here to stay.
 And I'm not alone.
 ''The history of the Internet suggests that there have been cool Web sites that go in and out of fashion and then there have been open standards that become plumbing,'' said Steven Johnson, the author and technology observer who wrote a seminal piece about Twitter for Time last June. ''Twitter is looking more and more like plumbing, and plumbing is eternal.''
 Really? What could anyone possibly find useful in this cacophony of short-burst communication?
 Well, that depends on whom you ask, but more importantly whom you follow. On Twitter, anyone may follow anyone, but there is very little expectation of reciprocity. By carefully curating the people you follow, Twitter becomes an always-on data stream from really bright people in their respective fields, whose tweets are often full of links to incredibly vital, timely information.
 The most frequent objection to Twitter is a predictable one: ''I don't need to know someone is eating a donut right now.'' But if that someone is a serious user of Twitter, she or he might actually be eating the curmudgeon's lunch, racing ahead with a clear, up-to-the-second picture of an increasingly connected, busy world. The service has obvious utility for a journalist, but no matter what business you are in, imagine knowing what the thought leaders in your industry were reading and considering. And beyond following specific individuals, Twitter hash tags allow you to go deep into interests and obsession: #rollerderby, #physics, #puppets and #Avatar, to name just a few of many thousands.
 The act of publishing on Twitter is so friction-free -- a few keystrokes and hit send -- that you can forget that others are out there listening. I was on a Virgin America cross-country flight, and used its wireless connection to tweet about the fact that the guy next to me seemed to be the leader of a cult involving Axe body spray. A half-hour later, a steward approached me and said he wondered if I would be more comfortable with a seat in the bulkhead. (He turned out to be a great guy, but I was doing a story involving another part of the company, so I had to decline the offer. @VirginAmerica, its corporate Twitter account, sent me a message afterward saying perhaps it should develop a screening process for Axe. It was creepy and comforting all at once.)
 Like many newbies on Twitter, I vastly overestimated the importance of broadcasting on Twitter and after a while, I realized that I was not Moses and neither Twitter nor its users were wondering what I thought. Nearly a year in, I've come to understand that the real value of the service is listening to a wired collective voice.
 Not that long ago, I was at a conference at Yale and looked at the sea of open laptops in the seats in front of me. So why wasn't my laptop open? Because I follow people on Twitter who serve as my Web-crawling proxies, each of them tweeting links that I could examine and read on a Blackberry. Regardless of where I am, I surf far less than I used to.
 At first, Twitter can be overwhelming, but think of it as a river of data rushing past that I dip a cup into every once in a while. Much of what I need to know is in that cup: if it looks like Apple is going to demo its new tablet, or Amazon sold more Kindles than actual books at Christmas, or the final vote in the Senate gets locked in on health care, I almost always learn about it first on Twitter.
 The expressive limits of a kind of narrative developed from text messages, with less space to digress or explain than this sentence, has significant upsides. The best people on Twitter communicate with economy and precision, with each element -- links, hash tags and comments -- freighted with meaning. Professional acquaintances whom I find insufferable on every other platform suddenly become interesting within the confines of Twitter.
 Twitter is incredibly customizable, with little of the social expectations that go with Facebook. Depending on whom you follow, Twitter can reveal a nation riveted by the last episode of ''Jersey Shore'' or a short-form conclave of brilliance. There is plenty of nonsense -- #Tiger had quite a run -- but there are rich threads on the day's news and bravura solo performances from learned autodidacts. And the ethos of Twitter, which is based on self-defining groups, is far more well-mannered than many parts of the Web -- more Toastmasters than mosh pit. On Twitter, you are your avatar and your avatar is you, so best not to act like a lout and when people want to flame you for something you said, they are responding to their own followers, not yours, so trolls quickly lose interest.
 ''Anything that is useful to both dissidents in Iran andMartha Stewart has a lot going for it; Twitter has more raw capability for users than anything since e-mail,'' said Clay Shirky, who wrote ''Here Comes Everybody,'' a book about social media. ''It will be hard to wait out Twitter because it is lightweight, endlessly useful and gets better as more people use it. Brands are using it, institutions are using it, and it is becoming a place where a lot of important conversations are being held.''
 Twitter helps define what is important by what Mr. Shirky has called ''algorithmic authority,'' meaning that if all kinds of people are pointing at the same thing at the same instant, it must be a pretty big deal.
 Beyond the throbbing networked intelligence, there is the possibility of practical magic. Twitter can tell you what kind of netbook you should buy for your wife for Christmas -- thanks Twitter! -- or call you out when you complain about the long lines it took to buy it, as a tweeter on behalf of the electronics store B & H did when I shared the experience on my Blackberry while in line. I have found transcendent tacos at a car wash in San Antonio, rediscovered a brand of reporter's notepad I adore, uncovered sources for stories, all just by typing a query into Twitter.
 All those riches do not come at zero cost: If you think e-mail and surfing can make time disappear, wait until you get ahold of Twitter, or more likely, it gets ahold of you. There is always something more interesting on Twitter than whatever you happen to be working on.
 But in the right circumstance, Twitter can flex some big muscles. Think of last weekend, a heavy travel period marked by a terrorist incident on Friday. As news outlets were scrambling to understand the implications for travelers on Saturday morning, Twitter began lighting up with reports of new security initiatives, including one from @CharleneLi, a consultant who tweeted from the Montreal airport at about 7:30 a.m.: ''New security rules for int'l flights into US. 1 bag, no electronics the ENTIRE flight, no getting up last hour of flight.''
 It was far from the whole story and getting ahead of the news by some hours would seem like no big deal, but imagine you or someone you loved was flying later that same day: Twitter might seem very useful.
 Twitter's growing informational hegemony is not assured. There have been serious outages in recent weeks, leading many business and government users to wonder about the stability of the platform. And this being the Web, many smart folks are plotting ways to turn Twitter into so much pixilated mist. But I don't think so. I can go anywhere I want on the Web, but there is no guarantee that my Twitter gang will come with me. I may have quite a few followers, but that doesn't make me Moses.

HEADLINE: Not a Total Economic Washout

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Big Zero'' (column, Dec. 28):
 Yes, Paul Krugman is right. The decade averaged out to a big zero. But it's an average of pluses and minuses, resulting in big winners and big losers.
 In the pluses: the top 1 percent of Americans got the largest share of total income since the 1920s, and paid a much lower rate of income tax than 80 years ago. 
 In the minuses: while there was a slight increase in the number of jobs created, as he said, there are more than 10 to 12 million more workers (depending on whose estimate you use of new workers entering the work force) competing for almost the same number of jobs there were in 2000.
 It is my hope that the Obama administration will attack this problem as its highest priority, as two of the biggest roadblocks to our economic recovery are the terrible distribution of wealth and the lack of jobs, especially for young people.
 Stan Rubin New Rochelle, N.Y., Dec. 28, 2009
 To the Editor:
 By focusing so much on all the negatives in the Big Zero, Paul Krugman missed out on countless examples of positive economic development, innovation and progress over the last decade.
 Millions of people in third-world countries are now active and productive participants in the world economy because of the growth in microlending. And innovation and disruptive technologies have continued to fuel growth in many sectors.
 Digital music sales and the iPod, for example, have created new ways for consumers to buy and hear music, and the green revolution has created an entire new industry.
 While there clearly have been many economic failures over the last 10 years, we have continued to experience significant economic growth through scientific, technological and medical advances, due in no small part to our continued world leadership in research and innovation.
 Jonathan Singer Tenafly, N.J., Dec. 29, 2009
 To the Editor:
 While reading Paul Krugman's column, the decade passed before my eyes like an old newsreel of unwinding calamity (and he didn't even get to the foreign debacles).
 Looking back, I would call this decade the Big Sub-Zero (global warming notwithstanding), for we as a nation have lost ground to a high-negative degree in so many well-defined ways.
 In another column from this last decade, Mr. Krugman referred to the administration of George W. Bush, then our president, as having ''the reverse Midas touch''; his whatever-the-market-will-bear policies opened the way to the housing bubble and the hyped investments that led to financial collapse on a grand scale.
 Unfortunately, the people who so gamed the financial system have not been held accountable and are still, for the most part, in charge, no doubt devising new and innovative formulations to defang real regulatory reform.
 Unless meaningful regulatory intervention is imposed, these high-stakes gamblers, who play the numbers with such time-tested, amoral zeal, will foreclose on the future as they did so reprehensibly on the most recent past.
 Barbara Allen Kenney Santa Fe, N.M., Dec. 28, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman is mistaken when he says we learned and accomplished nothing as a nation in the last decade. On the contrary, we learned and achieved a great deal.
 We learned that American taxpayers could be forced to pay for two failed wars, one of which was based on lies, and also to finance outrageous executive bonuses for corrupt Wall Street executives during a time of huge unemployment and wealth destruction for the poor and middle class. That's quite an achievement.
 D. R. Longway Towson, Md., Dec. 28, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Let's set the record straight. The economic ''mess'' had its origins in the subprime housing market and the excessive indebtedness of a greedy and materialistic public. These conditions existed well before the beginning of this decade, and that is why President Obama and the Democrats are circumspect in attaching blame.
 Lawrence H. Summers, Representative Barney Frank and Senator Christopher J. Dodd were as culpable as anyone in promoting the unwise practices causing the debacle. All President George W. Bush did was, unwisely, perpetuate what seemed a booming economy that was in fact based on a mountain of private indebtedness.
 Politicians of both parties, and above all the cherished ''people'' who want it all and want it now, are to blame. The cause was a moral failure, not a government failure.
 Ronald M. Holdaway Draper, Utah, Dec. 28, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Yes, there were many downturns and not-as-good-as-expecteds during the year. But after my mother's trust accounts lost more than $100,000 in value and I transferred them to another financial planner at a different company, the new planner was able to recover the losses within the last deplorable year, during the downturn.
 How? In his words, by reading everything, using good judgment and watching the portfolio regularly. Our previous investor had simply set up my mother's portfolio and then gone on to other, perhaps more lucrative investments, allowing the accounts regular losses over more than a year without stopping reinvestment.
 Our current adviser has earned his commissions while respecting my instructions not to invest in weapons manufacturers or obviously mercenary funds. 
 I've heard since then of other investors who had similar experiences. The banking industry isn't the only one that needs scrutiny -- many financial advisers who lack internal controls have slacked off as well.
 Diana Morley Talent, Ore., Dec. 28, 2009
 To the Editor:
 While I generally agree with Paul Krugman's point about the last decade's being an economic washout, his suggestion of naming the first 10 years of the millennium as the Big Zero is a sentiment best left to pessimists and naysayers -- which I hope the majority of Americans are not.
 Let's instead focus on the positive and inspiring things that emerged from the decade -- innovative television shows like ''The Sopranos'' and ''Mad Men''; major breakthroughs in medicine and technology; and our first black president. It was the decade in which I met my husband and in which our first child was born, and for those two things alone, I nominate that we call these last 10 years the Big Hope.

HEADLINE: The Shinnecocks, Recognized

 BODY:
More than 200 years late -- 31 if you count from the tribe's petition -- the federal government has acknowledged that the Shinnecocks of Southampton, Long Island, are an Indian tribe. Settling that question raises new ones. The Shinnecocks will almost certainly try to build a casino -- they have been lobbying as hard for one as they have for recognition -- but how big, and where? 
 The ''where'' is an especially interesting question. Casinos are usually built on reservation land. The Shinnecocks live on the East End of Long Island, a national depository of wealth, privilege and privacy. When the tribe jumped the gun a few years back and bulldozed part of its property for a bingo hall, the not-in-my-backyard opposition erupting from the dunes and privet hedges was ferocious. And that was just a skirmish. 
 That is probably why the Shinnecocks are exploring other sites in Suffolk County, at two New York racetracks and in the Catskills. But building an off-reservation casino is itself fraught with uncertainty and regulatory hurdles. The tribe could end up spending many years and lots of money chasing something that is a guaranteed winner only for lobbyists and consultants.
 Casinos are also a magnet for tainted money and a handmaiden to addiction, crime and other social ills. That is why we would urge the tribe to spend its energy on finding other ways to leverage its valuable real estate. 
 A casino is, after all, only a means to an end -- to economic vitality, greater respect, a better future for the tribe's 1,000 members. The Shinnecocks are now in a much better position to pursue that dream. Lack of federal status did more than hamper the tribe's quest for gambling riches. It also denied it access to federal programs for housing, health care and education.
 The Shinnecocks have a long, proud history of self- governance, and advantages that poorer, more remote tribes can only dream of: geography, bargaining power and the support of state officials including Gov. David Paterson, who endorsed their quest for recognition. The good news on recognition would be even better if the tribe could foresee a future apart from slots and dice.

 BODY:
THREE of my four grandparents immigrated to America from Russia, through Ellis Island, in the early 1920s. My father grew up in Brooklyn, and my mother in Buffalo. I was born in Syracuse, where my father was in medical school. After he graduated, he was drafted into the Air Force, which assigned him first to San Francisco, then to Madrid, where we lived for three years.
 When I was 9, my parents decided to settle in the suburbs south of San Francisco. Later, I went to Stanford, where I studied international relations. In college, I began to get involved in Jewish activities and that's how I met Laura, my wife. 
 In 1982, I went to Japan on an International Rotary Foundation graduate fellowship. The experience exposed me to a fascinating culture.
 When I returned the following summer, I moved to Los Angeles to be with Laura and worked selling dictating equipment to small businesses. Selling wasn't much fun, and I kept thinking about my Jewish leadership activities in college. I was accepted into rabbinical school, but after a year, I decided it just wasn't right for me. A business career looked attractive after all. I was accepted by Stanford's Graduate School of Business and began the program in 1986. At the time, my wife and I had a 4-month-old son.
 After I earned my M.B.A., Procter & Gamble hired me to work at its Cincinnati headquarters. I was lucky to work under A. G. Lafley, who later became the company's chief executive, and Susan Arnold, who became a vice chairwoman. I had some great assignments, including serving as brand manager for Tide detergent.
 During that time, my father, who had gone on to complete a law degree at night while he was still practicing medicine in the Bay Area, went blind from diabetes. I decided that after seven years in Cincinnati, it was time to return to California. In 1995, the Clorox Company in Oakland hired me as its first global marketing manager, and I later became general manager of its pet products category.
 But across the bay, in Silicon Valley, Internet businesses were beginning to explode, and I wanted to be part of it. So I left to become vice president of marketing for three different Internet start-ups. I left the third start-up, Cariocas, only days before the 9/11 terrorist attacks. As a result of the dot-com bubble's bursting, it became impossible to find a good job quickly.
 A few former P.& G. colleagues worked at Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, so I joined in September 2002. After four years, I gave myself a sabbatical. My wife was flexible because she was working on her Ph.D. dissertation, so we took the opportunity to be ski bums at Tahoe, drive Route 66 and scuba-dive in the South Pacific. 
 It was back to work in 2007, as chief executive of a social networking start-up, Visible Path, now called Hoovers Connect. In November of that year, I became chief executive of the three-year-old IMVU, where people connect and interact through avatars they create in a virtual community. It has more than 45 million registered users.
 In this job, I've been able to apply the marketing skills I learned at P.& G. and the general management lessons I learned at Intuit. My first year was challenging, and raising $10 million in new funding after the recession hit was hard. The past year has been great, and we recently announced that IMVU had doubled revenue, to over $2 million a month, and that we're profitable. IMVU is ''free to play'' -- meaning there is no cost to use it -- but some users buy virtual goods, especially avatar clothing. Those purchases are 85 percent of our revenue, and the rest is from ads. 
 People from all over the world can meet and interact virtually on IMVU. It reminds me of a wonderful saying from the Talmud: ''Who is wise? He who learns from all people.''

HEADLINE: Come Buy With Me And Be My Love

BYLINE: By HILARY STOUT

 BODY:
CHUCK HABERSTROH and Jacque Horelik went to high school together in Westport, Conn., but they did not know each other then. They met by chance during college, when she visited a mutual friend at Lehigh University, where he was a student. A few years later they crossed paths back home in Westport and went on a date to a cool pub and restaurant. Things were a bit on and off for a while, but then they began to get serious.
 He lived in a house in nearby Norwalk with a bunch of male buddies; she moved to the place next door with her sister and a couple of friends. She started spending all of her time at his place, so she ditched her room and moved in with him. A few months later, they signed a lease on a small apartment of their own.
 He was in his late 20s, she was two years younger. They had been together for two years. They made each other laugh, they liked each other's friends, they loved each other's company. And so they knew -- as everyone seemed to be telling them -- that it was time. 
 To buy real estate.
 Two distinct forms of desire -- the carnal type and the kind that involves granite countertops -- have been known to intermingle, but perhaps never more so than now.
 New York and its environs have always been places where real estate can drive relationships, for better or for worse (think of the marriages that have lingered for far too long because neither spouse can afford to move out of the Classic 6). But the peculiarities of the housing market today are leading more couples to ponder the question, ''Should we buy?'' before they settle the question, ''Should we commit?''
 Mr. Haberstroh, now 30 and a vice president of CastleKeep Investment Advisors in Westport, said the market dictated which question he and Ms. Horelik tackled first.
 ''When the market started to turn in the buyer's favor,'' he said, ''we decided we had to take advantage of that.''
 On Oct. 30, they closed on a three-bedroom Cape Cod-style cottage in Fairfield, Conn., with hardwood floors, a front porch and a back deck on a pretty corner lot. They got it for $430,000, $29,000 less than the asking price.
 They had been assuming for a while that one day they would, probably, get married, but for one reason or another the engagement had not happened.
 ''My whole thing was with this market, get the house -- the one you want and love -- first,'' Mr. Haberstroh said.
 That wasn't entirely her whole thing. ''I was itching to get engaged before we bought the house,'' said Ms. Horelik, 28, a teacher who works with special education students. ''Chuck definitely felt the pressure from me and both of our families.''
 But, she added, ''now I see why he wanted to wait. He saw the prices and rates were dropping and we realized we may never see such a buyer-friendly environment again.''
 Other couples are also finding it difficult to resist the allure of startlingly low mortgage rates, fallen prices that may be about to turn up again and expiring tax breaks.
 ''There are just so many things you can lose out on'' if you wait, said Elaine Matthews, 27, an actress and dancer who is in contract to buy a condominium in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, with her boyfriend of 16 months, Sean MacLaughlin. They hope to close on the property -- a brand-new 1,200-square-foot ground-floor duplex with a backyard, a deck and a white picket fence -- at the end of February or the beginning of March.
 Ms. Matthews and Mr. MacLaughlin, a 31-year-old actor, met while performing with the touring company of ''The Phantom of the Opera,''and have spent most of their relationship on the road, living in hotels.
 ''New York rents are very high and you never see that money again,'' Ms. Matthews said. She went on to list the benefits of buying: ''We got a great mortgage rate, 4.75,'' she said. In addition, owners of units in new developments in New York City can take advantage of a program that phases in property taxes over a period of 10 years. And then there's the federal tax credit for first-time home buyers, to expire on April 30, 2010, which will provide several thousand dollars in income tax relief.
 ''We will eventually get engaged and get married,'' Ms. Matthews added. ''We're kind of like, let's get this apartment now, then let's make it official.''
 Mr. MacLaughlin said: ''We were talking about getting married and I said, 'Wait a minute, if we just put off the ring, we'll get the apartment first.' ''
 At $522,000, the apartment costs a good deal more than most rings, but Ms. Matthews said the price was about $60,000 less than what a similar unit in a complex by the same developer went for two years ago.
 One of the most compelling forces motivating many couples right now is the first-time home buyer tax credit, which offers federal income tax relief equal to 10 percent of the purchase price of a home -- capped at $8,000 -- for couples earning less than $150,000 and individuals earning less than $75,000.
 Pete Flint, the chief executive of Trulia, a real estate search engine, points out that people who have never bought a home make up a demographic tending toward the young and unmarried. The credit, a part of the broad economic stimulus package enacted into law last year, was to expire last November, but Congress extended it until the end of April.
 That deadline is lighting a fire under some couples in the serious, or almost-serious, stages of a relationship. They worry that if they don't act now, they may squander the best property-buying opportunity they will have for a while. There are also signs (or at least a feeling in the air) that the housing market could be picking up (including word that this may be a good year for Wall Street bonuses).
 Mr. Flint said that trulia.com had received numerous e-mail messages from unmarried couples asking about the logistics -- and wisdom -- of buying a home together. Many of the queries are about the first-time home buyer tax credit and how or whether it can be divided between people whose marital status doesn't allow them to jointly file a tax return.
 (The answer from the Internal Revenue Service: only one of the two people can claim the tax break if they are unmarried at the time of the sale. It cannot be divided, even if the couple marry later in the year.)
 Trulia posts such questions on a message board called Trulia Voices, and real estate professionals often chime in with answers. One of the notes on the board contained the following cautionary tale from a couple who split up, rather than marry, six months after buying a new house.
 One person in the pair had provided a 10 percent cash down payment on the home; the other borrowed 10 percent; and they both signed a mortgage for the remaining 80 percent. Once they decided to break up, their only recourse seemed to be to try and sell the house.
 ''Yet,'' the e-mail post says, ''only being six months into the house it would be difficult to break even (right?). He is in no financial position to take on the home himself and I would be strapped if I did.''
 Real estate lawyers say that there are more complications for unmarried property owners who part ways than there are for married property owners who divorce -- and a less clear process for resolving them.
 ''By default, our laws are suited for married couples acquiring assets,'' says Luigi Rosabianca, a real estate lawyer in Manhattan.
 Under New York State law, he explains, a husband and wife are considered ''tenants by the entirety'' when they buy property. That ensures, among other things, that the property will automatically transfer to the surviving spouse if one person dies.
 ''If you are not married, you have to fill in the blanks,'' Mr. Rosabianca said. Toward that end, he recommends that unmarried couples consider signing what amounts to a pre-prenuptial -- legal agreements specifying the unknowns, including ''who contributes what percentage of the expenses, mortgage, taxes, common charges, utilities.'' He added, ''You also have to account for capital gains -- what percentage goes to whom.''
 And there can be other issues. ''Say this house is close to your mother,'' Mr. Rosabianca said. It may be wise to sign an agreement saying, ''If we break up, you have to buy me out, because I don't want to live near your mother.''
 Couldn't that be a problem for a married couple going through a divorce as well?
 ''With a married couple that would probably be handled with the divorce,'' he said. With an unmarried couple ''it's almost more prudent to be proactive in addressing these concerns.''
 Victor Bell III and Temiko Clifton, both 28, became engaged in May, but their romantic progression has also been influenced by the pull of real estate.
 At about the same time they were committing to each other, they were racing to take advantage of the first-time buyer tax credit. They made several offers on properties that fell through. But recently their offer was accepted for a three-bedroom, one-bath house with a renovated kitchen in Valley Stream, N.Y.
 Now, before they select a date for their wedding, they need to know how large an event they will be able to afford. ''We want to see how much our mortgage is going to cost us first,'' Mr. Bell said.
 And for Mr. Haberstroh and Ms. Horelik, both the real estate and the relationship have now fallen into place, to the delight of Ms. Horelik's family, who are of the wedding-before-house school.
 The first night they slept in their new home, they got engaged. They are hoping for a late-summer 2010 wedding, but have not set the date.
 ''Between moving in and outfitting the house,'' Mr. Haberstroh said, ''we've had a hard time finding time to really make progress on that front.''
 Look Before You Leap
 THE body of law governing property rights of unmarried partners is nowhere near as well defined as that covering the rights of married couples. To help prevent expensive and time-consuming disputes in the future, here are some questions unmarried couples should ask their lawyers and financial advisers before buying property:
 How will the title to the property be held -- joint tenants, tenants in common or living trust?
 Should both our names be on the mortgage?
 Should we enter into a legal ''partnership agreement'' before buying the property?
 How does domestic partner registration in our state affect property ownership?
 Should each of us keep records of our individual payments -- and their proportion of the total -- toward the mortgage, utilities, taxes and other expenses related to the property?
 If we broke up, how easily could the property be divided?
 If one of us died, how easily could the property be distributed?

CORRECTION-DATE: January 10, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about couples who buy homes together before getting married misstated the income limits of the federal first-time home buyer tax credit. For purchases after Nov. 6, 2009, the full credit is available to married couples filing joint returns with modified adjusted gross incomes of up to $225,000, not $150,000; and for individuals with incomes of up to $125,000, not $75,000. (The lower numbers were the limits for purchases before Nov. 6.)
 The article also misstated whether the tax credit can be divided between unmarried buyers. Indeed it can, if both buyers qualify for the credit.

HEADLINE: A Writerly Approach To the Financial Crisis

BYLINE: By DEVIN LEONARD

 BODY:
ONE of the aftereffects of the financial crisis has been a flood of books promising to explain it. There have been books by economists, journalists, politicians, Wall Street insiders and even a federal judge, Richard Posner, who has produced more than 40 other books, and evidently couldn't resist the temptation to churn out one on this subject.
 What has been hard to find is a book about the disaster by a writer with literary bona fides. But now comes ''I.O.U.: Why Everyone Owes Everyone and No One Can Pay,'' by John Lanchester (Simon & Schuster, $25). 
Mr. Lanchester, the British writer, has the intellectual heft and the chops, as a jazz musician might say, to deliver a resounding book about the crisis. A frequent contributor to The New Yorker and The New York Review of Books, he has written several novels. In fact, he started studying the world's financial situation two years ago, thinking it would be the backdrop for another fictional work -- only to decide that the unfolding financial mess was ''the most interesting story I've ever found.'' 
 An elegant and wonderfully witty writer, Mr. Lanchester approaches his subject with a newcomer's verve. It's infectious. But does he have something new to contribute?. Not as much as one would hope. ''I.O.U.'' feels less like a book and more like a lengthy essay that someone might write for The New York Review of Books. 
 ''I.O.U.'' does frame the Great Recession in startlingly original terms. Journalists tend to see the financial mess as a scandal born of hubris and greed. Some economists see it as the handiwork of their obsessively free-market brethren.
 Mr. Lanchester suggests that there are larger cultural forces at play. He traces the roots of the crisis to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Before this transformative moment, he writes, Western democracies kept their banks on a relatively short leash. Otherwise, he says, they might have forfeited whatever moral authority they enjoyed over their Communist foes.
 ''The jet engine of capitalism,'' Mr. Lanchester writes, ''was harnessed to the oxcart of social justice, to much bleating from the advocates of pure capitalism, but with the effect that the Western liberal democracies became the most admirable societies that the world has ever seen.''
 But when the Soviet Union fell, Mr. Lanchester laments, so did the checks and balances on capitalism. After that, he says, the forces of capitalism, particularly the harsher variety practiced in the United States and Britain, held a two-decade-long victory party.
 Emboldened by their triumph, he writes, bankers made shameless demands of their governments and got nearly everything they wanted, including the right to trade dangerously complex securities with virtually no regulation. 
 When Mr. Lanchester delves into the crisis itself, the shortcomings of the book become apparent. He has obviously spent a great deal of time reading and thinking about the debacle. But if you are a student of the crisis, you have probably absorbed much of the same stuff. 
 Mr. Lanchester is fascinated with what he calls an almost mystical belief by Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, in the self-regulating power of the markets, a view that fit perfectly with the post-cold-war mood. The author cleverly deconstructs Mr. Greenspan's now-famous mea culpa before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in the fall of 2008. 
 But Mr. Greenspan's testimony has been much parsed lately. In recent months, I've read books by at least two authors who made the same points as Mr. Lanchester, albeit in less sophisticated prose. 
 Mr. Lanchester's most insightful moments about the financial mess come in his reporting. He visits Baltimore, where thousands of borrowers have had their homes repossessed. Now their credit has been ruined, and many are having trouble renting apartments. 
 The author also spent considerable time talking to bankers, and comes away thinking that they suffer from an exalted opinion of themselves. ''One of our culture's deepest beliefs is expressed in the question, 'If you are so smart, why ain't you rich?' '' he writes. ''But people in finance are rich -- so it logically follows that everything they chose to do must be smart. That was a syllogism followed by too many people in the money business.''
 It's also false. Mr. Lanchester writes that part of the reason many bankers are rich is that their profession has rigged the system. When the markets are good, they make money hand over fist. And when markets collapse? All too often, they are bailed out by the government. 
 Maybe that's just another indication of how smart they are. Or it could be a dangerous moral failure. Mr. Lanchester says it is the latter.
 It would have been nice if Mr. Lanchester had explored the psychology of the people who caused the crash much more deeply. But he decided not to. I have a feeling that he may be saving his best material for his recessionary novel. If so, it should be worth picking up. Until then, ''I.O.U.'' will have to do.

HEADLINE: In Recession, Americans Doing More, Buying Less

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; Marjorie Connelly contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
Rosario and Igor Montoya used to buy, buy, buy for themselves and their two children without a second thought. Expensive sneakers, a new laptop, Legos -- they all got what they wanted. But with the recession slashing the Montoyas' workload and income by more than half, their priorities have shifted from products to activities. 
 After school and on weekends, the family now hops into a pink canoe they bought secondhand. They paddle though Biscayne Bay to nearby islands, naming each, sometimes making boats out of sticks and leaves. 
 ''I'm trying to teach the kids that you don't need to have expensive toys to have fun,'' said Mr. Montoya, 47, an artist and freelance art director in advertising. ''You can make it fun, from anything.'' 
 Quietly but noticeably over the past year, Americans have rejiggered their lives to elevate experiences over things. Because of the Great Recession, a recent New York Times/CBS News poll has found, nearly half of Americans said they were spending less time buying nonessentials, and more than half are spending less money in stores and online.
 But Americans are not just getting by with less. They are also doing more. 
 Some are working longer hours, but a larger proportion, the poll shows, are spending additional time with family and friends, gardening, cooking, reading, watching television and engaging in other hobbies. 
 The Department of Labor's time-use surveys show a similar trend: compared with 2005, Americans spent less time in 2008 buying goods and services and more time cooking or taking part in ''organizational, civic and religious activities.'' 
 Just as tellingly, evidence can also be found in culture. While one new study shows that attendance at museums and cultural events dropped from 2002 to 2008, it has climbed in 2009 at many major institutions, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Art Institute of Chicago. Movie attendance was also up 5 percent in 2009, and in the world of the Walt Disney Company, product sales have declined as the company's theme parks enjoyed a 3 percent increase in visitors last quarter. 
 Even here in Miami, a city famous for its materialism, retailers are hurting while audiences continue to grow at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, at parks and for cheap activities like yoga by the beach. 
 ''It's a different kind of recession,'' said Richard Florida, the author of several best-selling books about the economics of cities. ''It's not like in the '30s when people stopped going to concerts. Now people seem to be keeping up with experience consumption and cutting back on other necessities.''
 Psychologists have been saying for years that shared experiences like vacations lead to more long-term happiness than the latest bauble. And perhaps the change was inevitable -- to be expected when a shopping-spree nation trades a glut of credit for layoffs and furloughs. 
 ''Part of it is cyclical,'' said Scott Hoyt, senior director of consumer economics for Moody's Economy.com. ''They have less money, so they'll spend less time and money shopping, whether they want to or not.'' 
 Still, the New York Times/CBS News poll -- a telephone survey of 855 adults, conducted Nov. 6 to Nov. 8, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points -- found that the shift spanned income brackets. And in interviews, many Americans described motives beyond pure economic necessity. 
 Barbara Koricanek, 73, a retired nurse in rural Texas, said she cut back on shopping after a recent mission trip to Nicaragua made her realize that ''we don't need half of what we got.'' Over the past few months, Ms. Koricanek has started purging her closets and baking bread from scratch, partly because it tastes better, she said, partly to become more independent. 
 ''We cannot rely on money and the banking system and government to come up with all the answers,'' she said. ''People years ago were more self-reliant and were more able to take hold of the reins and do things themselves. I think we need to get back some of those basics.'' 
 Many young people, experiencing their first economic downturn, are also making different choices. Megan Stallings, 25, an investment analyst in Raleigh, N.C., said she first learned to value experiences while studying abroad in college, when the dollar was weak and trips brought her better memories than souvenirs. Now, she said, she spaces out her shopping trips to preserve time for activities. She has even studied how stores organize displays to make people buy more than they need. 
 ''That awareness has saved me a lot of money,'' she said. ''Now I am having fun working on projects around my house, even if it is just pulling weeds or taking my dog, Amos, for a long walk.''
 Those with diminished incomes described activities in slightly different terms: as a distraction from financial fear. Some, like Rebecca Heverin, 57, a former tollbooth collector in South Carolina who now lives on disability payments, have hunkered down with hobbies. Ms. Heverin said she worked on her doll collection at home instead of accepting dinner invitations from neighbors because ''it's kind of embarrassing to be struggling.'' 
 Others have been desperate to get out of the house, though in many cases, what began as psychic necessity ended with deep appreciation. Rosa Claudio, 47, of Chicago, said that since her husband was laid off from his job in construction last year, she and several relatives had made a family ritual out of going to museums. ''It's something we can do for free,'' she said. ''It's enjoyable.''
 The Montoyas, meanwhile, likened canoeing to therapy. ''When you're out there in the water,'' Mr. Montoya said, ''you can think about things openly and freely,'' 
 Only a few years ago, Mr. Montoya and his wife -- who worked as a freelance wardrobe stylist, mainly for Macy's -- had enough disposable income to spend up to $1,000 a month on designer clothes for themselves and their children, Camila, 13, and Diego, 6. But after major advertising cutbacks last year, work practically disappeared. Their lives, they said, were thrown into reverse. 
 First, they told their children that ''we can't spend money every day'' and that they were living on savings and family help. Then they started camping more. And as they hatched plans to start a catering business in the spring, Mr. Montoya discovered a used canoe on Craigslist. 
 He talked the seller down to $150, from $200. ''Money is tight,'' Mr. Montoya said, as he packed a picnic in the boat on a recent Saturday morning. ''But it's worth it.'' 
 There are, of course, potential problems as the United States drops old habits of consumption. On the macro level, economists worry that it could undermine a recovery. And the shift may be temporary: holiday shopping appears to have increased a little in 2009. 
 But in many homes today, experiences have become a more valued element of life. Mr. Hoyt, at Moody'sEconomy.com, said that the behavioral changes were likely to be less transformative than what followed the Depression but that after three decades when consumer spending outpaced gross domestic product, the end of a spendthrift era may be here. 
 Camila Montoya said that even teenagers were now wearing old clothes longer. And for Christmas this year, she said she wanted something different and a little more hands-on: a camera. 
 Her parents gave in only after finding a discount they could afford. 
 ''It's the only present that she got,'' said Mrs. Montoya, 43. ''We didn't want to spend too much money on someone who is 13 years old.''

HEADLINE: Getting Back in Shape For the Job Chase

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI. 
E-mail: thesearch@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE beginning of this new year -- after a very difficult 2009 for job seekers -- offers a good opportunity to review and fine-tune every element of an employment search, from resumes to thank-you notes.
 While you may be doing almost everything right, neglecting or mishandling just one or two pieces of the process could keep you from getting a job, especially in this ultracompetitive market. 
 Here, then, is a checklist that covers some of the major links in the job search chain:
 THE RESUME When was the last time you took a word-by-word, letter-by-letter look at your resume? Make sure it's completely up to date and tailored to the types of jobs you are seeking. (After all, your situation might have changed since you started looking.) Now is also the time to create alternate versions, to reflect different types of positions.
 Have someone else look at your resume. If you cannot afford a career coach, give your resume to friends or family members to scrutinize, said Alison Doyle, a job search specialist for About.com, which is owned by The New York Times Company. 
 Little things count. You could have overlooked a typo or another error. This happens more than you might think, and ''it can knock you right out of the running,'' Ms. Doyle noted. 
 And have copies of your resume printed, so you're ready to hand them out at interviews, she said. 
 REFERENCES If you have not talked to your references lately, call or e-mail them. Make sure they are still in the same jobs, and tell them you're still looking. This helps expand your network, because references may know of job openings. It's also a good time to consider whether to add or remove some people as references.
 COVER LETTERS Maybe you've set up a few basic templates in advance, but that's not enough. Each cover letter you write should be geared specifically to the job for which you are applying.
 WARDROBE Check your closet to ensure that you have appropriate professional attire, including shoes, ready for interviews.
 ONLINE PRESENCE Check and update your LinkedIn profile and make sure that it's consistent with the information in your resume and any other online presence you have, Ms. Doyle said. Hiring managers look at LinkedIn, and any discrepancies could be red flags, she said. 
 Review your contacts on LinkedIn and reach out to new ones. Check whether anyone new can write a recommendation for you on the site.
 And, while you're at it, Google yourself and check Facebook or other social networks to make sure that nothing embarrassing shows up. 
 NETWORKING Do not isolate yourself for days on end. Network , through e-mail messages, phone calls, coffee, lunch, appointments and meetings.
 Julie Morgenstern, a productivity consultant in New York, recommends setting up some kind of in-person meeting every day during the week. This helps bring structure to your day, keeps you in touch with the outside world and prevents you from becoming complacent or depressed, she says. 
 APPLYING A glance at huge online job sites isn't usually the best way to find jobs. You are more likely to succeed through people you know or meet through networking, or through professional or alumni associations.
 When you look for jobs online, Ms. Doyle recommends these sites because they collect job listings from sources like company Web sites: Linkup.com, Indeed.com and Simplyhired.com.
 THE FOLLOW-UP These days, it is common to apply for a job and never hear back from the company. Without being a pest, take the initiative by following up with a phone call a week or so after you apply. If no name is listed on the job posting, use research skills to find one. Or, if you know someone at the company, check whether that person will put in a word for you.
 INTERVIEWS If you are getting plenty of interviews but no return calls or job offers, take a ruthless look at your interviewing skills. This is one area where investing in a career coach may pay off, Ms. Doyle said. But if you can't afford one, try to find a job group or service that conducts free mock interviews. 
 In addition, the same day that you have an interview, make sure to send a thank-you note by e-mail or regular mail. 
 SUPPORT SYSTEMS Finally, recognize that looking for a job -- especially in a market like this -- can take a psychological toll. Don't take it personally if your job hunt is taking a long time. Many excellent job candidates, victims of the economic downturn, are in the same boat now. 
 Even in the best of times, a job hunt is often about rejection -- and that can be hard to endure. Staying in touch with family, friends, professional networks and fellow job seekers can help you maintain a positive attitude and a sense of perspective.
 In this job market, job seekers need all the help they can get, practical or otherwise. ''Don't be afraid to get help if somebody's willing to give it to you,'' Ms. Doyle said.

HEADLINE: Touring the Temples Of German Automaking

BYLINE: By STEPHEN WILLIAMS

DATELINE: STUTTGART, Germany 

 BODY:
 SOME Americans tour Europe not to enjoy the food, or to pay homage to the cathedrals, or to shop on Oxford Street or Boulevard Haussmann. They go to see the museums.
 Which is what I did. Except instead of staring at the art of Rodin, Raphael and Rembrandt, I studied the works of Chris Bangle and Walter de'Silva.
 In the last five years, four leading German automakers -- Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche -- have opened or reworked the museums dedicated to each brand's heritage and history. My plan was to travel across southern Germany in a triangle from Munich (BMW) to Stuttgart (Porsche and Mercedes) to Ingolstadt (Audi) and back to Munich. The total distance was a bit more than 300 miles.
 This trip did not include a visit to Volkswagen's Autostadt (Car City), an ambitious auto theme park dedicated to the history of VW and its subsidiaries. But I had been there previously, and a detour to Wolfsburg -- some 250 miles north of Stuttgart -- would have added considerable time to the tour. 
 I admit that I ate some terrific wurst and schnitzel along the way, visited a monument or two and shopped for face creams for my wife. But much of my time -- a total of five days -- was spent ogling old cars. Also, new cars. Racing cars. Cars that won Grands Prix, cars that rolled on 6 horsepower, cars with roofs and back seats and steel wheels, and cars with none of this. There was also the occasional motorcycle or bus.
 Though I traveled alone, imaginary companions sometimes joined me. Each time a BMW designed by Mr. Bangle passed me on the autobahn -- he was chief of design until February -- his ''flame surface'' body panels came to mind. The view from my Ingolstadt hotel one golden morning revealed not one, not two, but five flavors of the gorgeous Audi A5 shaped by Mr. de'Silva. 
 Devoting a day, give or take, to each museum and the accompanying attractions -- usually a gift shop, bistro or cafe, and a delivery center for people who pick up their new toys at the factory -- I came away with different impressions. ''Cars are cars, all over the world,'' Paul Simon sang. But they're not -- and neither are car museums.
 Aside from the cars within, a couple of these structures are architectural delights in their own right. The huge wedge of the Porsche Museum, created by a small Austrian architecture firm, Delugan Meissl Associated, seems to levitate above rail tracks and access roads. The ''double helix'' Mercedes-Benz Museum, done by a Dutch firm called UN Studio, would have delighted Frank Lloyd Wright with its nine stories of spiraling ramps and terrific views of Stuttgart from the top floors.
 Here, in no particular order, are my findings:
 Porsche Museum
 Let's start with the newest, and perhaps the most radical, of the museum quartet. There is nothing here to diffuse the focus: it's on Porsches, everywhere, all the time. Even the escalator is fast. Since opening last Jan. 31 more than 500,000 people have visited the museum in the Zuffenhausen district of Stuttgart. Above the V-shaped concrete pillars the theme of diagonals is carried inside.
 From the atrium lobby a long escalator ascends -- it has been called ''a stairway to heaven for Porsche enthusiasts'' -- and deposits you in front of an aluminum- body Type 64 racecar, considered the ancestor of all Porsches (if you discount the VW Beetle nearby).
 For those who do museums by the numbers, you'll find the models 356, 917, 911, 550, 924, 928 and so on. One estimate puts the value of all 82 machines on display at about $200 million (and there are about 360 more cars in storage).
 There's no touching, of course, though you want to run your fingers across the sheet metal of the seductive concept, racing and street-legal cars parked along clean white ramps. (Yes, there's a Cayenne S.U.V. here, too).
 Visitors are invited to tour chronologically -- cars are divided into pre- and post-1948 groups -- but no one will scold you if you hop from the 911 Carrera RSR Turbo to the plastic-body 908. Engine noises from a 911, a 550 Spyder and others are piped in. If you can't resist the urge to touch a Porsche, there's a dealership across the street.
 BMW Museum
 To visit this museum is to immerse yourself into BMW's corporate culture. Shaped like a big bowl, the Munich museum is adjacent to the massive hall called BMW World, with the company's unmistakable headquarters -- four skyscrapers in the form of engine cylinders -- just beyond, along with a factory.
 The museum has a certain clinical quality, which seems odd because many BMWs are so, well, sexy. They evoke passion. But while this place is stylish, cleverly arranged and full of those sexy cars, the experience can be rather dry unless you're a committed BMW fan. But my guide, Anne Schmidt-Possiwal, was deliciously animated as she walked me past a kinetic sculpture -- 714 steel balls forming constantly changing car shapes -- and through the seven exhibit ''houses'' linked by a series of ramps, bridges and squares. (Like the other guides I encountered, she spoke perfect English.)
 The approach here is nonlinear, although one exhibit begins with history and BMW's aircraft engine. Other exhibits focus on design, technology, motorsports, motorcycles, BMW brands and a tower that showcases the modern model lines.
 Among the fascinating machines are the Brabham that won Nelson Piquet the 1983 Formula One drivers championship and BMW the constructors' cup, and the stately 502 Baroque Angel of 1954, designed for the autobahns.
 The world's iconic sports sedan, the 1968 BMW 2002, resides under a wash of orange light; across from it is a funky 1955 Isetta, a tiny bubble car powered by a 13-horsepower motorcycle engine. Funkier still is a concept car with a shell made almost entirely of fabric. Something, as they say, for everyone.
 Mercedes-Benz Museum
 Open since 2006, this may be the Louvre of car museums, and it should be: this pioneering automaker's history was enriched by inventors and engineers including Karl Benz, Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach.
 And while the inventor of the automobile may forever be a matter of debate -- Benz's case is a certainly strong one -- there's no question that in Germany Mercedes-Benz invented the modern car museum. It came in 1936, 10 years after the merger of Benz & Cie. and DMG created Daimler-Benz. That first museum was on the factory grounds in the Unterturkheim section of Stuttgart, commemorating the 50th anniversary of Benz's 3-wheel Patent Motorwagen.
 This latest museum, chronicling 124 years of auto history in 1,500 exhibits, is an architectural tour de force. (It has been featured in Mercedes commercials in the United States.)
 It is also rich in anecdotes: my guide, Volker Luckenkemper, pointed out the four ashtrays in a 1950s era limo. ''After the war,'' he said, ''Germany had three times more smokers than before it.'' If you take the ''time capsule'' elevator up eight stories, you alight in 1886 to be greeted by a horse. It's all downhill, and fast-forward, from there.
 Unlike the other museums, the blocky, postmodern, Guggenheimesque house of Mercedes places its vehicles in perspective with their time. Lining the interior and the spiraling ramps that descend though the ages of the marque are photographs and picture tableaus, some of them profound (Hitler, Einstein, the Titanic) and others less so (Elvis, Mickey Mouse). But all point to humankind's turbulent history as it paralleled the development of cars from the Patent Motorwagen of 1886 up to the Mercedes SLS AMG that made its debut in September at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
 The sense of Mercedes-Benz authority is especially felt among the racecars, exemplified by the indomitable ''Silver Arrows'' of the 1930s. Among these is the W25 Grand Prix racer of 1934 that became the stuff of legend when, reportedly, its white paint (Germany's race color) was sanded off at the Nurburgring racecourse so the car would make the race's weight qualification. Voila! The white car became silver.
 Audi's Mobile Museum
 Every enthusiast has a favorite German brand, and in the interest of full disclosure, I'll admit mine is Audi. For those of similar persuasion, the Mobile Museum will not disappoint.
 As at Mercedes, the visitor strolls top to bottom, down four floors, following a timeline of the company through the four brands that formed it: Horch, DKW, Wanderer and Audi -- initially called Auto Union -- in 1932. (A fifth company, NSU, was added in the 1960s.) Audi was liquidated after World War II and its factory in Zwickau, in eastern Germany, was taken by the Soviets. But buoyed by Germany's economic rise in the mid-'50s, Audi re-emerged. Daimler- Benz owned Audi for seven years before VW gained control in the mid-1960s. The Audi 100 was the first model to reach the United States, in 1970.
 There is convincing evidence that VW has had a powerful influence on Audi, which celebrated its centennial in 2009. But the early models also showed a sense of grace: the elegant 12-cylinder Horch 670 limousine looks fast even planted in a museum. The striking midengine R8 sports car carries the theme to the present.
 If vorsprung durch technik (advancement through technology) resonates with you, there's plenty of that on view. In the 1920s, Audi was the first German company to begin series production of left-hand-drive cars, to provide a better view of oncoming traffic. (Germans always drove on the right, even when their cars had right-hand drive.)
 More examples of the company's technology advances include a pair of 1980s Audi quattro coupes and the R15 TDI that finished second in 2009 at the 24 Hours of LeMans (after a string of Audi victories with the R8 and R10). It's easy to spend a full day at the Audi complex, since it offers various factory tours, a gift shop and a cafeteria with soups, pastas, Bavarian desserts and, of course, those schnitzels.

HEADLINE: My American Friends

BYLINE: By GEOFF DYER. 
Geoff Dyer's latest book is a novel, ''Jeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi.''

 BODY:
The first thing I ever heard about Americans was that they all carried guns. Then, when I came across people who'd had direct contact with this ferocious-sounding tribe, I learned that they were actually rather friendly. At university, friends who had traveled in the United States came back with more detailed stories, not just of the friendliness of Americans but also of their hospitality (which, in our quaint English way, was translated into something close to gullibility). When I finally got to America myself, I found that not only were the natives friendly and hospitable, they were also incredibly polite. No one tells you this about Americans, but once you notice it, it becomes one of their defining characteristics, especially when they're abroad. 
 This is very strange, or at least it says something strange about the way that perception routinely conforms to the preconceptions it would appear to contradict. The archetypal American abroad is perceived as loud and crass even though actually existing American tourists are distinguished by the way they address bus drivers and bartenders as ''sir'' and are effusive in their thanks when any small service is rendered. We look on with some confusion at these encounters because, on the one hand, the Americans seem a bit country-bumpkinish, and, on the other, good manners are a form of sophistication. 
 Granted, these visiting Americans often seem to have loud voices, but on closer examination, it's a little subtler than that. Americans have no fear of being overheard. Civic life in Britain is predicated on the idea that everyone just about conceals his loathing of everyone else. To open your mouth is to risk offending someone. So we mutter and mumble as if surrounded by informers or, more exactly, as if they are living in our heads. In America the right to free speech is exercised freely and cordially. The basic assumption is that nothing you say will offend anyone else because, deep down, everyone is agreed on the premise that America is better than anyplace else. No such belief animates British life. On the contrary. A couple of years ago a survey indicated that British Muslims were the most fed-up of any in Europe: a sign, paradoxically, of profound assimilation. 
 If the typical American interaction involves an ostensibly contradictory mixture of the formal (politeness), the casual and the cordial, what happens when one moves beyond the transactional? Like many Europeans, I always feel good about myself in America; I feel appreciated, liked. It took a while to realize that this had nothing to do with me. It was about the people who made me feel this way: it was about charm. Yes, this is the bright secret of life in the United States: Americans are not just friendly and polite -- they are also charming. And the most charming thing of all is that it rarely looks like charm. The French put a rather charmless emphasis on charm, are consciously or unconsciously persuaded that it is either part of a display of sophistication or -- and it may amount to the same thing -- a tool in the service of seduction.
 You can see all of this in operation on flights back across the Atlantic from America to Euroland. At first we are under the spell of America. Instead of plunking ourselves down next to someone without a word, we say ''Hi.'' Maybe even indulge in a little conversation, though this American readiness to chat is counterbalanced by the fear that once we've got into a conversation we might not be able to extricate ourselves from it. By the time we're mid-ocean, a kind of preparatory freeze has set in. As the flight stacks up in the inevitable holding pattern over Heathrow, we begin to revert to our muttering and moaning national selves. But, for a week or so after landing, a form of what might be called Ameristalgia makes us conscious of a rudeness in British life -- a coarsening in the texture of daily life -- that had hitherto seemed quite normal. 
 For example. I pay a considerable sum of money to play indoors at Islington Tennis Centre. Eighty percent of the time, the next people to play indicate that your time is up by unzipping their racket covers and strolling on court, without saying a word, without a smile, without acknowledging your existence except as an impediment. In America that would be not just unacceptable but inconceivable.
 What is the relevance of this anecdotal trivia to a serious debate about the status of America in the world? 
 Most of my American friends were depressed and gloomy about the Bush years. Several said that if Bush were re-elected in 2004, they would leave the country. He was and they didn't. The bottom line is that given the choice, Americans love it rather than leave it. Day to day, American life remained as pleasant as could be expected, even in the midst of considerable economic hardship. There was even a bonding, anti-Bush feeling similar to the kind of consensual opposition that we experienced under Margaret Thatcher. A visiting American artist like Patti Smith found that while the usual torrent of name-dropping -- Rimbaud, Mapplethorpe, Kerouac et al. -- got a smattering of appreciative applause, a single gibe about Bush brought the house down. 
 At the same time, either sterling went up or the dollar went down (I don't really understand this stuff), and as a consequence, Americans felt poor when they visited our rainy little island. So, for a brief period, we felt richer -- planeloads of us went to Mannahatta and bought up everything in sight -- and ideologically and ethically superior. Man, that felt good. We had a less blinkered attitude to Israel, didn't drive big gas-guzzling S.U.V.'s, and if we were chilly of an evening we put on a sweater rather than turning up the heating (or, more accurately, turning off the A.C.). Sure, Blair went along with invading Iraq, but wasn't that partly because he hoped to restrain the crusading fundamentalism of Bush? Now the dollar is back up -- or down, or whichever it is -- Europe is no longer expensive, and with the election of Barack Obama, the brief cushion of political superiority has been permanently deflated. 
 The Obama election was a real kick in the teeth, because although we Britons still seethe with class hatred, we pride ourselves on our highly evolved attitude to the question of race that has consistently undermined the American dream. The slight problem is that racial intermingling in Britain is most conspicuous in the ethnically diverse makeup of the groups of yobs -- Asian, black and white -- who exercise their antisocial behavioral skills without any kind of discrimination as to whom they happen to be terrorizing. In this regard, as in so many others, we seem to be leading from the bottom up. 
 Across the board, the grounds for all our feelings of superiority have been steadily whittled away. It turns out that the qualities that make us indubitably British -- that is, the ones that we don't share with or have not imported from America -- are no longer conducive to Greatness. They actually add up to a kind of ostrich stoicism that, though it can be traced back to our finest hour (the blitz, the Battle of Britain), manifests itself in a peculiar compromise: a highly stylized willingness to muddle on, to put up with poor quality and high prices (restaurants, trains), to proffer (and accept) apologies not as a prelude to but as a substitute for improvement. We may not enjoy the way things are, but we endure them in a way that seems either quaint or quasi-Soviet to American visitors. 
 A tiny example. There's a fashionable gastro pub near where I live. You scrum at the bar, desperate to get the attention of the barman. After a while, he will raise his eyebrows and glare at you. Unschooled in our rough ways, a visitor from America might assume he is being threatened, but actually the glare means that your order can now be taken -- as long as you're quick about it. When a friend from California had managed to order, he was handed the credit card terminal, which showed the amount and the option to add something for service. Americans are predisposed to tip, but my friend was slightly taken aback because, far from being in receipt of anything that might be described as service, it felt as if he had been fighting for a place aboard the last lifeboat on the Titanic. ''Welcome to England,'' I said.

HEADLINE: The Time May Be Ripe for Party-Switching, but Its Risks Are Apparent

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Periods of intense partisanship and turmoil occasionally lead to a smattering of Congressional party-switching. But changing affiliation is no guarantee of political survival. Just ask ex-Representative Michael P. Forbes of New York.
 Before the recent decision by Representative Parker Griffith of Alabama to change his Congressional jersey, Mr. Forbes had been the last House member to abandon the majority for the minority. But back in 1999, Mr. Forbes, a three-term lawmaker, went the opposite direction of Mr. Griffith, sliding from the Republican column to the smaller Democratic side, saying his party had become too narrow and intolerant.
 ''A lot of people at the time thought something was clearly wrong with me,'' Mr. Forbes, now a lobbyist, said in an interview, recounting how he gave up a desirable slot on the Appropriations Committee. ''On the political landscape, a lot of people just thought it was a dumb move.'' 
 Not only did Mr. Forbes become the bane of Republicans overnight, but there were plenty of Democrats who did not want him either. Republicans, eager to discourage other potential defectors, ganged up on him in the Democratic primary in 2000. He lost by a handful of votes to a retired school librarian, who then lost the general election.
 Mr. Forbes's experience is not uncommon. About one-third of the 16 United States representatives who switched since 1980 lost the next election for either their House seat or another office. Others, however, have become influential and admired members of their new party. 
 Party-switchers have fared better in the Senate, though Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who defected to the Democrats after his vote for the economic stimulus bill proved unpopular back home, is facing re-election challenges from both the right and the left.
 Mr. Griffith, the first-term lawmaker who signed on with Republicans last month, can probably relate to Mr. Forbes at the moment. He has outraged Democratic colleagues who cannot fathom that he jumped ship less than a year into his first term after the party invested in his initial election. Democrats are casting about for a top-tier opponent for their ex-candidate.
 At the same time, some Republicans in Alabama are not eager to have Mr. Griffith as a new member of their club, saying his regular votes for Democratic initiatives -- not to mention his supporting Nancy Pelosi for speaker at the start of 2009 -- show that he is not conservative enough at a time when the party is looking for true-blue Republicans.
 Party strategists in Washington say they expect Mr. Griffith to hang on in his district and become a dependable Republican vote, even though he is taking a pounding at the moment. They say that his decision to abandon the majority party shows just how frustrated conservative and centrist Democrats are with their party's direction. They hope to persuade a few more to cross the aisle.
 ''Nancy Pelosi's decision to move her extreme agenda against the will of the American people has alienated a number of members within her own caucus to the point they are opting for retirement or even willing to switch parties,'' said Ken Spain, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee.
 If they are able to bag another Democrat or two, Republicans could claim a sense of momentum as they enter 2010, a welcome shift for them after losing the last two special House elections. And they have made some interesting overtures, with Senator John McCain of Arizona reaching out to Representative Christopher Carney of Pennsylvania, a Democrat and fellow naval officer, to ask him to consider a change.
 But party-switching is a delicate and typically secretive process, and the first move usually has to come from the switcher. Republicans risk losing potential conquests if they get too aggressive and public. And despite obvious unrest among more-conservative Democrats about the difficult environment lying ahead in the midterm elections, only the most optimistic Republicans anticipate a wave of defections.
 But Mr. Griffith's move, which came after a poll showed him in re-election trouble, certainly caught the attention of Democrats. They moved quickly to take the temperature of other House Democrats considered potential Republican targets, including Representatives Bobby Bright, Mr. Griffith's fellow Alabamian; Travis W. Childers of Mississippi; and Walt Minnick of Idaho. Along with Mr. Carney, the Democrats indicated they were not contemplating a change.
 Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said he believed that Mr. Griffith could have won re-election as a Democrat and that the lawmaker miscalculated. He does not anticipate more desertions.
 ''People don't like finger-to-the-wind politicians,'' Mr. Van Hollen said. ''I am very confident that we are not going to see any more people switching parties.''
 Mr. Forbes remains comfortable with his move and noted that even some Republican friends who ostracized him at the time eventually came around. But his advice on party-switching is to make the decision based on true philosophical reasons, not political expediency.
 ''I thought about it for more than a year, and intensely for more than six months,'' Mr. Forbes said, recalling his deliberations. ''And I was probably naive to believe some factions were not going to be as hostile as they ended up being. It was rough.
 ''But my life has gone in a direction now that basically confirms every day that it was the right decision for me.''

HEADLINE: States of Conflict: An Update

BYLINE: By IAN LIVINGSTON, HEATHER MESSERA, MICHAEL O'HANLON and AMY UNIKEWICZ. 
Ian Livingston and Heather Messera are researchers at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Michael O'Hanlon is a senior fellow there and the author of ''The Science of War.'' Amy Unikewicz is a graphic designer in South Norwalk, Conn.

 BODY:
In 2009, Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan dominated American military and foreign policy. Which themes emerged over the last year? 
 In Iraq, 2009 was the year of relatively smooth transitions. Despite catastrophic attacks in August, October and December, and a continuing level of violence that keeps it a troubled place by normal standards, the year went reasonably well in statistical terms. Violence did not increase, even as United States forces left the cities and generally reduced their role. 
 In Pakistan, 2009 was the year of the offensives. The country was still very turbulent, but major government military initiatives in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan reflected a new determination against the Pakistani Taliban. Unfortunately, the Taliban responded in its own brutal way with an intensification of suicide attacks against civilians, killing hundreds. 
 But momentum may be shifting to the government's side -- helped by successful American drone attacks against top Taliban and Qaeda leaders. That said, in terms of the basic strength of its economy and society, Pakistan is far from out of the woods.
 In Afghanistan, 2009 was the year of decisions -- by President Obama, of course, by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal and by the Afghan people as they re-elected Hamid Karzai as president. Afghanistan had a bloody year, with more than 300 Americans and some 500 international troops, as well as more than 1,000 Afghan security personnel, losing their lives. 
 However, as General McChrystal noted in recent Congressional testimony following President Obama's decision to raise troop levels in Afghanistan, our operations have begun to change the momentum in parts of the country -- though this momentum is bound to be halting, as last week's horrific suicide bombing at a United States base made painfully clear. In the year ahead, the hope is that this fragile progress will continue, and that President Karzai will justify American support by accelerating his efforts to reform the Afghan police force and to root out corruption.

HEADLINE: No-Commoner Obama

BYLINE: By MATT BAI. 
Matt Bai writes about national politics for the magazine.

 BODY:
There was something discordant, even tinny, about Barack Obama's attempt to castigate Wall Street last month. No doubt the president was trying to acknowledge and channel the resentments in his own party -- and in the country -- when he told CBS's Steve Kroft during a ''60 Minutes'' interview, ''I did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat-cat bankers on Wall Street.'' Yet the rhetorical slap felt a little flat. In part it was the oddity of the epithet, a musty Washington cliche that had the effect of making Obama, the most urbane president in a half-century, sound as if he belonged in some black-and-white talkie from the '40s. Why, listen here: I oughtta pound you -- and all your fat-cat pals!
 But it was also Obama's body language, the dutiful way in which he delivered the line and elaborated on it, that gave the impression of a dapper man trying on an ill-fitting suit. When the president sat down for an amiable conversation with a group of those very same fat cats the next day, it only reinforced the impression among disenchanted Democrats that Obama shows more deference to moneyed interests than he does to liberals. 
 Go to any Democratic enclave in Washington these days, and you will hear the same complaint: Obama isn't a real progressive, and not only because his economic team, culled mostly from Wall Street, boasts an elite pedigree. Union leaders are incensed over the administration's ambivalence toward a bill that would make it easier to organize workers. Black lawmakers accuse Obama of doing little to stem unemployment among the poor. Liberals in Congress are appalled that the president has jettisoned the ''public option'' he once championed for his health care plan, which has only temporarily distracted them from their fury over the military buildup in Afghanistan. The left is on the verge of full revolt. 
 For any Democratic president of the modern era, of course, such a state of affairs is about as predictable and unavoidable as repeats of ''Law and Order.'' Going back to the 1960s, a succession of Democrats have had to navigate two currents -- on one side, the movement liberals who embrace social justice as their guiding cause, and on the other, more moderate coalition builders. Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton both identified more with the moderates than with the liberals and paid the price. Carter faced a challenge from his left, in the person of Ted Kennedy, during his 1980 re-election bid, and Clinton's legacy of ''triangulation'' haunted his wife's candidacy last year. Obama has long managed to plant himself in both camps, by virtue of his rhetoric and his resume. In his writings, Obama casts himself as a flexible idealist, a less-partisan Democrat who rejected the dogmas of the '60s generation. But largely because of his early stance against the Iraq war, and because he was a onetime community organizer and the first African-American president, liberals felt certain that he had to be, at heart, one of them.
 By the definition of the word as it came to be used in the early part of the 20th century, Obama is indisputably in the progressive tradition. Like both Roosevelts and Woodrow Wilson, he has pursued financial regulation -- radical by the standards of the last two presidents -- that would seek to temper the power of the markets without controlling them. His recalibration of campaign fund-raising, achieved through the triumph of small-dollar donations over the influence of lobbyists and corporations, would have delighted progressives like Robert La Follete, who fought in their day for women's suffrage and the direct election of senators. And Obama's relentless pursuit of health care reform, even at the expense of provisions that liberals held sacred, may well place him alongside F.D.R. and Lyndon Johnson in the pantheon of progressive presidents who were able to substantially amend the nation's social contract.
 What Obama is not, at least not by temperament, is a populist. This is why digressions like his ''fat cat'' moment come off sounding forced and why a lot of liberal activists find his governing style disconcerting. In the last decade of Democratic politics, going back to Al Gore's theme of ''the people versus the powerful,'' the party has rediscovered its populist voice in domestic policy, a strident counter to the pro-Wall Street policies of the Clinton era and the corporatist culture of the Bush years. 
 What so many liberal critics really want in a Democratic president now is someone who will denounce the wealthy and punish the barons of industry (and insurance). Exasperated by the old notion of a rising tide that lifts all boats, something that turned out not to be true in the era of globalization, the left demands confrontation and contrast, and, at almost every juncture, Obama gives them compromise and complexity instead.
 A year into Obama's presidency, it is no longer inconceivable, if still unlikely, that he could face a challenge within his own party in 2012, especially if Democrats suffer sizable losses next November. (When Howard Dean made a point of trying to scuttle health care reform altogether, was he simply trying to get a better bill, or was he setting himself up as a populist insurgent?) And yet, history would suggest that it is the progressive, and not his populist antagonist, who makes change palatable and, in doing so, alters the trajectory of the country. William Jennings Bryan remains something of a patron saint to the economic populists, but it was Theodore Roosevelt who channeled the popular unrest of the day into a movement away from unbridled corporatism. And it is T.R.'s distant cousin Franklin, not contemporaries like Huey Long, who is celebrated for having made the New Deal the guiding framework for 60 years of American government. If today's liberals are serious about calling themselves progressives, then they may yet have to give up on the ideal of a president who enthusiastically excoriates fat cats -- settling instead for a leader who is serious and methodical about reforming their ways. 
 20% of liberal Democrats say that Obama listens to liberals in his party more than moderates.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 17, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Jan. 3 that evaluated President Obama's policies in the context of progressivism misspelled the surname of a historical political figure with whom Obama was compared. He was Robert La Follette, not La Follete.

HEADLINE: The Trade Seesaw

BYLINE: By HANNAH FAIRFIELD

 BODY:
The faltering economy provided the United States with at least one silver lining: a narrowing of the trade gap. In 2006, that gap had grown so large that Warren Buffett warned it was a bigger threat to the domestic economy than either the federal budget deficit or consumer debt. The bursting of the housing bubble and the ensuing credit crisis caused consumer spending to drop abruptly, and imports plunged as a result. Exports fell as well, but not as sharply, so the trade gap shrank from $65 billion in May 2006 to $26 billion in May 2009. 
 But as economists have noted, when the economy began to recover last fall, the trade deficit began to rise again as consumers felt freer to spend money on flat-screen TV's and other luxury items, many of which come from China. Last month, President Obama cautioned that the lopsided trade relationship with China could put enormous economic and political strain on the two countries.
 In October, the most recent data available, the gap grew to $33 billion, and many economists are concerned it will keep expanding as the recovery continues.
 New York
 The city's largest export category was precious stones and metals, at $33 billion. This was also the largest import category, at $32 billion, as the city is a center for grading and cutting diamonds. Electric machinery was also a top export, at $13 billion.
 Detroit
 Vehicle exports totaled $29 billion, but Detroit also had the most nuclear reactor machinery exports, at $21 billion. Both types lost ground in 2008.
 Los Angeles
 The trade imbalance here was stark in 2008: $322 billion imported and $110 billion exported. The bulk of exports to China and other Asian countries was energy sector equipment, airplanes and medical instruments.
 New Orleans
 The city exported $10 billion of cereals and grains, and $11 billion in mineral fuels and oil.

HEADLINE: For Shanghai Fair, World-Famous Fund-Raiser Comes Through

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and DAVID BARBOZA; Mark Landler reported from Washington, and David Barboza from Shanghai.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In the hectic last week before she became secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton squeezed in a Bon Jovi benefit concert in New York, part of a frantic effort to pay off the debt from her presidential campaign. No sooner had she arrived at the State Department than Mrs. Clinton discovered she needed to start raising money all over again.
 This time, the cash-starved beneficiary was not her own campaign but the United States, which needed $61 million to finance the construction of a national pavilion at a world's fair in Shanghai. Under federal law, no public money could be used for the project. And Mrs. Clinton, as a federal official, could no longer solicit private financial donations herself.
 So she turned to her well-established network of Clinton fund-raisers, and after negotiating with the State Department's lawyers about what she could legally do herself to support the project, she mounted an ambitious fund-raising campaign that has netted close to $54 million in barely nine months. 
 With multimillion-dollar pledges from PepsiCo, General Electric, Chevron and other American corporations, the United States is on track to open a sleek, 60,000-square-foot pavilion at the Shanghai Expo 2010, which runs from May through October.
 The prospect of the nation's chief diplomat asking for money worried government lawyers, according to officials. Referring to the first secretary of state, one lawyer asked, ''Would Thomas Jefferson do this?'' They imposed strict limits on the kinds of calls or other contacts she could make, allowing her to promote the pavilion but prohibiting any one-on-one appeals for cash.
 Despite those restrictions, and a dismal economy, Mrs. Clinton is closing in on her $61 million goal. She is clearly proud of the effort, which staved off what could have been a rupture in American-Chinese relations. In a year in which she has mostly worked to prove herself a loyal member of the Obama team, the campaign also showcases her enduring political drawing power.
 ''The idea, for many people, of raising more than $50 million would seem really daunting,'' Mrs. Clinton said in an interview. ''Maybe because I had participated in raising so much money in the past, I wasn't daunted by it. I knew it was going to be hard under the circumstances.''
 By all accounts, the effort to build a national pavilion was near death at the end of the Bush administration. The near-collapse of the global economy, the proximity of the expo to the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and the general ambivalence of the State Department had left U.S.A. Pavilion, the nonprofit group in charge of the project, with little support or money.
 ''There is a sense in the U.S. that Americans got disenchanted'' with world's fairs, said Nick Winslow, a former Warner Brothers executive who is the president of U.S.A. Pavilion.
 With deadlines passing, the Chinese advanced the Americans money to conduct technical work for the pavilion. They raised the issue with former President Jimmy Carter when he visited China last January.
 Enter Mrs. Clinton, who made her first trip as secretary of state to Beijing in February and was eager to talk about trade, climate change and the North Korean nuclear threat. Instead, she got an earful about how bad it would be if the United States did not have a presence at the Shanghai Expo. 
 For the Chinese, the expo is a bookend to the Olympics. Shanghai is spending $45 billion to transform the city, even more than Beijing spent preparing for the Games. Nearly 200 countries have signed on to take part, leaving only the United States and minuscule Andorra as potential no-shows.
 ''I was dumbfounded that so little attention had been paid to it,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''Everyone knows China is going to be an enormously powerful player in the 21st century. They have an expo, which is a kind of rite of passage that countries like to do to show they have arrived. We're not there? What does that say?''
 She said she did not relish the prospect of more fund-raising -- ''When would it ever end?'' she recalled asking herself -- but she promised Chinese officials that she would try to raise the money. 
 There was little support within the State Department. So Mrs. Clinton turned to two major fund-raisers with long ties to the Clinton family: Elizabeth F. Bagley and Jose H. Villarreal.
 Mrs. Bagley, who is married to Smith Bagley, an heir to the R. J. Reynolds fortune, was ambassador to Portugal under President Bill Clinton. Mrs. Clinton appointed her to be the department's special representative for global partnerships, a job that involves rounding up private support for public projects.
 Mr. Villarreal, a well-connected San Antonio lawyer, has raised money for Mrs. Clinton as well as for Mr. Clinton, former Vice President Al Gore and Senator John Kerry. In July, Mrs. Clinton named him the commissioner general to the expo.
 To kick off the effort, Mrs. Clinton held a conference call with 10 prominent chief executives. Chevron, PepsiCo and General Electric each pledged $5 million. Indra K. Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo, made calls to other chief executives. Mrs. Bagley and Mr. Villarreal also opened their Rolodexes, calling companies with operations in China. Some obvious prospects, like banks, were off limits because they were receiving federal bailout money.
 ''In the beginning, we had to use a patriotism argument,'' said Kris M. Balderston, Mrs. Bagley's deputy. ''The second wave of argument was commercial diplomacy. All of a sudden the companies understood it would be good for them.''
 Although Mrs. Bagley is a State Department employee, she said she was advised that she could solicit contributions. She noted that every would-be donor also had to be vetted by lawyers. 
 Fred Wertheimer, an advocate for stricter regulations for campaign fund-raising, said he was satisfied that the State Department had handled a difficult situation properly.
 ''It would have been far better if the U.S. government was able to pay for the activity involved, but that does not appear to have been the case,'' he said.
 While Mrs. Clinton was barred from soliciting individuals, she met with corporate sponsors in Shanghai in November, when she visited the expo site. 
 Her experience in the political trenches made a difference, Mr. Villarreal said. ''Any other diplomat would not have had the broad base of contacts,'' he said.
 Mrs. Clinton said it was easier raising funds for this project than to pay off campaign debt. ''I'm much better at raising money for other people and other causes than I am for myself anyway,'' she said, adding, ''Even though I've obviously raised a lot of money.''

HEADLINE: Avoiding a Japanese Decade

 BODY:
Thankfully, 2009 ended better than it began. Economists talk about green shoots of recovery taking hold. Consumer confidence has improved. Equity markets have soared. But for all the progress, the American economy remains extremely vulnerable. 
 To understand those economic risks, it is worth considering Japan's experience in the 1990s. A bursting housing bubble there sparked a banking crisis that was followed by a decade of economic stagnation. 
 The Japanese government lacked the resolve to do what was necessary. It failed to fix its banks and stopped its early fiscal stimulus before recovery had taken hold, leaving the economy all too vulnerable to outside shocks, including the Asian currency crisis and the dot-com collapse in 2001. Japan's annual growth rate -- which had averaged 4 percent since 1973 -- slowed to less than 1 percent, on average, from 1992 to 2003. 
 President Obama's economic advisers have learned from Japan's experience. But they may not have learned enough. (Certainly Congress has not been paying attention.) If they are not careful, they could end up repeating some of the big mistakes that condemned Japan's economy to a lost decade. 
 The green shoots are barely out of the ground and Republicans and conservative Democrats in Congress are already demanding that the administration ''do something'' to cut the budget gap. We worry that the political drumbeat may be too hard to resist. In 1997, after three years of tepid growth, the Japanese government stopped its stimulus: it raised a consumption tax, ended a temporary income tax cut, increased social security premiums and nipped recovery in the bud. 
 Japan's other blunder was its unwillingness to fix its banks. Regulators did not force banks and indebted firms to recognize trillions of yen worth of bad loans. Banks trundled along like zombies, squandering credit to keep insolvent firms on their feet. When the Asian currency crisis hit, many undercapitalized banks toppled over. 
 The Obama administration has not been quite as forgiving with the banks, but it still has been nowhere near aggressive enough. The regulatory reform meant to curb bankers' destructive risk-taking is moving at a snail's pace through Congress. While the Treasury has forced banks to raise capital, many -- including some of the largest -- remain thinly capitalized and weak. 
 Banks have been unwilling to sell bad assets and take a loss. They remain stuffed with risky commercial and residential mortgages and consumer debt. Bankers, meanwhile, have made things worse by insisting on paying themselves huge bonuses after profiting so handsomely from the taxpayers' tolerance and largess. 
 There are two big problems with that. The bankers' taste for risk has not been in any way quenched. And the American public is, justifiably, fed up. That means if there is another bank crisis -- say when the Federal Reserve takes away the punch bowl of low interest rates -- it will be a lot harder to get Congress to approve another bailout, no matter how necessary. 
 The Obama administration has still done a far better job -- up to now -- in addressing the crisis than Japan's governments did. As dismal as 2009 was, it pales when compared with what would have happened without the fiscal stimulus and the Fed's enormous monetary boost. 
 The White House is now pushing another mini-stimulus plan for next year. Chances are it will need to do a lot more to push reform and boost the economy. If there is an overarching lesson from Japan's lost decade, it is that half measures don't pay.

HEADLINE: In Cuba's Time Capsule, an Automotive Legacy

BYLINE: By TOM COTTER

DATELINE: Havana 

 BODY:
 EXCEPT for the security guards toting machine guns, this could have been any Caribbean island airport. 
 Until we walked outside, that is. Then it was apparent that we had either entered a time machine or landed in Cuba. 
 Actually, it was both.
 As we left the terminal, the taxi lane was crowded with vehicles I hadn't seen since childhood. Brightly colored American cars, all built before 1960, crowded the passenger pick-up area. It's a time warp created by the suspension of trade between Cuba and the United States after Fidel Castro's revolutionaries took control in 1959, cutting off the flow of new American cars. 
 That was no drawback to a group of five automotive historians, including me, who had been invited here to research the Cuban Grand Prix sports car races of 50 years ago. 
 In particular, we hoped to learn more about the 1960 race for a 50th anniversary celebration to be held in March at the Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance in Florida. The race was won by Stirling Moss in a Maserati Tipo 61, known as a Birdcage; both Moss and the winning Maserati will attend the March 14 concours. (Full disclosure: I am co-chairman of the event.)
 Our host for the research mission was Eduardo Mesejo Maestre, curator of the Deposito del Automovil, the country's official antique car museum. Our group had received Treasury Department permission to travel directly to Havana from Miami on cultural exchange visas. Call it spark plug diplomacy.
 From the airport we went straight to the Deposito, housed in a open-air warehouse in the heart of Havana's historic district. We had hoped to see Castro's personal cars on display in this former navy facility, but that was not the case. 
 Castro's cars, it turns out, are stored in a warehouse at Communist Party Central Headquarters, Mr. Mesejo told us; the museum's collection comprises about 40 cars, trucks and motorcycles that represent the last 100 years of Cuba's automotive history.
 Just past the admission desk -- admission is one CUC, or Cuban Convertible Peso, or about $1.08 -- visitors are greeted by a 1926 Rolls-Royce Phantom I with coachwork by Letourneur & Marchand of France. We were told this car was found abandoned after the 1959 revolution and kept safe by the government until the museum opened in 1980.
 The Rolls, like all of the cars on display, is not the sort of pristine example seen in most modern museums. The vehicles are well used and unrestored, but clean. Mr. Mesejo told us the cars were given a daily sponge bath to remove the potentially caustic dust that blows in from nearby building renovations.
 The Deposito is arranged in two large rooms. The first room allows visitors to get close to the cars. In the second room, velvet ropes keep visitors at a distance. All informational placards are written in Spanish, so a translation guide is needed when the only English-speaking person on the staff, Mr. Mesejo, is not available.
 While some auto museums apply faux finishes to give floors and walls a patina of period correctness, the Deposito's concrete, stucco and painted surfaces are authentic. The rough-hewn building reeks of character.
 Most of the cars in the collection are American, including a Chevy touring car and Model T and Model A Fords. Against the back wall are two 1959 Oldsmobiles, one originally owned by Camilo Cienfuegos, a revolutionary leader considered a hero by his countrymen. The few European cars include a 1953 MG TD, a 1920s Fiat (discovered hidden behind a secret wall in a mansion) and a bright red Alfa Romeo roadster. 
 ''I know that car from when I was a child,'' Mr. Mesejo said of the Alfa. ''My father would not let me stand any closer than one meter from it, which is very hard for a little boy. When it came here to the museum, I sat in it for an hour.''
 Some of the newer cars -- a 1970s Daimler and a 1980s Chevy -- were left to the museum as gifts by departing foreign diplomats.
 The museum's most important car is a 1905 Cadillac, which was in continuous use until the 1980s. The Cadillac is now being restored, the first such project for the museum. Much of the technical information needed for its restoration came from collectors in Philadelphia. 
 Fords and Oldsmobiles were assembled on the island in the 1940s and '50s, Mr. Mesejo said. ''After the Revolution the car companies left, and Cuba, as an auto assembly country, was paralyzed.''
 We were told of the country's dire economy, where street sweepers and doctors make the same wages. So auto repair for the island's vintage cars becomes a creative endeavor: shampoo is used for brake fluid; iron pipes are cut up for piston rings; Coca-Cola is used to loosen rusty bolts; and cars are painted with sponges, then buffed with toothpaste.
 ''We call it the Cuban way,'' Abel Contreras de la Guardia, our translator and tour guide, said. ''We do anything to keep our cars running.''
 Besides hoping to one day display the personal cars of Fidel and Raul Castro, as well as the Chevrolet Impala of Che Guevara, Mr. Mesejo said he would like to secure what is perhaps Cuba's most important car.
 ''I have seen Ernest Hemingway's 1955 Chrysler New Yorker convertible,'' he said. ''It is hidden, but it is still in the country and still restorable.''
 Front and center in the museum's second room is a replica of the 1960 Maserati raced by Juan Manuel Fangio, the five-time world champion. If this bright blue sports car were real, it would be worth millions of dollars, but this one was cobbled together from Citroen parts for a movie about Fangio. It was donated to the museum after filming was completed. 
 Parked next to the fiberglass Maserati is a car that holds special meaning for Mr. Mesejo: a plain-looking dark brown 1953 Dodge sedan. 
 ''That was my father's,'' he said of the car he inherited. ''With this I learned to drive and work on cars.
 ''This car never let our family down.''
 Deposito del Automovil is at Oficios No. 13, Habana Vieja, C.P. 10100, La Habana, Cuba. Hours: Tuesday-Saturday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Sunday 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 10, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the Deposito del Automovil, Cuba's antique auto museum, referred incorrectly to a car in the collection. It is a replica of a Maserati racecar driven by Juan Manuel Fangio, the five-time world champion, in 1957, not 1960.

HEADLINE: Buying a Share of Victory. Or Not.

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
How do you pay for a war? The question re-emerged in Congress last month afterPresident Obama announced he would send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan, and it is likely to be a major issue as lawmakers return to work in January.
 Reaching back into the nation's history books, some lawmakers are suggesting a war bond program similar to those used during the Civil War and both World Wars. Such a program might reduce the country's reliance on foreign borrowing and avoid a tax increase. 
 The World War II bonds in particular have a certain popular appeal. They were promoted by movie stars likeBette Davis andRita Hayworth, who toured the country to rally support.Norman Rockwell drew up some of the government's advertisements, with slogans like: ''Ours ... to fight for. Freedom from fear.'' And the Treasury Department organized a door-to-door drive. About $185 billion in bonds were sold.
 Senator Ben Nelson, the Democrat from Nebraska who last month introduced war bond legislation, said in a statement that he hoped to ''tap into the same spirit of patriotism and create a sense of participation in the war effort akin to that shown by the greatest generation.''
 Can you see it?Britney Spears andOprah touring Midwestern towns to rally support for the war? It sounds farfetched today, and not just because the public is more skeptical.
 Economists and others who have studied the war bonds programs say America's economy has matured in ways that would make such an effort possibly harmful to today's economy. For decades, Americans have been urged to consume. Encouraging people to set aside money for the war could slow the economic recovery.
 ''With war bonds, we would be effectively saving this money and taking it out of circulation,'' said James J. Kimble, a professor at Seton Hall University and author of ''Mobilizing the Home Front: War Bonds and Domestic Propaganda.'' ''War bonds in effect limit our spending. It could be that that ends up shooting our economy in the foot because our economy was more built on spending today.''
 Consider the economic logic behind war bonds. In World War II, the secretary of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr., weighed three options for financing the war: printing money, raising taxes or issuing war bonds. But printing money can cause inflation, and imposing taxes would not offer Americans the opportunity to give to the war effort. (In the end, the government ended up printing money and raising taxes, but the bonds limited the extent of those actions.)
 War bonds in 1941 translated into sacrifice. Indeed, in 1942, Mr. Morgenthau initiated the door- to-door drives to encourage Americans to buy the bonds. ''I am not thinking of a token contribution,'' he said.
 But can Americans make a real investment in war bonds today without hurting the economy? Mr. Nelson suggested the bonds as an alternative to a war tax, which he said would be more damaging to the economy. Taxes and war bonds would both take money out of the system that might otherwise be spent at the shopping mall.
 But today, the economic recovery looms as a greater concern to many people than war costs. Spending on Iraq and Afghanistan is significantly less, proportionately, than spending on World War II. That war accounted for about a third of the nation's economic output; the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan add up to just over 5 percent of gross domestic product today, according to Hugh Rockoff, an economics professor at Rutgers University who has studied war bonds programs.
 Another difference, economists point out, is that World War II was a boon to the economy, creating jobs, mainly in manufacturing. The war against terrorism has not provided similar benefits for the American economy.
 ''Back then you had all these people who suddenly had a lot of extra cash because they were working two shifts for the war,'' said Mr. Kimble. ''This war is not contributing in the same way. This war is an outflow, if you will. Some people have described this as more of a spectator's war. We just get to watch.''
 Of course, the United States today has a fourth option to pay for the war that Mr. Morgenthau lacked in the 1940s: borrowing from other countries. During World War II, America was a creditor nation, lending out money to others. Today, the United States is a debtor nation -- a point Senator Nelson has seized on in pushing his idea. ''War bonds allow us to borrow from ourselves, rather than other countries,'' he said.
 But Professor Rokoff is doubtful that war bonds are the answer. (A program by the Treasury Department to sell Patriot Bonds, begun after 9/11 to contribute to the government's ''overall effort to fight the war on global terrorism,'' has raised only $10.9 billion in eight years.)
 ''We are financing all of these deficits with debt,'' Mr. Rokoff said. ''A bond campaign might be a morale booster. But it's a different world now. I could see people protesting outside of the bond rallies. In the long run, they're going to have to raise taxes.''

HEADLINE: A Whey With Words

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE MUHLKE

 BODY:
Vermont calls to mind some vivid associations: maple syrup, progressive politics, cheese. Laini Fondiller has brought two of the three together with Lazy Lady Farm. Taking inspiration from the talk radio she listens to while making cheese from goat and cow milk in her off-the-grid facility, Fondiller has sent out offerings with names like Tomme Delay (a riff on French tomme-style cheese), Barick Obama (a square cheese from 2004, named after the young state senator gave his speech at the Democratic National Convention) and Fil-a-Buster (a hefty wheel banded with spruce). The Ben & Jerry's flavor Imagine Whirled Peace might make for a cute take on a bumper sticker for the state's rusty Saabs, but until Hubby Hubby becomes permanent, Lazy Lady has the leftie-foodie market cornered. 
 People who want to pick up a Crumb Cake goat cheese this month will be out of luck. Wait, you mean cheeses have a season? Yes: Even Barack couldn't get a Barick from June to October. As the organic milk from her goats naturally tapers off in the winter -- ''The goats just began to collect unemployment as of last Friday,'' Fondiller e-mailed me on Dec. 15 -- she mixes it with organic milk from her neighbors' Holsteins and Jerseys to create cheeses like Bipartisan (cow with goat in the middle), moving into all-cow before phasing back into goat in the spring. For a few weeks in the fall of 2008, she used the dregs of a vat of cow milk to make Palin Comparison: ''I said, 'This is where they drug her up from!' ''
 Fondiller and her goats don't make it easy on cheesemongers. ''You don't pick the season; we do!'' she said. As a result, Lazy Lady cheeses come and go faster than a Beltway news cycle. The New York cheesemonger Anne Saxelby says, ''We tell restaurants that if they want something they can print on the menu, Lazy Lady is not a thing to choose.'' 
 ''I don't decide what I get for the week,'' Saxelby told me recently, chuckling. ''She just goes down the roster and tells me what she has.'' Saxelby is happy to comply: ''She's always creating something new, which is rare for a cheese maker to do. It's even more rare for them to do it well.'' Saxelby loves the well-meshed texture and bright, ''goaty'' flavor of Lazy Lady's chevres. ''There are few well-made, French-style goat cheeses'' in America, she explains. ''Laini was one of the first, so she's had a 15-year leg up.''
 Fondiller, who is 57, has been making cheese for 22 years. She began learning cheese-making in Corsica, where she landed after answering an ad in a French farming publication. (A phys-ed major, she met a farmer in the last two weeks of college in Indiana and ''that was it,'' she said with a sigh. Farming it was.) Settling in Vermont, she eventually started making goat cheese in her kitchen, ''the French way.'' After she was shut down by the Agency of Agriculture, she built a freestanding cheese room next to her house in Westfield (solar- and wind-powered, naturally). At the time, there was only one cheese-making supply company in the Northeast, and it didn't even carry cultures or papers. Not that anyone cared. Selling goat cheese at the local farmers' market in the late '80s was ''awful,'' Fondiller recalled. ''I'd say it was goat cheese, and they'd go: 'Oh, God! Oh, God!' They'd get really mad.''
 She switched from her rural market to the tourist havens of Montpelier and Stowe, and shoppers recognized the quality of her cheeses. Today she produces more than 10,000 pounds a year with the help of an apprentice. For the past two years, she has been elected the president of the Vermont Cheese Council, allowing her to witness the incredible leaps in quality the state's cheese makers have made. ''The bar is getting very high,'' she said. 
 People might imagine that cheese makers tinker idly while their wheels gather mold. But for Fondiller, every day is a 14-hour fire drill. After tending to her cows, pigs, chickens and vegetable garden, she milks 40 Alpine goats. (She did it by hand until she added enough solar panels to run a machine.) Then she dashes into her cheese room to add culture, wash rinds, add rennet, ripen wheels on racks, move cheeses into the cave. . . . ''Then it's rinse and repeat in the evening,'' she said with a laugh. ''This is what you're looking at,'' she said, eating a sandwich during the one-hour lunch-break interview she granted me. ''No friends, no social life. My only other communication is with other cheese makers. And the farmers' market.'' 
 When told that some urbanites fantasize about leaving it all behind to make goat cheese, Fondiller looked startled. ''Don't. It's a lot of work. Mmm,'' she said, tapping a hot-pink rubber boot. ''Mmm! It's. . . . Don't.''
 She does love the goats. ''They're very nice little animals,'' she said. ''Cows don't give a damn. Sheep can't stand ya. Pigs? 'Just feed me!' And goats really do want to be around you.'' Cheese-making also suits Fondiller's self-described attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Contrary to her farm's name, she said: ''I'm a workaholic. I mean serious. That's a problem.'' (Her apprentice bobbed her hairnet in agreement.) But for people with A.D.H.D., Fondiller said: ''this is a way that utilizes it best. Now it's seen as a problem, so they drug the kids up. But if they left it alone, what would transpire -- if they don't end up in prison -- is that they'd be doing stuff like this. Or being C.E.O.'s.'' Or, in the next generation of Vermont cheese makers, both. 
 Recipe: Baked Goat Cheese With Garden Lettuces
 From ''Chez Panisse Cafe Cookbook,'' by Alice Waters.
 8ounces fresh goat cheese (1 log, 2 by 5 inches)
 1cup extra-virgin olive oil
 3to 4 sprigs fresh thyme, chopped
 1 small sprig rosemary, chopped
 Half of a sour baguette, preferably a day old
 1tablespoon red-wine vinegar
 1teaspoon sherry vinegar
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper
 1/4cup extra-virgin olive or walnut oil, or a combination
 1/2pound mixed lettuces.
 1.Carefully slice the goat cheese into 8 discs about 1/2-inch thick. Pour 1 cup olive oil over the discs and sprinkle with the chopped herbs. Cover and store in a cool place for several hours or up to one week.
 2.Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Cut the baguette in half lengthwise and put it in the oven for 20 minutes or so, until dry and lightly colored. Grate into fine crumbs on a box grater or in a food processor. If the crumbs are still soft, place them back in the oven for a few minutes until dry. The crumbs can be made in advance and stored until needed. 
 3.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. (A toaster oven works well, too.) Remove the cheese discs from the marinade and roll them in the bread crumbs, coating them thoroughly. Place the discs on a small baking sheet and cook for about 6 minutes, until the cheese is warm. 
 4.Measure the vinegars into a small bowl and add a big pinch of salt. Whisk in 1/4 cup oil and a little pepper. Taste for seasoning and adjust. Toss the lettuces lightly with just enough vinaigrette to coat and arrange on salad plates. With a metal spatula, carefully place 2 discs of the baked cheese on each plate. 
 Serves 4.
 Recipe: Goat-Cheese Cheesecake
 Adapted from ''The Last Course,'' by Claudia Fleming.
 1 1/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons (11 ounces) cream cheese, at room temperature
 8 ounces fresh goat cheese, at room temperature
 1/2 cup sugar
 Half of a vanilla bean, split lengthwise, seeds scraped and reserved
 1 1/2 cups mascarpone cheese
 4 large eggs, at room temperature.
 1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the cream cheese, goat cheese, sugar and vanilla seeds and beat until smooth and creamy. Add the mascarpone and beat until smooth. Add the eggs and mix well, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a spatula as necessary. Strain the mixture into a bowl.
 2. Tightly wrap the outside of an 8-inch springform pan with foil, making sure there are no gaps. Spoon the mixture into the pan and place it in the center of a larger baking pan. Pour enough very hot water into the baking pan to reach two-thirds of the way up the side of the springform pan. Cover the entire baking pan with foil. Pierce the foil in several places with a knife. Bake for 1 hour, then lift off a corner of the foil to allow the steam to escape. Re-cover the pan and bake 50 minutes longer, or until the cake looks set around the edges but is still slightly jiggly in the center.
 3. Transfer the cake to a wire rack to cool completely. The cake can be made up to 2 days in advance and kept covered in the refrigerator. Serve with seasonal fruit, fruit sorbet or nut brittle.
 Serves 8.

OCEAN swims, Ocean Drive, Art Deco, Art Basel, palms and pulchritude: these are what draw the crowds to Miami. But not me -- at least not anymore. When I go back, it will be for the ''Pop-Tarts.''
 They're a new addition to the menu at Michael's Genuine Food & Drink, which started serving brunch -- and thus the Pop-Tarts -- in late October. And they're not, of course, the supermarket variety. They're a proper pastry chef's riff on those childhood favorites, miniaturized and so adorably dimpled on the edges that I wasn't sure whether to eat or cuddle with them. I opted for eating, trying both the gooey blackberry and the sunny yuzu. Sometimes, but not that day, Michael's serves Nutella-flavored ones, too. I'm checking airfares as I type.
 During most of my past trips to this sun-kissed American playground, I'd been disappointed by its restaurant scene, crammed as it was with too many steakhouses and too much vacuous glitz.
 If I looked for low-cost Latin fare, especially Cuban cooking, I had luck. But it was harder to find impressive meals by principled chefs whose work spanned diverse ethnic traditions and participated fully in the culinary conversation of the moment. 
 Thanks in part to the momentum created by the 2007 opening of Michael's in the Miami Design District, that's changed, and the city's restaurant scene has experienced a remarkable growth spurt: the sexy new tapas restaurant Sra. Martinez, also in the Design District; the first American outpost of Hakkasan, London's fabled Chinese restaurant, in Miami Beach's lavishly renovated Fontainebleau hotel; Red Light, a sort of upscale diner where the Caribbean and the American South meet.
 When thousands of food lovers descend on this city next month for the South Beach Wine & Food Festival, they'll be able to range across an impressive restaurant landscape. And when other travelers flock here through the winter for a balmy break, they'll discover that they don't have to trade great meals for good weather.
 Sra. Martinez
 If they're smart they'll hit Sra. Martinez, which nabbed nationwide attention pretty much the minute it opened in December 2008. 
 The chef Michelle Bernstein's work at the restaurant Michy's in Miami had established her as one of Miami's culinary stars (well enough known to merit an appearance as a guest judge on ''Top Chef''); at Sra. Martinez she has turned in a glossier and more ethnically specific direction, joining a sort of gastronomic revolution in the Design District.
 Like Michael's and other restaurants in the district, Sra. Martinez meets the street with a spacious outdoor patio and a canopy of palms: Miami restaurateurs tend not to let the local weather or flora go to waste. (As for its name, Sra. means senora, and Ms. Bernstein owns the restaurant with her husband, David Martinez.) 
 The interior of Sra. Martinez is even more attractive, with its two-story-high ceiling, its enormous windows and, in the back, up a staircase, a second-story dining alcove that overlooks the main first-story room. 
 The menu presents a carefully considered mix of relatively traditional tapas (ham croquetas, patatas bravas) and innovative ones that reflect the cooking not just of Spain but also of its former colonies: grilled prawns, for instance, are sprinkled with popcorn and corn nuts, both of which Ms. Bernstein said are used in Peru as an accouterment for ceviche.
 Other creations spring from Ms. Bernstein's fertile imagination. One such dish is the ''egg yolk carpaccio,'' a pool of whipped egg yolks, olive oil and coarse salt that's baked until it takes on a carpaccio-esque texture, then studded with tiny shrimp and topped with shoestring potatoes.
 Servers provide bread for scooping up the yolk mixture, and the overall experience was one of a deliciously unceremonious breakfast nudging up against a more refined dinner. It was a heady confluence, made headier still by the restaurant's bounty of Spanish wines, scores of them, seizing the foreground from France and Italy, which too often dominate it.
 Pacific Time
 Elsewhere in the Design District, a few fashionable, landlocked blocks of galleries and showrooms, Fratelli Lyon offers Italian food in contemporary trappings, and the chef Jonathan Eismann has established a modern pizzeria, Pizza Volante. It's just one prong of his huge investment in the neighborhood, where he will soon open Fin, serving local seafood, and Q American Barbeque. 
 But Mr. Eismann's real showpiece in the Design District is Pacific Time, which serves pan-Asian food. After more than a decade in South Beach, this Miami favorite moved to a handsome yet utterly relaxed new setting away from the surf. 
 A front patio leads to a dining room that's visually dominated by a long bar, where bottles sit in precise positions on backlighted shelves, and by a partially open kitchen. There's a sense of controlled bustle, and there's dark wood and a warm, honeyed glow throughout.
 Reading Pacific Time's menu -- or, for that matter, merely focusing on its name -- provokes some cognitive dissonance, in that the restaurant looks to countries on the big ocean that Miami is nowhere near.
 It takes in Thailand, Japan, China and India, and thus assembles a larder including house-made hoisin sauce (for duck confit), tamarind (for the salmon yaki), red curry and coconut water (for the local black grouper cheeks) and sake and edamame (for the black cod).
 To further the confusion, Pacific Time throws in some dishes -- sheep's milk ricotta gnudi, for example -- with Mediterranean bearings.
 But who needs ethnic logic and clarity when there are outsize delights like Pacific Time's soft-shell crab, dressed in a fermented black bean vinaigrette? It was exceptional, and yet paled beside the restaurant's signature hot-and-sour popcorn shrimp, with their gossamer casings around a succulent core.
 Michael's Genuine Food & Drink
 The shining star of the district and, arguably, the entire city is Michael's, a New American bistro with an emphasis on the fruits of Florida's soil and seas and an insistence on making just about everything -- the pastrami, the pickles, the jams, the sodas -- in house.
 Named for its chef-owner, Michael Schwartz, the restaurant simply radiates joy, in its sum and in its parts: the red and purple color scheme inside; the glass walls between interior and exterior dining areas; the jazz soundtrack; the loquacious servers; the open kitchen, with its prominently displayed wood-burning stove.
 I first ate here in early 2008, when I came for dinner. Michael's served lunch then, too, but the restaurant's outstanding brunch didn't come along until the fall of 2009.
 All three menus -- dinner, lunch and brunch -- have clearly been written with one question in mind: will customers yearn to eat everything on them?
 They will, and the sillier something on the menu sounds, the better it tends to be. The restaurant's masterpiece, in fact, isn't any of the fine Florida seafood that's roasted in that wood-burning oven, or even the gorgeous, bountiful salads, bejeweled with macadamia nuts, pickled pearl onions and papaya. It's the house-made, thick-cut potato chips with pan-fried onion dip.
 They get stiff competition, though, from anything and everything the pastry chef, Hedy Goldsmith, whips up. She's all slyness and nostalgia, with her ''Mounds bar'' tart and her red velvet cupcakes and those Pop-Tarts, oh those warm, crisp, tender Pop-Tarts.
 And she answers each of thesavory hits on Mr. Schwartz's side of the brunch menu -- like an omelet that pays homage to a Reuben sandwich and a chicken-salad sandwich better than any I'd ever had -- with a home run of her own. Get the fudgy peanut butter brownie with malted chocolate sauce. Just don't plan to eat again for five years.
 Red Light
 The spirit of playfulness that defines Michael's is also present at Red Light, a modest restaurant of immodest pleasures.
 Located in another overlooked Miami neighborhood that's being spruced up, the MiMo district, Red Light is situated alongside a canal in which manatees -- and the occasional alligator -- swim. It sprawls up and down stairs and in and out of doors in a deliberately ramshackle fashion, and it's decorated with strings of little lights.
 The menu that has been put together by Kris Wessel, the chef and owner, nods to the Caribbean, Mexico, the American South and even New Orleans. In the unpretentious manner of the moment, it traffics heavily in fatty and starchy fare -- with the bacon abundant, the ribs present and accounted for, the sides making room for both macaroni and cheese and Gorgonzola grits.
 There are three kinds of grilled cheese sandwiches, and that struck me as possible overkill until I tried the one with Fontina and (of course) bacon and instantly regretted not getting the other two as well. Scandalously thick and rich, it was more sandwich than anyone can reasonably handle, and I bet no one leaves so much as a crumb or rivulet.
 Red Light also serves fish whose freshness is beyond dispute. We had a plump, perfectly cooked fillet of sauteed lane snapper, glistening with butter on a king-size bed of rice. If you're looking for spa cuisine, don't look to Red Light.
 Area 31
 I found seafood done with a lighter touch (for the most part) at Area 31, a sleek, almost minimalist restaurant perched on the 16th floor of the Epic Hotel downtown, with stunning views of the glittering skyscrapers around it. 
 After I ate there in early December, Area 31 was closed, along with the rest of the Epic hotel, for two weeks because Legionnaires' disease was diagnosed in three people who had visited the hotel. One died; the others recovered.
 After many tests and adjustments to the hotel's water system, public health officials cleared the restaurant to reopen last weekend.
 I hope Area 31 doesn't suffer for that long, pregnant pause, because I admire its emphasis on sustainable seafood from the Atlantic fishing zone comprising Florida, Central America and northern South America. (The restaurant takes its name from that zone.)
 About half of the appetizers are crudo compositions, and the ''ocean to table'' category of entrees presents a changing roster of half a dozen kinds of fresh fish.
 We ordered a five-course tasting menu, very reasonably priced at $50 a person, and though it was uneven, the fried clams were outstanding. 
 Hakkasan
 Downtown Miami and Miami Beach have both grown considerably flashier in recent years, on account of the pre-recession real-estate boom. The newly renovated Fontainebleau hotel, now awash in colored lights and gleaming with new marble, provides the perfect example. It's home to several particularly prominent new restaurants, including Gotham Steak from Alfred Portale, and a second Scarpetta from the chef Scott Conant, whose first one is in Manhattan's meatpacking district. But the biggest news at the Fontainebleau is Hakkasan, an exotic labyrinth of carved teak walls and turquoise upholstery. (The original Hakkasan, in London, is precisely the sort of haute Chinese exemplar that New York craves but lacks.) 
 Almost all of the dozen or so dishes I sampled at the Miami branch were superbly cooked. The meat on the tea-smoked ribs didn't so much fall as ooze off the bone. The dumplings in a seafood dim sum platter were textbook -- bouncy on the outside, juicy within.
 None of this came cheap. Just three courses can easily cost $60, and in that context the occurrence of a soup as wan as the red snapper with watercress proved frustrating.
 But the service was impeccable, and Chinese cuisine of this ambition, with an ambience this opulent, is rare. It doesn't exist in bigger cities better known for their restaurant scenes. That Miami has it is a revelation -- and a reason to go.

HEADLINE: Island Hopping To Your Own Island

BYLINE: By JONATHAN VATNER

 BODY:
ONE night in August, Debra Dawson and her boyfriend, Joe Sinagoga, were vacationing on Jonathan Island, a nearly three-acre plot off the coast of Narragansett, R.I. Their motorboat had broken down and they had no way of getting to the mainland for dinner. A crisis? Not at all. 
 For Ms. Dawson, a 48-year-old Manhattanite and self-described ''city chick,'' it turned into one of the most romantic nights of her life. She spent the rest of the day plucking a dozen mussels from the buoys off the dock and digging for clams on the beach. She picked tomatoes and peppers from the garden and brought everything inside to make paella. Most importantly, the couple had the island all to themselves for the week, for a reasonable $3,250, plus $500 for use of the boat.
 ''It was one of the best vacations I had ever taken,'' said Ms. Dawson, who, as a regional director for the Body Shop, travels constantly and unplugs almost never. She stumbled across the island when searching for rentals on the Internet; the couple already has plans to return. 
 Bill Huggins, Jonathan Island's proprietor, is not the type one normally associates with private-island ownership. Mr. Huggins, a 51-year-old mortgage broker, and his wife, Alison, bought the property in 1998 because it was close to their primary home (in Narragansett) and yet felt totally remote. 
 ''At first my wife wasn't interested in it at all,'' Mr. Huggins said. ''One day I took her over there, and she said, 'Oh my God, this place is beautiful. Please get me this house and this island.' ''
 Now, Mr. Huggins and folks like him are sharing their gems with travelers, as private-island rentals become attainable for those traveling on a more modest budget. 
 There are still, of course, glitzy islands available for rent, owned by celebrities and magnates like Richard Branson, whose Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands rents for $36,000 per night and up. 
 On the other end of the spectrum, Jonathan Island starts at $375 per night, and Melody Key, an island in the Florida Keys owned since 2003 by Nick Hexum, lead singer in the band 311, runs $1,400 per night for up to six guests. And Forsyth Island, a 1,744-acre refuge in New Zealand, costs about $1,400 a night.
 ''Every island is different,'' said Chris Krolow, chief executive of Private Islands Inc., a real-estate agency specializing in the sale and rental of islands. ''We have a few islands that are really out in the middle of nowhere, where you bring your own food, all the way to the very luxurious Rania Experience, with seven staff per person,'' he said, referring to a package based in the Maldives.
 Counterintuitively, the island-rental trend might have its roots in the recession. In a down economy, island owners don't want to shell out for the high cost of maintaining them. ''Owning an island is an expensive hobby,'' Mr. Huggins said. He pays a premium both on repairs and heating fuel, and when his mortgage business started to slow in 2007, he listed the island on the Internet.
 Like urban subletters, some private island owners are happy just to break even. ''The idea is not to make big money,'' said Farhad Vladi, the founder of Vladi Private Islands, another island realty, and owner of Forsyth Island. ''The idea is to cover the running costs and to keep the wheels in motion.''
 For the renter, the appeal is obvious. Islands by definition offer that most valuable of amenities: privacy. During the few weeks a year he and his family can get to Melody Key, Mr. Hexum fishes for his dinner and writes songs outside in his underwear -- neither of which is easy at home in Los Angeles. ''It's been good for my spirit to totally unwind,'' he said. ''Being on an island is such an incredible contrast to L.A.''
 Private rentals can also be an antidote to the typical island resort, with a high volume of guests.
 ''I guess we're kind of tired of the traditional hotel,'' said Ron Kilius, a Toronto-based owner of a healthcare company, who vacationed this year on Royal Belize, an island off Belize with three homes that became available for rental in 2009. Whether guests rent just one of the houses for as low as $600 a night, or all three for $2,115, they can be assured that no other vacationers will be there. ''My wife and I are pushing 60, so we don't like a lot of hullabaloo.''
 For the most part during their vacation, they lie about and read. ''I guess after 30 years of marriage, what do you do?'' Mr. Kilius said.
 For couples without long guest lists, the private-island wedding has also become popular. Molly and Kurt Pitts held their wedding in November on Melody Key, partly to limit attendance. ''We really just wanted something small, and we both love the water,'' said Mrs. Pitts, a lending assistant in Tifton, Ga. After the ceremony, the couple stayed on for a week. ''It was so peaceful; you don't have anybody bothering you,'' she said. ''If you got a usual condo somewhere, you always have people around, hooting and hollering.''
 Private islands aren't for everyone. Those who want museums and nightclubs and 24-hour pharmacies should look elsewhere. And on some -- Jonathan Island included -- guests need to watch their water and energy use. Ms. Dawson admitted that being stuck on an island could have been a nightmare. But, she pointed out, ''you're kind of in the mind-set to figure out how to make it a good situation.''
 Other island owners have taken a more proactive approach in the conservation department. Melody Key, for example, lies ''pretty much off the grid,'' according to Mr. Hexum. The house has solar panels and a cistern, but a propane generator and extra water are in reserve for guests who want to take long showers and leave the lights on.
 As Ms. Dawson indicated, it's best to mentally prepare for the private-island experience. Even loners might find the hermetic isolation a bit overwhelming. ''Time on an island is very different from time on the mainland,'' Mr. Krolow of Private Islands Inc. said. ''Two or three days can feel like a week.'' To that end, he recommends that first-timers limit their adventure to a few days, and book the remainder of their vacation at a resort.
 But solitude is in the eye of the beholder. Jim Arthur, a resort-wear manufacturer, will be renting out the 26-acre island in French Polynesia that he owns with his wife, Inger Pettersson, starting in 2010 -- in hopes of meeting interesting people. At $2,500 a night, all-inclusive, the rental isn't cheap, but the area is famously pricey, and Mr. Arthur is not out to make money. The couple plan to be as present or absent as guests please, but they hope to find, amid all the quiet, a sort of community.
 ''My wife and I are world travelers, and we like to meet new people,'' he said. ''That's one of our main reasons for doing this.''

HEADLINE: A Trickle From the Equity Tap

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
HOME equity lines of credit, once a staple of home finance, have been fading from view, and not only because securing credit is generally more difficult. As borrowers also grow more fiscally conservative, industry experts say, many are becoming reluctant to take on these second mortgages. 
 Helocs, as they're known in the industry, are typically open-ended revolving credit products, with interest rates pegged to the prime lending rate, which banks offer their best customers. 
In recent years, when the real estate market was strong, many homeowners used Helocs to draw cash from their homes. At its peak, in November 2008, 13.3 percent of residential loans were home equity loans and Helocs, according to Mortgagebot, a Mequon, Wis., company that tracks mortgage activity. But in April 2009, home equity lending dropped to 3.2 percent of the overall market. It rebounded slightly in November, the last month for which Mortgagebot data was available, to 5 percent.
 Other sources suggest an even bleaker recent picture. First American CoreLogic, a mortgage industry statistical and consulting firm that tracks a wider range of lenders than Mortgagebot, said that in November 2009, Heloc originations slid to $3.8 billion, the lowest level in the last two years and far below October's $6.6 billion.
 Mark Fleming, the chief economist at First American, says that even though home prices have stabilized, fewer people have enough equity in their homes to qualify for a line of credit. He added, ''Consumers are still retrenching and paying down debt, not extending debt burdens.''
 Some mortgage industry executives says they also see continued reluctance from the nation's biggest banks to offer Helocs, even to those with substantial equity in their homes. Regional banks, however, may be more willing to offer Helocs, because they typically suffered fewer losses during the subprime mortgage collapse.
 TD Bank, which is based in Cherry Hill, N.J., and Portland, Me., increased its Heloc lending in 2009, according to Gregory Braca, the bank's regional president in New York. The institution's overall lending activity grew by 10 percent over 2008, and home equity lending ''drove that growth,'' Mr. Braca said.
 TD Bank offers one of the more competitive Heloc rates. The most highly qualified applicants -- specifically, those with credit scores of more than 680, low household debt and good income, and who take out credit lines of $100,000 or more -- would qualify for an interest rate of half a percentage point over the prime rate, which is currently at 3.25 percent. (In recent years, lenders had offered the lines for half a percentage point below prime.) Mr. Braca said he had seen some signals from other lenders that they, too, may grow more aggressive in marketing Helocs. In part, he said, lenders may be reacting to the stabilization in housing prices. ''But there's also a lot of pressure on banks, from Washington and elsewhere, to start lending again,'' he added.
 Wayne C. Walker, the senior vice president for residential lending at People's United Bank, a regional bank based in Bridgeport, Conn., said that his institution had not dropped interest rates or loosened lending requirements on Helocs, but that it could in the coming months.
 ''From a lender's perspective,'' Mr. Walker said, ''the fact that we have more stable home prices is certainly reassuring.''
 In late 2008, People's United raised the minimum interest rate for Helocs from 3 percent to 4 percent, where it remains. It increased to 25 percent from 20 percent the amount of home equity borrowers are required to retain. And borrowers whose combined monthly debts exceeded 40 percent of gross income could not qualify; in previous years that percentage limit was 45.
 But Mr. Walker predicted that in the industry in general, ''you should start to see lending guidelines loosen up a little bit from where they are now.''

HEADLINE: Whither the Dream

 BODY:
NO federal law prohibits illegal immigrants from attending college in the United States, or requires them to disclose their situation. Most colleges don't even check immigration status when students apply for financial aid -- only 31 percent, according to a survey last year by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers. 
Still, illegal students face numerous barriers to higher education. About 65,000 graduated from American high schools last year, but only 5 percent went on to college, according to Roberto G. Gonzales, a professor at the University of Washington and author of a College Board report last year on the plight of minors brought in illegally by their parents and raised here. 
 Many fear that applying to college will expose them and their families to deportation. But, too, higher education is expensive, and far less aid is available. Illegal immigrants are not eligible for federal financial aid, and only 10 states extend cheaper in-state tuition rates to illegal students who attended their high schools. The issue is emotional and politically volatile. South Carolina has recently barred such students from enrolling in any of its state colleges and universities; in spring Alabama will bar them from community colleges, and North Carolina has yo-yoed on the issue.
 Proposed legislation to grant legal status to minors has been debated in Congress for eight years. A new bill, the so-called Dream Act, was introduced last year to provide those who entered the country under age 16 with a conditional path to citizenship in exchange for two years of college or military service. And on Dec. 15, Representative Luis V. Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat, introduced a comprehensive immigration bill that folds in some of the Dream Act. 
 But even advocates acknowledge that with unemployment so high among citizens and health care preoccupying Congress, such legislation might have to wait for a more auspicious moment. Another Democrat, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, is working on his own immigration overhaul, expected to be introduced in the spring.

HEADLINE: For Much of the World, A Fruitful Decade

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
IT may not feel that way right now, but the last 10 years may go down in world history as a big success. That idea may be hard to accept in the United States. After all, it was the decade of 9/11, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the financial crisis, all dramatic and painful events. But in economic terms, at least, the decade was a remarkably good one for many people around the globe. 
 The raging economic growth rates of China and India are well known, though their rise is part of a broader trend in the economic development of poorer countries. Ideals of prosperity, freedom and the rule of law have probably never been more resonant globally than they've been over the last 10 years, even if practice often falls short. And for all of the anticapitalistic rhetoric that has emerged from the financial crisis, national leaders around the world are embracing the commercialization of their economies. 
 Putting aside the United States, which ranks third, the four most populous countries are China, India, Indonesia and Brazil, accounting for more than 40 percent of the world's people. And all four have made great strides. Indonesia had solid economic growth during the entire decade, mostly in the 5 to 6 percent annual range. That came after its very turbulent 1990s, marked by a disastrous financial crisis and plummeting standards of living. 
 Brazil also had a consistently good decade, with growth at times exceeding 5 percent a year. There is lots of talk that the country has finally turned the corner, and, within its borders, there is major worry that its currency is too strong -- a problem that many other countries would envy.
 Elsewhere in South America, Colombia and Peru have made enormous progress and Chile is on the verge of becoming a ''developed'' country; it will soon be joining the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
 To be sure, in Africa, there is still enormous misery. Nonetheless, overall standards of living rose in a wide variety of countries there, with economic growth for the continent as a whole at more than 5 percent in most years. Many basic essentials, like water, sanitation, electricity and especially telephones, are more commonly available.
 One lesson from all of this is that steady economic growth is an underreported news story -- and to our own detriment. As human beings, we are prone to focus on very dramatic, visible events, such as confrontations with political enemies or the personal qualities of leaders, whether good or bad. We turn information about politics and economics into stories of good guys versus bad guys and identify progress with the triumph of the good guys. In the process, it's easy to neglect the underlying forces that improve life in small, hard-to-observe ways, culminating in important changes.
 In a given year, an extra percentage point of economic growth may not seem to matter much. But, over time, the difference between annual growth of 1 percent and 2 percent determines whether you can double your standard of living every 35 years or every 70 years. At 5 percent annual economic growth, living standards double about every 14 years.
 Nonetheless, despite the positive news in much of the world, it's questionable whether the decade as a whole has been good for Americans, economically speaking. Median wages have not risen much, if at all, and the costs of the financial crisis and irresponsible fiscal policies have become increasingly obvious. Those facts support a pessimistic interpretation.
 Still, most economic models suggest that the fundamental source of growth is new ideas, which enable us to produce more from a given set of resources. To the extent that the rest of the world becomes wealthier, there's more innovation, as my colleague and co-blogger Alex Tabarrok, professor of economics at George Mason University, argued recently. China, for instance, is moving toward the research frontier in areas such as solar power, scientific instruments, engineering and nanoscience, all of which can benefit the United States. Unlike the situation of just a few decades ago, a genius born in Mumbai now stands a good chance of becoming a notable scientist, whether at home or abroad.
 It might be pleasant to boast that America is -- or should be -- a world leader in every area, but the practical reality is that if some other country solves the problem of green energy, so much the better for us.
 The subtler point is that a wealthier China, India, Brazil and Indonesia will lead to more customers for new innovations, thereby producing greater rewards for successful entrepreneurs, no matter where they live. There are so many improvements in cellphones these days because there are so many cellphone customers in so many countries. 
 TO put it bluntly, if the United States takes one step back and the rest of the world takes two steps forward, even in purely selfish terms we should consider accepting the trade-off, if only for the longer run. Most of us gain from the wealth and creativity of other countries, even if we can't always feel like the top dog. 
 When asked what he thought of the French Revolution, Zhou Enlai, the premier of China from 1949 until his death in 1976, reportedly replied, ''It is too soon to tell.'' 
 That is also a fair response to the last 10 years, and it will be for some time to come. The point remains that if we look beneath the surface just a bit, the picture is a good deal rosier than we might otherwise think.

HEADLINE: The Business of Zeroing In

BYLINE: By NANCY HASS

 BODY:
WHEN Adam Krueckeberg, 37, decided to leave his job as a vice president at Fidelity, the mutual fund giant, to return to school for an M.B.A., he didn't look at top-ranked schools like Harvard or the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, although his resume was stellar and his scores strong. The only place that interested him was Boston College, the Jesuit-run institution that has been offering a dual M.B.A./M.S. in church management and pastoral ministry since 2005. 
 ''I wanted a career that was more spiritually fulfilling,'' says Mr. Krueckeberg, who plans to work in a Catholic diocese or university when he graduates, in 2012. ''I wouldn't have been able to train for that in a more traditional setting.'' 
 The trend toward specialization has crept into most fields over the past few decades, but few have embraced the shift more enthusiastically than graduate schools of business. Since 1990, the year that the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business International, the main accreditation board for business schools, changed its guidelines to encourage innovative curriculums, schools have focused on areas like aerospace, wine management, luxury goods, real estate and energy management.
 The percentage of business school students enrolled in specialized programs has risen about 4 percent each year since 2001, according to Daniel R. LeClair, the organization's vice president for knowledge services. More than a fifth of business school students are now seeking such degrees.
 Instead of exposing them to theory or the big picture of their discipline, specialized programs tend to zero in on practical and commercial applications. It's an approach more likely to be seen outside the top tier of M.B.A. programs. Institutions like the University of Chicago and Columbia, whose graduates are much sought-after, have mostly kept the general M.B.A., with broad areas of concentration like finance and marketing. But for many others, specialization is a way to stand out among the more than 500 accredited programs here and abroad.
 ''If you're not one of those few obvious schools, you need to be able to offer students and employers real depth,'' says Blair Sanford, assistant dean and director of M.B.A. career services at the business school at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, which enrolls about 125 students a year.
 The university is widely considered the pioneer in niche M.B.A. programs, having established some of the first specialized institutes within its business school in the 1990s. The university did away entirely with the general M.B.A. in 2004, opting instead for 13 specializations, including market research and real estate. Niche M.B.A. programs tend to attract students who know exactly to which industry they are heading, as well as older students with business experience who may want to change fields, says Mr. LeClair. ''In this kind of economic environment, people do tend to get very focused.'' 
 Some niche programs, such as the energy concentration at the University of Oklahoma's Price College of Business, capitalize on geography. Located smack in the middle of oil country, the program has a pool of local employers likely to seek custom-trained executives. With major pharmaceutical firms like Merck and Johnson & Johnson headquartered in the state, Rutgers University in New Jersey offers an M.B.A. in pharmaceutical management.
 European business schools were early adopters of the specialization model, especially in France. The international luxury brand management program at Essec Business School near Paris is conducted entirely in English and attracts about 40 students a year, most of them not French. Students in the wine and spirits M.B.A. program at the Bordeaux Management School in western France enrich their studies with stints at cooperating universities in Australia and northern California.
 Investing as much as $30,000 in such a narrowly focused degree may be risky -- especially if the market for a particular job dries up suddenly (the tightening of the real estate industry is a good example) -- but going deep instead of wide seems to fit right in with an increasingly segmented world. 
 ''I knew what I wanted and where I wanted to be eventually,'' says Mr. Kruekeberg. ''I didn't need to waste time relearning the things I already knew how to do. I wanted every minute to be something valuable and new.''

HEADLINE: Fight Against an Invasive Fish Threatens a Fragile Unity in the Great Lakes

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
Asian carp, the voracious, nonnative fish whose arrival near Lake Michigan is threatening to cause havoc in the Great Lakes, are now setting off strife on land as well.
 In an urgent effort to close down Chicago-area passages that could allow the unwanted fish to reach Lake Michigan, the State of Michigan is suing the State of Illinois and other entities that govern the waterways here. Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin have filed documents in recent days supporting Michigan's move, and Indiana says it will soon do the same.
The new rift between these Midwestern states, which would reopen a nearly century-old legal case in the United States Supreme Court over Great Lakes waters, comes at a particularly sensitive moment -- just as the numerous entities with interests in the Great Lakes had united in what lakes advocates consider some of their most significant progress in decades. 
 In 2008, the eight states that touch the Great Lakes helped push through a federal-state compact that bars diversion of water from the lakes unless all of the states (and the Canadian provinces involved) agree. That Great Lakes Compact, which was years in the making, at last calmed fears that other water-starved regions might tap into the lakes, which make up 20 percent of the world's freshwater.
 And this fall, the federal government approved what many saw as the first step in a major restoration for the lakes, long sought in these states. 
 Some $475 million was designated to clean up pollution, protect habitat and fight invasive species in the Great Lakes. 
 ''Years ago, we realized that this region of the country needed to do a much better job of speaking with one voice or we would not be heard in Washington,'' said David A. Ullrich, executive director of the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative, one of several alliances that formed in recent years around the notion that those with Great Lakes interests needed to work together if they hoped to draw the support and attention captured, say, by the Florida Everglades.
 Of the Asian carp threat and the legal sparring suddenly brewing between the states, Mr. Ullrich, whose group of 70 lakes mayors includes Richard M. Daley of Chicago, a Democrat, said, ''It's a very serious issue, and I think we are going to need to figure out a way to come together as a region.''
 For years, leaders in the region worried about Asian bighead and silver carp -- large, imported fish that can take over an ecosystem by consuming the food supply of other fish and that were known to be making their way north up the Mississippi River. But the efforts took on a new urgency in November, when the authorities reported finding genetic evidence of the carp within about six miles of Lake Michigan, in the Chicago-area waterway system that links the Mississippi to the Great Lakes. 
 As lake advocates called on leaders to close locks in the waterway system in an emergency effort to block the fish, representatives from the office of Mike Cox, the attorney general of Michigan, said he had reached out to leaders on the other side of the lake, in Illinois, but got no response. 
 Mr. Cox, a Republican who is running for governor of Michigan this year, said hundreds of thousands of jobs in his state depended on Lake Michigan, and in December he filed a lawsuit. ''This is an environmental and economic emergency,'' Nick De Leeuw, a spokesman for Mr. Cox, said of the potential damage the carp could inflict throughout the lakes. ''It's almost like a bad science fiction movie.''
 In his legal filings, Mr. Cox called for an injunction to close locks immediately, but he is also seeking, ultimately, to separate the Mississippi River system from the Great Lakes entirely. 
 More than a century ago, a canal was built linking the two waterways. Barges travel between the two, and over the years, the design helped carry sewage away from Chicago and Lake Michigan as part of an engineering feat that reversed the flow of the Chicago River.
 The Michigan lawsuit would reopen a Supreme Court case from the 1920s (which was later modified repeatedly) in which neighboring states complained that Illinois's diversion of water away from the lake was wrong.
 The suit leaves Illinois leaders in an awkward spot: though many of them have expressed horror at the thought of Asian carp taking over Lake Michigan, a closing of locks could also cause damage for a barge industry here. And permanent separation of the two waterways might also require changes to the Chicago area's wastewater infrastructure.
 A spokeswoman for Gov. Patrick J. Quinn of Illinois, a Democrat who is up for election this year, said he believed that ''everything should be looked at in a careful and studied way.'' 
 And Suzanne Malec-McKenna, the commissioner of Mr. Daley's Department of Environment, said, ''While we recognize that Asian carp pose a significant threat to the Great Lakes, shutting down the waterway system in Northeastern Illinois before fully understanding the impact it would have on the movement of people, goods and storm water is a shortsighted answer to a complex problem.''
 Left uncertain is what so much turmoil over the carp might do to the broader efforts at cooperation on the lakes, or whether it might damage relations just as the region tries to figure out how best to spend the hundreds of millions of dollars in restoration money. 
 Notwithstanding this lawsuit, said David Naftzger, executive director of the Council of Great Lakes Governors (including Mr. Quinn and the governors whose states have signed on with Michigan to close the locks), there have been long efforts to work together in the region to fight invasive species, even these carp. 
 ''That will continue,'' Mr. Naftzger said, pointing out that it is attorneys general, not governors, who would be handling any legal back-and-forth. ''This doesn't mean other elements of the state governments won't persevere to find common ground.'' 
 All that being said, Mr. Naftzger added, if some solution to the carp problem cannot be found, all sorts of progress could eventually be at risk.

HEADLINE: New York's Resolutions

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
THE making of New Year's resolutions is, at once, the most optimistic and cynical of acts. The vow to change posits a continuing faith in human improvement (''I'll lose 30 pounds this year''), but the format, a checkable mental list, is so tyrannical and skeptical of success that it often leads to failure (''Yeah, well, maybe 20.'') 
 Whether it's the nagging housewives and jealous husbands counseled by an 1880 New York Times editorial to ''foreswear all such works of the evil one'' or a latter-day smoker vowing to be done with a pack-a-day habit, there seems to be a biological imperative to seek excellence each Jan. 1 but a genetic incapacity to obtain it. What better metaphor, then, for New York City, a metropolis forever chasing progress and perfection but perhaps best at making do with the reality of considerably less?
 So we asked some prominent New Yorkers to muse aloud not on their own ambitions for the year ahead but on our collective objectives. What might knit New York together in 2010? What should be its goals, its boundaries, its promises to improve, and change, and grow? 
 The answers were grandiose and granular, silly and sublime, ranging from huge new social programs that ought to be established to the smallest sorts of elective surgeries. Some interpreted ''the city'' strictly as its government or political leadership; others construed the question much more broadly to include enhancements to something like its soul.
 What all of them had in common, though -- clergy, columnist, clown, filmmaker, educators, executives and one mostly unclothed huckster -- was a certainty that the city could be better, that it should be better, even if that was not likely to happen in a year. 
 But first, suggested Elaine Kaufman, proprietor of the eponymous celebrity saloon, a cocktail. ''We all work so hard so we need to resolve to have more laughs in the New Year,'' Ms. Kaufman said. ''Go have a drink somewhere, have a good dinner and enjoy yourself. That's the way it should be.''
 Jimmy Breslin, 80
 Author and newspaperman
 First, you've got to find a way to get rid of Albany. They've got people up there -- I mean, all you have to do is look at what they're up to. For 30 years, they let this guy Bruno, for example, just go on and on and on. It's the seat of larceny, so I say just get rid of it. 
 Then you have to start a real newspaper. Do the newspapers today even attack anybody anymore? They had Bloomberg winning by a mile and a half. The people know more than the newspapers and the television does. They sure knew not to like Bloomberg as much as they were told to. People are getting away with murder all over the place, and the papers have a chance to say something about it. But they just don't do it.
 Donald Trump, 62
 Real estate mogul and TV personality
 Obviously, the city needs to get rid of its tremendous debt, but what would be really fantastic, really fabulous, would be to see the city roads and, especially, the guardrails get fixed up. Whenever I drive the roads in this city, I see these terrible, truly awful guardrails. They're dented, they're broken, some of them are completely rusted out. To me, it's supposed to go hand in hand: You fix the roads and then you fix the guardrails simultaneously, but it doesn't seem to happen that way. So debt and the guardrails -- but almost more, I'd say the guardrails. The guardrails are just in such bad shape.
 Katrina Vanden Heuvel, 50
 Editor, The Nation magazine
 I think it's very serious -- it's actually almost Dickensian -- that we're planning to cut reduced student fares on the subway. The hard-core thought about that would be the idea of free transportation altogether. People might laugh at it, but it's something that the city should actually think about. 
 I've been thinking a lot about the New Deal lately, too, and how this great city could be a place where we launch some sort of new pilot W.P.A. program. We already have the writers and the thinkers and the creators in place. So a program like that would be about job creation and economic development, but also creativity and how creativity inspires community development and renewal. It would also be about rebuilding the city -- its parks, its highways, its schools and its post offices, but then its theaters and its music and its visual arts, too. 
 The crisis of the economy is a hugely serious one, but there's also a crisis of the spirit.
 Eliot Spitzer, 50
 Former governor, attorney general
 I would love to see investment bankers actually do God's work. 
 Oliver Stone, 63
 Movie director
 For a city that's been so revitalized, that's become so incredible again, the airports are a disgrace. Any chance I get, I fly out of Newark. Even the smallest airports in China are better than La Guardia, and you can just forget about J.F.K. 
 My second choice is a little less important, maybe, but the cabdrivers here are horrendous, and something needs to be done. I'd say 22 percent of my cab rides recently have ended in near collisions. They drive like they don't even care, like they just want to get to their destination. 
 But as much as I dislike the taxi drivers, the bicyclists are worse. I was almost hurt, twice, seriously, by bikes. One time, at night, a guy was going the wrong way down the street and almost ran me down. He called me an expletive, so I called him something back, and he came at me with a knife! I can't believe their sense of entitlement. 
 Lastly, and I know it's not doable, it's just a hypothesis, but they ought to send Bloomberg up to Albany. You need a strong man up there. The best solution for New York is to get him up there as governor and let him clean house. 
 Jennifer Raab, 53
 President, Hunter College
 We're at a critical moment where the city has to really commit to becoming a leader in higher public education. It's more important than ever now given the fact that people need a college degree to move into a middle-class lifestyle. 
 It's about $38,000 for private institutions in New York -- and that's just tuition. At Hunter, it's only $4,600 a year. So if you're a sanitation worker and a nurse, say, with two kids, how do you pay $38,000 times two over four years? 
 When education begins to price itself out the range of the average New Yorker, that's a problem. 
 Keith Nelson, 39
 Founder, Bindlestiff Family Cirkus
 In 2010, the city should open a unicycle lane and special unicycle access to every bridge in New York.
 William Thompson Jr., 56
 Former city comptroller, 2009 Democratic candidate for mayor
 The biggest thing we need next year are jobs. It's important to keep in mind that there is a huge middle-class exodus going on, and whether it's from the government or the private sector, what we need are good jobs and, especially, those that will, at the very least, let people take care of their families.
 The second thing is -- and this is something everyone can take part in -- we're looking at a very large rise in the number of food pantries that are running out of food this year. Whether it's individuals taking note of that or corporations helping out those who are hungry, it's something that the city should clearly resolve to focus on. 
 The lines for people receiving food are growing longer and longer. You're also watching the city government denying extensions of food stamp benefits. So I think food and hunger is a huge issue in the city that needs addressing because it's only gotten worse in the last year. 
 Russell Simmons, 52
 Hip-hop entrepreneur
 Mayor Bloomberg, do what you can to uplift the poor. The divide between rich and poor is growing in New York, so the need is better education and better educational opportunities for everyone. 
 We also need meditation in the schools, quiet time for kids. Sitting still is so important. There's so much research out there now about the chemicals in the brain and how they react to sitting still. If you can't have arts education, meditation won't entirely replace it, but it doesn't cost anything to just sit still. 
 Howard Rubenstein, 77
 Founder, Rubenstein Associates Inc., a public relations firm
 I think the city has to create a million advocates for itself by crisscrossing New York and reminding everyone of all the great pluses we have, so when people go visiting other cities, states or other parts of the world, average citizens can promote New York. 
 What you'd do is have all the deputy mayors in the city visit various organized groups -- chambers of commerce, synagogue councils, different church groups -- with a white paper, a very simple outline about the cultural institutions in New York, the job opportunities, the educational opportunities, the prestige of bringing a business to the city. Then when New Yorkers go anywhere, they talk it up. 
 You'd be surprised the huge impact that can have. A million nonpaid, amateur P.R. people talking from the heart about how great New York is? Our resilience, our courage, our strength? It could be a tremendous campaign. 
 Robert Burck, 39
 The Naked Cowboy of Times Square
 I'm waiting for the city to put my new product line into the Times Square retail center that's coming. So far, we've got Naked Cowboy shot glasses, Naked Cowboy T-shirts, Naked Cowboy protein powder and a Naked Cowboy tequila. 
 It would also be nice if they could open up a Times Square wedding chapel. I'm an ordained minister. It's a multimillion-dollar industry. Why let all those people go to Vegas to be married by an Elvis impersonator when they can do it in a unique way, right here in New York, by either myself or one of my licensed franchisees?
 The Rev. Robert Coleman, 53
 Riverside Church
 One thing I hope our city would resolve to address in the next year is in the area of hospitality. With Ellis Island, the whole history of immigration into North America, New York City needs to be a hospitable city again, especially in our treatment of the immigrant, the stranger and the asylum-seeker. We, in this nation, have in many ways criminalized immigration, and I'd like to see us recover ways of celebrating the immigrant that are both healthy and provide a sense of security.
 That extends to how hospitable we are to our own residents, too, to people trying to make their way with affordable housing and on the minimum wage. I want us to be known not only as a good place to go but as a good place to live. 
 The second area to focus on is for the city to continue its commitment to greening. I'd like to see us incorporate a green mapping of all five boroughs, targeting hot spots and alleviating some of the worst of them. We also need to accelerate work on the mayor's plan for reducing our carbon footprint by 30 percent. People who are poor carry the burden of our environmental problems. We could all work collectively and collaboratively in greening our city in all five boroughs.
 Stephen Schwarzman, 62
 Chief executive, the Blackstone Group
 I think New York should try to create a tax regime for foreign citizens domiciled in the city to have it comparable to the tax treatment of similar people in London. What happens in London is that foreigners, other than Americans, don't pay taxes there in any degree and don't pay taxes in their own home country either, so it's basically a tax-free zone. If we had a similar regime here in New York, we could attract the best and brightest from outside the United States. And we would benefit enormously from their indirect spending in the city and their employment of other people through the expansion of businesses. 
 George Steinbrenner, 79
 Principal owner, New York Yankees
 New York City should resolve to rise above the tough economic times and maintain its determination, energy and spirit. New York is a city of winners, and it shouldn't let its spirit sag even for a minute.

HEADLINE: An Invitation To Fly Local

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

DATELINE: RONKONKOMA, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 ON the day before Thanksgiving -- one of the year's most exasperating days for air travelers -- jet planes were soaring out of Long Island MacArthur Airport on time. There were no lines at the check-in counters, no lines to clear security and no lineup of idling planes on the runway.
 Cindy Poll, 47, a nurse who was on her way to spend Thanksgiving with her brother near Columbus, Ohio, chose MacArthur even though La Guardia and Kennedy Airports are about as close to her Syosset home, and even though using MacArthur would mean a detour through Baltimore.
 ''I didn't feel like dealing with the lines and dealing with the traffic -- I didn't feel like dealing with Queens,'' said Ms. Poll, as if Queens embodied all that was wrong with air travel. 
 Ms. Poll is just the kind of flier MacArthur is looking for these days. The airport, eager to sell itself to Long Island's three million people as a laid-back, less crowded alternative to the congestion at Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark Liberty Airports, is plastering Long Island Rail Road trains and stations with posters, and showing ads at multiplexes. The airport's slogan: ''We Make Flying a Breeze.'' 
 That initiative, which may gain appeal as air travel gets generally more frustrating after the Dec. 25 bombing attempt, is just one way some of the region's local airports -- MacArthur, Atlantic City International Airport and Stewart International Airport outside Newburgh, N.Y. -- are seeking to promote growth. Not all the regional airports are pushing expansion and some are forbidden from doing so, but many are adding new flights and, with them, new advertising campaigns. Perhaps most important, regional airport officials hope that as the economy rebounds they will look more and more attractive to time-pressed passengers and airlines, too. 
 ''When the economy snaps back and congestion increases at the three major airports, that might act as an impetus for carriers to use the regionals,'' said Steve Van Beek, president of the Eno Transportation Foundation, a nonprofit research group. 
 MacArthur, which has 56 flights a day to Philadelphia, Baltimore, Chicago, Las Vegas and several Florida destinations, is planning to add, in June, a morning flight by US Airways to Washington and an evening flight back -- a route the airline dropped after 9/11. 
 After losing some flights in the Delta Airlines bankruptcy, Atlantic City has also started some new routes: to Boston on Spirit Airlines, to Atlanta on AirTran Airways and to Toronto on WestJet. Much of this expansion was driven by the casino industry, which is relying more on air traffic for customers as rival casinos in Connecticut and New York lure away gamblers who drive, said Bart R. Mueller, executive director of the South Jersey Transportation Authority. The authority runs the airport.
 Also, the Atlantic City airport will soon break ground for a new international arrivals center with customs inspections, and three new gates. That expansion, to be finished in 2011, will give more weight to the ''international'' in the airport's name. 
 Meanwhile, in Orange County, Stewart International Airport, a former military base, is benefiting from a $500 million, 10-year refurbishing project by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, its owner since 2007. Stewart was thought of in the 1970s as a fourth major airport, but that role proved elusive; now, with 10 flights a day to Detroit, Florida and Philadelphia, the Port Authority sees Stewart primarily as a provincial airport for mid-Hudson Valley residents. 
 But Stewart has ambitions. It has been buying billboard space and local chambers of commerce are running radio ads encouraging people to ''fly local.'' Stewart plans to build a new customs station and a new cargo transfer station, and to upgrade its electrical and sanitation systems.
 ''We're fully committed to Stewart and working with local chambers of commerce and citizens in that part of the world to get them thinking about Stewart,'' said John P. Kelly, an airport spokesman. 
 Beyond the ad campaigns and construction plans, regional airports are also hoping the recession will end.
 Jeffrey M. Zupan, a senior fellow at the Regional Plan Association, said passenger traffic at La Guardia, Kennedy and Newark had dropped to 102 million this year from 109 million in 2007. As the economy picks up, the industry expects much of that traffic to return. In this, the regional airports see opportunity, since it will bring crowding and delay to the major airports. The regional airports are typically less congested. For the year that ended Sept. 30, for example, 83 percent of flights to MacArthur arrived on time, compared with 68 percent of flights to La Guardia and 72 percent at Kennedy.
 Not every regional airport plans to grow. Westchester County Airport, which has 58 daily flights to Atlanta, Chicago, Toronto and Washington, is already operating at or close to the peak levels allowed by a 25-year-old county law that protects people who live nearby from the drone of aircraft. The restrictions limit commercial flights to four per half-hour and the number of passengers to 240 per half-hour. 
 Might that law be relaxed? ''The chances of that happening are just about as great as my getting struck by lightning and hitting the lottery on the same day,'' said Lawrence C. Salley, the county transportation commissioner.
 But at MacArthur, which is owned by the town of Islip, local resistance to airport noise has softened a bit because ''the airline industry has met that challenge with much quieter planes,'' said Phil Nolan, the town supervisor.
 The recession has made economic growth particularly desirable, a fact that strengthens the cause of airport expansion. In Islip, officials like Teresa Rizzuto, MacArthur's manager, point out that the airport has contributed to the investment of more than $184 million along the airport corridor and the creation of more than 1,600 jobs there. Moreover, they add, any expansion will be aided by the pre-recession boom; since 2004, 164 new buildings totaling 7.3 million square feet were constructed within three miles of the airport, including four hotels. 
 Still, the regional airports have limits. Local residents may like quieter planes, but they may oppose busier airports because of the resulting traffic congestion. And the airlines are cautious about starting new routes at regional airports, fearing that they will be competing with their own flights. 
 Asked why US Airways does not put more planes at the smaller regional airports, Valerie Wunder, a spokeswoman, said, ''We put our planes where the demand is.'' 
 Further, Mr. Van Beek said, airlines prefer airports where there are abundant connections, and where they have enough flights to pay for maintaining a full-time staff.
 But Ms. Rizzuto predicted that carriers' attitudes would change as passenger demand heats up. 
 ''Air congestion is atrocious,'' she said, ''and a lot of airlines are looking for reliever airports.''

HEADLINE: 36 Hours in Tucson, Ariz.

BYLINE: By RICHARD B. WOODWARD

 BODY:
TUCSON has worked hard to shed its reputation as a tanning salon for retirees and snowbirds. To complement its natural beauty -- a national park in its midst and mountains on four sides -- the city has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into its downtown during the last decade. Instead of adding strip malls and high-rises, older buildings were saved and retooled as movie houses and museums. And with a deep-rooted Hispanic community, tides of Mexican immigrants and students from the University of Arizona who never left after graduation, the city has now taken on a youthful and multicultural glow.
 Friday
 4 p.m. 1)JET AGE GRAVEYARD 
 Tucson's bone-dry climate is easy on all kinds of metal bodies. The city is a hunting ground for used-car buyers as well as home to one of the world's largest airplane graveyards. A sample of the 4,000 or so stranded military and civilian aircraft can be viewed by driving along the fence on Kolb Road by the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. For a closer look, the Pima Air & Space Museum (6000 East Valencia Road; 520-574-0462; pimaair.org) offers tours with frighteningly knowledgeable guides who can run down all the specs on the SR-71 ''Blackbird'' spy plane.
 6 p.m. 2)DINING TROLLEY
 The Southern Pacific railroad reached Tucson in 1880, and the moaning whistle of freight and passenger trains can still be heard day and night. For a front-row seat to the passing leviathans, head to the Maynard's Market and Kitchen (400 North Toole Avenue; 520-545-0577; www.maynardsmarkettucson.com). Less than 50 feet from the tracks, this dark and handsome former depot attracts an upscale crowd that comes for the extensive choice of wines (from the store next door) and the reasonably priced menu. Meat eaters enjoy the 14-ounce dry-aged New York strip ($27), and vegetarians the roast garlic and wild mushroom stone-baked pizza ($10). But just as inviting are the sights and sounds of the rattling plates and glasses.
 8 p.m. 3)TUCSON NIGHTS
 Tucson has a jumping band scene on weekends, a sleepier one the other five days. On warm nights, the noise of music pumps through the open doors of restaurants and bars along Congress Street. The center of the action is often the historic Rialto Theater (318 East Congress Street; 520-740-1000; www.rialtotheatre.com). A nonprofit showcase vital to downtown's renewal, it books major acts but has no stylistic agenda (Sonic Youth is playing on Jan. 4, and Cowboy Mouth on Jan. 14).
 Saturday
 9 a.m. 4) ROADRUNNER
 When the summer sun isn't blazing, Tucsonians head outdoors. A prime destination is the Saguaro National Park, which embraces the city on two sides. To walk among fields of multi-armed cactus giants, drive west about a half-hour along a snaking road. Look for an unmarked parking lot a few hundred feet after the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum. This is the start of the King Canyon Trail (www.saguaronationalpark.com/favorite-trails.html), put in by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s and the path for a refreshing morning hike. A covered picnic area is at mile 0.9. Fitter types can proceed 2.6 miles to Wasson Peak, highest point in the Tucson Mountains.
 Noon 5)MODERN MEXICAN
 Tucson thinks highly of its Mexican restaurants, perhaps unjustly so. One place they have a right to be proud of is Cafe Poca Cosa (110 East Pennington Street; 520-622-6400; www.cafepocacosatucson.com). Don't be put off by its location (in an ugly office building) or the decor (a vain attempt to import some glam L.A. style). The chef Suzana Davila has attracted national attention for her novel take on Mexican cuisine, which emphasizes fresh and regional. Try the daily sampler (La Plato Poca Cosa) of three dishes chosen by the chef. It usually has an exotic mole and perhaps a zinger like a vegetarian tamale with pineapple salsa. Lunch is a relative bargain (about $15 for all entrees), but dinner is more expensive (about $26 for entrees). Dinner reservations are essential for weekends.
 1:30 p.m. 6)PICTURE THIS
 One of the most impressive collections of 20th-century North American photographers can be found at the Center for Creative Photography (1030 North Olive Road; www.creativephotography.org), in a hard-to-find building on the University of Arizona campus. Containing the archives of Ansel Adams, Edward Weston, Garry Winogrand, W. Eugene Smith and more than 40 other eminent photographers, it also runs a first-rate exhibition program. On view through Jan. 31 (free) is a retrospective of the peculiar, self-effacing German emigre John Gutmann.
 3:30 p.m. 7) THE BUY AND BUY
 Phoenix-style shopping has arrived at La Encantada, a mall in the foothills of the Santa Catalinas, with Tiffany and Louis Vuitton (Skyline Drive and Campbell Avenue.; 520-615-2561; www.laencantadashoppingcenter.com). Downtown at the Plaza Palomino downtown (520-320-6344; www.plazapalominotucson.com), local merchants like Enchanted Earthworks (www.enchantedearthworks.com) carry more idiosyncratic items like funky handmade jewelry and crafts.
 5 p.m. 8)EYES ON DESERT SKIES
 The surrounding mountains are heavenly for star-gazing. The Kitt Peak National Observatory (Tohono O'odham Reservation, 520-318-8726; www.noao.edu), about 90 minutes southwest of the city and 6,900 feet above sea level, says it has more optical research telescopes than anywhere in the world. Aside from serving professional astronomers, it also has generous offerings for amateurs. One of these, the Nightly Observing Program ($48 a person), begins an hour before sunset and lasts four hours with an expert who will show you how to use star charts and identify constellations and will give you a peek through one of the mammoth instruments. (Dinner is a deli sandwich; remember to wear warm clothing.) Reserving a month in advance is recommended, but you may get lucky and find an opening the day of.
 11 p.m. 9)MORE COSMOS
 For a nightcap, head to the Club Congress (311 East Congress Street; 520-622-8848; www.hotelcongress.com/club), a boisterous joint on the ground floor of the Hotel Congress with five bar areas that offer steeply discounted drinks after 10 p.m. ($3 for shots of Jack Daniels). Live bands often have crowds of dancers spilling out into the lobby of the hotel. Finish the night at Plush (340 East 6th Street; 520-798-1298; www.plushtucson.com), where the acts are less polished but the drinks are almost as cheap and just as strong.
 Sunday
 9 a.m. 10)EARLY BIRD
 The Epic Cafe (745 North Fourth Avenue; 520-624-6844; www.epic-cafe.com) is a happening spot at almost any hour. This neighborhood hub on the corner of University Avenue is open from 6 a.m. to midnight and serves an eclectic menu of sandwiches, sweets and drinks to a clientele of would-be intellectuals with laptops and dog owners who jam the sidewalk tables. Grab a cup of the excellent coffee ($1.84) and a vegan seed cookie ($2.50). If it tastes like delicious bird food, that's because it is.
 10 a.m. 11)MISSILE AMERICA 
 For a terrifying yet educational reminder of the cold war, drive about 30 minutes south of downtown on Interstate 19 to the Titan Missile Museum (1580 West Duval Mine Road, Sahuarita; 520-625-7736; www.titanmissilemuseum.org; reservations advised). The nuclear silo housed a single intercontinental ballistic missile equipped with a warhead 700 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb. Of the 54 built in the 1960s, it is the only silo that has not been filled in or demolished. The museum tour lasts an hour. Much of it is underground, behind eight-foot-thick blast walls, and ends with a peek at the 103-foot weapon, with its warhead removed. 
 THE BASICS
 Instead of flying into Tucson, frequent visitors often land at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and drive for two hours along scenic Interstate 10. Phoenix offers more nonstop flights and is often cheaper. A round-trip flight on US Airways from Kennedy Airport in January starts at $351, according to a recent search.
 The Ritz Carlton, Dove Mountain (15000 North Secret Springs Drive; 520-572-3000; www.ritzcarlton.com/dovemountain ) opened this month with a 27-hole golf course designed by Jack Nicklaus, a luxurious spa and 253 rooms starting at $299.
 The Arizona Inn(2200 East Elm Street; 800-933-1093; www.arizonainn.com) is the granddaddy of Tucson luxury hotels and still family-owned. Spacious standard rooms start at $259. 
 Budget travelers should be more than happy with the Best Western Royal Sun Inn & Suites (1015 North Stone Avenue; 520-622-8871; www.bwroyalsun.com). Convenient to downtown and the mountains, the hotel offers free Wi-Fi, a small pool and rates starting at $110.

WHEN CHINA RULES THE WORLD
 The End of the Western World and the Birth of a New Global Order
 By Martin Jacques
 Illustrated. 550 pp. The Penguin Press. $29.95
 Historians may someday debate whether the financial crisis that began a year ago is most notable for how much damage it did to the United States, or how little it inflicted on the world's major rising power, China. Helped by huge state intervention and buoyant optimism almost surreally undiminished by the crisis of confidence across the Pacific, China has had a very good downturn. It is closing the gap with the world's most developed economies faster than anticipated and could overtake Japan as the world's second-largest economy when the final figures for last year are tallied. 
 China's already rapid emergence is changing many things, from diplomatic alliances in Africa to the status of the dollar as the world's favorite currency. It may also open minds to a provocative thesis that, until a short time ago, might have been dismissed as breathless hyperbole. 
 In ''When China Rules the World,'' Martin Jacques, a columnist for The Guardian of London and a visiting scholar at the London School of Economics, argues that China will not just displace the United States as the major superpower. It will also marginalize the West in history and upend our core notions of what it means to be modern.
 This bold assertion, he acknowledges, rests on the assumption that nothing will derail the political stability and economic dynamism China enjoys today. It is not clear that even the most senior leaders in Beijing share Jacques's faith in that forecast. But the future is unknowable, and his extrapolations are, if not provable, at least plausible. The strength of his book lies in his exhaustive, incisive exploration of possibilities that many people have barely begun to contemplate about a future dominated by China.
 Much of the journalism and many of the best-selling books on China treat the country's rise as an economic phenomenon. It is presented as a developing country, albeit the biggest one, that has opened its doors to the West, allowed a Western-style market economy to flourish and exported goods to wealthy consumers abroad. Those things are true. But Jacques argues that the focus on the economic side of the story has lulled the West into a false sense of security. ''The mainstream Western attitude has held that, in its fundamentals, the world will be relatively little changed by China's rise,'' he writes. Rather, he says, ''the rise of China will change the world in the most profound ways.''
 Unlike Britain, the United States or Germany at various times during the past 200 years, China is not emerging on the world stage as a new, powerful nation-state. It is, instead, as one Chinese writer put it, regaining ''lost international status,'' becoming the first ancient civilization to re-emerge and reclaim its position as a dominant power. 
 China was the wealthiest, most unified and most technologically advanced civilization until well into the 18th century, Jacques points out. It lost that position some 200 years ago as the industrial revolution got under way in Europe. Scholars once viewed China as having crippling social, cultural and political defects that underscored the superiority of the West. But given the speed and strength of China's recent growth, those defects have begun to look more like anomalies. It is the West's run of dominance, not China's period of malaise, that could end up being the fluke, Jacques writes.
 Skyscrapers and stock markets in China look like those in the West, of course. But Jacques argues that the country's cultural core resembles ancient China far more than it does modern Europe or the United States. It is accumulating wealth much faster than it is absorbing foreign ideas. The result, he says, is that China is nearly certain to become a major power in its own mold, not the ''status quo'' power accepting of Western norms and institutions that many policy makers in Washington hope and expect it will be.
 The enduring loyalty of its enormous diaspora and even the global popularity of Chinese food testify to the appeal of Chinese culture abroad. But the pervasiveness of a country's culture depends only partly on its appeal. It also depends on strength, which China is acquiring, and scale, which it already has.
 Many Chinese have learned English to compete better in the world economy. But the future, Jacques writes, belongs to Mandarin. It is the national tongue of one in five people in the world, and it is rapidly edging out English as the preferred second language in Asia. In the early days of the Web, the language of cyberspace was English. But the explosion of Internet use in China will tip the balance to Mandarin before long.
 China has pioneered its own style of economic production. If the Japanese became known for obsessive quality and just-in-time inventory controls, China has developed a reputation for speed and flexibility. Its companies mix and match suppliers; buy, copy or steal ideas; and churn out products just good enough and just cheap enough to sell. Many multinationals have trouble competing, even when they use Chinese labor.
 China also manages its economy in its own fashion. Its public and private sectors blur together in ways that befuddle Americans accustomed to strict separation of government and business. Ferociously competitive entrepreneurs thrive alongside a ''hyperactive and omnipresent'' state that has never ceded its right to intervene.
 As China finds its own path economically, it is unlikely to look west for political advice, Jacques suggests. Its ruling Communist Party, having largely set aside its socialist ideology, has become a modern version of an imperial dynasty. China's Communist leaders have flirted with reviving Confucianist thought, positioning themselves as protectors of Chinese unity, the state's traditional role. Many Chinese see that mission as sacred. Jacques argues, credibly, that most Chinese will back their leaders, with or without democratic reforms, as long as the country keeps getting stronger.
 So how might the world work under Pax Sinica? Jacques ventures some fascinating guesses: The United States often promotes democracy within nations. China insists on democracy among nations. If the power of countries in the international arena were determined by how many people they represent, China would have more clout than all the Western democracies combined.
 Jacques has lived in China, and he writes about his travels there. But it seems clear that he has developed his views from reading books and newspapers (a voluminous quantity of them, to be sure) rather than through any immediate experiences in China or by getting to know its people. 
 Possibly as a result, he dwells little on the everyday turmoil of Chinese life -- the melange of cultures in its cities, the violent uprisings of its peasants, the factional struggles in its leadership, the pollution in the air, the gridlock on the streets, the bubbly economy and the corrupt bureaucracy. Others have and will be more successful at conveying the human struggle for China's future.
 But the fact that China looks messier in practice than in books does not invalidate Jacques's thesis. He has written a work of considerable erudition, with provocative and often counterintuitive speculations about one of the most important questions facing the world today. And he could hardly have known, when he set out to write it, that events would so accelerate the trends he was analyzing.

HEADLINE: Living on Nothing but Food Stamps

BYLINE: By JASON DEPARLE and ROBERT M. GEBELOFF; Matthew Ericson contributed research.

DATELINE: CAPE CORAL, Fla. 

 BODY:
After an improbable rise from the Bronx projects to a job selling Gulf Coast homes, Isabel Bermudez lost it all to an epic housing bust -- the six-figure income, the house with the pool and the investment property.
 Now, as she papers the county with resumes and girds herself for rejection, she is supporting two daughters on an income that inspires a double take: zero dollars in monthly cash and a few hundred dollars in food stamps.
With food-stamp use at a record high and surging by the day, Ms. Bermudez belongs to an overlooked subgroup that is growing especially fast: recipients with no cash income.
 About six million Americans receiving food stamps report they have no other income, according to an analysis of state data collected by The New York Times. In declarations that states verify and the federal government audits, they described themselves as unemployed and receiving no cash aid -- no welfare, no unemployment insurance, and no pensions, child support or disability pay. 
 Their numbers were rising before the recession as tougher welfare laws made it harder for poor people to get cash aid, but they have soared by about 50 percent over the past two years. About one in 50 Americans now lives in a household with a reported income that consists of nothing but a food-stamp card. 
 ''It's the one thing I can count on every month -- I know the children are going to have food,'' Ms. Bermudez, 42, said with the forced good cheer she mastered selling rows of new stucco homes.
 Members of this straitened group range from displaced strivers like Ms. Bermudez to weathered men who sleep in shelters and barter cigarettes. Some draw on savings or sporadic under-the-table jobs. Some move in with relatives. Some get noncash help, like subsidized apartments. While some go without cash incomes only briefly before securing jobs or aid, others rely on food stamps alone for many months.
 The surge in this precarious way of life has been so swift that few policy makers have noticed. But it attests to the growing role of food stamps within the safety net. One in eight Americans now receives food stamps, including one in four children.
 Here in Florida, the number of people with no income beyond food stamps has doubled in two years and has more than tripled along once-thriving parts of the southwest coast. The building frenzy that lured Ms. Bermudez to Fort Myers and neighboring Cape Coral has left a wasteland of foreclosed homes and written new tales of descent into star-crossed indigence.
 A skinny fellow in saggy clothes who spent his childhood in foster care, Rex Britton, 22, hopped a bus from Syracuse two years ago for a job painting parking lots. Now, with unemployment at nearly 14 percent and paving work scarce, he receives $200 a month in food stamps and stays with a girlfriend who survives on a rent subsidy and a government check to help her care for her disabled toddler.
 ''Without food stamps we'd probably be starving,'' Mr. Britton said.
 A strapping man who once made a living throwing fastballs, William Trapani, 53, left his dreams on the minor league mound and his front teeth in prison, where he spent nine years for selling cocaine. Now he sleeps at a rescue mission, repairs bicycles for small change, and counts $200 in food stamps as his only secure support.
 ''I've been out looking for work every day -- there's absolutely nothing,'' he said.
 A grandmother whose voice mail message urges callers to ''have a blessed good day,'' Wanda Debnam, 53, once drove 18-wheelers and dreamed of selling real estate. But she lost her job at Starbucks this year and moved in with her son in nearby Lehigh Acres. Now she sleeps with her 8-year-old granddaughter under a poster of the Jonas Brothers and uses her food stamps to avoid her daughter-in-law's cooking. 
 ''I'm climbing the walls,'' Ms. Debnam said.
 Florida officials have done a better job than most in monitoring the rise of people with no cash income. They say the access to food stamps shows the safety net is working. 
 ''The program is doing what it was designed to do: help very needy people get through a very difficult time,'' said Don Winstead, deputy secretary for the Department of Children and Families. ''But for this program they would be in even more dire straits.''
 But others say the lack of cash support shows the safety net is torn. The main cash welfare program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, has scarcely expanded during the recession; the rolls are still down about 75 percent from their 1990s peak. A different program, unemployment insurance, has rapidly grown, but still omits nearly half the unemployed. Food stamps, easier to get, have become the safety net of last resort. 
 ''The food-stamp program is being asked to do too much,'' said James Weill, president of the Food Research and Action Center, a Washington advocacy group. ''People need income support.''
 Food stamps, officially the called Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, have taken on a greater role in the safety net for several reasons. Since the benefit buys only food, it draws less suspicion of abuse than cash aid and more political support. And the federal government pays for the whole benefit, giving states reason to maximize enrollment. States typically share in other programs' costs.
 The Times collected income data on food-stamp recipients in 31 states, which account for about 60 percent of the national caseload. On average, 18 percent listed cash income of zero in their most recent monthly filings. Projected over the entire caseload, that suggests six million people in households with no income. About 1.2 million are children.
 The numbers have nearly tripled in Nevada over the past two years, doubled in Florida and New York, and grown nearly 90 percent in Minnesota and Utah. In Wayne County, Mich., which includes Detroit, one of every 25 residents reports an income of only food stamps. In Yakima County, Wash., the figure is about one of every 17.
 Experts caution that these numbers are estimates. Recipients typically report a small rise in earnings just once every six months, so some people listed as jobless may have recently found some work. New York officials say their numbers include some households with earnings from illegal immigrants, who cannot get food stamps but sometimes live with relatives who do.
 Still, there is little doubt that millions of people are relying on incomes of food stamps alone, and their numbers are rapidly growing. ''This is a reflection of the hardship that a lot of people in our state are facing; I think that is without question,'' said Mr. Winstead, the Florida official. 
 With their condition mostly overlooked, there is little data on how long these households go without cash incomes or what other resources they have. But they appear an eclectic lot. Florida data shows the population about evenly split between families with children and households with just adults, with the latter group growing fastest during the recession. They are racially mixed as well -- about 42 percent white, 32 percent black, and 22 percent Latino -- with the growth fastest among whites during the recession.
 The expansion of the food-stamp program, which will spend more than $60 billion this year, has so far enjoyed bipartisan support. But it does have conservative critics who worry about the costs and the rise in dependency.
 ''This is craziness,'' said Representative John Linder, a Georgia Republican who is the ranking minority member of a House panel on welfare policy. ''We're at risk of creating an entire class of people, a subset of people, just comfortable getting by living off the government.''
 Mr. Linder added: ''You don't improve the economy by paying people to sit around and not work. You improve the economy by lowering taxes'' so small businesses will create more jobs.
 With nearly 15,000 people in Lee County, Fla., reporting no income but food stamps, the Fort Myers area is a laboratory of inventive survival. When Rhonda Navarro, a cancer patient with a young son, lost running water, she ran a hose from an outdoor spigot that was still working into the shower stall. Mr. Britton, the jobless parking lot painter, sold his blood. 
 Kevin Zirulo and Diane Marshall, brother and sister, have more unlikely stories than a reality television show. With a third sibling paying their rent, they are living on a food-stamp benefit of $300 a month. A gun collector covered in patriotic tattoos, Mr. Zirulo, 31, has sold off two semiautomatic rifles and a revolver. Ms. Marshall, who has a 7-year-old daughter, scavenges discarded furniture to sell on the Internet.
 They said they dropped out of community college and diverted student aid to household expenses. They received $150 from the Nielsen Company, which monitors their television. They grew so desperate this month, they put the breeding services of the family Chihuahua up for bid on Craigslist.
 ''We look at each other all the time and say we don't know how we get through,'' Ms. Marshall said.
 Ms. Bermudez, by contrast, tells what until the recession seemed a storybook tale. Raised in the Bronx by a drug-addicted mother, she landed a clerical job at a Manhattan real estate firm and heard that Fort Myers was booming. On a quick scouting trip in 2002, she got a mortgage on easy terms for a $120,000 home with three bedrooms and a two-car garage. The developer called the floor plan Camelot.
 ''I screamed, I cried,'' she said. ''I took so much pride in that house.''
 Jobs were as plentiful as credit. Working for two large builders, she quickly moved from clerical jobs to sales and bought an investment home. Her income soared to $180,000, and she kept the pay stubs to prove it. By the time the glut set in and she lost her job, the teaser rates on her mortgages had expired and her monthly payments soared.
 She landed a few short-lived jobs as the industry imploded, exhausted her unemployment insurance and spent all her savings. But without steady work in nearly three years, she could not stay afloat. In January, the bank foreclosed on Camelot.
 One morning as the eviction deadline approached, Ms. Bermudez woke up without enough food to get through the day. She got emergency supplies at a food pantry for her daughters, Tiffany, now 17, and Ashley, 4, and signed up for food stamps. ''My mother lived off the government,'' she said. ''It wasn't something as a proud working woman I wanted to do.''
 For most of the year, she did have a $600 government check to help her care for Ashley, who has a developmental disability. But she lost it after she was hospitalized and missed an appointment to verify the child's continued eligibility. While she is trying to get it restored, her sole income now is $320 in food stamps.
 Ms. Bermudez recently answered the door in her best business clothes and handed a reporter her resume, which she distributes by the ream. It notes she was once a ''million-dollar producer'' and ''deals well with the unexpected.''
 ''I went from making $180,000 to relying on food stamps,'' she said. ''Without that government program, I wouldn't be able to feed my children.''
 The Safety Net: With millions of jobs lost and major industries on the ropes, America's array of government aid -- including unemployment insurance, food stamps and cash welfare -- is being tested as never before. This series examines how the safety net is holding up under the worst economic crisis in decades.

HEADLINE: Building More Than Resumes

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to construction, most of us think hammers, nails and concrete. Who knew that an advanced degree would be in order for this largely blue-collar industry or, in this economy, that it would be in demand? 
 In fact, construction administration involves financing (bidding, estimating, cost control), people skills (labor negotiations) and management (project planning). Average salary: a lofty $90,000 in 2008, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And every level of credential, from certificate to Ph.D., is offered at every kind of institution, from Ivy League (Columbia University) to for-profit (University of Phoenix Online).
 At New York University, applications for this spring's master's program in construction management were up 33 percent over last year. Numbers were even higher for the graduate certification program, which usually takes a year to complete. 
 James P. Stuckey, a former real estate developer who heads N.Y.U.'s Schack Institute of Real Estate, attributes the rising interest to the federal stimulus program's emphasis on building highways, railroads and other infrastructure. At the same time, green construction requires a higher level of technological knowledge. 
 ''I believe people are recognizing that there's going to be a lot of work in those areas,'' Mr. Stuckey says.
 Is that notion shared by employers, or is graduate school simply a way station while construction companies slash payrolls? (Some 530 construction projects are stalled in New York City alone.)
 ''If you do go for a master's in construction management you're pretty eligible to work for us,'' says Peter Davoren, chairman of Turner Construction, a national company with 5,500 employees and over $10 billion in annual billings. Turner typically visits some 100 colleges and universities looking for the 250 recruits it hires every year. While the bulk of them are civil, mechanical and environmental engineers, a full 25 percent have degrees in construction management.
 Kevin Haney, a project manager at Plaza Construction in New York City, worked at a variety of construction jobs after graduating from Villanova University in 1994 with a degree in civil engineering. He later enrolled in the graduate engineering program at Columbia, with a minor in construction management. 
 ''It was definitely worthwhile, in my case,'' Mr. Haney says. ''I got some experience -- overseas and in New York -- and then I went back to school. The classes I took, at night, were directly related to the work I was doing during the day.''

HEADLINE: Ambitious Downtown Transit Project Is at Hand

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

 BODY:
In 2010, San Francisco will finally bring out the wrecking balls and cement mixers and embark on a grand overhaul of its downtown. The project could eventually result in a half-dozen new skyscrapers, including a 1,200-foot tower whose gracefully tapered top would add a defining element to the iconography of the upwardly mobile skyline. 
 Much of this grand transformation, which would leave the 853-foot Transamerica pyramid as the second-tallest structure in the city, is still in the conceptual stages. The ambitious plan for a new urban neighborhood could be scaled back. But the centerpiece of the project -- a $4.2 billion public transit hub -- has enough financing to begin construction, and the first dirt could be turned as early as March.
In the process, the squat, malodorous building at First and Mission Streets will be razed and replaced by the Transbay Transit Center, a sparkling multiuse building with links to regional bus service, Bay Area Rapid Transit trains and California's proposed high-speed rail line. 
 ''What's unusual about the whole Transbay redevelopment proposal is that it will expand downtown dramatically as well as completely change the physical profile of the city,'' said Jasper Rubin, a former city planner and an assistant professor of urban studies and planning at San Francisco State University. ''It's an incredibly ambitious plan.''
 Gabe Metcalf, executive director of the nonprofit San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association, said, ''I have never seen a project get this far along and not be built.''
 The project, designed by Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects of New Haven, could ultimately be a signature structure in a carbon-sensitive city that professes devotion to public transportation. 
 It could also change the way San Francisco sees itself and serve notice that a financially strapped city and state are still capable of undertaking bold public projects, even in an age characterized by bureaucratic stalemates and endless wrangling over spending. 
 The new terminal, scheduled to be built over five years, would serve as the anchor of a dense, dynamic neighborhood that would be filled with a mix of housing and skyscrapers. It will also include a shopping center and an elevated 5.4-acre park, potentially becoming a bustling meeting place for downtown workers and weekend wanderers alike. 
 Discussions of the project stretch back to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, which led to the demolition of the elevated Embarcadero freeway that divided the neighborhoods south of Market Street. The area around the 70-year-old bus terminal has since sprouted some new office and residential towers, but still has blocks of unsightly parking lots, bus ramps and the station itself, which often feels more like a hub for the homeless than for rush-hour commuters.
 Over the years, city planners, activists and voters considered a wide range of issues related to replacing the terminal: where the new transit center should be, who would design it and how it would be financed. Surprisingly, San Franciscans never mounted much protest to the idea of new high-rises, despite fierce resistance to such initiatives in the 1970s and early '80s when people worried about the ''Manhattanization'' of the city. In the last decade, planning picked up steam as the need to bring jobs and housing into the city's center -- and to take cars off the clogged roads -- intensified. 
 Cesar Pelli, the project's lead architect since his firm won a design competition in 2007, calls the central office tower aesthetic ''elegant and simple.'' But Mr. Pelli said his firm left ''the exuberance of the design for the transit center, which is meant to be an extraordinary public facility.''
 Drawings of the new bus and train station show a light-drenched, multilevel glass structure that will span five blocks, from Second to Main Street. A transparent roof will provide broad visibility to the leafy park above, which is meant to serve as a sort of urban retreat and amphitheater. 
 Planners say the terminal, scheduled for completion in 2015, will serve 45 million passengers a year, eliminate 8,000 automobile trips daily, and offer a mass-transit link between San Francisco to Silicon Valley, the other economic engine in the Bay Area.
 A second phase of the transit plan, with construction set to begin in 2014, is more tenuous at this point. It calls for extending the Caltrain commuter line more than a mile from the current Townsend Street station to the new center, a huge undertaking that would mean tunneling under 2nd Street. Also in the plan: a hub for California's proposed high-speed rail network, which would require state and federal taxpayers to come up with tens of billions of dollars in addition to a $10 billion bond voters approved in 2008. 
 To bring the first part of the plan close to reality, planners have tapped a remarkable number of revenue sources, including bridge tolls, additional sales taxes across the region and a variety of federal grants and loans.
 But there are still unexpected shortfalls that could delay plans. The Transbay Joint Powers Authority, which manages the project, had long hoped to raise around a half-billion dollars from the sale of land around the site to developers and bring in additional money through fees that allowed them to surpass skyscraper height limits. 
 But the recession has hurt the sales effort. Last summer, the agency withdrew the first parcel from the market after bids for the property were shockingly low. The agency is now deferring land sales until the real estate market improves while trying to compensate with other revenue streams.
 One hope is that the federal government will save the day. San Francisco has asked for $400 million from an $8 billion stimulus fund being administered by the Federal Railroad Administration for high-speed rail projects. Planners want to use the money to install the train station, or so-called ''train box,'' underneath the terminal during the first phase, which could shave a hundred million from the overall cost of the project, compared to the cost of adding it later.
 A decision on that money is due in the next two months, but somewhat ominously, virtually every other state has also submitted proposals -- some 260 in all -- for a total of $57 billion, said Warren Flatau, a spokesman for the railroad administration. 
 San Francisco has the lobbying clout of Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House of Representatives, on its side. But if planners do not get they money, architects will have to spend at least an additional four months to redesign the transit center without the train levels. 
 Maria Ayerdi-Kaplan, executive director of the Transbay Joint Powers Authority, said construction would begin this year regardless of what happened with the stimulus financing. But Ms. Kaplan also concedes that ''the longer you delay a project, the more expensive it becomes.''
 On the east side of the designated project area on the corner of Howard and Main Streets, a temporary bus terminal was just built to accommodate the Greyhound, AC Transit and Muni bus lines and their riders when the old bus terminal is torn down.
 By last week, the temporary terminal looked complete, save for some rerouting of traffic. Construction crews were awaiting the arrival of a pole bearing an original Art Deco sculpture of the Greyhound mascot. It could symbolize the idea that San Francisco is ready to sprint into the future.

HEADLINE: To-Do List Grows For Leadership Group

BYLINE: By DANIEL WEINTRAUB. 
Daniel Weintraub has reported on California politics and policy for more than 20 years.

 BODY:
The Silicon Valley Leadership Group represents business interests in a region known for being on the leading edge of innovation. But when it comes to politics, the group is decidedly retro, a throwback to the days when there was a viable center in California's civic affairs.
 With nearly 300 companies on its roster, from Accenture to Yahoo, the group stands out as a small island of ideological diversity in a sea of partisan polarization. 
 The group is for taxes or against them, depending on how they are structured; for more regulation or less of it, depending on what is being regulated; and for affordable housing, transportation financing and education reform.
 A cynic might say the group's guiding philosophy is a paraphrase of that old General Motors line: What's good for Silicon Valley is good for California. And the group's agenda for 2010 certainly reflects its narrow self-interest. But it goes deeper than that. 
 ''There are several issues where the traditional Democrat or the traditional Republican positions are a fit for the innovation economy, and several where they are left scratching their heads,'' Carl Guardino, the group's president and chief executive officer, said in an interview late last month. 
 ''We are not just immediately out-of-the-gate antitax,'' Mr. Guardino said. ''If you are going to have a good education system, quality transportation and water systems, you have to pay for those things. So sometimes our position on infrastructure issues leaves Republicans scratching their heads. But often our position on tax and regulatory issues can leave Democrats scratching their heads.''
 The group's members supported billions of dollars in general tax increases that were part of a budget package last February. But they also lobbied hard to win a tax cut that some critics described as a needless giveaway to corporations at a time when the state is desperate for cash.
 That tax break will let companies choose whether to have their income tax based on the proportion of their total sales occurring in California or on a combination of their sales and their operations here, including payrolls and property. The new rule will mean a tax cut for firms that have a big presence in California but sell most of their products in other states and countries.
 Lenny Goldberg, who runs the California Tax Reform Association with support from organized labor, hopes to repeal the tax break with a ballot measure next year. Mr. Goldberg said it was an embarrassment when Silicon Valley -- including the leadership group -- lobbied to give its companies a choice of the old income tax system or the new one, allowing them to use whichever method yielded a smaller tax bill in any given year.
 Defeating Mr. Goldberg's initiative will be a priority for the leadership group in 2010. But the group's to-do list is topped by two other measures already scheduled for next year's ballots. 
 One is a June measure that would create open primaries in California elections. If the proposal passes, voters would be able to choose among all candidates in the primaries without regard to party affiliation. The top two finishers would advance to a run-off election. 
 ''The open primary,'' Mr. Guardino said, would help ''free well-meaning legislators from the grips of the party caucuses.'' The result might be a Legislature that looks a little more like Silicon Valley and less like Orange County or Marin County.
 The leadership group's other major priority for 2010 will be passing an $11 billion bond measure to finance a historic overhaul of the state's water management system. The proposal seeks to safeguard the water supply while repairing and preserving the environmentally fragile Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. With much of Silicon Valley's water supply coming from the delta, the group sees passage of the bond as crucial to the region's future.
 Between the June and November elections, the group will be fighting in the Legislature to expand financing for affordable housing, protect transportation funding from possible budget cuts and overhaul the management of California's public schools. 
 Allies in these battles will come from the left, the right and the center, depending on the issue. The leadership group, in other words, will be in the middle of everything.

HEADLINE: Depending On the Culture Of Strangers

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
PACKAGING art by the decade isn't realistic; art doesn't come in squared-off units. But we seem to need handles on history, so that's what we do. And here we are once again, in 2010, trying to make a chronological chunk of art -- 2000s art, or new millennium art, or art of the aughts -- make sense. Whatever you call the art of the last decade, there was a ton of it. Has the world ever turned out more, in more varieties, than in the last 10 years? I doubt it.
 The 2000s really started in the late 1990s. In the early years of that decade the American economy was in woeful shape, the art market a shambles. AIDS and the culture wars raged. At the same time multiculturalism and a budding globalism were opening doors. Not only were we seeing African-American, Latino and Asian-American artists stepping onto the stage in New York in unprecedented numbers, but we were getting news from art centers in Africa, Latin America and Asia. 
 Art reflected the realities of the day, good and bad, with a new kind of content: politically informed, activist in spirit, often self-consciously ethnic in reference. Some of the work was polished, some scrappy. That it was happening at all was intensely interesting. Some work you liked, some you didn't; this, as always, came down to personal taste. History moved ahead a step.
 By 2000 the economy was a few years on the rebound. Chelsea had happened. Sales were going great. Politics, viewed by the New York market as yesterday's news, seemed distanced, or disguised or put on the shelf. The words ''beauty'' and ''pleasure'' were on insider lips. Painting was embraced like a monarch returned from exile -- at last the uprising was over -- and just in time to meet the retail demands of that most characteristically 2000s phenomena: the art fair.
 Then came Sept. 11, 2001. Pundits spoke: The catastrophe marked a cultural watershed, the beginning of a new seriousness, the death of irony. Everything, including art, would change. But art didn't change. It stayed exactly the same. Washington told Americans to spend, keep the economy pumped, and the art industry did its patriotic duty.
 As the 2000s progressed, we got acres of well-schooled paintings and drawings. We got Damien Hirst (talk about yesterday's news) at the Met, and Jeff Koons, with his big-ticket baubles and vote-for-me smile, at every turn. Leftovers by modern masters and demi-masters (Picasso, Warhol, Klimt) were taken for wonders. Art fairs grew on top of art fairs. Did I mention that United States had started a war in Iraq? The art world didn't mention it either.
 This is one view of the decade and a New York-centric one. More global perspectives are possible, to say the least. During the 2000s what began as a contemporary art boom in China grew into a colossal industry. Beijing alone had hundreds of galleries in multiple art districts. If much of the art was throw-away stuff, so is much new art everywhere.
 Thanks to a flourishing Asian economy, the decade also saw the exponential growth of the contemporary art scene in India. A handful of its artists became staples of international art festivals, though relatively few of them showed in New York. In part this is because there are only a few galleries here devoted to this art, but also because, one suspects, Indian artists weren't looking to New York for affirmation. They were involved in their own cosmopolitan and self-sustaining art world, and it kept them very busy.
 The decade was rich in new art from Africa, though we saw relatively little of it first hand. But we were given an extraordinary historical exhibition on the subject of African modernism in ''The Short Century: Independence and Liberation Movements in Africa, 1945-1994.'' Organized by the Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor, it opened in Europe in 2001 and traveled to New York the following year.
 It was one of the decade's most important shows.
 So was another historical survey, ''Inverted Utopias: Avant-Garde Art in Latin America,'' at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston in 2004, which cast comparable illumination on Latin American modernism. Its curators, Mari Carmen Ramirez and Hector Olea, served notice that in contradiction to long-held stereotypes, 20th-century Latin-American art was not: a) restricted in theme to religion and revolution; b) unitary but made up of diverse countries and cultures; and c) derivative of European modernism but supplying Europe with new information. 
 Finally, perhaps most significantly, the 2000s brought us face to face with Islamic cultures. In the days after 9/11, many art-loving New Yorkers felt impelled to visit the overlooked Islamic galleries at the Metropolitan Museum, as if to get some grasp of a religion suddenly central to their lives. Through an accident of timing, the galleries closed for renovation soon thereafter, not to reopen until 2011. In 2008, however, a spectacular museum of Islamic art opened in Qatar, and the Met made one of the hires of the decade by bringing in Sheila R. Canby from the British Museum as curator-in-charge of its Islamic collection.
 The invasion of Iraq drew attention to the malignant realities of archaeological looting and to the besetting question of who really owns what. Calls for the repatriation of art held in major American museums resounded through the decade and are not likely to end. Thomas P. Campbell, the Met's director as of 2007, will undoubtedly be called upon sooner than later to determine institutional policy. His decisions will be more than closely watched.
 Mr. Campbell's appointment was, of course, one of the decade's major New York museum changes. There were others. The American Folk Art Museum, the New Museum of Contemporary Art and the Museum of Art and Design all got new homes. The Museum of Modern Art expanded, as did El Museo del Barrio and the Bronx Museum of the Arts.
 In addition, during the 2000s the city's art institutions entered the digital age, exploiting display and communication possibilities barely tapped before. Artists also picked up on digital technology in a big way. Many now use these resources as supplements to photography, video and painting. More intriguingly, some take digital technology itself, including the Internet, as a primary medium, pioneering future-directed forms that would seem ripe for broad-based exploration.
 That probably won't happen any time soon though. Digital is hard to market. And after the recent economic scare the New York art world is scrambling back to business as usual, which means business before all else. This kind of cautious and conservative thinking made 2000s art at best a thing of only minor excitements, more often simply expendable, and beside the point. In the real world the news of the decade was 9/11, two awful wars, staggering corporate greed and the election of an African-American president. In the art world a big event was Mr. Koons showing his sculptures at Versailles. In short, life passed art by. Maybe in the new decade they'll meet.

HEADLINE: The Ballad of Blu-ray And Scratchy Old Film

BYLINE: By DAVE KEHR

 BODY:
DVDS were introduced in 1997 in the United States but didn't really take off until a few years later, when the price of players dropped low enough to make them affordable for a large number of consumers. The same thing seems to be happening now with Blu-ray, which was introduced in 2006 but has only become widely affordable in the last year or so, as the price of players has dropped from the $900 range to something on a par with a midrange DVD unit: $200 to $300 for a quite acceptable player, with budget ones available for as little as $90. And while DVD sales declined by some $1 billion in 2009 from the previous year, sales of Blu-ray discs, according to data from the Digital Entertainment Group, rose by $200 million, partially offsetting the industry downturn. 
 Does that mean that the DVD decade is over, and the era of Blu-ray is about to begin? Although it would satisfy our primal human need to divide experience into tidy 10-year slices, it is probably premature to say. 
 For one thing, Blu-ray faces much stiffer competition from other delivery services than DVDs did: companies like Apple, Netflix and Amazon are falling over one another with rival schemes for digital downloads, streaming video and video-on-demand services. For another, most consumers seem perfectly happy with DVD technology and see no reason to convert to another standard that won't be playable on much of their installed equipment. (To counter that argument, some distributors have started offering standard DVDs and computer-friendly digital files in the same Blu-ray package.) 
 There's no doubt that Blu-ray is the better technology. (Blu-ray machines can also play standard DVDs.) Blu-ray offers a sharpness of detail, stability of color and depth of sound far beyond the capabilities of DVD. And yet that's exactly why I'm wary of it. 
 As an omnivorous cinephile, I'm interested in seeing as much material as possible made available to as many viewers as possible, and Blu-ray doesn't promise much in that department. For bringing the latest Hollywood blockbusters into homes, Blu-ray is without parallel. But it is less friendly to older films, foreign films and films made with antiquated technologies (like 16 millimeter and analog video). 
 For Blu-ray to look its best it requires picture and sound images of the finest, most pristine quality. That's not difficult to come by in a contemporary release like ''Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen'' (the best-selling Blu-ray of 2009), but is somewhat more problematic for a film made in Germany in 1926. Blu-ray exaggerates the faults in older material: the dust specks and scratches caused by decades of wear and tear, the softness of detail or harshness of contrast caused by duplication from sources several generations removed from the film that actually passed through the camera. 
 Even on those rare occasions when first-rate source material exists for older films -- Kino's fine new Blu-ray of Buster Keaton's 1926 brilliant adventure-comedy ''The General,'' for example, was made from a fine-grain positive struck from the original camera negative -- the modern eye requires digital intervention to clean up the imperfections built into the original. And because digital restoration is often a zero-sum game, in which the erasing of one flaw produces another, we continue to move further from the look and feel of the first-generation film. The dust specks on a D. W. Griffith one-reeler have probably been there since the film was first developed: laboratories weren't as antiseptic then, and audiences had different expectations. 
 Restoration on that scale costs a lot, so much so that only the most famous titles seem to justify the expense, as exemplified by Warner Brothers' recent high-definition transfers of ''Gone With the Wind'' and ''The Wizard of Oz'' to Blu-ray. It's safe to say that only a tiny fraction of the movies produced by Hollywood studios, much less those from international sources, will make the cut. 
 This isn't the first time this winnowing has occurred. When VHS arrived, the format was forgiving enough to allow the studios to transfer many of their titles to tape directly from the video masters they had already made for television distribution. Many of those titles disappeared in the transition to DVD because studios felt that more obscure films wouldn't be profitable enough to justify striking new prints and preparing new digital transfers. 
 As a result huge swaths of our film heritage have vanished. After 10 years of DVD the studios seem to have concluded that all the films that will make money in home video have already been released; that number is a very small percentage of their output. Turner Classic Movies online says that of the 162,984 films listed in its database (based on the authoritative AFI Catalog), only 5,980 (3.67 percent) are available on home video. 
 At this point only Warner Brothers and Sony (the owners of the Columbia films) are maintaining a truly active library program. Fox has virtually eliminated the archival initiative that brought us marvels like the Fox Film Noir series and the box sets devoted to John Ford, Frank Borzage and F. W. Murnau. Paramount has apparently lost interest in releasing its older titles (a shame, since it also owns the Republic Pictures library, a wonderful, largely unexplored repository of genre films from the '30s, '40s and early '50s). 
 Universal makes the occasional effort on DVD, and usually does a good job with what it does, but the studio has allowed its superb library to fall almost entirely out of distribution apart from a handful of horror films and Abbott and Costello comedies. The vast majority of the 700 prime Paramount titles owned by Universal (essentially all of Paramount's sound films up to 1948) have for all practical purposes disappeared down a black hole. 
 Perhaps this policy will change now that Universal NBC has been acquired by Comcast, a cable company with a financial interest in making the most of its assets. Increasingly, however, one has to turn to Europe to find good DVDs of American studio films, like the Douglas Sirk series (most of the titles licensed from Universal) released by Carlotta Films in France, or the Blu-rays of Murnau's ''Sunrise'' and (coming) ''City Girl'' from the British company Masters of Cinema (licensed from Fox). The Criterion Collection is a national treasure, but it can't do everything. 
 Blu-ray is wonderful for what it does. Still, the most encouraging development as the decade turns is the multiplication of alternative formats and means of distribution. Cinephiles have taken matters into their own hands by trading digital copies of out-of-distribution films on the Internet. Burn-on-demand programs, like Warner Archive and TCM's Universal Collection, provide an economically viable way of making older movies available to the relatively small audience interested in them. Warner Archive has released many titles in unrestored versions that would not be acceptable as mass manufactured DVDs, though collectors seem glad to have them (even at a steep $19.95). Perhaps other companies will follow the Warner Brothers example, if only as an intermediary step toward the wide implementation of video on demand. 
 We will probably never achieve the utopian vision of having every film ever made available at the click of a mouse, but we are certain to move a little bit further in that direction in the decade ahead -- with the cooperation of the studios or without them. (Copyrights will soon be expiring on the first wave of talkies.) In the meantime let us praise diversity. As confusing as the format wars may be, they keep hope alive.

 BODY:
THE REALITY
 If you've written a few five-figure tuition checks or taken on 10 years' of debt, you probably think you're paying to be taught by full-time professors. But it's entirely possible that most of your teachers are freelancers.
In 1960, 75 percent of college instructors were full-time tenured or tenure-track professors; today only 27 percent are. The rest are graduate students or adjunct and contingent faculty -- instructors employed on a per-course or yearly contract basis, usually without benefits and earning a third or less of what their tenured colleagues make. The recession means their numbers are growing. 
 ''When a tenure-track position is empty,'' says Gwendolyn Bradley, director of communications at the American Association of University Professors, ''institutions are choosing to hire three part-timers to save money.''
 THE PROBLEM
 While many adjuncts are talented teachers with the same degrees as tenured professors, they're treated as second-class citizens on most campuses, and that affects students.
 It's sometimes harder to track down adjuncts outside of class, because they rarely have offices or even their own departmental mailboxes. 
 Many patch together jobs at different colleges to make ends meet, and with commuting, there's less time to confer with students or prepare for class. It's not unusual for adjuncts to be hired at the last minute to teach courses they've never taught. And with no job security, they may consider it advantageous to tailor classes for student approval. 
 HOW TO
 Colleges tend to play down the increasingly central role of adjuncts. This fall, the American Federation of Teachers complained that some top-ranked universities exaggerated the percentage of full-time faculty to U.S. News & World Report for its rankings. U.S. News declined to investigate. 
 Another source is the ''Compare Higher Education Institutions'' search tool at A.F.T.'s Higher Education Data Center (highereddata.aft.org). These are the stats that colleges report to the federal government. 
 Ask admissions officers point-blank: what percentage of classes and discussion sections are taught by part-timers and graduate assistants, and are they required to hold office hours?
 For entry-level classes -- the ones tenured faculty famously don't want to teach -- the squeaky wheel often gets a full-time professor, says Harlan Cohen, author of ''The Naked Roommate: And 107 Other Issues You Might Run Into in College.'' ''If you're not thrilled with your adjunct professor,'' he says, ''go to the head of the department and see what options are available. They may put you in a different section.'' 
 CAVEATS
 If you take a strict anti-adjunct stance, you may miss out on some star instructors -- Barack Obama taught a seminar on racism and the law at the University of Chicago Law School as an adjunct. Professoring part-time is a hobby for overachieving architects, graphic designers, lawyers and entrepreneurs, all of whom can share insights from real-world experiences that full-time academics haven't had. 
 ''Before making assumptions that an adjunct is bad, Google them,'' Mr. Cohen says. ''You may find that real estate teacher is one step removed from Donald Trump's V.P. on LinkedIn, and these are the types of people you want to meet.''

HEADLINE: An Undocumented Princetonian

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER. 
Joseph Berger, a metro reporter for The Times, is working with Harold Fernandez on a memoir. This article is adapted from the book.

 BODY:
IN lyrical passages of ''This Side of Paradise,'' F. Scott Fitzgerald's young alter ego, Amory Blaine, is awed by the ''great dreaming spires'' of Princeton and its ''lazy beauty, its half-grasped significance, the wild moonlight revel of the rushes.'' Three generations later, Harold Fernandez was no less awed by the castle-like dormitories, the teeming libraries, the hoary traditions.
 But Harold Fernandez was different from most freshmen. Amory Blaine had been to prep school, and his mother, though not of the privileged class, had raised him to appreciate the treasures of Western culture. Harold had been raised in the streets of Medellin, Colombia, listening to tango and salsa lyrics that spoke of the harsh local realities of violence, drugs and prison. His American schooling was in a gritty factory town, West New York, N.J.
 He also harbored a secret. He had entered Princeton using a fake green card and Social Security number that he had acquired in the immigrant black market, because he had been smuggled into Florida on a leaky boat crowded with illegal immigrants. 
 Relentless poverty had driven his parents to leave him and his younger brother Byron in Medellin as they scraped together a living in the United States. The parents missed their sons terribly and were desperate to have them escape what was then the world's cocaine capital. The boys' childhood neighborhood was lively with children kicking soccer balls, but Harold had twice witnessed young men being shot to death in drug wars; violence would ultimately claim six of his own relatives. 
 At age 13, he had not seen his father for four years or his mother for two. And so in October of 1978, he and Byron said goodbye at the Medellin airport to the two grandmothers who had cared for them. Even today, he can recall the sadness written on their faces; if the boys reached their destination, they might never see them again. 
 The boys made their way to the tiny island of North Bimini, where they and a dozen other migrants waited 12 days for the treacherous seas of the Bermuda Triangle to calm for their clandestine voyage. 
 Just before midnight one moonless night, the group clambered aboard a 25-foot wooden cabin cruiser that did not seem seaworthy enough to take them the 50 miles to the coast of Florida. As they huddled around the cabin table, the boat lurched and bounced over the waves. Harold remembers the terror in the grown-ups' eyes. Soon almost everyone was seasick, dashing to the toilet to vomit. ''Padre nuestro que estas en el cielo, santificado sea tu nombre,'' they murmured, the Lord's Prayer.
 By daybreak the weary, battered travelers glimpsed the jagged skyline of Miami. When they disembarked, they staggered a few hundred yards to a public telephone, where they took turns calling relatives. The joyful lilt of his mother's voice when she learned her sons were safe is still clear in Harold Fernandez's mind. Yet he sometimes considers what his reckless crossing cost: years as an outlaw, with the fear that each day would be his last in America.
 With steady work and fierce ambition, the boy weathered West New York's rough-and-tumble culture to become valedictorian of Memorial High School and gain admission to Princeton. Whatever his back story, he was now required to thrive on this side of paradise. 
 HAROLD FERNANDEZ arrived on campus in 1985, two weeks before most of the class, to take part in a program for poor and minority students or those from high schools without the array of Advanced Placement courses that Princeton freshmen usually had. Princeton wanted to introduce these students to its academic demands by giving them a taste of calculus, chemistry and writing. It was writing, Harold remembers, that was his biggest challenge, and his mangling of everyday English would haunt him throughout his college years. 
 For his first year, Harold was assigned a small room with a window overlooking a stately Gothic courtyard in the Hamilton Hall dorm in Mathey, one of Princeton's residential colleges. He shared it with a Mexican immigrant from East Los Angeles who had a deceptively aristocratic bearing: he actually was paying his way by washing dishes in the cafeteria. The other Mathey students were daunting; they included the sons of lawyers, businessmen, even a Rockefeller. Once, in the cafeteria, Harold was slathering peanut butter and jelly on bread as a strikingly tall, attractive girl waited for him to finish. He realized it was Brooke Shields -- the Brooke Shields. She was a junior. He pretended not to be starstruck, but he was. He felt, in Fitzgerald's words, ''stiff and awkward among these white flannelled, bareheaded youths'' and he envied ''the savoir-faire with which they strolled.'' 
 At night, as he tried to fall asleep, he wondered about his West New York education. Could it match that of students who had gone to selective schools? He assumed his SAT scores were among the lowest in his class. He moved around campus feeling as if he were onstage and the other students were reviewing his performance and finding it wanting. Although he dressed neatly, he was painfully aware that his clothes were cut-rate. One classmate, the son of a physician, ''went out shopping with his parents and came back with a pair of $200 shoes,'' Harold recalls. ''I had never spent more than $20 on a pair.''
 The young immigrant ate all his meals in the cafeteria, whose food he considered ''gourmet quality,'' though most of his classmates knew better. He worked shifts washing dishes and he tutored the daughter of his Latin American literature professor in calculus. 
 Luckily, he says, his grandmothers had hammered self-respect into him. He was proud of the solitary women who had raised him, and proud of how hard his father and mother had worked to send money to Colombia to put food on the family table. Still, each time he uttered his awkward sentences, he was sure other students wondered what he was doing at Princeton. 
 In the classroom he was very quiet, he says. But as the year progressed, he showed a firm grasp of the course material on written tests. He would read a required chapter so many times he would memorize much of it. He was always ahead of the reading list by two weeks. He kept two notebooks for every course, one recording what the professor had said in class and the other containing more organized summaries supplemented with explanations and diagrams. To study, he found private niches where there were no distractions. He was particularly attached to the classrooms in Palmer Hall, where nearly half a century before Einstein had given some of his lectures. 
 ''Just the idea of sitting in the same rooms where mankind's greatest mind had worked was inspiring,'' he says now. ''I would read about a problem, solve it, and then step up to the blackboard and pretend that I was teaching it to someone else. I would do this routine in a loud voice. I found that if I could teach a concept to someone else, then I understood it. Besides, I figured that no one else would want to share a room with someone who was studying in such a nutty way.'' 
 He received A's his first semester, and at the start of spring semester, he received a personal letter from Nancy Kanach, then Mathey's director of studies, which said that he was one of the college's top freshmen. With tears in his eyes, he read the letter over many times. He was proving wrong those who had dismissed him as an undeserving beneficiary of affirmative action. He suspects that he was admitted as a result of such a policy. But Princeton's admissions committee, he felt, had paid attention to the fact that his accomplishments were achieved after arriving in this country as a Spanish-speaking 13-year-old.
 IF he was beginning to feel he might be a legitimate part of this cherished American institution, that confidence would end one spring evening. Students would soon be going home for the break, and he was eagerly looking forward to again tasting his mother's arepas -- stuffed tortillas -- and listening to his parents' earthy Spanish wit. He ate dinner with the young woman he was dating, as he did most weeknights, and they returned to the dorm. At the mailboxes he spied an envelope. 
 It was a form letter from the adviser to foreign-born students, Janina M. Issawi. Those who were not citizens or permanent residents were asked to set up appointments and bring their documents to be photocopied. According to a Princeton spokeswoman, Emily Aronson, the university had to verify that these students were eligible for federal loans or work-study jobs. Harold had received a Pell grant and federal loans, both restricted to citizens or permanent residents. He was neither.
 A copy of his green card had been submitted with his application; now Princeton was asking for the original. But the original was a crude forgery. 
 The dream that had begun at a Florida dock was about to shatter. His face must have telegraphed his shock, because his girlfriend asked him immediately what was wrong. ''I can't tell you now,'' he remembersresponding. ''I need to go back to my room.'' 
 She insisted on accompanying him, and in his room she reached into his coat pocket and grabbed the letter. He let her read it. He had never spoken about his immigration status to anyone on campus, but now he did. He revealed that he could be deported to Colombia overnight if immigration officials discovered the truth. At the least, Princeton would throw him out. 
 ''Although we had been together for just a few months, we were falling in love,'' he says. ''So when the full weight of my predicament sank in, tears were welling in her eyes, I could see. Somehow her emotions showed me how much she cared and bolstered me for the troubled days ahead.'' 
 He did not tell his parents. He knew it would tear them up to learn that he might be expelled, shorn of the opportunities they had worked so hard to give him. His father's locker at the embroidery factory where he worked was plastered with local newspaper articles about his son's accomplishments in the classroom and on the track and soccer teams. His father would buttonhole coworkers and his boss and show off the clippings. The boss might earn more money, but he did not have a son at Princeton. 
 Harold could not summon the nerve to show the adviser fake documents. A few years earlier, he had failed to obtain a genuine Social Security card (his father had acquired one years earlier; he says he was never asked for proof of immigration status). All Harold would have had to do was flash his fake green card at a government clerk in Long Branch, N.J. If a clerk could intimidate him, how much more would a Princeton official? 
 He decided he had to confess, but first he confided in someone he had come to trust -- his professor in Latin American literature, Arcadio Diaz-Quinones. 
 The professor closed the door to his office, and they sat down at a small table. Harold did not utter a word. The tensions that had built up spilled out. He dropped his head on the table and wept. 
 Professor Diaz put his hand on his shoulder consolingly. After a few minutes, Harold collected himself and unfolded his saga. Professor Diaz seemed to listen to the tale as if it were a picaresque novel. Professor Diaz, who still teaches at Princeton, recalls that when Harold was done, he advised him not to tell anyone and to keep at his schoolwork. He says he assured Harold that he would speak to Mrs. Issawi and to the university's president, William G. Bowen. 
 A few days later, Harold was asked to meet with Ms. Kanach. He found her just as friendly in person as in her letter congratulating him on his record. Ms. Kanach, who is now senior associate dean of the college, remembers the encounter only vaguely. Harold says he remembers it clearly. He says she told him Princeton was proud to have him as a student but identified two formidable problems he had created for the university. First, he had broken Princeton's honor code, which essentially affirms that students will not cheat or lie. Moreover, he had improperly received government money intended for American citizens or permanent residents. 
 ''Just as I was feeling crushed by the gravity of these issues,'' he remembers, ''she went on to say: 'But, Harold, both problems have solutions.' '' 
 To address the first, he would have to write an essay explaining his understanding of the honor code, how he had broken it and why he deserved a pardon. To resolve the second, Princeton would change his status to that of a foreign student and furnish grants and loans with its own funds, laying out more than $16,000 a year. It was like having a full Princeton scholarship. 
 Ms. Aronson confirms that the university engaged in this practice for some foreign-born students, adding that since 2001, Princeton has replaced all need-based loans with grants, ''regardless of national origin.'' Also, the admissions office does not consider immigration status in making its decisions, she says, and ''there are no laws that would require us to do so.''
 Harold says, ''I think the fact that I was doing so well in my courses and was playing on a school soccer team helped my case. Nevertheless, I was moved by the school's generosity toward someone whom they could have shrugged off as an unscrupulous intruder.'' 
 He left Ms. Kanach's office feeling enormous relief, he says, but he was not in the clear. He was no longer an impostor at Princeton, but his family was illegally in the United States. Authorities could still send them back to Colombia. With that as well, Princeton would help. 
 Harold traveled home for a weekend to tell his parents what had happened, but in reverse order. Princeton had offered a meeting with a university lawyer who specialized in immigration so that his parents might legalize their status. And then he told them about his confession. 
 His mother sat next to him gently crying. Even today, she agonizes over the decision to immigrate illegally, and what it put her children through. She expressed appreciation to Princeton and said: ''Harold, mi amor, you are doing great. Keep working hard and they will keep on helping you.'' 
 EPILOGUE
 The family attained legal residency, and among the arguments on their behalf was a letter from a Princeton alumnus then in the Senate, Bill Bradley. Harold Fernandez went on to graduate from Princeton magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1989, and to train at Harvard Medical School and New York University Medical Center. Now 44, he is a cardiac surgeon affiliated with St. Francis Hospital in Roslyn, N.Y., where he performs bypass operations and valve replacements that allow his patients to live longer, more vigorous lives.

HEADLINE: Making College 'Relevant'

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE. 
Kate Zernike is a national reporter for The Times. Rachel Aviv contributed reporting.

 BODY:
THOMAS COLLEGE, a liberal arts school in Maine, advertises itself as Home of the Guaranteed Job! Students who can't find work in their fields within six months of graduation can come back to take classes free, or have the college pay their student loans for a year.
 The University of Louisiana, Lafayette, is eliminating its philosophy major, while Michigan State University is doing away with American studies and classics, after years of declining enrollments in those majors. 
 And in a class called ''The English Major in the Workplace,'' at the University of Texas, Austin, students read ''Death of a Salesman'' but also learn to network, write a resume and come off well in an interview. 
 Even before they arrive on campus, students -- and their parents -- are increasingly focused on what comes after college. What's the return on investment, especially as the cost of that investment keeps rising? How will that major translate into a job? 
 The pressure on institutions to answer those questions is prompting changes from the admissions office to the career center. But even as they rush to prove their relevance, colleges and universities worry that students are specializing too early, that they are so focused on picking the perfect major that they don't allow time for self-discovery, much less late blooming. 
 ''The phrase drives me crazy -- 'What are you going to do with your degree?' -- but I see increasing concerns about that,'' says Katharine Brooks, director of the liberal arts career center at the University of Texas, Austin, and author of ''You Majored in What? Mapping Your Path From Chaos to Career.'' ''Particularly as money gets tighter, people are going to demand more accountability from majors and departments.''
 Consider the change captured in the annual survey by the University of California, Los Angeles, of more than 400,000 incoming freshmen. In 1971, 37 percent responded that it was essential or very important to be ''very well-off financially,'' while 73 percent said the same about ''developing a meaningful philosophy of life.'' In 2009, the values were nearly reversed: 78 percent identified wealth as a goal, while 48 percent were after a meaningful philosophy. 
 The shift in attitudes is reflected in a shifting curriculum. Nationally, business has been the most popular major for the last 15 years. Campuses also report a boom in public health fields, and many institutions are building up environmental science and just about anything prefixed with ''bio.'' Reflecting the new economic and global realities, they are adding or expanding majors in Chinese and Arabic. The University of Michigan has seen a 38 percent increase in students enrolling in Asian language courses since 2002, while French has dropped by 5 percent. 
 Of course, universities have always adjusted curriculum to reflect the changing world; Kim Wilcox, the provost and vice president for academic affairs at Michigan State, notes that universities, his included, used to offer majors in elocution and animal husbandry. In a major re-examination of its curriculum, Michigan State has added a dozen or so new programs, including degrees in global studies and, in response to a growing industry in the state, film studies. At the same time, it is abandoning underperformers like classical studies: in the last four years, only 13 students have declared it their major.
 Dropping a classics or philosophy major might have been unthinkable a generation ago, when knowledge of the great thinkers was a cornerstone of a solid education. But with budgets tight, such programs have come to seem like a luxury-- or maybe an expensive antique -- in some quarters.
 When Louisiana's regents voted to eliminate the philosophy major last spring, they agreed with faculty members that the subject is ''a traditional core program of a broad-based liberal arts and science institution.'' But they noted that, on average, 3.4 students had graduated as philosophy majors in the previous five years; in 2008, there were none. ''One cannot help but recognize that philosophy as an essential undergraduate program has lost some credence among students,'' the board concluded.
 In one recent survey, two-thirds of public institutions said they were responding to budget cuts with extensive reviews of their programs. But Dr. Wilcox says curriculum changes at Michigan State have just as much to do with what students, and the economy, are demanding. ''We could have simply reduced the campus operating budget by X percent,'' he says, ''but we wouldn't have positioned ourselves any differently for the future.'' 
 In Michigan, where the recession hit early and hard, universities are particularly focused on being relevant to the job market. ''There's been this drumbeat that Michigan has got to diversify its economy,'' says Mary Sue Coleman, the president of the University of Michigan. 
 Dr. Coleman says she had an ''aha'' moment five years ago, when the director of admissions was describing the incoming class and noted that 10 percent -- some 600 students -- had started a business in high school. The university has responded with about 100 entrepreneurship courses across the curriculum, including ''Financing Research Commercialization'' and ''Engineering Social Venture Creation,'' for students interested in creating businesses that not only do well financially but also do society good. Next year, the university will begin offering a master's to students who commit to starting a high-tech company.
 At the same time, Dr. Coleman is wary of training students for just one thing -- ''creating them to do some little widget,'' as she says. Michigan has begun a speaker series featuring alumni or other successful entrepreneurs who come in to talk about how their careers benefited from what Dr. Coleman calls ''core knowledge.'' 
 ''We believe that we do our best for students when we give them tools to be analytical, to be able to gather information and to determine the validity of that information themselves, particularly in this world where people don't filter for you anymore,'' Dr. Coleman says. ''We want to teach them how to make an argument, how to defend an argument, to make a choice.'' These are the skills that liberal arts colleges in particular have prided themselves on teaching. But these colleges also say they have the hardest time explaining the link between what they teach and the kind of job and salary a student can expect on the other end.
 ''There's no immediate impact, that's the problem,'' says John J. Neuhauser, the president of St. Michael's College, a liberal arts school in Vermont. ''The humanities tend to educate people much farther out. They're looking for an impact that lasts over decades, not just when you're 22.''
 When prospective students and their parents visit, he says, they ask about placement rates, internships and alumni involvement in job placement. These are questions, he says, that he never heard 10 years ago.
 St. Michael's, like other colleges, has adapted its curriculum to reflect demand. The college had to create new sections of chemistry labs and calculus on the spot during summer registration, and it raised the cap on the number of students in a biology lab. ''I'd say, given the vagaries of the business cycle, people are looking for things that they know will always be needed -- accountants, scientists, mathematicians,'' says Jeffrey A. Trumbower, dean of the college. ''Those also happen to be some of the most challenging majors academically, so we'll see how these trends hold up.''
 Still, Dr. Neuhauser finds the careerism troubling. ''I think people change a great deal between 18 and 22,'' he says. ''The intimate environment small liberal arts colleges provide is a great place to grow up. But there's no question that smacks of some measure of elitism now.''
 There's evidence, though, that employers also don't want students specializing too soon. The Association of American Colleges and Universities recently asked employers who hire at least 25 percent of their workforce from two- or four-year colleges what they want institutions to teach. The answers did not suggest a narrow focus. Instead, 89 percent said they wanted more emphasis on ''the ability to effectively communicate orally and in writing,'' 81 percent asked for better ''critical thinking and analytical reasoning skills'' and 70 percent were looking for ''the ability to innovate and be creative.''
 ''It's not about what you should major in, but that no matter what you major in, you need good writing skills and good speaking skills,'' says Debra Humphreys, a vice president at the association. 
 The organization has conducted focus groups with employers before and heard the same thing. With the recession, she says, they weren't sure the findings would hold. ''But it's even more intense. Companies are demanding more of employees. They really want them to have a broad set of skills.'' She adds that getting employer feedback is the association service that ''college leaders find the most valuable, because they can answer the question when parents ask, 'Is this going to help in getting a job?' ''
 Career advisers say that colleges and universities need to do a better job helping students understand the connection between a degree and a job. At some institutions, this means career officers are heading into the classroom.
 Last fall at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, the career office began integrating workplace lessons into capstone research seminars for humanities majors. In one of three classes taught by Anne Scholl-Fiedler, the director, she asks students to develop a 30-second commercial on their ''personal brand.'' ''When somebody asks, 'How are you going to use that English degree?' you need to be able to clearly articulate what you are able to do,'' she says. ''If you don't know, employers probably won't either.''
 At the University of Texas, Ms. Brooks says, many parents drop their children off freshman year asking, ''How can my child transfer to the business school?'' She tries to establish the value of the liberal arts with a series of courses called ''The Major in the Workplace.'' Students draw what she calls a ''major map,'' an inventory of things they have learned to do around their major. Using literature -- ''The Great Gatsby,'' perhaps, or ''Death of a Salesman'' -- she gets students to think about how the themes might apply to a workplace, then has them read Harvard Business Review case studies. The goal, she says, is to get students to think about how an English major (or a psychology or history major) might view the world differently, and why an employer might value that. 
 ''There's this linear notion that what you major in equals your career,'' Ms. Brooks says. ''I'm sure it works for some majors. If you want to be an electrical engineer, that major looks pretty darn good.
 ''The truth is,'' she says, ''students think too much about majors. But the major isn't nearly as important as the toolbox of skills you come out with and the experiences you have.''

HEADLINE: You Can Go Back Again

BYLINE: By RACHEL AVIV

 BODY:
SIX years ago, as a senior at the University of Colorado, Boulder, Meg Goodwin was motivated in her job search by social anxiety as much as anything else. Her friends had positions lined up, so she wanted one, too. She went to the career counseling center and signed up for interviews for 10 different jobs, none of which she particularly wanted. 
 Now a financial planner, Ms. Goodwin is still not sure she ever figured out what she wanted to do. As the employment rate steadily slipped and her line of work became increasingly inhospitable, she, like many alumni around the country, has returned to her university's career center to begin the search process all over again. ''It's a humbling experience to go back to your old school and be asking for help,'' says Ms. Goodwin, who is now considering a career in corporate education. 
 Traditionally, career counselors have cut off graduates 6 or 12 months out. But with an influx of requests from alumni who are now or fear they soon will be unemployed, career services offices have become a hub for disenchanted graduates, some of whom have not been back to campus for years. In the last year, Boulder had so many visits from alumni that the career services office hired a new staff member to focus exclusively on their needs. In addition to administering personality tests, editing resumes, facilitating opportunities for networking and doing interview prep, the newly hired alumni counselor, Lea Alvarado, finds herself spending a good deal of time simply offering encouragement.
 ''Those who have never been rejected before are now experiencing it for the first time,'' Ms. Alvarado says.
 While some universities charge alumni $25 or $50 for career counseling sessions, the University of Colorado's are free. Colleges that don't charge are not just altruistic. The career office provides a way of staying in contact with graduates -- successful alumni may be more likely to help others find jobs, or even contribute money. 
 ''Obviously, knowing that the university still cares about me after I've paid my final tuition bills makes me that much more willing to give down the road,'' says Brian Fessler, who graduated in 2006 from the State University of New York at Albany. Its career services offices have seen a 28 percent increase in the number of sessions with alumni in the past year.
 At Rutgers in New Jersey, there has been a 119 percent increase in the past two school years, and the university now holds networking sessions and seminars for alumni. At last month's ''speed networking'' session, 300 chairs were aligned in pairs, and employed alumni had three-minute conversations with current students and alumni without jobs. The job-seekers rapidly introduced themselves, and the mentors gave out business cards and dispensed tips; at the sound of a whistle, they stood up and moved on to the next chair. 
 At another event, alumni learned the importance of ''articulating your brand.'' The audience included gray-haired women who had come back to the job market after years of raising children as well as 23-year-olds fresh out of college. The speaker encouraged them all to identify their ''invisible skills'' and learn to resign themselves -- and adapt quickly -- to a job market whose complexities have evolved from a ''zoo to a jungle.''

HEADLINE: What's a Bailed-Out Banker Worth?

BYLINE: By STEVEN BRILL. 
Steven Brill, the author of ''After: The Rebuilding and Defending of America in the September 12 Era,'' is the co-founder of Journalism Online.

 BODY:
Last August, as midnight approached on a Friday, two Treasury Department staff members sat in a cramped basement office in the Treasury Building next to the White House and watched as their e-mail in-boxes filled up. The aides worked for Kenneth Feinberg, the government's special master for executive compensation, and they were awaiting submissions from companies that had received (and not yet paid back) billions in what federal regulations call ''exceptional assistance'' from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. The government had the authority to set compensation levels at those seven TARP recipients, and this was the companies' opportunity to plead for salaries and bonuses for each of its top 25 executives. Chrysler Financial and General Motors submitted their proposals -- about 2,000-plus pages each -- a few days before. Now, like college kids crashing a term paper, the other five -- A.I.G., Bank of America, Chrysler, Citigroup and General Motors Acceptance Corporation -- were frantically trying to get their pitches into Treasury's digital in-box by the Aug. 14 deadline. 
Feinberg, a 64-year-old lawyer with an often-booming voice and pronounced Boston accent, has said jokingly that he loves ''jobs that seem so hard that they have a low bar for success.'' This one, for which he is not accepting a salary, fits the bill. In proposals from the TARP Seven and in confrontations that followed the August deadline, Feinberg would hear arguments that Main Street America would find incredible. Citigroup and Bank of America, for example, concluded that everyone in their executive suites was above average when compared with peers at other giant banks that didn't need a bailout. Or there was A.I.G.'s behind-closed-doors argument against Feinberg's directive to pay its top people in large part with A.I.G. stock. The company's reasoning? That the stock -- trading briskly at the time at around $40 on the New York Stock Exchange -- was actually worthless. Yet Feinberg would be pushed by staff at Treasury and officials of the Federal Reserve Bank to accept that argument and others in order to keep the captains of these broken companies from quitting.
 Feinberg's other constituency -- the rest of America, as represented by members of Congress -- wasn't so eager to placate the executives. Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who is the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and whose views on this flash-point issue reflected a broad sentiment, told me recently that his attitude was, and is: ''Let 'em quit. Who needs them? How can we reward the same people who screwed up in the first place?'' Indeed, if to many on Wall Street the spectacle of their best and brightest reduced to submitting payroll permission slips to government bureaucrats was a dangerous exercise in populist pandering, to almost everyone else it was an overdue reckoning. 
 When Feinberg announced his pay packages in late October, he found a way to give something to everyone. The public enjoyed a measure of revenge: Feinberg's ultimate rulings looked hard-nosed when compared with what the executives used to make. Yet the leaders of these failed companies still ended up winning big paydays -- an average of $6.5 million to each Bank of America executive and $6.2 million to those at Citigroup. Meantime, the Obama administration looked tough on fat-cat compensation, even as it quietly cajoled Feinberg to ease up on some of the restrictions he wanted to impose. 
 Feinberg's power was limited from the start and is now fading as quickly as it rose up last spring amid the furor over huge bonuses given to bailed-out executives. While other companies receiving smaller or different kinds of bailouts were subject to general compensation restrictions (like a ban on lavish severance payments or guaranteed bonuses), Feinberg's authority to set specific pay packages applied only to the seven companies that got the most TARP money. Today, two of those firms -- Bank of America and Citigroup -- have made arrangements to pay the government back, so that they will no longer be under Feinberg's thumb. Still, Feinberg's stint as paymaster is important for two reasons. As someone with no ax to grind, Feinberg produced a credible template for broader compensation reform -- reforms that corporate boards could adopt on their own. But the fact that it required such elaborate staging just to rein in a portion of the payouts at companies temporarily controlled by the government also illustrates just how difficult systemic reform will be. 
 THE BABE RUTH STANDARD
 How people are paid at the top in a free-market system has always been a contentious issue, especially in bad times. Babe Ruth's most famous quip was not about baseball but about salaries. When asked in 1930 if it was right that he should be making more money than President Hoover, he replied, ''I had a better year than he did.'' 
 It's an issue that people come at from different angles. There's the equity approach: Is it ''fair'' that executives at big companies should make 275 times (today's approximate ratio) what their average employees make? Setting high tax rates for what are regarded as excessive earnings is a popular fairness remedy, as we've seen lately with a proposal for a surtax on bonuses that was recently passed in England and another being pushed in France. (It is likely to surface in Washington this winter too.) 
 On the other side, there is the free-market view: Whatever consenting adults agree to is fine. If the Babe had hit no home runs and the Yankees still wanted to pay him $80,000 a year (President Hoover made $75,000), that would have been between the Yankees and its slumping slugger. 
 Then there is the middle-ground idea that the free market should be regulated -- not for the larger purposes of social fairness, but to ensure that shareholders, especially public shareholders, are well served or at least well informed. This could mean that shareholders would be able to make their boards set clear standards tied to an executive's performance, as measured, for example, by the company's share price or its profit. Or it could mean that the government sets rules, requiring, for example, that top executives' compensation be disclosed to shareholders (as is now the case, though clarity and completeness are often lacking), or mandating an annual vote by shareholders on top executives' compensation packages -- which is included in a reform bill recently passed by the House of Representatives, though it would be only a nonbinding, ''advisory'' ballot meant to embarrass boards into doing the right thing. 
 Whatever the approach, even defining fair compensation is harder than it looks, as is implementing reforms that don't have unintended consequences. When governments intervene to impose taxes or put limits on bonuses, for example, companies tend to increase salaries or introduce new perks. When the issue is left to the companies' boards, endless questions peck away at the seemingly simple idea of paying executives based on performance. If pay is based on what an executive's peers at other companies get, how is a peer group defined? Why penalize and demoralize talented employees if the firm's stock or profits are down because the economy as a whole collapsed, or because the company incurred a short-term loss while making a sensible long-term investment? Besides, as a general matter isn't it just plain silly to worry about spending a few extra million to keep the leaders at the top happy when they're making decisions with billions at stake?
 Questions like these add up to infinite reasons -- or excuses -- for why standards, whether set by boards or regulators, haven't had much effect. Over the last 50 years, the ratio of top pay to average pay at public companies has multiplied roughly 11 times (24:1 to 275:1). That's more pay in one workday for the chief executive than his average employee makes in a year. Academic journals, compensation-consultant white papers and even corporate proxy statements (typically in the section introducing wildly extravagant pay plans) are filled with the apple-pie watchwords of prudent compensation: ''transparency,'' ''independence'' (of board compensation committees), ''long-term'' and, of course, ''performance.'' Turning these principles into specifics, as Feinberg had to do, rarely happens. 
 Warren Buffett, the famed investor and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, offered this view of the problem -- and his own impotence in solving it -- in his 2006 letter to shareholders: 
 ''Too often, executive compensation in the U.S. is ridiculously out of line with performance. . . . . A mediocre-or-worse C.E.O. -- aided by his handpicked V.P. of human relations and a consultant from the ever-accommodating firm of Ratchet, Ratchet and Bingo -- all too often receives gobs of money from an ill-designed compensation arrangement. . . . . The drill is simple: Three or so directors -- not chosen by chance -- are bombarded for a few hours before a board meeting with pay statistics that perpetually ratchet upward. Additionally, the committee is told about new perks that other managers are receiving. In this manner, outlandish 'goodies' are showered upon C.E.O.'s simply because of a corporate version of the argument we all used when children: 'But, Mom, all the other kids have one.' ''
 Indeed, what has happened with executive compensation -- and what that blizzard of paper that Feinberg would review is so emblematic of -- is that a culture of entitlement has apparently become the norm. It's not a matter of how much anyone in particular makes, and certainly not a question of an innovator like a Steve Jobs hitting the jackpot. The problem is that so many now seem automatically to receive so much (the chief executives in the Fortune 500 averaged $11 million in 2008) despite average or poor performance -- or, in the case of the TARP companies, performance that was so colossally bad that it almost brought down the financial system. 
 That a government regulator now had the power to decide the paychecks at seven companies that failed so conspicuously would seem to offer a laboratory for concocting real reform. But Feinberg's work instead became an experiment demonstrating just how entrenched and insulated Wall Street's pay culture has become. The thousands of pages of electronic templates and supporting documents submitted to Feinberg by the TARP Seven may have provided the aura of a bureaucratic regulatory exercise, but what began that summer night turned out to be anything but a by-the-numbers process. It became a kind of proxy war between Wall Street and Main Street.
 BUSINESSMAN OR AVENGER?
 Following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Feinberg took a job that put him in a similar squeeze: Attorney General John Ashcroft named him to run a government fund intended to compensate those injured in the attacks and the families of those killed. (He did that job pro bono; Feinberg earns his living as the senior partner of his law firm, Feinberg Rozen.) In an exercise similar to his TARP work, Feinberg had to decide how much a person was worth. In the case of the 9/11 families, he based the figure on the projected future earnings of the person who had been killed. He ended up persuading 98 percent of the 3,000 victims' families -- even those of janitors offered a tenth of what families of killed stockbrokers got -- to stay out of court and instead apply to his fund. And, while dispensing $7 billion in awards, he also got the support of an instinctively anti-plaintiff Republican administration. 
 Feinberg sees the parallels in his new assignment, but he keeps it in perspective. ''9/11 was horrific,'' he told me this fall. ''This is just about money for executives.'' We were sitting in his law firm's Washington office across Pennsylvania Avenue from the Treasury Department. It is festooned with mementos from his service as chief of staff to Senator Edward Kennedy, with whom he maintained a strong, lifelong friendship. After he left Kennedy's office, he began a law practice that blossomed into a specialty mediating cases where the stakes and emotions were high. On a coffee table is a framed, handwritten note that suggests that he is either miraculously successful at playing both sides, or that he has a special skill for getting people to let him find middle ground: ''Ken: You served our nation with such class,'' scribbled President George W. Bush. 
 Kenneth Feinberg's mediating is a lifelong skill, according to his younger brother, David, who works in the Feinberg law firm. ''Ken had this role that he always assumed when we were growing up of organizing a game of pickup stickball or basketball, and then being the one who chose the sides,'' David Feinberg says. ''Even when he was 9 or 10, he had this ability to make decisions that everyone accepted. . . . Everyone always thought he divided the teams into fair sides. He saw that as his assignment.'' 
 Feinberg says that when he met with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner to discuss his new assignment, the secretary did not talk about avenging popular anger over executive pay abuses but instead stressed ''the need to keep the seven companies in business so that the taxpayers could eventually get their money back.'' But, Feinberg says, Geithner also ''expressed the hope that . . . I could build in some new substantive criteria for compensation, such as prospective performance'' as well as ''low cash-based salaries . . . so that my work would have an impact well beyond the seven companies.'' How could he do both? Political common sense might dictate that the last executives who should get excessive pay were executives at companies the government now partly owned, but business common sense seemed to dictate that because the government owned them, these were the last companies the government should want to undercut with unilateral pay disarmament. And of course, the overwhelming political impulse across the country, as expressed by the legislators who wrote the law Feinberg was now supposed to enforce, was that Feinberg should ignore the companies' doomsday scenarios of the talent fleeing because this was the ''talent'' that got the country into this mess in the first place. 
 Feinberg tackled the dilemma by deploying a doomsday scenario of his own to win over the TARP Seven: ''I told them it wasn't Citi or Bank of America or the others against me, it was Citi and me or B. of A. and me, against them'' -- ''them'' being the public. 
 ''What I tried to make them understand,'' he explained, ''was that if I didn't do something, the public would revolt, and Barney [Frank] would surely do something much more drastic that would endanger them and the whole system.'' He underscored his point by recalling that soon after lavish bonus payments to A.I.G. executives were revealed in March 2009, the House passed legislation putting a 90 percent tax on any TARP-company bonuses. 
 Feinberg sat down with the TARP companies, one by one, well before the Aug. 14 deadline for submitting their compensation requests and laid out a series of guidelines that were his blueprint for injecting accountability, fairness and long-term thinking into executive compensation. The first principle was that there would be no guaranteed bonuses, and performance bonuses would have to be tied to metrics that combined both individual performance and the long-term performance of the company. He also ruled out perks worth more than $25,000 and deferred compensation plans (pseudo-retirement plans for executives that defer taxes and mask current payouts). 
 For base cash salaries, Feinberg suggested a sum that, on Wall Street, is considered piddling -- typically no more than $500,000 a year. He also said there would be no cash bonuses. But he tempered that with a compromise: The firms could provide additional annual salary compensation if paid in company stock -- stock that the executive would receive every payday but could not sell immediately. 
 This last provision came to be called ''salarized stock.'' It sounds like jargon only an M.B.A. could love, but it became a key element of the negotiations and a clever way for Feinberg and the bailed-out companies to work around a law passed in the early weeks of the Obama administration. Back in February, Senator Christopher Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who is the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, inserted what is now called the Dodd amendment into the President's economic stimulus bill. A provision in that amendment limited any bonus compensation to 50 percent of the executive's salary. This clause seems logical but has the potential to backfire. Rather than limit compensation or encourage pay-for-performance, it could encourage Wall Street executives to pay themselves higher, risk-free salaries so that their bonuses could then be higher.
 Because Feinberg's salarized stock would be dispensed every payday, it could therefore be considered salary under the Dodd amendment. But because executives would be prohibited from selling the stock right away, Feinberg was putting a long-term performance measure -- the fluctuating value of the stock -- into the equation. Thus, someone who in 2008 might have earned a total of $3 million in cash and a cash bonus might now be offered $500,000 in cash salary and $2 million in salarized stock. The value of the stock would be calculated at its price when paid, but it could not be sold for two to four years. (The first third could be sold on the second anniversary of when it was earned, and each of the next two thirds a year and two years after that.) That would be a big cut in current, spendable cash, but much less of one when the stock's value was considered; and it might turn out not to be a cut at all if the stock's value increased (something that seems possible at some of the TARP Seven companies, especially Citigroup).
 Feinberg laid out his proposals, but he also told the TARP Seven that he'd be open to their suggestions for fulfilling his mandate. This was a key part of his choreography. The 30 pages of regulations he was operating under used the empty word ''appropriate'' 32 times. This was an invitation to the TARP Seven to do their part of the dance, or as A.I.G.'s vice chairman, Anastasia Kelly, puts it, to follow ''our board's instructions to request what was needed.'' What was needed would be articulated by people who see the issue in the following way, as expressed by one earnest Wall Street lawyer who worked on one of the proposals: ''We really believe these industries provide real value to America -- in jobs created, in raising capital, in making the system work,'' he says. ''If people in these industries -- which are a main American export -- see that Congress can jerk them around whenever they want, they're going to stop going into these businesses, just the way people have stopped becoming doctors.'' 
 The stage was set. These Aug. 14 proposals could shoot high, and Feinberg could cut them down, a lot, and look tough, while still giving these executives the millions that they said they could not live without. 
 WHERE EVERYONE IS ABOVE AVERAGE
 And they did shoot high. To take a near-comic example, the firms did not present a single executive as meriting a pay grade below the 50th percentile of their supposed peer group, according to two people in Feinberg's office. In fact, all 136 of the executives (the 25 top earners for each of the seven companies, less 39 who left during the year) were depicted as well above average, typically in the 75th percentile or higher. And the peer groups they were supposed to be in were often inflated; for example, someone running a unit might be portrayed as a chief executive because, the argument went, he ran a really big unit. 
 Beyond that, the proposals ran roughshod over the basic guidelines Feinberg had set. Bank of America's pitch included salaries that far exceeded Feinberg's stricture that cash be limited in most cases to about $500,000, and added huge amounts of salarized stock on top of that, so that the bank's total compensation proposals were typically more than $10 million and ran to as much as $21 million. (J. Steele Alphin, Bank of America's chief administrative officer, declined to comment on the bank's submissions to Feinberg.) 
 Citigroup also proposed salaries in cash and stock far higher than instructed, and it ignored the guideline that salarized stock would have to be held for two to four years. It proposed that a third of it could be sold immediately. (Citigroup's spokeswoman, Shannon Bell, said the bank did not want to comment on anything having to do with the Feinberg process.) Most of the other companies proposed shorter holding periods, too. (''A lot of our folks have second and third homes and alimony payments and other obligations that require substantial current cash,'' said one banker, who insisted on anonymity because he did not want to attract any attention to his firm.) The two car companies also stretched or ignored some guidelines, but what was most jarring was the evidence that these manufacturers and Wall Street now exist in different universes: the stock awards proposed by G.M. and Chrysler were as low as $11,000 in G.M.'s case and $56,000 for Chrysler. 
 The TARP Seven deployed squadrons of blue-chip lawyers and compensation consultants to file their proposals. A.I.G. alone spent $3 million on two compensation consultants and two Wall Street law firms, according to A.I.G.'s vice chairman Kelly. (Of course, most of that money ultimately came from taxpayers, who now own 80 percent of A.I.G.) Not only did the high-priced talent hired by the seven companies typically ignore one or more of Feinberg's basic guidelines, but many also failed to answer questions and complete various templates. A.I.G. tried to make up for its failings by tossing in an additional 167-page PowerPoint presentation, which was drafted by one consulting firm as part of its $500,000 fee, according to Kelly, to ''provide a full picture.'' 
 So why didn't Feinberg -- dubbed the all-powerful Wall Street pay czar in the press -- send A.I.G.'s submission back as ''noncompliant,'' the way any bureaucrat would have? Better yet, why not project a new-sheriff-in-town image the way special prosecutors and others Washington czars typically do by leaking his smackdown to the press? ''Sure, it bothered me,'' says Feinberg, whose small, temporary staff works in one basement office. ''But rather than get angry, we demanded, quietly, and received seven or eight supplemental submissions from them. The goal is to get it done.'' 
 Once he got all his data, Feinberg could have simply pored over it and rendered his rulings, czarlike. Once again, he chose to be a mediator rather than an avenger. Armed with binders for each of the 136 employees whose pay was at issue, he and two or three aides began a series of discussions with representatives of the TARP Seven to hammer out deals. 
 ''He'd tell us where he was coming out on an issue or on a person, and we'd push back a bit, and he'd push back,'' recalls one lawyer for one company (who, like the other lawyers representing the TARP Seven who were interviewed, requested anonymity because he did not have his client's permission to discuss the work). According to eight people who participated in these discussions, there was a rhythm to Feinberg's method. His initial response to any question or comment, no matter how caustic, was typically that it was ''perceptive'' or ''thoughtful.'' (It's a trick Feinberg uses on reporters and congressmen at hearings too.) And he would invariably sympathize with their complaints about his rules. But after a while a tougher side would emerge. He'd warn that they ''just didn't get it'' -- that to the rest of the world they were ''living on another planet.''
 THE BONUS ETHOS
 To that ''rest of the world,'' the farthest-off planet was called A.I.G. Popular disgust with executives who took millions while their companies were being bailed out boiled over last March, when it was revealed that A.I.G. had just paid $168 million in bonuses, including 73 payouts of $1 million or more, to employees in its Financial Products subsidiary. That's the division whose wild trafficking in risky derivative products sank A.I.G. and, according to the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, could have crashed the global economy had the company not received some $180 billion in bailouts. 
 ''I have never seen the public angrier about anything than when the stuff about the A.I.G. bonuses came out,'' Barney Frank, who has been an elected official for 36 years, says. ''I think the country snapped. . . . This was not like Vietnam or Iraq, where there was a split. Everyone was united on this.''
 While it's understandable that the A.I.G. bonuses fueled that firestorm, there's an argument that they were not as outrageous as they seemed, and that they were not even bonuses. I'm going to let a friend -- a longtime A.I.G. employee who received one of the multimillion dollar payouts -- make the case. It's worth considering if only to understand the distance between Wall Street and Main Street.
 My friend (who did not want his name used because, he says, ''being associated with A.I.G. is not safe for my family'') is a mild-mannered math whiz who worked at a unit of A.I.G. Financial Products that, he says, had nothing to do with the small London-based credit-default-swaps group that sank the company. Over the last half-decade, he made millions every year from a bonus pool composed of the profits supposedly made by Financial Products. But he had to leave roughly half of his bonuses in the pool for five years so that the payouts could be adjusted for any subsequent gains or losses from Financial Products' trades. (That's an extreme version of what's called a ''claw back,'' another reform that Feinberg's guidelines would require.) When the credit-default-swaps unit went bust, he personally lost tens of millions in that pool. (Which would also mean that he took home tens of millions over those five years.)
 He says his salary barely changed once he reached a senior level at A.I.G. Financial Products, but that it didn't matter after a while, because ''by the end it was a tiny portion of my earnings'' -- meaning his bonus, which grew to millions a year, represented most of his pay.
 In early 2008, he and his colleagues were offered ''retention contracts,'' he says, because it was becoming clear that ''one business within our firm had issues that could kill the entire bonus pool. . . . They needed us to stay, because we were still making them lots of money, and we had the kind of business we could take to any competitor or, if they wanted, that we could wind down profitably.'' Thus, the retention agreement, which was actually a contract, not literally a bonus payment, guaranteed that in 2008 and 2009 he would make 75 percent of what he had made in 2007 regardless of the amount of the bonus pool for those years, and that he would be paid those bonuses in March 2009 and 2010 (for work done in 2008 and 2009). 
 ''Why should I simply walk away from a contract?'' he now argues. ''I earned that money, and I had nothing to do with all of the bad things that happened at A.I.G.''
 By getting a guarantee of 75 percent of his take from a 2007 bonus pool that was drastically inflated because it included what we now know to be nonexistent profits attributed to the London-based credit-default swaps, he'd no doubt be getting more than he actually ''earned.'' But he did keep his part of the bargain, and every lawyer who has looked at these contracts agrees that they are enforceable. Still, last March he and most of his colleagues orally pledged to return the bonuses after Attorney General Andrew Cuomo of New York threatened to name them and after, in the case of some whose names had already been revealed, they were scared by camera crews camping on their front lawns and even a bus full of angry citizens riding by their homes. All but two have since reneged on those pledges, saying they were made under duress.
 ''The people who make these companies go work really hard,'' adds one of my friend's former colleagues. ''They think: I'm making lots of money to support my family, but I'm not with my family. I can't go to the soccer games or the dance recitals. Stop paying them well, and they'll leave.''
 Senator Dodd has a sharp retort when I asked him about that warning: ''Oh, that's very patriotic. What do I tell a guy who worked in an auto dealership in Bridgeport -- who can now go to all of his kid's soccer games, because he's lost his job and his health insurance and his 401(k)?''
 That Dodd led the attacks on A.I.G. when what came to be called the retention bonuses were revealed infuriates my A.I.G. friend. He says that his boss asked everyone at A.I.G. Financial Products ''to contribute the maximum to Dodd, because he was so important in Washington in terms of regulating the products we sell.'' My friend went on to say: ''Before he attacked us, Dodd was in our office'' -- in Wilton, Conn. -- ''giving a speech telling us how great we were. And our checks were in envelopes stacked up right there.'' 
 Federal Election Commission filings show 31 maximum $2,100 contributions to Dodd during the last quarter of 2006 from employees of A.I.G. Financial Products. My friend's former boss, A.I.G. Financial Products' head, Joseph Cassano, who is listed as giving $2,100, did not return calls to his home, nor did his lawyer return calls seeking comment. 
 Asked about the event, and about checks stacked on a table, Dodd said: ''Yes, it happened. I remember having a fund-raiser there. . . . I can't finance my own campaigns. I have to raise money,'' he added. ''But what does this guy think? That if they give me money I have to do what they want me to do? That tells you something about them.''
 A.I.G.'S STOCK: REAL OR PHANTOM?
 Feinberg consulted regularly with Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin and others at Treasury, Wolin says, though he met with Geithner only three times. ''We pushed back with him on some issues,'' Wolin recalls, referring to Treasury's desire to make sure that the companies would be able keep talented employees -- and eventually repay the government. Wolin says that he, not Feinberg, communicated with the White House, providing Rahm Emanuel, the chief of staff, and the economic adviser Larry Summers with what Wolin calls an occasional ''heads up on scheduling, nothing about substantive decisions. . . . The secretary basically gave this job to Ken.'' 
 At the negotiating table, Feinberg certainly didn't stress that independence, let alone make it clear that whatever pressure he was getting from the administration was to go easier on the companies. ''Feinberg has told everyone that he got no pressure from anyone, but that's not what he told us,'' says a TARP Seven lawyer who participated in the negotiations. ''I'd make a case for one of my guys getting x, and he'd say: 'You're being too reasonable. The people who I have to worry about are not reasonable. They're worried about politics and the fallout. . . . They think you should get zero.' And he'd point to the White House, and then he'd point up to Capitol Hill. . . . He tried to make it seem like his job was to be the mediator between zero and getting us what we wanted.'' 
 On the surface, Feinberg seems to have met them more than halfway. His overall awards were, on average, about 60 percent of what the TARP Seven requested in total compensation. Yet, according to Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, associate dean at Yale School of Management, the structure of the packages ''was a radical departure from perverse executive compensation as we know it,'' making them worth far less in present value than what the TARP Seven requested. Sonnenfeld cites not only Feinberg's crisp rules that do away with camouflaged payment, like perks and deferred compensation, but also the way so much of the compensation -- the salarized stock, which was typically more than 80 percent of these packages -- is delayed and depends on long-term results. 
 When it came to A.I.G., however, Feinberg's push for long-term accountability was met with what Feinberg calls ''intense pressure'' from officials at the Treasury Department and from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which had provided most of the A.I.G. bailout, to make accommodations for the firms whose perceived extravagance had created his job in the first place. First, there were those cash retention bonuses, which 8 of the 12 A.I.G. executives now under Feinberg's purview received in 2009. Feinberg pushed to have the executives return the money and replace it with salarized stock. They all refused, even those who had pledged to give the bonuses back altogether. Among those who insisted on keeping the cash was David Herzog, A.I.G.'s chief financial officer, whose bonus was $1.5 million. He and the others told Feinberg, through A.I.G.'s vice chairman Anastasia Kelly, that if they didn't get to keep that bonus, plus get additional bonuses for work in 2009, they would leave, which would grievously imperil the company. No one at A.I.G. seemed to be embarrassed to argue that the chief financial officer of Wall Street's Titanic was irreplaceable. (Herzog declined to be interviewed.) 
 Second, and more important, those top executives at A.I.G. who hadn't received the retention bonuses refused to accept the salarized stock as part of their pay packages. They wanted all cash. A.I.G.'s Kelly told Feinberg that their position was that A.I.G.'s stock -- which was trading in the late summer and fall at around $40 -- was, in a word that Feinberg says he remembers vividly, ''worthless.'' Kelly explained A.I.G.'s position this way: ''We wanted compensation for people at A.I.G. that they would see value in.'' 
 Feinberg dug in, insisting that every executive at every other company was going to get the majority of his or her annual salary paid in the company's stock, and that these stocks, too, were hardly safe bets. In fact, that was the point of paying them with the stock -- to get them to share risk with the company's owners. 
 Officials at Treasury weighed in on A.I.G.'s side, according to Feinberg. Herbert M. Allison, the assistant secretary for financial stability, and the official to whom Feinberg reported day to day, confirms pressing Feinberg to consider, he recalls, ''the fact that we were dealing with a highly volatile stock that seemed to the employees to have a less than reliable value.'' 
 The regulations establishing his office say that Feinberg can be removed by Treasury Secretary Geithner at any time for any reason. Of course, his removal for being too lenient was unlikely. And Feinberg takes pride in not being a spoilsport. He often talks about how he, a Ted Kennedy man, was able to pay the 9/11 victims well (and even help survivors who were asserting rights as the gay partners of victims) without getting into a fight with John Ashcroft. Besides, as he constantly reminded himself and his staff, his job was to find that middle ground between compensation reform and, as the regulations put it, paying enough ''to retain and recruit talented employees . . . so that the company will ultimately be able to repay its TARP obligations.''
 Feinberg says Allison's office told him to consult officials at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Those at the Fed were even more insistent that Feinberg make exceptions for A.I.G., according to Feinberg and to a senior official at the New York Fed who refused to be named because of a policy that no official can speak on the record about these matters. 
 The New York Fed is a Wall Street institution whose officials, perhaps more than any others on the public payroll, inhabit the world of Wall Street bankers and lawyers. (For example, the law firm advising Citigroup and General Motors in the Feinberg negotiations -- Davis Polk & Wardwell -- is also counseling the New York Fed on TARP matters related to A.I.G., at rates of $305 to $1,055 per hour, according to the retainer agreement.) In a little-noticed section of a report he issued in October, Neil Barofsky, the Treasury Department's TARP inspector general, wrote that the New York Fed actually worked with A.I.G. after its 2008 bailout to set up another generous bonus arrangement for other A.I.G. executives. (Geithner was president of the New York Fed at the time, but he has said he did not become aware of the details of the A.I.G. bonus plans until March 2009, by which time he was at Treasury.) That Fed-blessed bonus plan nearly mirrored the 75-percent guarantee of 2007 bonuses that ignited the firestorm over compensation in the first place. 
 As the standoff over the A.I.G. stock continued, a New York Fed official told Feinberg that the Fed had done its own analysis of the stock and concluded that with all the bailout debt and other obligations, the common stock was, indeed, worthless, according to Feinberg and one person at Treasury who worked on the matter but was not authorized to speak. (Asked if they had done this analysis, Jack Gutt, a New York Fed spokesman, said that Fed officials would ''not speak on the record about that or anything to do with these issues.'')
 Finally, a compromise was suggested that Feinberg agreed to: The A.I.G. executives would get a form of ''phantom'' salarized stock that would reflect the value of onlyfour A.I.G. operating units that made money and had not been part of the company's downfall -- according to a formula to be worked out by the Fed and A.I.G. Moreover, the phantom stock would not reflect the $180 billion dollars in loans and purchases of preferred stock that the taxpayers had extended and that had to be paid back, nor any losses at other A.I.G. units. This seemed a reasonable way to create, in Kelly's words, a stock that her people would see value in. But it does present the paradox of the top executives of a company, including its chief financial officer, declaring behind closed doors that its real stock is worthless to its employees -- with the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve Bank agreeing -- even as the rest of the world is buying and selling it for $40 or $50. (As of last week the stock was trading at about $29, a decline largely attributed in the business press to the growing realization that A.I.G.'s overall equity value was, indeed, unlikely ever to exceed its debt to the government.) 
 Thus, the A.I.G. executives who hadn't received the cash retention bonuses got cash salaries of $450,000 and between $3 million and $4 million in this phantom salarized stock. As for Herzog, the chief financial officer, and the seven other A.I.G. executives who took the 2009 cash retention bonuses and wouldn't give them back, Feinberg pointedly gave them cash salaries ranging from $100,000 to $450,000 and nothing else. 
 MANAGING EXPECTATIONS
 Seen simply through a business lens, the Fed and Treasury people were arguably right to restrain Feinberg. Why obsess over $20 million or $30 million in extra payouts at businesses that have billions in other expenses and where the government had billions at risk? What if some of those people really did leave? Even if replacing them would just cause a hiccup or two, the risk wasn't worth it. 
 But Feinberg did not see the issues involved in isolation from what Barney Frank calls ''maintaining the public's confidence in our capacity to govern.'' In fact, as Feinberg began planning to release his decisions on Oct. 22, his principal fear, he told me, was that despite the cuts in compensation he had made and despite his reliance on measurements of long-term performance, giving out millions to each of these executives would generate a new wave of public anger. So he approached the drafting of the decisions, which would be released publicly, as more of a political challenge than a regulatory exercise, making sure that each decision first recounted in detail what the company had initially requested and then outlined all the ways he was ruling against them. There was no hint of the multiple discussions that took place after the proposals were filed -- after which most companies amended their demands and ultimately, if grudgingly, came to terms with the decisions Feinberg was going to render. ''Only mentioning our original proposals and then knocking them down was really clever,'' one bank negotiator says. 
 Accompanying the rulings was a Treasury Department press release that led to headlines heralding the czar's crackdown. The release highlighted how much Feinberg had cut cash salaries from the year before (more than 90 percent in the case of some of the companies, but that was because the millions in salarized stock did not count as ''cash''), as well as total compensation (more than 50 percent in some cases). Of course, 2008 was the year the firms had all gorged on bonuses and perks as if there had been no crash, so the bar for prudence was hardly high. 
 Whatever the limits of the work Feinberg had done, the dance was so well staged that Feinberg's decisions conveyed a story line destined to play well on Main Street: masters of the universe reduced to opening the czar's envelope to find out how much, or little, was inside. Bank of America -- whose executives had been awarded an average of $6.5 million by Feinberg in total compensation -- complained mildly to the press that there would now be a talent drain, but by early December the bank announced that its profits had bounced back so quickly that it was repaying its TARP loans. It would be out from under Feinberg's thumb by early 2010. A.I.G.'s often-tempestuous C.E.O., Robert Benmosche (who joined the company only in late August), was quoted in The Wall Street Journal on Nov. 11 as having told his board that he was ready to quit because Feinberg was crippling his ability to keep talent. But Benmosche issued a statement later that day that he was not quitting. None of the other TARP Seven complained at all, although Citigroup began a frantic effort to pay back its TARP money, too. 
 On Capitol Hill, Representative Darrell Issa of California reflected the views of fellow Republicans. While complaining that ''the idea that private enterprise should lead to all the reward one can earn is unfortunately not shared by every member of Congress,'' he allowed that ''given Feinberg's mandate, it's hard not to give him a high grade.'' Across the aisle, the most rabid critics of Wall Street among the Democrats praised Feinberg, even as he was awarding millions to the bailed-out executives. And although Feinberg described the A.I.G. phantom-stock provision in his ruling, no one seemed to notice or care how he had accommodated the A.I.G. executives. 
 In December, as this article was being prepared, A.I.G. formally requested Feinberg's permission to have the option ''in appropriate cases'' to go back to taking common stock instead of the phantom stock. At that point, A.I.G. officials knew that they were going to be quoted as having taken the position through the summer and fall that the A.I.G. stock didn't have any value to its employees. Feinberg, of course, agreed to A.I.G.'s request, although it appears from Feinberg's decision that A.I.G. did not commit to the shift back to the common stock. 
 By mid-December, Feinberg had finished his second exercise -- setting pay structures and principles (but not specific amounts) for the 26th through 100th top earners at each of the TARP firms. As with the highest earners, he ruled that at least 50 percent of any compensation must be in stock that cannot be sold immediately, and that cash salaries should generally not be more than $500,000. He has again forbidden payments that create incentives for risk (like paying people for the simple dollar volume of derivatives they sell), while nixing perks over $25,000 and other extras. 
 Now he's on to deciding specific pay packages for 2010 for the top 25 executives at the shrinking list of companies left under his control. A.I.G. is once again his toughest customer. Those who got the reviled cash retention bonuses last year are due -- under those contracts -- to get the same bonuses this March. Feinberg still can't stop the payments, but he has been threatening to pay those executives practically nothing, as he did this year, if they take the bonuses instead of agreeing to roll them into stock. 
 ''If he tries that a second year, these guys are just going to start to come in late and leave work early,'' says one of the people representing A.I.G. in the Feinberg process. ''They'll quietly look for other jobs. And six months or nine months from now they'll be gone. Why should they stay? They're already millionaires. Do you think a hundred- or two-hundred-thousand-dollar salary means anything to them?''
 Which brings us back to Main Street, where a hundred thousand dollars means a lot, and where the public's fury is already building once again because big banks that are not beholden to Feinberg are cashing in as never before. Frank says he thinks the A.I.G. executives are not irreplaceable and are probably bluffing about leaving anyway. ''Let's see how many are really gone in six months,'' he says. Certainly, the bluff is not alien to the Wall Street deal culture. 
 ''My philosophical lodestone,'' Frank concludes, ''is Henny Youngman. When someone asked him, 'How's your wife,' he said, 'Compared to what?' Ask me how Feinberg did, and I say, 'Compared to what?' He inherited a structure, and he did a good job with it.''
 INCITING CORPORATE BOARDS
 Will Feinberg's work become a model for changing that structure? He has said he would like for that to happen, and the Federal Reserve Bank has announced that it will soon require all major banks to abide by structural guidelines intended to assure that executives are compensated based on performance and that they are not given incentives to take undue risk. European regulators have been talking tough, too. And Goldman Sachs has already mimicked the centerpiece of Feinberg's new pay structure by dispensing all bonuses to its top people in stock that must be held for five years. That structure, rather than the actual amounts he awarded, could be Feinberg's lasting contribution -- but only if its influence spreads beyond the corporate boardrooms that have been temporarily in the public spotlight.
 ''The boards of these companies just don't have an arm's-length relationship with these executives,'' says Lucian Bebchuk, a Harvard Law School expert on executive compensation who advised Feinberg. Board members are frequently executives or board members at other big corporations, Bebchuk explains, and therefore are likely to be steeped in the same entitlement culture. Indeed, they are lavishly paid, too; in 2008, A.I.G. board members earned an average of about $300,000 for their work in 2007, the year when apparently unsupervised trading in toxic financial products destroyed the company. 
 ''No director wants to be the skunk at the garden party,'' says Sonnenfeld, the Yale Management School associate dean. ''And the headhunters, whose compensation, by the way, is based on how much executives make, won't pick them for boards if they're going to be dissenters.''
 Prof. Jonathan Macey of Yale Law School, who has written widely about how government efforts to regulate pay have backfired, agrees that the boards are the only route to real change. ''What I object to about the process Feinberg engaged in,'' he says, ''is the pretense that he can develop some superior system. . . . It's not that people in charge don't know how; it's that they don't want to. '' 
 Feinberg made progress ''threading the needle between competing interests,'' as Wolin, the deputy Treasury secretary, puts it. However limited his special-master assignment, his willingness to dive into the details and then doggedly pursue a compromise, plus his political savvy in selling it, improved the pay structure at the seven companies and produced an important structural template for others. In paying more than $6 million on average to the top executives at Citigroup and Bank of America, he certainly wasn't as tough as Main Street would have liked him to be (or thought he was). Yet he was tough enough to get the two banks scurrying to pay back the TARP money in order to get out from under him. 
 But the larger issue isn't whether we should admire Feinberg for finessing his way to a middle ground or jeer him for not throwing down the gauntlet. Rather, the clearest lesson that has emerged so far from his nine months of tortured choreography is that if it's this hard to inject even a limited measure of common sense into the way executives are paid at companies that taxpayers partly own and control, broader change requires a boardroom upheaval. 
 Even if the government should not regulate executive pay directly in a free market, regulators could force the kind of transparency that would not only help shareholders control their boards but would also unleash some of what Frank calls ''the power of embarrassment.'' One idea would be to require that all public companies publish a chart each year showing the total annual income of its highest-paid executive and of a worker earning the median income, as well as the ratio between the two amounts. Perhaps boards might get some gumption once the press starts publishing tables comparing pay-gap ratios at hundreds of well-known companies. 
 As for more tangible reform, Warren Buffett has written that pension funds and other big institutional shareholders are the key, because they have the expertise and power, if they choose to use it, to influence the boards of the companies they own. Perhaps these powerful shareholders should give Feinberg another assignment. This time, the job would not be to find a compromise between satisfying the masses and mollifying executives at a few failed companies, but to coax the hundreds of boards that lack Buffett's common sense or fortitude into different behavior. The big institutional investors could join together and ask Feinberg to adapt his TARP decisions into a set of more widely applicable rules and then demand that the boards in whose companies they have invested explain when they veer from those rules. They might even ask Feinberg to set up a service where he could issue advisory rulings for them. After all, a man who can persuade pickup stickball players, populist congressmen and, in most cases, corporate titans that he does a smart, fair job of playing it down the middle might be able to improve on a system that everyone except those cashing the checks seems to think is a mess.

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
O COME, let us adore them.
 Let it be written that in the first decade of the second millennium a host of gods and goddesses descended on the mortal land of Broadway. Julia, Jude, Hugh, Denzel, Daniel the Elder, Daniel the Younger, Catherine, Katie and he who was called P. Diddy. For these deities, known to all the world from the writ of the tabloids, the people arrived in multitudes, among them heathens who had never set foot in a theater before. And so the Pharisees of Broadway rejoiced, for their coffers were full again and their other expenses were low.
 Star worship reached unprecedented heights on Broadway during the past 10 years, when big names in little shows became the most reliable formula for making money. Theater producers -- who had unhappily discovered that jukebox musicals and works adapted from popular movies did not, after all, guarantee financial success -- learned what every televangelist knows: Religion sells. And in the United States, no religion is more pervasive than the cult of celebrity. 
 Stars like Julia Roberts may no longer ensure that any movie they appear in is a hit, but their in-the-flesh presences (and that of their peers in the recording industry) can still fill a theater to overflow, pack stage-door alleys with camera-toting acolytes of all ages and cause traffic jams in the streets off Times Square. (For the record, the phenomenon is just as strong in London, where Keira Knightley recently opened in ''The Misanthrope.'') 
 The proficiency of their performances is not, ultimately, at issue. What counts far more is that strange, atavistic enactment of a holy communion between the adored and their adorers. Or as one infamous diva puts it, ''I love the audience, and the audience loves me for loving them.''
 Those words to live by are spoken eight times a week on Broadway by Roxie Hart, an aging chorine of the Jazz Age who achieved fame when she murdered her lover, a furniture salesman. Roxie is the main character in ''Chicago,'' a 1975 musical (based on a 1926 play), which was restaged in 1996 and became the longest-running revival in Broadway history. Though it opened four years before the new century began, this production may in retrospect be read as a bible for the Broadway to come, and its producers, Fran and Barry Weissler, as the prophets of the new age.
 ''Chicago,'' you see, portrays a country in which fame has become the most valuable and versatile currency of the realm. (Though it was eclipsed by the confessional sentimentality of ''A Chorus Line'' in its first Broadway incarnation, the cynicism of ''Chicago'' fit the national mood perfectly 20 years later.) And no Broadway producers have been as enterprising as the Weisslers in manipulating that currency. 
 For once the original top-drawer cast of ''Chicago'' had departed, there followed a highly imaginative procession of headliners whose resumes often did not include work in Broadway musicals. (The Weisslers had pioneered the formula with their earlier revival of ''Grease.'') There was Lynda Carter (television's Wonder Woman), the R&B singer Usher, the pop star Huey Lewis, the professionally tan George Hamilton, the movie actress Melanie Griffith (oddly affecting as the minimally talented, narcissistic Roxie) and, most recently, Ashlee Simpson-Wentz, a singer best known for having been outed as lip-syncher on ''Saturday Night Live.'' In a dizzyingly apt example of practicing literally what the show itself preaches satirically, the producers cast the tabloid talk-show host Jerry Springer as a disgusted, fame-exploiting lawyer who sings the lyrics, ''Long as you keep 'em way off balance, how can they spot you got no talents?''
 Known for frugality, the Weisslers offered a bargain-basement approach to selling stars. The Tiffany's version of the same phenomenon -- the model that Broadway producers have been emulating ever since -- was the 1998 London-born production of ''The Blue Room,'' David Hare's adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's erotic roundelay of play. It had minimal sets, a shortish and slightly salacious script and a cast of exactly two performers. 
 That one of them was Nicole Kidman, a rising film actress at that point most famous for being married to Tom Cruise, made all the difference. Once Ms. Kidman in ''The Blue Room'' appeared on the cover of Newsweek, tickets to the show's limited run were nigh impossible to come by. Who cared that reviews were tepid, and that no one at the play seemed much impressed by it? Seeing Ms. Kidman in ''The Blue Room'' was something any truly urbane New Yorker was supposed to have done, and if you hadn't, you lied.
 That Ms. Kidman acquired new artistic cachet (and an Oscar) after ''The Blue Room'' may have encouraged her peers in celebrity to take similar steps. There had been previous instances of similar event casting -- including Elizabeth Taylor in ''The Little Foxes'' (1981) and Madonna in ''Speed-the-Plow'' (1988) -- but nothing like the spate of boldface names that have adorned marquees during the past decade, particularly in its second half.
 They include Sean Combs, known as Diddy, in ''A Raisin in the Sun'' (2004); Denzel Washington in ''Julius Caesar'' (2005); Ms. Roberts in ''Three Days of Rain'' (2006); Daniel Radcliffe (of the ''Harry Potter'' movies) in ''Equus'' (2008); and Katie Holmes (another Mrs. Tom Cruise) in ''All My Sons'' (2008). This season has seen Jude Law in ''Hamlet,'' Daniel Craig and Hugh Jackman in ''A Steady Rain,'' Sienna Miller in ''After Miss Julie'' and Catherine Zeta-Jones in ''A Little Night Music.'' Scarlett Johansson appears in ''A View From the Bridge'' this month. (I am excluding eminent performers, like Paul Newman, Jane Fonda and Susan Sarandon, who had passed their peak of Hollywood-generated fame, or Ms. Zeta-Jones's co-star, Angela Lansbury, who became a star of musicals in the 1960s and '70s.) 
 Let me say that none of these performers were embarrassing in their parts, though a few were initially stiffened by self-consciousness. On the other hand, none of them were really right for their parts, either, and I can't think of a single case in which they left me with fresh insights into their plays (all but two, for the record, revivals). And that's because the play was not the thing, even when it was ''Hamlet.''
 For these productions the theater becomes its own hybrid institution: part temple and part freak-show tent, wherein paying customers can see a living, breathing member of the breed that has been cursed and blessed by incredible fame -- and preferably incredible physical beauty as well. Never mind that many theatergoers can (and most likely do) read about these stars' lives, in detail lurid and quotidian, on the Web every day. They are propelled by the same primitive impulse that drove New Yorkers of a century ago to queue up to see Lillie Langtry, a professional beauty (and former mistress of the king of England) who occasionally appeared in plays.
 So I suppose I shouldn't be surprised when I hear people defending these stars' performances on the basis of their looks. ''But he's so adorable,'' my sister said to me, after seeing Mr. Law's bizarrely extroverted rendering of the introspective Hamlet. ''But she's so beautiful,'' more than one well-educated, well-versed theatergoer has said to me about Ms. Zeta-Jones in ''A Little Night Music.'' 
 It's all the more galling that, properly cast, such actors, many of whom are genuinely talented, might shine in unexpected ways. Why give Ms. Roberts, a natural romantic heroine, not one but two quirky character roles in ''Three Days of Rain''? Or cast the charismatic Mr. Jackman and Mr. Craig, who both proved their stage mettle years ago, as the standard-issue Chicago cops in ''A Steady Rain''?
 It's as if complex interpretation might get in the way of these productions' true raison d'etre, which is to serve as an inconspicuous setting for a multicarat jewel. As heartening as it was to see so many teenage girls at the Jude Law ''Hamlet,'' or to have Ms. Roberts introduce a whole new audience to Mr. Greenberg's elegant 1997 drama ''Three Days of Rain,'' I don't know how many people actually saw the plays behind the starlight. 
 And you can't help lamenting the more complete shows that might have been, with different performers in their parts. (There are, of course, instances where a big star meets a big role and sparks fly. Witness Cate Blanchett's scalding turn as Blanche DuBois in the Sydney Theater Company's ''Streetcar Named Desire,'' recently at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.)
 It seems curmudgeonly -- and too easy -- to dismiss celebrity-driven productions on Broadway. They inspire people to keep buying increasingly expensive tickets, even in a recession, and they allow an institution too often perceived as culturally marginal these days to bask in an international spotlight from time to time. I suppose what most rankles is how most of us are transformed into awe-struck gogglers in the presence of a majesty so fleeting, so illusory, so factory-made. 
 People say stars imported from other constellations are easy targets when they appear on Broadway, but I have found that reviewers, myself included, go out of their way to be respectful. It's difficult, after all, to escape the reflexes bred by your culture. As hard as we may try to resist it, when visitors arrive from even an ersatz Olympus, our first instinct is to take off our hats.

HEADLINE: The Smartphone Makes and Breaks

BYLINE: By ROBERT CYRAN, ROB COX and MARGARET DOYLE

 BODY:
What will the mobile phone devour next? It swallowed up the personal digital assistant, the gadget that defined the beginning of the last decade, and is eating through the landline telephone, digital camera, MP3 player and even the wristwatch. The creative destruction has just begun. 
 Investors should heed the mobile phone's Schumpeterian powers. When the century began, bankers ''beamed'' each other information via the now-quaint infrared technology of the Palm Pilot, whose maker had a market value of $92 billion. Palm shifted to mobile phones, but lost 97 percent of its value along the way. That should be a warning to other industries standing in the cellphone's path. 
 The most obvious target is the traditional telephone. Almost a quarter of all American households no longer have a fixed-line phone. That's a drag for operators like AT&T and Verizon, which have wireless networks but must continue to run their expensive copper-based infrastructure. For landline providers without wireless operations, like Qwest and Frontier, it's terrifying. 
 Even the iPod faces obsolescence. Unit sales are in decline, though that's not a problem for Apple as long as its customers listen to music on their costlier iPhones instead. 
 And pity the poor watchmaker. Most teenagers now use their cellphones to tell time. Watchmakers like Seiko and Tag Heuer must pitch themselves as fashion designers to succeed. That's not a trick easily turned by the manufacturers of GPS devices, cameras and radar detectors, which must compete with smartphone applications that do their jobs. Google's introduction of a free navigation application not long ago wiped 16 percent off the valuation of Garmin and 23 percent off TomTom. 
 There will certainly be winners from the cellphone's creative destruction as new companies spring up to innovate. And as Morgan Stanley notes, each wave of technological innovation creates more market cap than the one it follows. 
 Where the mobile herd will stampede next is hard to predict. But a rummage through pockets and handbags turns up credit cards, cash, keys, ID cards, books, newspapers and tickets -- all potentially replaceable with something electronic. That will mean opportunity for some enterprising inventors and destruction for others. 
 Financial Centers
 Three years ago, New York authorities worried that London might steal their city's crown as the world's financial capital. That distinction now looks much less desirable. 
 Back then, cities and countries vied for the jobs and glamour of the fast-growing financial industry, using tools that included regulation, taxes, language, education and infrastructure. While the longtime rivals New York and London fought for the top spot, new money centers and old, like Frankfurt, Dubai, Singapore and Zug, Switzerland, vied for leadership in the second tier.
 But even before the financial crisis, some doubted the value of the prize. Finance produced lots of high-paying jobs, but much of the money seemed to come at the expense of the rest of the nation. And while banks accounted for a quarter of Britain's corporation tax and also underpinned value-added tax and stamp duty receipts, sophisticated investment banks and hedge funds managed to minimize payments. 
 After the financial system led the world into recession, the City of London and its peers now elicit something more like a love-hate -- or hate-love -- relationship. Finance still has glamour, the pay is still high and the industry can be a good source of export income, but it's more dangerous than thought. 
 Britain put too many eggs in what proved to be an unstable basket. The direct financial bailout costs aren't yet known, but the crisis has already tipped Britain into its longest postwar recession. Even the sunniest Treasury forecasts say it will take until 2012 for the economy to regain its 2008 levels of output. 
 Politicians have a great deal of influence over how and where finance will concentrate. Right now, voters are telling them not to care. When bankers warned that the new British supertax on bonus pools would drive them away from London, the prospect was greeted with enthusiasm in many quarters. 
 Finance could yet regain some of its luster. The industry does gather and allocate capital, maintain liquid markets and spread risks -- useful work that needs skilled people. But financial professionals have to show they can generate jobs and taxes, and much less risk.

HEADLINE: In Health Bill For Everyone, Provisions For a Few

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Early versions of the Senate's far-reaching health care bill said that small businesses with fewer than 50 workers would not be penalized if they failed to provide insurance. That was before labor unions in the construction industry went to work and persuaded Senate leaders to insert five paragraphs.
 Their provision, added to the 2,074-page bill at the last minute, singles out the construction industry for special treatment, in a way that benefits union members and contractors who use union labor. 
 In this one industry, the exemption from the penalty would be much more limited, available only to employers with fewer than five employees. Construction companies with five or more workers would generally have to provide health insurance or pay a penalty -- an excise tax of $750 per employee.
 Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, asked: ''Why this assault on the home builders? I don't get it.''
 Labor unions that have negotiated health benefits for construction workers lobbied for the provision. Without it, they said, small nonunion employers would have an unfair competitive advantage over companies that they say do ''the right thing'' by providing health benefits to plumbers, electricians, carpenters, roofers and other workers in the building trades.
 The provision was one of many added to the bill as senators rushed to finish the legislation by Christmas Eve. It illustrates the difficulty of establishing uniform national requirements in a country where employers have, over decades, devised myriad different arrangements for providing health insurance to employees.
 The construction industry provision is receiving a second look as work begins in earnest this week to resolve differences in bills passed by the Senate and the House to remake the nation's health care system. Other provisions sure to be scrutinized include a tax break for the Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan in Nebraska; Medicare coverage for residents of Libby, Mont., sickened by a mineral mine; extra Medicaid money for Massachusetts, Nebraska and Vermont; and a special dispensation for a handful of doctor-owned hospitals.
 White House officials have generally acquiesced in the provisions, which they see as a normal part of the legislative process, required to secure votes for a bill overwhelmingly opposed by Republicans.
 Republicans complained of ''sweetheart deals,'' payoffs and kickbacks. But the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, brushed aside the criticism.
 ''There's a hundred senators here, and I don't know if there is a senator that doesn't have something in this bill that was important to them,'' Mr. Reid said. ''If they don't have something in it important to them, then it doesn't speak well of them. That's what this legislation is all about. It's the art of compromise.''
 Health insurance for all Americans is the overarching goal of the Senate and House bills. 
 Employers would be subject to financial penalties if they do not provide workers with health insurance that meets federal standards. Under the Senate bill, businesses with fewer than 50 employees would be exempt from the penalties in every industry but construction.
 Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, proposed the special rule for the construction industry. Mr. Reid accepted it when he was assembling the final bill.
 Daniel V. Gardner, a lobbyist at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, said: ''The Merkley amendment is necessary because construction is an extremely competitive, low-bid industry. Very few small nonunion construction employers provide health insurance. It's one way they gain an advantage over union contractors.''
 At union contractors, Mr. Gardner said, health benefits account for 12.5 percent to 20 percent of payroll. The Senate and House bills would significantly increase these costs, he said, by banning most annual and lifetime limits on coverage and by requiring insurers to allow children to stay on their parents' policies through age 25 or 26.
 ''Together,'' Mr. Gardner said, ''these requirements will drive up costs an additional $1,000 per member every year.'' While small union contractors would be required to pay the costs, he said, nonunion contractors of similar size could avoid the expense.
 Labor unions tried unsuccessfully to get a similar provision inserted into the House bill.
 Senator Merkley said, ''Construction contractors are overwhelmingly small businesses,'' with 90 percent of them employing fewer than 20 workers. If companies with fewer than 50 workers received an exemption, he said, that ''would effectively exempt the entire construction industry.''
 Lake A. Coulson, executive director for government affairs at the National Electrical Contractors Association, which represents many union contractors that already provide health benefits, shares that concern and lobbied for the Merkley amendment.
 But in a letter to Congress, other business trade associations, including the National Association of Home Builders and the United States Chamber of Commerce, expressed dismay. The construction industry provision looks like ''a political payoff to satisfy the desires of a small constituency,'' the letter said.
 Joe Robson, chairman of the home builders group, said the requirement would ''kill jobs at thousands of small builder firms'' struggling to stay afloat in the worst housing downturn since the Depression.
 The Bureau of Labor Statistics said the unemployment rate in the construction industry was 19.4 percent in November, nearly twice the national rate.
 Under the Senate bill, if an employer with at least five employees does not offer coverage and has at least one full-time employee who receives federal subsidies to buy insurance, the company would have to pay the penalty of $750 a year for each of its full-time employees, regardless of how many got subsidies.
 The biggest source of revenue in the Senate bill is a tax that would be imposed on high-cost insurance policies, the so-called Cadillac plans. Construction worker unions oppose the tax because they believe their health plans could be affected by it.
 Under a separate provision of the Senate and House bills, the government would provide tax credits to help small businesses buy health insurance for two years. But the National Federation of Independent Business, a trade group, said that many small businesses would still find insurance difficult to afford.

HEADLINE: Legislators Moving to Fill In Cracks That Teenage Runaways Can Slip Through

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
State and federal lawmakers from around the country are pressing a variety of new laws that would make sweeping changes in the way runaways and prostituted children are handled by police officers and social workers.
 In Congress, Democratic leaders in the House and Senate are moving several bills that would improve how runaways are tracked by the police, increase spending to provide them with social services and promote methods for earlier intervention. The Government Accountability Office, an auditing arm of Congress, initiated an investigation in December at the request of the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, and Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, into whether police departments are handling runaways properly. 
 Lawmakers in at least 10 states have proposed or passed bills in recent months that focus on runaways by extending outreach efforts and shelter options and changing state reporting requirements so that youth shelters have enough time to win trust and provide services before they need to report the runaways to the police. 
 Police departments are already required by federal law to enter missing-person reports into a database called the National Crime Information Center, or N.C.I.C., within two hours of receiving them. When the local police fail to do this, law enforcement officials in other jurisdictions do not know to look for the missing person. 
 But data provided by the national center to The New York Times indicates that the police often do not comply with this requirement. Lawmakers say a series of articles published in The Times in October about the increase in runaway children and teenagers involved in prostitution because of the recession, showing how many cases are not being properly tracked by police departments, has prompted much of the legislation.
 From November 2006 through November 2009, the police in New York City failed in about 40 percent of cases to enter missing-person reports into the database for runaways within 24 hours of receiving the report, according to a review of cases reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The national average during that period was around 16 percent.
 One such case involved Francisco Hernandez Jr., a 13-year-old with a form of autism known as Asperger's syndrome, who ran away from home and, undetected, spent 11 days riding subways in New York City.
 Though Francisco's parents said they did not feel the police had taken their son's case seriously, department officials said they had investigated it properly.
 But the N.C.I.C.'s data indicated that the department did not enter Francisco's missing-person report into the federal database for at least 24 hours after his parents made it.
 Paul J. Browne, a spokesman for the New York Police Department, said Francisco's report was not entered into the national database when it was received because the person with that duty was not available. Mr. Browne said another police official entered the information on Saturday, Oct. 17, two days after Francisco went missing, and he noted that the department had broadcast news of the missing child on its citywide radio system a day earlier.
 Mr. Browne said he was not sure why his department had such high noncompliance numbers with the national database, but said the police took extensive steps to alert the full department and local hospitals when missing-person reports were filed.
 Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, said the reporting failures were ''outrageous.''
 ''It's absolutely inappropriate that many runaway children are missing not only from their homes, but also from the very database meant to help law enforcement officers find them,'' Ms. Maloney said. She and Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey, introduced legislation on Nov. 19 to certify that law enforcement agencies comply with federal law by entering all missing children into the federal database. 
 The bill, co-sponsored by Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, also requires the police to provide anyone who reports a missing person with information about the services provided by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the National Runaway Switchboard. In many cases, the police said, they often did not take reports about runaways as seriously as abductions, and families were often unaware of other resources.
 Mr. Schumer said he planned to introduce a similar bill soon in the Senate, which instructs the Justice Department to perform audits of local law enforcement agencies to ensure compliance with reporting requirements.
 At the same time, Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, and Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, introduced legislation in December that is modeled after the methods used by the Dallas Police Department in tracking down repeat runaways, which has been successful in reducing teenage prostitution. The bill adjusts the national database so that it automatically flags repeat runaways, much as the Dallas police have been doing.
 The bill would also create block grants worth $2.5 million annually, renewable for two more years, that would be allocated to six pilot programs to provide shelter and services like drug treatment, counseling and job training for teenagers seeking to escape prostitution.
 Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, introduced a bill in November that would enable school officials to pay for transportation of runaways and homeless youths who want to stay in school. The bill would increase, to $300 million from $70 million, federal money for other services for homeless and runaway youths. 
 State lawmakers in Connecticut, Hawaii, New York, Pennsylvania and North Dakota are considering bills to improve tracking and services for runaways and minors who are victims of sex trafficking. Washington and Iowa are considering bills to lengthen the time before welfare workers are required to report a child missing. Illinois and Rhode Island have passed laws, and Massachusetts has proposed one raising penalties for involvement in the sex trafficking of minors. 
 Hoping to build on this momentum, the National Conference of State Legislatures began drafting policy guidelines for model legislation on runaways in November to distribute to state lawmakers around the country.
 The guidelines, which await final approval by the conference in July, would require teachers, social workers and others who work with children to report to the state child welfare agency any youth believed to be involved in prostitution, according to State Senator Renee Unterman of Georgia, a Republican who drafted the guidelines and is the chairwoman of the conference's committee on human welfare. 
 The American Bar Association has also begun changing its policy guidelines so that it can lobby Congress for increased financing for tracking runaways and providing them with social services. Association leaders say they hope to urge Congress to pass a law preventing minors from being charged with a crime -- prostitution -- that they are too young to consent to. 
 ''The number of these kids keeps increasing, services for them keep decreasing and tracking of them is totally insufficient,'' said Casey Trupin, a professor at the University of Washington law school who helped write the new guidelines. ''We figured it was time to get involved because arresting and charging these youth is not helping them escape the streets.''

HEADLINE: Muslim Deli Owners Must Choose Koran or Customers

BYLINE: By DANIEL E. SLOTNIK

 BODY:
Most of Khairul Kabir's customers at the Madison Deli and Grocery in East Harlem do not realize that his jovial smile masks a lingering sense of shame. 
 Mr. Kabir, 49, an immigrant from Bangladesh and a Muslim, is chagrined because he sells pork and alcohol, which are prohibited by the Koran. He also sells lottery tickets, a form of gambling that is also banned. Devout Muslims are not supposed to indulge in, sell, or even handle any of these ''haram,'' or forbidden, goods. Mr. Kabir's dilemma is widespread among Muslim immigrants in New York and other American cities, where religious beliefs, the pursuit of prosperity and pressures to assimilate are often in conflict. 
 But the spiritual struggle is especially acute in diverse neighborhoods like East Harlem, where Muslim businesses must compete for customers who expect that a deli will, for example, make them a ham sandwich or sell them a Lotto ticket or a six pack of beer. 
 Opinions regarding the sale of haram items are as diverse as the people who form the Muslim community in America, but Mr. Kabir is unequivocal about his distaste for the practice.
 ''Selling haram is the same as eating haram,'' he said, glancing at the beer-filled coolers that line the grocery's back wall. ''I feel guilty, totally guilty. I want to sell the business and go home and not sell haram. Every day I'm thinking I should do that.''
 Mr. Kabir said he had to sell goods he disapproved of to survive the recession. ''I am doing a lot of bad things,'' Mr. Kabir said. ''I pray to Allah to forgive me.''
 Mohammed al Naqib, who was working at Sammy's Grocery at 165 DeKalb Avenue in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, said the store, which is owned by his cousin, stopped selling beer four or five years ago, because of lack of demand and ''because of religion, mostly.''
 ''The area has changed,'' Mr. al Naqib said. ''My cousin, he was selling. But I return the license from the government. It doesn't sell good.''
 Back in East Harlem, Ahmed Ibrahim, a 25-year-old from Egypt who works in the tiny 3-S Deli at Second Avenue and East 105th Street, was concerned because the store could not sell beer -- not because of religious law but because the previous owner had lost his liquor license. 
 From a business perspective, Mr. Ibrahim said, stores had to sell beer and other haram to be successful. 
 ''For me, I come over here to make money and stuff,'' he said. ''If I come over here and try to run a halal business, only Muslims will go there. You have to sell to Americans.''
 ''Beer and cigarettes and deli sandwiches are the most important things in the deli-grocery business,'' Mr. Ibrahim said.
 As Mr. Ibrahim spoke a radio played what he said was an Islamic prayer. When a group of customers entered the store, Mr. Ibrahim changed the station. 
 ''If I see a problem with a customer, I change it,'' Mr. Ibrahim said, gesturing to the radio. ''To do business, I have to make the customer smile.''
 A worker at a grocery on Carlton Avenue in Fort Greene said the store hired the equivalent of a ''Shabbos goy,'' a gentile engaged by Orthodox Jews to manipulate electrical devices on the Sabbath.
 ''We have somebody who handles the beer who is not Muslim,'' the worker said. 
 Some imams say they understand the pressures faced by Muslims trying to make a living in such a competitive city. 
 Mr. Kabir's imam, Mohammad Fayek Uddin, leader of the Jackson Heights Islamic Center and Mosque on Roosevelt Avenue, Queens, spoke to a reporter shortly after conducting an evening prayer service. 
 Mr. Uddin, 42, said that while he might chide someone he knew personally for selling haram, he was not required to get involved. 
 ''In this country everyone has to do something. I deliver my speech in front of the people, it depends on their choice,'' Mr. Uddin said as worshipers who remained after the prayer nodded in agreement. ''No punishment, not here,'' said Mr. Uddin, who also came from Bangladesh. ''Allah will give punishment on the day of judgment; I do not have an authority to do that.''
 Mr. Uddin added that he had occasionally helped observant Muslims find more acceptable work. He said believers could usually find jobs that did not conflict with their faith because ''Allah will provide for the people.''
 Despite the temptations America presents, Mr. Uddin said he believed that life was better here. 
 ''In this country I saw the infinite independence,'' he said. ''That's better than in our country.''

HEADLINE: Prisons and Budgets

 BODY:
The United States, which has less than 5 percent of the world's population, has about one-quarter of its prisoners. But the relentless rise in the nation's prison population has suddenly slowed as many states discover that it is simply too expensive to overincarcerate. 
 Between 1987 and 2007 the prison population nearly tripled, from 585,000 to almost 1.6 million. Much of that increase occurred in states -- many with falling crime rates -- that had adopted overly harsh punishment policies, such as the ''three strikes and you're out'' rule and drug laws requiring that nonviolent drug offenders be locked away. 
 These policies have been hugely costly. According to the Pew Center on the States, state spending from general funds on corrections increased from $10.6 billion in 1987 to more than $44 billion in 2007, a 127 percent increase in inflation-adjusted dollars. In the same period, adjusted spending on higher education increased only 21 percent.
 In 2008, the explosion of the prison population ground to a near halt, according to data released last month by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. About 739,000 inmates were admitted to federal and state facilities, only about 3,500 more than were released. 
 One factor seems to be tight budgets as states decide to release nonviolent offenders early. This can not only save money. If done correctly, it can also be very sound social policy. Many nonviolent offenders can be dealt with more effectively and more cheaply through treatment and jobs programs.
 Michigan, which has been hard hit by the recession, has done a particularly good job of releasing people who do not need to be in prison. As the American Civil Liberties Union's National Prison Project details in a new report, Michigan reduced its prison population by about 8 percent between March 2007 and November 2009 by taking smart steps, notably doing more to get nonviolent drug offenders out, while helping in their transition to a productive, and crime-free, life.
 Not every state has gotten the message. Florida, for example, has a state law mandating that all prisoners serve a high percentage of their sentence, which is both dubious corrections policy and terrible fiscal policy.
 For many years, driving up prison populations has been an easy thing for elected officials to do, popular with voters and powerful corrections officer unions. The new incarceration figures suggest, however, that in the current hard economic times, strapped states are beginning to realize that they do not have the money to keep people in prison who do not need to be there.

HEADLINE: Fee to Film in New York Municipal Buildings Riles Producers

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
 A new fee levied on movie and television production companies filming inside some municipally owned buildings in New York City is drawing complaints from the entertainment industry, which argues that the charge of $3,200 accompanying each permit is excessive and could drive productions elsewhere.
 City officials say the fee affects only a small number of locations and is fair compensation for expenses they incur in processing permit requests and providing staff, like electricians. But entertainment industry representatives, citing declining revenues from DVDs and advertising, say the new measure sets a worrisome precedent at a difficult moment. ''Our concern is that this could start a domino effect among other city agencies, which could make filming in New York cost-prohibitive,'' said Vans Stevenson, senior vice president for state affairs at the Motion Picture Association of America, a trade group financed by the major studios. ''What's to stop the parks and sanitation departments or police stations or hospitals from instituting similar fees? We are living in a time when production costs and budgets are very tight, and these kinds of charges can make a difference in terms of the decision process.'' 
 The fee, which went into effect just before Christmas, applies to 54 buildings operated by the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, including courthouses familiar to viewers of television series like ''Law & Order.'' Mark Daly, a department spokesman, said there were 190 requests to film in those buildings in 2009. 
 Had the fee been in effect all year long, it would have generated a little more than $600,000 for the city.
 Besides the popular ''Law & Order'' franchise, which has been shooting in New York since 1990, and at the moment consists of three shows, other series that have filmed in department buildings and will be subject to the new fee include, Mr. Daly said, ''Gossip Girl,'' ''Ugly Betty'' and ''The Good Wife.'' The buildings most requested by production companies, he added, are the columned Supreme Court Building at 60 Centre Street in Manhattan, Brooklyn Borough Hall and the Supreme Court building in Jamaica, Queens. 
 Despite calls for a sliding scale that would allow makers of commercials, videos and television pilot episodes to pay less and would exempt student filmmakers altogether, the fee applies to all productions. That is because ''in terms of staff time spent arranging and reviewing permits, the basic administrative costs are the same, regardless of the size of the production,'' Mr. Daly said. 
 John Johnston, executive director of the New York Production Alliance, a trade group that represents local craft unions, production and service companies and soundstages, said: ''This one fee is not going to destroy the film business in New York. But it's an irritant, and it does hurt the independents'' who have much smaller budgets than Hollywood studios or television networks. ''This is a highly mobile industry,'' he added, ''and history has shown that when it's more advantageous to move to adjacent states, that's what happens.''
 Producers are also complaining about the lead time now needed to process permits. The city initially planned to require applications be filed a week in advance, which was reduced to four days after protests. But that is still slower than many California municipalities and is particularly problematic for commercials, which often involve a very short turnaround time. 
 The new charge in New York City, which producers say is already the most expensive shooting location in the nation, is one that rival cities either do not have at all or that they have chosen to keep at a minimal level. Chicago, for example, where ''The Good Wife'' is set but not filmed, makes police stations, schools, airports and even City Hall available to production companies without any permit or administrative fee unless the building is no longer in use, in which case there is a $250 opening charge. 
 ''Revenue is tough to come by these days, and our office has also heard from other departments within government that this is an opportunity to create revenue,'' said Richard Moskal, director of the Chicago Film Office, a city agency. ''When you're dealing with an industry that is not necessarily impoverished, you can see the tendency to want to take advantage of that. But this is such a competitive business, and thus far we've been able to maintain a balance that allows us to offer services at low or no cost whenever possible.''
 New York officials at the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting appear skeptical of arguments that the new measure will reduce the city's competitiveness. Julianne Cho, an associate commissioner, said that while New York's system ''is different from the way other cities work, the big picture is that we are the only city offering free police assistance,'' in addition to free permit processing and free use of one-of-a-kind exterior locations, which she said could save a large production company up to $19,000 a week compared with Los Angeles shoots. 
 In a written statement Katherine Oliver, the commissioner of the film office, also noted that New York City offered a 5 percent tax credit to production companies, ''the only one of its kind administered by a city in the U.S.'' (That is on top of a 30 percent credit from New York State. Tax credits of up to 42 percent are available in other parts of the country but through state governments.) However, the city has recently proposed scaling back that credit by 1 percent a year for television series, meaning that it would expire after five years, a move that Ms. Oliver said was ''designed to incentivize new television production.'' 
 That take-it-or-leave-it attitude in part reflects the shifting economics of film and television production. Until recently companies that might bridle at the new charge might have transferred productions to Toronto, which has often doubled for New York, or to Vancouver. But over the last eight years the value of the Canadian dollar has risen from 62 cents to the United States dollar to parity or even above, and that has eroded part of Canada's cost advantage and attractiveness.
 In view of the current economic downturn, entertainment industry representatives say they are not opposed to a charge for the use of municipal buildings. But they question how the city arrived at the $3,200 figure and say that and other aspects of the new fee have unnecessarily complicated a heretofore cordial relationship that, in their estimate, generates about $5 billion a year for the local economy. 
 ''Any fee should be reasonable and more accurately mirror the cost of using a particular space,'' Mr. Stevenson said. ''Many local jurisdictions and states waive fees altogether, and we believe that $3,200 is an exorbitant rate that will only serve to discourage motion picture and television location production in New York's public buildings.''

 CORRECTION:
 An article last Monday about a new fee levied on movie and television production companies filming in some municipally owned buildings in New York City misstated the title of a television show that has used such buildings and will be subject to the fee, according to a spokesman for the Department of Citywide Administrative Services. It is ''Gossip Girl,'' not ''Gossip Girls.''

HEADLINE: News Sites Dabble With a Web Tool for Nudging Local Officials

BYLINE: By DANIEL E. SLOTNIK

 BODY:
Doug Hardy, an associate editor and Internet supervisor for The Journal Inquirer in Manchester, Conn., wanted to increase page views on its Web site.
 Mr. Hardy had heard about SeeClickFix.com, a local advocacy Web site that lets users write about issues to encourage communication between residents and local government. SeeClickFix users post a complaint about problems that occur within a set of boundaries on a Google Map, like graffiti at a bus stop or potholes on a busy street, and the site communicates the problem to the appropriate government agency and marks the problem on the map. 
 Users can comment on the issue or label it resolved. Government agencies can post on the site to respond to residents, and journalists can use the site to communicate with readers and see which issues are most pressing to people. 
 Ben Berkowitz, the chief executive of SeeClickFix, said the tool went beyond government: ''Anyone can be held accountable: a business, nonprofit, even a private citizen.''
 The Journal Inquirer, which covers the area around Manchester, invested in its Web site, and then paid circulation plummeted. So the editors put online content behind a pay wall. 
 There seemed to be a trade-off. Once visitors could no longer read articles without paying, circulation stabilized -- but page views dropped by about 30 percent. It fell to Mr. Hardy, the associate editor, to attract more visitors. 
 ''We needed new strategies,'' Mr. Hardy said. ''We needed new ways to draw traffic to our site and to improve our product and make it more compelling.'' 
 He thought SeeClickFix could help. Mr. Hardy drew a SeeClickFix map of the paper's coverage area last spring and posted some sample issues, but the map did not receive responses until an article about the site ran in The Hartford Courant. After the article, Mr. Hardy noticed new issues on his map and added a SeeClickFix widget to the Journal Inquirer site last August, where it drew many comments. 
 The basic service is free, but Mr. Hardy spends $38 a month for SeeClickFix Pro, which features The Journal Inquirer's logo on issues the paper selects and allows access to an advanced management dashboard.
 Mr. Hardy decided to write a column based on issues that arose on the SeeClickFix widget, using either his own posts or compelling ideas from other users. Topics include long-delayed repairs to a bridge, which were completed after the article ran, and roads where dangerous speeding seemed to go unrestrained. Mr. Hardy is working on a project involving articles and video on eyesores in the area, including a dilapidated structure in Windsor, Conn., that is visible from Interstate 91.
 ''You look back at some of the stuff you've done over the years as a journalist, and you go, 'I've written some important stories; no one ever called or wrote,' '' Mr. Hardy said. ''I've just gotten tons and tons of response to some of the stories I've written'' using SeeClickFix. 
 SeeClickFix is not unique in its hyperlocal focus. Other sites, like EveryBlock.com and CrimeReports.com, post data from government organizations and news outlets. FixMyStreet.com features discussion between residents and government officials, but only in Britain. 
 Mr. Berkowitz says that what sets SeeClickFix apart from other hyperlocal sites is that, anywhere in the world, it can foster interaction among government, news media and residents.
 Issues were first reported on SeeClickFix in March 2008, and the site was incorporated as a business in September of that year. The four founders paid for the start-up themselves and used any revenue to develop the site. The company received an undisclosed amount of money from a group of angel investors last September but remains privately owned. Last March, it won a $25,000 Pitch It prize from We Media, a company that supports media entrepreneurship.
 The site is used mostly in Philadelphia, New Haven and parts of New Jersey. But Mr. Berkowitz, who has ambitious plans, recently released an iPhone application similar to two that serve Pittsburgh and Boston. He offers the site in 72 languages and is seeking volunteer translators. 
 ''A few weeks ago we launched home pages for 25,000 cities and about 8,000 neighborhoods,'' Mr. Berkowitz said. ''If your neighborhood isn't on there, you can add it. You can even create your own free-form geography.'' An e-mail alert is sent to all users in the same neighborhood when an issue is posted about it. SeeClickFix has received posts from countries as distant as Australia. 
 Other newspapers, large and small, have also tried the site. The New York Times uses it on the Local blogs, which cover neighborhoods in Brooklyn and New Jersey. 
 Mr. Hardy said SeeClickFix was invaluable because it provided a broader forum beyond just writing about an issue. 
 ''We printed a paragraph from a woman's complaint about a deteriorated mill building in Vernon,'' Mr. Hardy wrote in an e-mail message. ''I got responses from the mayor, town administrator and the architect who is redeveloping the building -- all within 24 hours.'' The Journal Inquirer had written about the mill before but had never received such a response. 
 ''It's just such a natural thing for us to be doing as a local paper,'' Mr. Hardy said. ''The ideas are basically generated by readers.''
 Mr. Hardy said he had rarely seen malicious or incorrect information on SeeClickFix, and Mr. Berkowitz concurred.
 Mr. Hardy said he was convinced that SeeClickFix was an invaluable tool for struggling local journalists. 
 ''The writing is on the wall,'' Mr. Hardy said. ''If we can't remain competitive, you know, we're not going to be around. That's the way it is; that's the way the economy is. So if local papers are looking for a way to add their brand to the conversations people are having, this is it.''

HEADLINE: Following Venture Capital for Signs of Tech to Come

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
After hibernating for the last year, Silicon Valley's venture capitalists are beginning to stir. 
 Technology financiers raised about $14 billion to finance new companies in 2009, a sharp drop from $36 billion in 2007. But as the economic freeze begins to thaw, investors are once again writing checks to entrepreneurs. 
 Some of the ideas will become the big public companies of the future, following in the footsteps of one-time start-ups like Google, Cisco Systems and Amazon.com. Many more will fail because they are too early, late or unoriginal. 
 Yet whether individual companies make it or not, the new ideas that are intriguing top venture capitalists offer an early look at which technologies may transform the way we live in coming years. 
 COMPUTERS IN OUR POCKETS Tech pundits have long predicted that one day we would carry tiny computers in our pockets, and last year that began to happen with application phones like the iPhone. 
 Computing will become even more mobile this year, especially if Apple releases a rumored tablet computer, said Todd Chaffee, a general partner at Institutional Venture Partners in Mill Valley, Calif. 
 As the line between our phones and computers blurs, the way we use them will change. In 20 years, a keyboard and mouse will be archaic, like punch cards are today, said Brad Feld, a managing director of the Foundry Group in Boulder, Colo. 
 ''With gesture-based, multitouch, spatially controlled, voice-activated and wearable computing, there is an unbelievable amount of innovation going on here,'' he said. 
 For all the interest in mobile, venture investors are losing interest in start-ups that build iPhone applications. ''That was a very exciting place to look at; the growth numbers were off the charts, but I think we all understand now that it's very hard to build big businesses here,'' said David Pakman, a partner at Venrock in New York. 
 This year, investors are most excited about Android, Google's mobile operating system. In 2010, people are expected to buy two to three times as many Android-based phones as iPhones, ''ripping apart the hegemony of the Apple ecosystem,'' said Peter Fenton, a general partner at Benchmark Capital in Menlo Park, Calif. 
 GREEN TECH FIZZLES After years of breathless excitement about green technology, many venture capitalists have grown skeptical. ''That one has been overhyped,'' Mr. Chaffee said. 
 Venture capitalists invested just $1.6 billion in clean tech companies in the first nine months of 2009, compared with $3.1 billion in the same period in 2008, according to the National Venture Capital Association. 
 Many still think that saving the earth could be profitable, but on a smaller scale. Foundation Capital is interested in applications that use the smart electric grid to monitor, distribute and conserve energy. Battery Ventures is looking at companies that make devices like computers more energy efficient. 
 DATA OVERLOAD Among Tweets, Foursquare check-ins and text messages, we are all producing a lot more data than we were a year ago. However, ''the way we've built Web sites for the last 15 years hasn't really been designed to deal with the amount of data we're now seeing because of the real-time Web,'' Mr. Pakman said. 
 New technology companies will figure out how to tweak the architecture of the Web to accommodate the data deluge, he said. 
 Start-ups will figure out how to restore the balance between how much information we receive and our ability to process it, Mr. Feld said. For example, Foundry is investing in companies that manage and extract data from e-mail inboxes, as well as start-ups that give people access to personal data, like music and photos, from any computer, at any time. 
 A MORE EFFICIENT OFFICE Start-ups that make software and hardware for businesses will take a cue from consumer devices like the iPod and build products that are simpler to use, said Sunil Dhaliwal, a general partner at Battery Ventures in Boston. 
 ''The guy buying software and hardware for your average company probably looks a whole lot more like a guy raised on an iPod and an iPhone than a guy in his 60s raised on Unix terminals and big old I.B.M. mainframes,'' he said. ''That's going to ripple through technology sold to companies in a really dramatic way.'' 
 Paul G. Koontz, a general partner at Foundation Capital in Menlo Park, said entrepreneurs were coming up with promising ideas for virtualization software and Web-based cloud computing, both of which give companies lower-cost options for maintaining their technologies. 
 ''There's no doubt in my mind that 10 years from now, our notion of the corporate data center is going to be gone, and the way that large companies use technology like software is going to be completely redefined,'' he said. 
 Security companies that help Web sites and computer owners protect themselves are ripe for investment as well, said Ray Rothrock, a partner at Venrock in Palo Alto. Today, 80 percent to 97 percent of business e-mail messages are spam, he said, and malware, software that infects computers, has grown exponentially. 
 RETURN OF THE I.P.O.? Venture capitalists make most of their money on initial public offerings of the tech companies they invested in. But in each of the last two years, fewer than 10 companies have gone public, compared with 86 in 2007. 
 The new year could finally break the logjam, bringing more than 50 tech offerings, investment bankers say. That could include prominent companies like Facebook. 
 ''There's a big backup and there's a lot of companies that have $100 million or more in revenue and are profitable or will be profitable next year, and there will be some huge I.P.O.'s,'' said Mike Kwatinetz, a general partner at Azure Capital Partners in San Francisco. ''What that will also do is heat up the M&A market.'' 
 That is welcome news after a dark year, Mr. Dhaliwal said. ''The mood is pretty optimistic, in that way that if you're nearly killed in a car accident you've got a renewed positive outlook on life.''

HEADLINE: Where the Action Is on Climate

 BODY:
Even as many members of Congress resist as too hard or too costly the steps necessary to address global warming, American cities and states -- the largest of which have carbon footprints bigger than those of most nations -- have quietly been making serious commitments to curb emissions. Instead of finding reasons to do nothing, Congress should build on these actions to fashion a national response to climate change. 
 According to a recent study by Environment America, an advocacy group, about half of the states have broad plans and specific regulations aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions. When fully realized, these actions would cut emissions by over 7 percent between now and 2020 -- a sizable distance toward the 17 percent reductions President Obama promised at Copenhagen. 
 About half the reductions would come from proposed emission limits in six big states, plus a regional cap on power plant emissions adopted by New York and nine other Northeastern states. The other half would result from legally required increases in the use of alternative energy sources like wind -- 29 states have approved such mandates -- as well as stronger state and city efficiency standards for appliances, lighting and buildings. 
 California's goal of cutting greenhouse gases by one-quarter by 2020 is plausible partly because the state has been so successful in improving the efficiency of its power plants and buildings, promoting renewable energy and insisting on fuel-efficient vehicles. The state recently approved strict new energy-efficiency requirements for television sets, which now account for 10 percent of the average household's energy use but are largely unregulated. The rules will save consumers $1 billion in energy bills and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by three million tons each year. Though that is just under 1 percent of current emissions, it is small steps like these that will take California to its overall goal. 
 In another positive move, New York City has adopted a new law requiring periodic ''energy audits'' on 22,000 large commercial and residential buildings that account for half of the city's carbon dioxide emissions.
 Owners will not be required to make renovations under the law, although this idea should be revisited if the economy improves. The expectation is that the prospect of saving energy costs over the long term will lead to major investments in more efficient heating and cooling systems. The law is a critical component of Mayor Michael Bloomberg's goal of reducing New York City's carbon emissions by 30 percent by 2030.
 A national policy endorsed by Congress that puts a price on greenhouse gas emissions is urgently needed. These states and cities shed a hopeful light on what this nation and others can and must achieve.

HEADLINE: Lax Oversight Caused Crisis, Bernanke Says

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
Regulatory failure, not low interest rates, was responsible for the housing bubble and subsequent financial crisis of the last decade, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said in a speech on Sunday. 
 Mr. Bernanke's remarks, perhaps his strongest language yet assessing the roots of the financial crisis, came as he awaited confirmation for a second term as Fed chairman and as he sought greater regulatory authority from Congress.
 ''Stronger regulation and supervision aimed at problems with underwriting practices and lenders' risk management would have been a more effective and surgical approach to constraining the housing bubble than a general increase in interest rates,'' Mr. Bernanke said in remarks to the American Economic Association. 
 Mr. Bernanke, addressing accusations that the Fed contributed to the financial crisis, argued in his speech that the interest rates set by the central bank from 2002 to 2006 were appropriately low. He was a member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve system for most of that period. 
 ''When historical relationships are taken into account, it is difficult to ascribe the house price bubble either to monetary policy or to the broader macroeconomic environment,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
 Some lawmakers and economists have argued that the Fed kept interest rates too low in the aftermath of the 2001 recession, making loans cheap and feeding reckless lending by banks. 
 ''I strongly disapprove of some of the past deeds of the Federal Reserve while Ben Bernanke was a member and its chairman, and I lack confidence in what little planning for the future he has articulated,'' Richard Shelby of Alabama, the Senate Banking Committee's top-ranking Republican, said in December during a committee vote on Mr. Bernanke's reconfirmation.
 The Senate Banking Committee approved Mr. Bernanke's renomination last month. He is expected to be reconfirmed by the full Senate before his current term expires on Jan. 31, despite some vocal opposition.
 Even if confirmed, however, Mr. Bernanke is likely to face further political challenges over financial regulatory reform and the governance of the Fed.
 The House passed a provision to audit the Fed as part of a larger financial reform package last month. Representative Ron Paul, Republican of Texas, has been carrying the banner for such an audit for decades.
 The debate over what caused the financial crisis comes as the economy shows signs of recovery and as Congress considers a wide-ranging overhaul of financial regulation. 
 In a separate talk on Sunday at the conference, Donald L. Kohn, the Fed's vice chairman, listed several measures the central bank was likely to take to shed the problematic assets it took from banks during the financial crisis. He said ''the appropriate use and sequencing of these tools is under active discussion'' by regulators.
 But, as members of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee said last month, he noted that the fragile economic recovery and weak job market would ''warrant exceptionally low'' interest rates ''for an extended period.''
 Mr. Bernanke, in his talk, echoed his previous calls for Congress to grant the Fed greater oversight powers over the financial system, like the ability to help monitor and regulate against ''systemic risk.''
 The implication is that the Fed believes that regulation and supervision, rather than tighter monetary policies, should be used to address asset bubbles in the future.
 Mr. Bernanke has pointed to the Fed's extraordinary efforts to stem the crisis, including the creation of new lending vehicles to banks and a reduction of bank-to-bank interest rates to virtually zero, as evidence that the Fed has a firm grasp of what the economy needs. The Fed's handling of the crisis has been widely praised by economists.
 The Treasury and other government agencies already have supervisory power over parts of the financial system, but so, too, does the Federal Reserve.
 In his talk on Sunday, Mr. Bernanke acknowledged as much, rattling off a list of regulatory efforts the bank made to address nontraditional mortgages and poor underwriting practices.
 But, he said, ''these efforts came too late or were insufficient to stop the decline in underwriting standards and effectively constrain the housing bubble.''

HEADLINE: Decline Is Relative

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
Here in the United States, we spent New Year's weekend bidding good riddance to the awful, awful aughties -- a miserable decade of bubbles and busts, rising health care bills and soaring deficits, domestic terror attacks and overseas quagmires. 
 Elsewhere, though, the decade's turn was probably flavored by nostalgia. For much of the world, the last 10 years was a period to savor -- an era of impressive economic growth, ever-higher life expectancy, relative peace and steady progress against poverty. 
 A billion-odd Chinese had a pretty good decade, and so did a billion Indians: their economies just about doubled in size, minting new millionaires and lifting countless peasants into a growing middle class. Brazil boomed, Indonesia prospered, and even Africa enjoyed a season of substantial growth. Nobody would mistake Vladimir Putin's Russia for a liberal democratic paradise, but most Russians seem to prefer its stability to the basket-case republic Putin inherited from Boris Yeltsin.
 Seen in this light, America's lost decade looks less like a big zero and more like an inevitable corrective to the high-flying 1990s. The enormous Clinton-era gulf between the United States and its competitors was bound to narrow eventually. For now, at least, our decline is only relative -- from hyperpower back to superpower, from the only nation that mattered to the one that matters most. 
 But as the 2010s begin, there's reason to worry that America has further to fall. Our politics are polarized, our finances are still overleveraged, and our society is increasingly segregated -- by income, education and family structure -- between a thriving elite and a struggling working class. Worse, neither political party seems capable of forging a new policy synthesis to reckon with our domestic challenges.
 In the unhappy aughts, we witnessed the exhaustion of Reaganomics. A quarter-century after Ronald Reagan's mix of tax cuts and deregulation revived American competitiveness, George W. Bush's attempt to imitate the Gipper produced only wage stagnation and skyrocketing debt. 
 This failure helped cost Republicans their majority. But instead of seeking a new post-Reagan consensus, the Obama Democrats are returning to their party's long-running pursuit of European-style social democracy -- by micromanaging industry, pouring money into entitlement and welfare programs, and binding the economy in a web of new taxes and regulations.
 These policies may help smooth over the inequalities that have opened in our national life since the 1970s. But they threaten to cost America its position in the world along the way. 
 Social democracy has its benefits, but global competitiveness isn't one of them. As Jim Manzi points out, in an essay on ''Keeping America's Edge'' in the latest issue of National Affairs, ''from 1980 through today, America's share of global output has been constant at about 21 percent. Europe's share, meanwhile, has been collapsing in the face of global competition -- going from a little less than 40 percent of global production in the 1970s to about 25 percent today.''
 If we hope to avoid a similar plunge, the Obama-era tilt toward government intervention needs to be balanced, and soon, by a new growth-oriented agenda. This will require more than the rote invocations of Reaganism that too many Republican politicians have fallen back on, however. The age of sweeping tax cuts financed by deficit spending is over. The policies of the 1980s will not keep America competitive in the 2010s. Our challenges are new, and we must think and act anew.
 Manzi's National Affairs essay, a tour d'horizon of our socioeconomic situation, provides a solid place to start. He proposes a fourfold agenda: Unwind the partnerships forged between Big Business and Big Government in the wake of the 2008 crash; seek financial regulations that ''contain busts,'' by segregating high-risk transactions from lower-risk enterprises; deregulate the public school system, to let a thousand charter schools and start-ups bloom; and shift our immigration policy away from low-skilled immigration, and toward the recruitment of high-skilled emigres from around the globe.
 To this list, I would add tax reform and entitlement reform. The former should broaden the tax base while cutting taxes on work, childrearing and investment. The latter should means-test both Social Security and Medicare, reducing both programs' spending on well-off retirees rather than questing fruitlessly for their privatization. 
 This is a right-of-center agenda, broadly speaking, but it's also one that you could imagine attracting bipartisan support, even in the current polarized environment. 
 Which is as it should be -- since in the quest to make the 2010s a far, far better era than the grueling decade America has just escaped, we're all in this together.

HEADLINE: Really Big Money Politics

 BODY:
The nation's hard times are proving to be boom times for the lobbying industry in Washington. Lobbyists are expected to easily break their record of $3.3 billion in annual business, raising an inevitable question: How much more in special-interest donations will be bagged by lawmakers as they are furiously lobbied on everything from health care reform to economic regulation? 
 No one confesses to explicit quid pro quo crudity. But the power of lobbyists as they channel money and urge favor for rich clients is a gripping, and so far immutable, fact of political life. It needs to change. 
 To his credit, President Obama has delivered some promised reforms in the executive branch, particularly by banning administration officials from doubling back as lobbyists across his time in office. But the moneyed clout of K Street makes it urgent that Mr. Obama deliver on an even bigger promise. He must repair the damage done by his unfortunate rejection last year of publicly subsidized election financing as an alternative to the temptations of the special-interest trough. 
 Mr. Obama chose unlimited private financing to buoy his campaign to a huge electioneering advantage. He pronounced the leaner public subsidy option used by major candidates since Watergate to be a ''broken system'' outdated by modern campaign costs. 
 Mr. Obama made much of a promise to fix it, once elected. So, the time has come to fix it. 
 He needs to set a strong example for Congress and the status quo laziness of Washington and move convincingly for revival of the public option, which served the nation well. This would create pressure for a similar system of restraint by Congressional candidates now basted with special-interest money. As the lucre builds to critical mass, a public option for Congressional and presidential candidates becomes ever more vital.

HEADLINE: Rules for Alabama Democrat: Toe G.O.P. Line, and Be Liked

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

DATELINE: ANDALUSIA, Ala. 

 BODY:
Among the men who gather every morning at 6 o'clock at the Church's Chicken here on Three Notch Street, there is general agreement that the Obama administration is doing a very bad job of running the country. And the stakes are as high, as one coffee drinker put it, as the survival of the country's culture, economy and way of life. 
 Yet this group is represented in the House by a Democrat, Bobby Bright. And they are actually fond of him. For now.
 ''I like Bobby,'' said Glenn Cook, 72, a retired electrical engineer. ''I think he's a great guy and a fine Christian man. But when he first came out, I wished that he'd been a Republican.'' 
 In the deep-red states of the South, it is very hard these days to be a Blue Dog, as members of the group of 52 centrist House Democrats are known. Suspicions about the Obama administration's expansive view of government power have made the Democratic label so toxic in some parts of the South that merely voting like a Republican -- as many Blue Dogs do -- may no longer be enough.
 If that is true, Mr. Bright recently became Alabama's sole test case. 
 On Dec. 22, Representative Parker Griffith, a freshman representing the northernmost district in the state, announced that he was switching to the Republican Party. His defection was a bad sign for Democratic hopes of retaining seats in the South, specifically in Alabama, which has moved ever more securely into the Republican column since the mid-1960s, after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 permanently altered Southern politics.
 Gratitude still abides in Mr. Griffith's district for President Franklin D. Roosevelt's creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority, which is one reason voters there have not sent a Republican to Congress for over 140 years. Mr. Griffith's calculation that he probably could not win as a Democrat indicates that the hostile reaction to Democrats over the past year has been intense enough to turn an already deeply red state -- one that President Obama lost by more than 20 percentage points in 2008 -- even redder.
 And it leaves, standing alone as the sole white conservative Democrat in the state's Congressional delegation, Mr. Bright, 57, who represents the men in Church's Chicken. Mr. Bright has announced no plans to switch parties. If one counted only by his voting record, it would not seem to make a difference anyhow.
 ''Bright and Parker won, despite the poor showing of Obama, because they are conservative and therefore not open to attack from Republicans on social issues like abortion, prayer, guns and taxes,'' John Anzalone, a Montgomery-based Democratic pollster, wrote in an e-mail message. 
 Mr. Anzalone argued that Mr. Griffith's calculation was likely to end up hurting him, since he now has to face a Republican primary, while Mr. Bright's conservative record could potentially expand his base.
 Mr. Bright's victory in 2008, the first by a Democrat in this district for nearly 45 years, was something of a fluke. He is uniquely qualified: a former mayor of Montgomery, he was popular in the largely black areas in his district that are near the city. But he was born the 13th child of a poor sharecropper in the quiet country to the south, a largely white region of peanut farms and cotton fields known as the Wiregrass. The area is deeply conservative, but it likes its own, and Mr. Bright is one of them.
 The huge turnout by black voters in the 2008 election, coupled with some infighting on the Republican side, resulted in Mr. Bright's winning the Second District by less than 1 percentage point.
 Since winning, Mr. Bright has been such a purebred Blue Dog that he is practically red. He has voted with the Republicans on every significant piece of legislation of his term, including the health care overhaul, the budget and the ''cap and trade'' energy legislation. The reaction to his rare party-line votes helps explain why: a largely pro forma vote to keep Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House has drawn the ire of some of his supporters.
 But staunch Republican voters in his district point to the advantages of having a Democrat in Washington: Mr. Bright is constantly making the rounds -- because he has to -- and he votes like a man who knows he is being watched. 
 ''I don't believe that Bobby would survive if he didn't vote conservative in this district,'' said Mike Barefield, 60, a conservative and normally Republican voter in Ozark who supports Mr. Bright. ''It doesn't take but one or two votes to change people's minds.''
 Mr. Bright declined to comment for this article.
 Political analysts say Mr. Bright is smart to pay attention to the Wiregrass voters. He might not be able to count on such an enormous turnout among black voters in 2010 -- even if, as is possible, Representative Artur Davis becomes the first black Democratic nominee for governor in Alabama history -- leaving Mr. Bright to depend on people who normally vote Republican, a tall order.
 ''The average guy out there walking the streets, he doesn't know how anybody votes,'' said Larry Lee, who has run for the seat as a Democrat three times. ''They hear all this stuff about Obama's making us all socialist and Pelosi's riding a broomstick to work. I think he's going to have a very tough row to hoe.''
 The Republican Party is backing a Montgomery city councilwoman, Martha Roby, but so far few in the Wiregrass know her name.
 ''How do you campaign against a Democrat who votes like a Republican?'' asked Cleveland Poole, the chairman of the Butler County Republican Party. 
 Mr. Poole thought about that and answered with another question: ''When Nancy Pelosi finally comes down to him and says, 'We've given you a pass on all this other stuff, I need you now,' is he going to go with the party?''
 Conservative voters in the Wiregrass have considered that prospect, and it gives serious pause to defenders of Mr. Bright.
 At the same time, there are such things as white liberals in southern Alabama -- staunch union members and the few remaining yellow dog Democrats -- and they are not so patient. 
 ''To me, he's of no value to the Democratic Party,'' said C. T. Weed, 75, a retired contractor at the Fort Rucker Army base and now mayor pro tem of Pinckard. ''If you're going to be a Baptist, be a Baptist.''
 At Church's Chicken, the token Democrat, Rayford Davis, a 69-year-old retired insurance agent who is known as Pee Wee, is a little more forgiving. He says that the resistance to the Obama agenda around here is based on racial prejudice, and that Mr. Bright, over time, could bring his constituents around.
 The others bristle at accusations of racism and say the problem is Mr. Obama's crowded agenda of major changes, with the potential deal breaker being the health care bill.
 ''If it passes, there's going to be people who will go against Democrats no matter how he voted to try to get them all out,'' said Mr. Cook, adding that he supports Mr. Bright, cautiously. 
 But while some Republicans who back Mr. Bright do not want him to switch parties, considering it a sign of untrustworthiness, Mr. Cook is among those who would welcome it. In that case, he would not have to temper his support.
 ''If Bobby switched to the Republicans,'' he said, ''I'd put a sign in my yard.''

HEADLINE: Pioneering Greenhouse Analyst Appraised

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A fresh view of a pioneer in studies of the climate impact of human-generated greenhouse gases. 

 BODY:
Global warming has of late felt like a new issue, but it's useful once in a while to review the generations-long line of analysis that points to substantial climatic and environmental consequences from rising emissions of greenhouse gases.
 The basic idea, of course, goes back more than a century, but the real number crunching started in the 1950s, and even drew the attention of the filmmaker Frank Capra, who produced a series of television programs on science (in the post-Sputnik days when science was a high priority), that included "The Unchained Goddess," a remarkable 1958 film on weather and climate. It contained a section on greenhouse-driven warming: 
 Now Gavin Schmidt at the Realclimate.org blog has posted about a reissued and freshly appraised body of work by Gilbert N. Plass from that same era -- on the climatic impact of human-generated carbon dioxide. 
 The piece caught my eye because, in sifting through New York Times archives a few years ago while researching my book on the changing Arctic, I found what I believe is our first substantial newspaper coverage of research pointing to the prospect that humans could substantially warm the climate -- a 1956 article on Plass's work by Waldemar Kaempffert. You can read it below. I cite this piece frequently when discussing the climate challenge, particularly because its "kicker," or closing thought, remains utterly relevant: 
Coal and oil are still plentiful and cheap in many parts of the world, and there is every reason to believe that both will be consumed by industry so long as it pays to do so.
The only update I'd suggest is changing the word "industry" to "us," given that oil and electricity remain staples of all facets of modern life, not just manufacturing or the like. 
The line perfectly crystallizes the heart of the continuing, and largely unresolved, debate over how to respond to the risks posed by unabated emissions of heat-trapping gases. For the moment, the atmosphere remains a free dumping space for nearly everyone on the planet. 
Those pushing for a rising price (via a tax or cap) on emissions make the economic case that as long as the environmental costs of burning fossil fuels (or cutting forests) aren't reflected in the accounting calculations driving those activities, "burn baby burn" will remain business as usual. 
Here's the Kaempffert article on Dr. Plass.

HEADLINE: A Love Affair With Panthers, For the Moment

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER

DATELINE: Naples, Fla. 

 BODY:
 As David Onorato of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission carefully opened the giant refrigerator where the bodies were kept, I couldn't help myself. My heart raced. My muscles tensed. Every cheesy freezer horror scene from the movies and ''The Sopranos'' flitted through my mind, and I almost covered my eyes but knew how ridiculous that would be. 
 Yet when the partly frozen female panther was finally laid out on a metal table, the sight was not scary or grisly. It was pure, plain sadness. The vultures may have pecked out her eyes and begun rummaging around beneath her tail, but still the 4-year-old panther was an 80-pound muscular masterpiece, her canines as thick and polished as coffee cup handles, her tawny fur still softly bristly to the touch. 
 The carcass had been recovered from the side of the road a day earlier, another case of big cat meets bigger motorized vehicle in a year that was full of them: 17 endangered Florida panthers were killed by cars and trucks in 2009, the valedictory victim a 3-month-old kitten, as young panthers are called, found on New Year's Eve. Add in the seven other panthers that were killed by gunshot, one another or ''causes unknown,'' and the mortality rate seems insupportably high for a wild population estimated at maybe 110 breeding adults. 
 Yet if there is any bright note to be extracted from the death ledgers, it's that the wild panthers slinking in and around the Everglades -- the sole surviving tribe of Puma concolor east of the Mississippi -- are apparently breeding avidly enough to replace their fallen numbers. The traffic fatalities are terrible, said Dr. Onorato, but ''we must remember there's reproduction going on, some of which we don't document.''
 Call them panthers, pumas, cougars or mountain lions, but cats they remain, and cats have a defiantly syncopated way of coming back again and again. As Dr. Onorato and other researchers see it, the tale of the Florida panther is twitchier and more sinuous than its long tail, a continuing saga of highs and lows, hopes and oh nos. 
 On the one hand, the population in South Florida is stable and possibly even growing by small increments. On the other, the animal is nowhere near meeting the standards necessary for removal from the endangered species list -- the existence of three distinct populations of at least 240 adults each, somewhere in the southeastern United States. Moreover, scientists recognize that if economic revival brings fresh rounds of development that intrude into panther habitat, even the extant Florida population could once again suffer. 
 Floridians love their panthers. At the behest of enthusiastic students, the panther was designated the official state animal in 1982. Of all the specialized license plates in Florida, the panther plate is among the most popular, bringing in more than $1 million a year. ''All of our research and management, our budget, equipment -- everything -- is supported by purchases of these cat tags,'' said Dr. Onorato, one of five state researchers devoted entirely to studying the biology and conservation of the panther. 
 Some biologists worry that at least part of the infatuation is predicated on the Florida panther's impeccable record. In contrast with mountain lions in California and other Western states, which have been known to ambush, kill and partly consume the occasional jogger or hiker, there are no recorded cases of a Florida panther's attacking a human being. 
 Some have suggested that the distinction in how the two cougar populations comport themselves around people stems from slight regional discrepancies in anatomy and leg length. Others have proposed that the Western puma is comparatively more accustomed to hunting large animals and thus sees Homo sapiens as acceptable pickings. 
 Yet scientists point out that DNA analysis has revealed very little genetic difference between the Eastern and Western panther populations, which means there is no reason to believe the Florida panther is a congenital puddy tat. Certainly the animals can be ruthless with one another. Among panthers living in prime areas away from roads, said Dr. Onorato, ''the No. 1 cause of death is intraspecific aggression'' -- one panther killing another. Some authorities suspect it is only a matter of time and sustained human encroachment before a Florida panther pounces on a Florida land speculator. 
 Devotees yearn to see panthers in the wild, but very few ever do. The cats are quiet, reclusive, solitary and built to blend in. On a twilight foray into known panther territory under the guidance of a naturalist, Marcy Wagner, we saw dozens of alligators with their madcap zigzagging heat-control grins, and anhingas looking like caped pterodactyl Draculas as they dried out their wings, and storks, hawks, egrets, herons and orchids worthy of being poached. We spotted fresh panther tracks in the swamp mud and even fresher panther scat, and at one point Ms. Wagner declared there was a distinct smell of ''wet cat,'' but whether that smell was a wading cougar, well, I have no proof of that. 
 Early Americans had a much easier time puma sighting, for the cats abounded across the continent. For generations the cats were shot as vermin and their hunting grounds transformed into cattle pastures, farmland or conference centers. By the late 1980s, the Florida panther population hit its nadir of about 20. ''It was a recipe for entering the vortex of extinction,'' Dr. Onorato said. 
 But with the help of the Endangered Species Act and other legislation, and with the introduction of a few Texas pumas into the area to counter the threat of so-called inbreeding depression, the Florida panther was yanked back from the vortical brink. 
 The panthers did their part, too, thanks to a reproductive schedule vaguely reminiscent of an unspayed house cat. Panthers can breed year round, their gestation period is 90 days, compared with a domestic cat's 67, their average litter size of 2.5 kittens is just slightly below that of a house cat, and they nurse their young for a pet-length span of about eight weeks. 
 Unlike the great cats, panthers lack the vocal cords to roar, but they can purr. Among the panther's favorite meals is an invasive species -- the feral hog, brought to this continent by the Spaniards in the 16th century -- but it will also eat white-tailed deer, armadillos, raccoons, small alligators and pet cats on the loose. 
 Pumas need lots of space. Females roam over a home range of about 80 square miles, while males patrol ranges as big as 250 square miles. For anyone driving through Florida cat country, the law demands you take it slow. If you're lucky, you'll see a panther -- one that still has the eyes to see you.

HEADLINE: Sales Rise Spurs Optimism In Manhattan Real Estate

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
The 2009 Manhattan real estate market ended on a better note than it began, according to fourth-quarter reports that were to be released Tuesday by the city's largest brokerages. 
 The improvements in the market that began over the summer pushed through to the end of the year. Most reports found that sales increased from the third quarter to the fourth, which helped eat away at the inventory of unsold apartments. Prices, meanwhile, stayed about flat -- some of the reports showed slight increases, but most showed small declines. 
 ''Considering where we came from, the results this quarter were much better than we could've imagined a year ago at this time,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, who prepares the market report for Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''There are a lot of challenges ahead for housing, but I think the worst is behind us.'' 
 Dottie Herman, president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that in the first half of 2009, apartment sales were low. ''People were thinking, If I buy this, will the market go down more?'' Ms. Herman said. ''You don't have that any more. People feel the market has pretty much bottomed out.'' 
 The Prudential report showed that the median sale price in Manhattan was $810,000 in the fourth quarter of 2009, a 10 percent drop over the same period in 2008 and a 4.7 percent decline over the third quarter of 2009. The average sale price, $1.296 million, was down 2.1 percent since last summer and 12.7 percent since the fourth quarter of last year. 
 Real estate sales figures usually represent contracts signed several months earlier. Mr. Miller said that the median sale price of $810,000 in Manhattan was down 21 percent from the peak of $1.025 million in the second quarter of 2008. The average sale price of nearly $1.3 million last quarter was 24.8 percent lower than the peak of $1.72 million in the first quarter of 2008. Prudential said the number of sales increased 10.9 percent from the third quarter to the fourth last year, and they were 8.4 percent higher than in the fourth quarter of 2008. 
 It was unusual to have such an active fourth quarter, which includes many holidays. ''Over the last couple of years, prices leveled off and activity went down sharply in the fourth quarter,'' said Gregory J. Heym, chief economist at Terra Holdings, who prepares reports for Halstead Property and Brown Harris Stevens. ''That hasn't happened'' in 2009.
 ''It's unusual to see this kind of strength continuing in the fourth quarter,'' Mr. Heym added. 
 Inventory has been reduced by the rise in sales that started in the summer. That is unusual because the busiest time for sales in the city is usually the spring. The Prudential report found that inventory had fallen 18.3 percent since the third quarter of 2009 and 24.6 percent since the fourth quarter of last year. 
 Inventory is now 6,851 listings, just shy of the 10-year quarterly average of 7,094, Mr. Miller said. Some of the decline in inventory, however, is seasonal. Sellers often pull their homes off the market before the holidays and put them back on in the new year. Those owners might be joined by many others who have sat on the sidelines for the last year or so, hoping to wait out the economic storm. 
 But even with willing buyers and sellers, there is a third party to consider: the banks.
 Lending remains extremely tight, especially for ''jumbo'' mortgages, those above $729,750. In Manhattan, these represent a much larger part of the market than in most parts of the country. 
 ''It's still a struggle,'' said Pam Liebman, president of the Corcoran Group. ''The inflexibility of the jumbo mortgage market does continue to kill some deals out there.'' 
 But for anyone who can get a mortgage, rates are still low. They have nowhere to go but up, and this year, some economists say, they are likely to rise, which could put some downward pressure on the market. High unemployment and concerns about commercial real estate foreclosures could play a part as well. 
 ''There are a lot of concern in the economy,'' said Mr. Heym of Terra Holdings. ''We want to see jobs added again; it's hard to know what a bunch of commercial foreclosures would mean. I think we're at a state where things are getting better; it's just going to be a slow recovery.''

HEADLINE: Big Plans for Old Sugar Refinery Face Review

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
In 2004, the Domino Sugar refinery that occupied five blocks along the Brooklyn waterfront in Williamsburg for more than 150 years shut down, joining the neighboring brick factories as remnants of the area's industrial past.
 Now a developer is beginning a public review of a proposal to turn the vacant 11-acre industrial site into a $1.5 billion residential complex, reusing the refinery and installing the historic, 40-foot-tall Domino Sugar sign (now on a separate building) on top. There would be 2,200 apartments in all. The developer also plans to build a waterfront esplanade and a set of new glass and brick buildings that would range from 6 to 40 stories.
 ''We saw this as an opportunity to create what is best in New York: a mixed-income community, with a lot of affordable housing and some pretty interesting architecture, on a waterfront that's been closed to the public for 150 years,'' said the developer, Michael D. Lappin, chief executive of the Community Preservation Corporation, a nonprofit group, and CPC Resources, its for-profit subsidiary. 
 An unusually large percentage of the apartments, 30 percent, or 660 units, would be set aside for low- and moderate-income families and distributed throughout the project. (Generally, development projects promise to dedicate 20 percent of their units for such housing.) 
 The plan might sound a little ambitious, given the recession. And the project still faces some criticism from community advocates who say the project may be too densely packed.
 The city's land-use review for the project started Monday at the City Planning Commission with a public hearing and the certification of the developer's proposal. Over the next seven months, various governmental entities -- from the local community board to the City Council -- will weigh in on the plans. 
 In the years since the last sugar cubes were packed into cartons at the refinery, the neighborhood has been the center of the residential building boom and then the real estate downturn. More than one-fifth of the 500 projects stalled in New York City are in Williamsburg.
 But like a few other developers, Mr. Lappin said he had adopted a slow, multiphased approach. It will take nearly a year to get city approval; once that is secured, only the first building will immediately go up -- on the east side of Kent Avenue, between South Third and South Fourth Streets. The rest will follow on the waterfront parcel, with construction to be completed in 2021.
 Although the market is inundated with luxury housing, Mr. Lappin said, there was a continuing need for housing for teachers, construction workers, clerks and low-income families. Community Preservation Corporation, a lending consortium of banks and insurance companies, has financed $7.2 billion in mostly affordable housing in its 35-year existence.
 Mr. Lappin's company and his partners have already spent more than $125 million on the land, environmental assessments, architects and plans. The architect Rafael Vinoly designed the transformation plan for what is known as the New Domino, while Beyer Blinder Belle, the architectural firm, drew up the plan to convert the 12-story refinery building, which was declared a landmark in 2007, into 241 apartments, with shops, a community center and a multilevel rooftop structure that would rise as high as four stories.
 The original plan was to sell condominiums on the site and use the profit to subsidize the low- and moderate-income units. That may still happen, but Mr. Lappin acknowledged that the current condo market was soft.
 Peter Gillespie, executive director of Neighbors Allied for Good Growth in Williamsburg, credited the developer with a well-designed plan, nice open space and the inclusion of a high percentage of apartments for low- and moderate-income residents. But, he added, ''there's a concern about the size and scale of the buildings. There's greater density here than other developers have gotten.''
 Christopher Olechowski, chairman of Community Board 1, which includes the Domino site, agreed. ''It's a trade-off,'' he said. ''They will have to make some really strong arguments about affordable housing versus density and height. It's not going to be an easy sell.''

HEADLINE: After Planning the Big Party, Back to Business as Usual

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON; Nate Schweber contributed reporting.

 BODY:
From deep inside a cubicle on the first official workday of 2010 for the hats-and-noisemakers crowd, a question came to mind: How did the people who worked while the rest of the city partied on New Year's Eve spend their Monday? Were they still slaving away, if you can use that word about people who orchestrate ball drops in Times Square and mastermind fireworks displays in Central Park?
 Jeffrey A. Straus, the chief executive of the company that produces the New Year's Eve celebration at 1 Times Square, was not in his office, high above where it all happened as the clock ticked down the final moments of the old year. He was working, he said, but from home, in Armonk, N.Y. 
 ''I'm working on getting people paid,'' he said, a chore that he said involved going through invoices and budgets. ''The last week of the year, so much stuff gets put to the side as far as paperwork goes,'' he said, ''and you wake up on Jan. 1 after you've slept for 18 hours, and you realize you've got to get that done.''
 Except that the brand-new calendar said Monday was Jan. 4. 
 Mr. Straus's Jan. 1 was Rip Van Winklish. He left Times Square at about 5:15 a.m., as he usually does after tidying up after the ball has dropped. ''Typically, I'm up by late afternoon'' on New Year's Day, he said, ''but this time, I got up, had a late lunch and went back to bed. It was that kind of a year.''
 Tim Tompkins, the president of the Times Square Alliance, said he spent Monday ''going through the piles of work which were deliciously deferred in December.'' Some had been shoved aside, literally. He said that in anticipation of New Year's Eve and a small crowd watching from his office, which has a view of guess what, he moved the things some people would have left in their inbox.
 ''I completely cleared all the surfaces and made the office very neat,'' he said.
 The revelers left traces of the night behind. He said there was a carpet of confetti when he arrived on Monday morning. ''It adds a little color to the office,'' he said. ''It takes away from the gravitas.''
 Ken Furstoss of Pyrotecnico, the fireworks company that staged the display in Central Park in connection with the New York Road Runners club's four-mile midnight run, said that he spent Monday going over paperwork. ''We do 35 percent of one year's work in one weekend over the Fourth of July,'' he said, ''You have to get started on the contracts and the logistics early.''
 Brian Carroll, a researcher for ''New Year's Rockin' Eve 2010,'' spent much of last week trying to find answers to questions from the writers on the show. On Monday, he said, ''I'm not doing anything -- I'm unemployed.''
 ''The job is over,'' said Mr. Carroll, a freelancer who lives in the Los Angeles area, ''and it wasn't as late as you think on New Year's Eve, because I'm on the West Coast. The people doing the writing were done at midnight East Coast time.''
 He said he stayed up until about 2:30 a.m. ''to see my name on the credits'' at the end of the show.

HEADLINE: Demonstrating Resourcefulness in the Face of Career Challenges

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MASCIA

 BODY:
Have a problem? Denise Wintz has a Web site for you. Or a book. Or a motivational seminar. 
 ''I learned that from the Millionaire Mind workshop,'' she said one afternoon in her apartment in Canarsie, Brooklyn, pointing to a series of glasses half-filled with coins. Notes were taped to the front of each glass: ''Necessities: 55%'' read one; ''Play: 10%,'' read another. 
 ''Your necessities should never be more than 55 percent of your income,'' she said, explaining her savings system. ''And you must spend 'Play' money every month. It can't roll over.'' 
 Ms. Wintz, 47, a former information technology specialist, leaves nothing undone when it comes to bettering herself: Her shelves are filled with books like ''Move Ahead With Possibility Thinking,'' by Robert H. Schuller, and ''The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People,'' by Stephen R. Covey. A small pillow hanging from a corkboard near the kitchen reads, ''Check your woulda, coulda, shoulda at the door.''
 Her latest project has been keeping herself financially afloat. Though she lived for years on freelance work for companies like Citigroup and agencies like Safe Horizon, which helps victims of domestic violence, her last assignment ended in October 2008. Since then she has subsisted on unemployment benefits, which net her $365 a week. She has needed so many extensions, she said, ''I can't count anymore.''
 The $200 a month in food stamps that she receives provides some relief, and a roommate contributes half of the $800 rent on the two-bedroom apartment. Ms. Wintz also supplements her income with occasional house-cleaning jobs, which earn her about $375 a month.
 But her car payments are $470 a month, and insurance is $750 a year. She bought a Honda Civic hybrid when she worked for Citigroup, and she cannot sell it, she said, because with on-call computer work ''you're not even entertained'' if you do not have a car. 
 Last summer, after she had fallen behind $7,700 on her rent, her landlord initiated eviction proceedings. A friend suggested that she visit Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, one of the seven organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. 
 In October she was granted $800 toward her rent debt, and the Housing Resources Administration gave her a ''one-shot deal'' payment of $4,000, which she is repaying in $50 monthly installments. She was able to contribute $500 from her savings, and, proving her resourcefulness, she cobbled together the rest from Partnership for the Homeless and other organizations.
 Asking for help, Ms. Wintz said, has ''been very humbling.''
 ''But it's given me perspective,'' she said. 
 Ms. Wintz has never been one to wither in the face of uncertainty: Four years ago, when she was between projects, she signed up with a local car service and used her Honda to shuttle riders around Brooklyn. In between calls she would come home and search for jobs on the Internet.
 These days she is online by 8, scouring the Web for work. She is registered with 200 job search sites that range from the mainstream to the obscure, and she scans them for four hours each day, breaking away only when her back starts hurting.
 ''She could show me Web sites for my clients to look for jobs,'' said her caseworker, Betty Morales, who has been in the field for 20 years.
 At noon Ms. Wintz is off to Medgar Evers College, where she is studying to be a sonogram and X-ray technician. When she was younger she completed three years toward a computer science degree at Fordham, but left to have a daughter, Naveenah Tashi Lewis, now 24 and living in Queens. (She also has 20 godchildren.) 
 Ms. Wintz is hoping her next field will be more stable than information technology. Her tuition is paid through the Federal Pell Grant Program and student loans, and she has three semesters to go. She estimates her starting salary could be $60,000. 
 Ms. Morales said she realized early on that a self-starter like Ms. Wintz did not need guidance so much as emotional support. 
 ''It was hard for her to admit she needed help,'' she said. ''She just needed to know she was not alone.''

HEADLINE: Dodging the Dollar

BYLINE: By MARTHA C. WHITE

 BODY:
Although it has ticked up a bit recently, the United States dollar did not have a particularly good 2009. Nor was its value against competing currencies like the euro and Japanese yen easy to predict. 
 Coming on top of global economic weakness, the dollar's travails just compounded the financial hardships faced by the professionals who plan and attend overseas meetings. 
 ''There's no question that currency fluctuations are a factor,'' says Michael Payne, executive vice president of SmithBucklin, an association management company, adding: ''We've certainly seen negative impacts in terms of meetings attendance.'' While the general economic weakness plays a role in the decision to attend or not attend a meeting, Mr. Payne said the current low value of the dollar added to the challenges faced by business travelers. 
 Gregg Talley, president and chief executive of Talley Management Group, a consulting firm that plans conferences and other events, said the currency situation was a continuing issue for both event planners and their delegates. ''Sticker shock existed before, but once you throw in the currency conversions on top of that, it's pretty stark,'' he said. 
 Leigh Wintz, executive director of Soroptimist International of the Americas, a women's organization, has managed to cope with the dollar's fluctuations by expanding her skills far beyond those of a typical meeting planner, becoming a foreign currency trader. Ms. Wintz says she buys futures contracts for pounds, euros and other currencies up to several months before meetings in overseas destinations. She watches exchange rates daily and keeps track of seasonal patterns in currency movements. When the exchange rate drops to what she considers a good deal, she makes her move. 
 ''A good time to buy for pounds sterling is usually early spring,'' she said. Last year, when the price of a pound dropped to roughly $1.40 (it is now about $1.62), she bought a contract. ''I made money on that deal. That's the game you play.'' 
 Ms. Wintz said she sometimes even paid a hotel or other service provider earlier than necessary to take advantage of a favorable exchange rate.
 Mr. Talley also suggested that clients use foreign currency contracts to hedge against the dollar's volatility. Otherwise, he said, when the dollar falls, groups that did not lock in a rate are forced to take steps like paring back meal options or other elements of the event just to meet their budgets.
 Brenda Anderson, chief executive of the Society of Incentive Travel Executives, an industry trade group more commonly known as SITE, said some organizations were coping by simply staying closer to home. Phelps R. Hope, vice president of meetings and expositions for Kellen Meetings, said some of his clients had opted to meet in the United States instead of taking their events abroad. But for certain groups, like corporations with overseas operations or associations with a significant international membership, staying domestic is not an option. 
 Margaret Moynihan, a director at the consulting firm Deloitte & Touche who is responsible for planning meetings and events, factors in currency fluctuations and their effect on her budget when she selects a site for her annual global meetings. ''When we're doing cost analyses, we look at what the value of the dollar is there,'' she said. In some cases, she can choose a destination that offers more favorable exchange rates, but that is not always possible if the meeting needs to take place in a certain place where the company has a significant presence. 
 Event planners for professional and trade associations face even greater challenges. Earlier this decade, many associations based in the United States expanded significantly overseas, according to Brad Weaber, president of the event management firm Courtesy Associates, a subsidiary of SmithBucklin. As part of these initiatives, the associations promised that a certain number of their gatherings would be held overseas to better attract and serve foreign members. 
 ''It's a little bit of chicken or egg,'' Mr. Weaber said. ''You want to invest in your organization and your members and create an opportunity for global outreach, but you have to be very careful because of the cost.'' Holding a meeting overseas can cost 20 to 40 percent more than a comparable event held in the United States.
 These costs are not just borne by the host organization; in many cases, members of associations must pay their own way to attend. An unfavorable exchange rate can be the final straw for beleaguered members who are paring their expenses sharply. 
 Some organizations have resorted to slashing rates and offering free amenities to lure participants. ''We have to develop new incentive programs to drive attendees from the U.S., such as reduced registration or hotel rates, or covering things like airport transfers or in-room Internet,'' said Mr. Hope, of Kellen Meetings. In addition, he said some clients for whom he plans overseas conferences have had to shorten the program to two days, from three, to reduce the hotel room costs for travelers coming from the United States.
 In some cases, even these efforts are not enough to lure travelers to other countries where the dollar is at a marked disadvantage. ''In some cases, we've seen outright cancellations,'' said Mr. Weaber of Courtesy Associates. Groups generally try to defer meetings that are likely to be lightly attended, rather than scrap the gatherings outright, to avoid having to pay hefty cancellation penalties. Even when a group does go ahead with a meeting in a foreign destination, attendance can be down by 30 to 40 percent, Mr. Weaber said. 
 ''Historically, when the U.S. dollar was strong, currency exchange was never a concern,'' Mr. Hope said. ''Now, exchange rate turns into one of the first conversations, whereas before it was really at the bottom of the list.''

HEADLINE: Ex-Senator Runs for Governor in R.I. as Independent

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
Lincoln D. Chafee, the former Republican senator from Rhode Island who lost his seat to a Democrat in 2006 despite his family's longtime presence in state politics, announced Monday that he would run for governor there as an independent. 
 Mr. Chafee, 56, left the Republican Party after his loss to Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat, saying the party's agenda had grown too conservative. In Congress, he opposed President George W. Bush's tax cuts and was the only Senate Republican to vote against authorizing the war in Iraq.
 Gov. Donald L. Carcieri, a Republican who took office in 2003, cannot seek re-election because of term limits, and the only Republican to enter the race dropped out last month. Mr. Carcieri, a conservative with flagging approval ratings, is the only Republican in statewide office. 
 On the Democratic side, Patrick C. Lynch, the state's attorney general, and Frank T. Caprio, its general treasurer, are competing for their party's nomination. Both are well known in the state, but so is Mr. Chafee, whose family has loomed large in Rhode Island politics for more than a century. His father, John, was the state's governor for six years in the 1960s before serving in the Senate for two decades; upon his death in 1999, his son was appointed his successor.
 ''I believe that running as an independent will free me from the constraints that party politics impose on candidates,'' Mr. Chafee said in his announcement speech in Warwick, R.I. ''This freedom will allow me to bring in the best people from both major parties and people without political ties to solve our problems.'' 
 During the recession, Rhode Island has suffered from some of the nation's worst budget problems and one of its highest unemployment rates. In his speech, Mr. Chafee said the state should ''carefully examine'' expanding its sales tax to cover some items -- like food, clothing and over-the-counter drugs -- that are currently exempt. 
 Mr. Chafee faces significant challenges in the governor's race: Rhode Island is overwhelmingly Democratic, and he trails his Democratic opponents in fund-raising. But New England voters have elected a number of independents in recent decades, including two governors -- Lowell P. Weicker Jr. in Connecticut and Angus King in Maine. 
 In Massachusetts, Timothy Cahill, the state treasurer, is running for governor as an independent after leaving the Democratic Party last year. 
 Darrell M. West, vice president of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said Mr. Chafee would be a strong candidate even without the backing of a major political party. His name recognition, his personal wealth and the fact that about half of Rhode Island voters are not affiliated with a party all work in Mr. Chafee's favor, Mr. West said. 
 ''The Chafee family name is the gold standard in Rhode Island,'' he said. ''And while Rhode Island does tend to elect Democrats, independents are the largest voting bloc in the state.''

HEADLINE: Mayor Sticking by Tourism Projections Despite Dropoff in 2009

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
With the number of visitors to New York City declining by almost 2 million last year, it might be reasonable to expect that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg would offer a less than rosy view of the decline, or at least express some concern that a continued slump might be in store in 2010. 
 But at a news conference on Monday, the mayor was having none of that. 
 Mr. Bloomberg said he was pleased with the estimated 45.25 million visitors for the year, even though that number was down nearly 4 percent from 2008. He explained that the city still drew about 3 million more visitors than tourism officials had forecast a year ago, and pointed out that New York had fared better than other leading destinations in the United States.
 ''It is down a little bit, but it is down a lot less than we had feared,'' Mr. Bloomberg said at Greenhouse Cafe, a brick-and-brass restaurant in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.
 Despite the decline, Mr. Bloomberg said New York had passed Orlando as the nation's No. 1 tourist destination. In December, the Orlando/Orange County Convention and Visitors Bureau forecast that its visitor count for 2009 would be down by 9.4 percent from the year before, to 44.3 million.
 A combination of factors, including the global recession and fears of swine flu, slowed travel to New York for both business and pleasure, Mr. Bloomberg said. Now, with the economies of several countries rebounding, city officials predict that the flow of visitors will swell this year by about 1.5 million, or 3.2 percent.
 Then, over the next two years, they said, the city will draw a total of 3.3 million more annual visitors to reach the 50 million mark by 2012 -- a goal of the mayor's that he will not relinquish lightly. Indeed, George Fertitta, the chief executive of NYC & Company, the city's tourism marketing arm, stood next to Mr. Bloomberg and proclaimed, ''We will achieve 50 million visitors by 2012.''
 Doing so may be harder than saying so, though. Getting there would require an annual growth rate of 3.5 percent for the next three years.
 Tourism Economics, the company that consults with NYC & Company on its forecasts, projects that the number of international trips to the United States will increase by 2.75 percent in 2010, said David Goodger, a senior economist with the consulting firm.
 Mr. Goodger said travel to New York City should increase at a higher rate than to other United States markets, because it is one of the first places that come to mind when people in other countries decide to go somewhere. He said he expected that worldwide tourism would grow gradually as countries recovered from the financial crisis.
 One drag on tourism in New York and other American cities could be a strengthening of the dollar, which would weaken the buying power of visitors' currencies, Mr. Goodger said. 
 The dollar is ''weak by a lot of standards but not as weak as it was in 2008,'' he said. His company's forecast assumes that the dollar will ''strengthen slowly'' but not return to its recent peak value in 2002, he said.
 Still, Mr. Goodger added, while the goal of 50 million is still attainable by the end of 2012, the setback in 2009 ''pushed it out a bit further.''

HEADLINE: Even in G.O.P., Lazio's Bid for Governor Is a Hard Sell

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

DATELINE: CANANDAIGUA, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Rick A. Lazio is on a tear: ripping into corruption and cowardice in Albany, blasting state leaders' addiction to spending and taxes, warning that New York is on the verge of losing a generation of job seekers to economic decline.
 ''It breaks my heart,'' Mr. Lazio, the former Long Island congressman, tells a few dozen Republicans here in the Finger Lakes. ''People are fed up, they're disgusted, they're disillusioned, and they're scared.''
 Now comes the ask. ''It is our turn to fix this mess, and not to leave this for our kids and our grandchildren to clean up. Please join me in this great mission.''
 Not a hand claps. 
 Political comebacks can be tough, and Mr. Lazio's exit from the stage, after his disastrous 2000 Senate contest with Hillary Rodham Clinton, was humbling. But even among New York Republicans, with whom he is personally popular, Mr. Lazio's fiery pitch for his gubernatorial campaign hasn't yet ignited any prairie fires.
 Many party regulars were deflated by former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's decision not to run. And they seem resigned to the idea that Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo -- whose poll numbers are formidable -- will overtake Gov. David A. Paterson to be the Democratic nominee, and could be all but impossible to beat. 
 After listening to Mr. Lazio's speech, Matt Kellogg, a law student, offers this assessment: ''If he runs against Paterson, he's got a good shot.''
 ''He has a lot of what it would take,'' says Gary Baxter, the Ontario County treasurer. ''I admire him for taking on a challenge.''
 Mr. Lazio, 51, whose hair is grayer and shaggier since his Senate run, is undeterred. Asked after a long day on the trail why he had not chosen to challenge Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand instead of running for governor, he bristled. ''Maybe it would be an easier race,'' he said. ''But it's not about me,'' he added sharply. ''I'm not looking for a job. I don't need this -- and I definitely don't need that.''
 Indeed, Mr. Lazio did quite well as a Wall Street lobbyist, first for the Financial Services Forum, a trade group for chief executives that paid him more than $900,000 in 2004, according to its tax filings, then for JPMorgan Chase. He left Long Island behind, moving with his family to Manhattan, and rebuffed entreaties to run for Nassau County executive in 2001, for his old congressional seat in 2002, for Suffolk County executive in 2003 and for attorney general in 2006.
 But then, he said, he watched Gov. David A. Paterson fail to rein in state spending last year, and began to think about challenging him. Later, while driving his oldest daughter, Molly, to visit colleges, he began brooding over whether she might one day feel forced to leave New York in search of a job.
 ''I figured, if I'm thinking about that for my child, imagine the hundreds of thousands of other New Yorkers who are going through the same thing,'' he said. ''There's a lot of politicians who wring their hands and say, 'I'm going to wait for the right opening,' '' he added. ''I only thought: this state is in desperate need of a debate, and we are in real trouble. And it's not self-correcting.'' (The December night he visited Canandaigua, his daughter won early admission to Hamilton College, in Clinton, N.Y.)
 If Mr. Lazio is remembered for anything in the 2000 race, which he entered after Mr. Giuliani's late withdrawal, it is for walking across the stage during a debate and asking Mrs. Clinton to sign a no-soft-money pledge; the ill-advised stunt made him look like a bully. Intent on attacking her as a carpetbagger who saw the job as a springboard, he never told his own story and looked inexperienced next to his opponent, then the first lady.
 Now, with more time to hone his message -- and with help from Arthur J. Finkelstein, political guru to his Republican forebears Alfonse M. D'Amato and George E. Pataki -- Mr. Lazio assures voters of his record as a village attorney, prosecutor, county legislator and four-term congressman. He tells of his stint at ''probably the best-managed bank in the world,'' where he learned from people ''with a different level of intellect'' who did not care what party anyone belonged to.
 He says he will govern without concern about being re-elected and with a discipline Albany is unaccustomed to: a strict hiring freeze, a hard property-tax cap, conservative budgeting, no more passing on the cost of state-mandated programs to local governments and structural reforms like a unicameral Legislature, an ethics overhaul and tighter campaign-finance rules.
 ''I know what this turnaround looks like: It is ugly,'' Mr. Lazio says, imagining his first draconian budget and labor negotiations. ''When I do what I need to do, we're going to see name-calling and picketing and commercials, and stuff that's really tough to see. And I get that, and I accept it, and I approach this job knowing that this is part of the deal. But I just want to get this state in a place where my successor has a better chance than we have right now.'' 
 Yet Mr. Lazio's tough talk has its limitations. Meeting with a group of business leaders in Buffalo, he deflected, four times, when they asked if he would lay off state workers to close state budget gaps, which are expected to be in the billions. He barely promised to cut jobs through attrition, instead saying there could be savings in streamlined contracting.
 His audience grew frustrated. ''Don't tell me we're going to improve purchasing,'' said Kevin Murphy, the regional president of Bank of America, after Mr. Lazio had departed. ''It's almost an insult to the people in the room. I think in this environment, people are beyond being sugarcoated. There's an opportunity for someone who wants to be bold.''
 Mr. Lazio's advisers say there is plenty of time for boldness; first he must capture the nomination. A potential Republican rival, the Erie County executive, Chris Collins, produced a letter last week from 15 Republican county chairmen urging him to run. 
 But with Mr. Giuliani out of the picture, Mr. Lazio is making the most of his head start. He already has the endorsements of nine county leaders representing more than 25 percent of the state, enough to secure a spot on the ballot. And he expects more, including big counties in the New York City suburbs, by early January.
 Oddly, but understandably, Mr. Lazio finds himself defending the governor he wants to defeat, while hectoring the attorney general at every opportunity. 
 ''There's competency issues,'' he says of Mr. Paterson, ''but I don't doubt that he's trying to move things in the right direction. But Andrew Cuomo is not stepping forward, he's not providing leadership, and he could. It's almost as if people around him think the worse things get, the more things collapse, the better off it's going to be for him politically.''
 Beyond the primary, Mr. Lazio's strategy, it seems, is to be there and hope for a break. If Mr. Paterson somehow wins the nomination or Mr. Cuomo survives a bloody primary -- and a possible run by Steve Levy, the Suffolk County executive, could make a Democratic free-for-all more likely -- he will count his blessings. But if the way is cleared for Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Lazio may be seen as heading into a gun battle with a slingshot.
 Then again, he reminds skeptics that Republican underdogs in Nassau and Westchester, vastly outspent, upset formidable Democratic incumbents in November.
 ''We have the wind at our back,'' Mr. Lazio said in Canandaigua. ''It is the people's voices back there, saying, 'We have had enough.' ''

HEADLINE: Cold and Signs of Stronger Economy Drive Oil Above $81

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
A combination of frigid weather, expectations of an improving economy and new tensions between Russia and Belarus catapulted crude oil prices above $81 a barrel on Monday to the highest close in nearly 15 months. 
 Energy markets are beginning the year with a number of economic signs that could help push prices higher still. Traders viewed reports of increased manufacturing activity and passenger car sales in December as indications that the economy was on the mend. Meanwhile, India reported a substantial increase in oil imports.
 The eighth consecutive trading session of rising prices was also attributed to nervousness over reports that Russia might charge higher prices and raise export taxes on oil sent to Belarus for refining for European markets. And heating oil futures rose to the highest level in more than a year as cold weather was reported across much of Europe, China and the United States. 
 Gasoline prices, which had been falling until recently, have reversed course to jump 6 cents in the last week. And with American stockpiles of crude oil sliding by 19.5 million barrels in the last month, higher prices at the pump could be coming in the weeks ahead.
 Still, most energy analysts said it was too soon to predict that crude and gasoline prices would go substantially higher. They pointed out that oil prices had been see-sawing within a relatively narrow range from $70 to just above $80 a barrel since the end of July. Oil prices closed above $81 on Nov. 4, before dropping again to as low as $70 a month ago.
 On Monday, oil for February delivery climbed about 3 percent to $81.51 a barrel, the highest settlement price since Oct. 9, 2008. 
 Oil prices have gradually revived since mid-December, followed by gasoline prices in recent days. The national average for a gallon of regular gasoline was $2.66 on Monday, a dollar above the price at the beginning of 2009, when the economy appeared to be in a tailspin. 
 The jittery price of oil reflects conflicting trends. Economic performance is still weak and supplies are plentiful on the world market, with manufacturing activity and driving still at relatively low levels in many industrialized countries. 
 ''We've tried now three times to hold above $80 since October, and we have failed each time, largely because supplies remain so strong and demand remains fairly weak,'' said Addison A. Armstrong, senior director of market research at Tradition Energy, an energy broker in Stamford, Conn. 
 But at the same time, expectations of a stronger economy have encouraged investors to pour money into commodities, in anticipation of higher demand and as a hedge against inflation.
 ''It's a little bit of a sugar rush from all the money that comes into commodities at the beginning of every year,'' said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service. ''By next week we'll know whether this is another typical false start, or whether it's relevant and related to supply and demand.'' 
 Mr. Kloza predicted that the average price for regular gasoline would rise above $2.70 in coming days, higher than at any time in 2009. But he said that after peaking around $2.75, prices would drift lower as driving declined in the dead of winter. He said he expected a spring rally to $3 a gallon or higher. ''The question I have is, will those prices stick around for awhile?''
 Some experts say a rising gasoline price could slow the economic recovery. As gasoline prices move toward $3 a gallon, Mr. Armstrong said, ''consumers don't take that extra trip shopping or to a restaurant, and the U.S. consumer is still responsible for two-thirds of the economy in this country.'' 
 Expectations among experts on oil prices for the coming year range widely, in part because no one can be sure how strong the economic recovery will be or what impact a potential crisis like an Israeli bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities would have on oil markets.
 In October, many energy experts predicted that the move to $80 would continue and that oil would break $100 by early 2010. Then when the price fell to $70 a month or so ago, few experts predicted the quick rebound that ensued.
 Many now say the best bet is for continued volatility.
 Adam E. Sieminski, chief energy economist for Deutsche Bank, said he expected an average price of $65 in 2010, although he would not discount the possibility of a ''big spike in the event of a big geopolitical event.''
 ''By the middle of the year we need the delivery of good news and not merely the expectation of good news about the economy'' to support prices, he said. ''It's going to take a year or more before you change things enough to actually reduce the overhang of inventories and OPEC spare capacity.''

HEADLINE: C.I.A. Revives Data Sharing on Environment

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
The nation's top scientists and spies are collaborating on an effort to use the federal government's intelligence assets -- including spy satellites and other classified sensors -- to assess the hidden complexities of environmental change. They seek insights from natural phenomena like clouds and glaciers, deserts and tropical forests.
 The collaboration restarts an effort the Bush administration shut down and has the strong backing of the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. In the last year, as part of the effort, the collaborators have scrutinized images of Arctic sea ice from reconnaissance satellites in an effort to distinguish things like summer melts from climate trends, and they have had images of the ice pack declassified to speed the scientific analysis. 
 The trove of images is ''really useful,'' said Norbert Untersteiner, a professor at the University of Washington who specializes in polar ice and is a member of the team of spies and scientists behind the effort. 
 Scientists, Dr. Untersteiner said, ''have no way to send out 500 people'' across the top of the world to match the intelligence gains, adding that the new understandings might one day result in ice forecasts.
 ''That will be very important economically and logistically,'' Dr. Untersteiner said, arguing that Arctic thaws will open new fisheries and sea lanes for shipping and spur the hunt for undersea oil and gas worth hundreds of billions of dollars.
 The monitoring program has little or no impact on regular intelligence gathering, federal officials said, but instead releases secret information already collected or takes advantage of opportunities to record environmental data when classified sensors are otherwise idle or passing over wilderness.
 Secrecy cloaks the monitoring effort, as well as the nation's intelligence work, because the United States wants to keep foes and potential enemies in the dark about the abilities of its spy satellites and other sensors. The images that the scientific group has had declassified, for instance, have had their sharpness reduced to hide the abilities of the reconnaissance satellites.
 Controversy has often dogged the use of federal intelligence gear for environmental monitoring. In October, days after the C.I.A. opened a small unit to assess the security implications of climate change, Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, said the agency should be fighting terrorists, ''not spying on sea lions.''
 Now, with the intelligence world under fire after the attempted airliner bombing on Christmas Day, and with the monitoring program becoming more widely known, such criticism seems likely to grow.
 A senior federal official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, defended the scientific monitoring as exploiting the intelligence field quite adroitly.
 Ralph J. Cicerone, president of the National Academy of Sciences and a member of the monitoring team, said the program was ''basically free.''
 ''People who don't know details are the ones who are complaining,'' Dr. Cicerone said.
 About 60 scientists -- mainly from academia but including some from industry and federal agencies -- run the effort's scientific side. All have secret clearances. They obtain guidance from the National Academy of Sciences, an elite body that advises the federal government.
 Dr. Cicerone said the monitoring effort offered an opportunity to gather environmental data that would otherwise be impossible to obtain, and to do so with the kind of regularity that can reveal the dynamics of environmental change.
 ''It's probably silly to think it will last 50 years,'' he said of the program in an interview. ''On the other hand, there's the potential for these collections to go on for a long time.''
 The C.I.A. runs the program and arranges for the scientists to draw on federal surveillance equipment, including highly classified satellites of the National Reconnaissance Office.
 Officials said the effort to restart the program originated on Capitol Hill in 2008 after former Vice President Al Gore argued for its importance with Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who was then a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee; she became its chairwoman in early 2009.
 The Obama administration has said little about the effort publicly but has backed it internally, officials said. In November, the scientists met with Leon E. Panetta, the C.I.A. director.
 ''Director Panetta believes it is crucial to examine the potential national security implications of phenomena such as desertification, rising sea levels and population shifts,'' Paula Weiss, an agency spokeswoman, said.
 The program resurrects a scientific group that from 1992 to 2001 advised the federal government on environmental surveillance. Known as Medea, for Measurements of Earth Data for Environmental Analysis, the group sought to discover if intelligence archives and assets could shed light on issues of environmental stewardship.
 It is unclear why Medea died in the early days of the Bush administration, but President George W. Bush developed a reputation for opposing many kinds of environmental initiatives. Officials said the new body was taking on the same mandate and activities, as well as the name. 
 ''I'm extremely pleased with what's been happening,'' said Michael B. McElroy, an atmospheric scientist at Harvard University and a senior member of the group. ''It's really first-rate.''
 Among the program's first responsibilities has been to assess earlier Medea projects to see which, if any, produced valuable information and might be restarted or expanded.
 Dr. Untersteiner of the University of Washington said that in June the government posted some imagery results from that assessment on the Web sites of the United States Geological Survey in an area known as the Global Fiducials Library, which advertises itself as an archive of intelligence images from scientifically important sites.
 Among other things, the online library displays years of ice imagery from six sites inside the Arctic Circle, including the Fram Strait, the main route for icebergs moving from the Arctic basin into the North Atlantic.
 Scientists consider the Arctic highly sensitive to global warming and are particularly interested in closely monitoring its changes as possible harbingers.
 In July, the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences released a report that praised the monitoring.
 ''There are no other data available that show the melting and freezing processes,'' the report said. ''Their release will have a major impact on understanding effects of climate change.''
 Dr. Untersteiner said the federal government had already adopted one of the report's recommendations -- have reconnaissance satellites follow particular ice floes as they drift through the Arctic basin rather than just monitoring static sites.
 For this summer, Dr. Untersteiner said he had asked that the intelligence agencies start the process sooner, ''so we still see the snow cover, maybe in early May.''
 Such research, Dr. Untersteiner said, promised to promote understanding of the fundamental forces at work in global climate change, including the endless whorls and gyres of polar ice.
 ''We still have a problem with ice mechanics,'' he said. ''But the dynamics are very revealing.''

HEADLINE: Divergent Views Of Signs of Life In the Economy

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

 BODY:
Signs of revival on the factory floor emerged in the United States and Asia on Monday, fueling exultant buying on Wall Street and reinforcing a sense that genuine economic recovery was unfolding.
 But if the Great Recession has indeed relaxed its grip on American life, it has been replaced by something that might be called the Great Ambiguity -- a time of considerable debate over the clarity of economic indicators and the staying power of apparent improvements.
 Manufacturing expanded in the United States in December, the fifth straight month of gains, amplifying hopes that a job market hobbled by double-digit unemployment might finally be adding paychecks. New jobless claims slipped markedly last week. Some economists think data to be released on Friday will show the economy gained jobs in December, the first monthly net increase in two years.
 ''We're really coming back,'' said Allen Sinai, chief global economist at the research firm Decision Economics. ''The expansion is picking up the pace.'' 
 Investors pushed up stock prices, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 156 points, or 1.5 percent, and oil prices reaching a 14-month high, $81.51 a barrel. [Pages B1 and B8.] 
 But many economists remain worried that momentum could soon weaken, with the economy sliding back into glum times. 
 Indeed, the only area in which economists can reliably declare expansion is in the supply of competing narratives about the economy -- perhaps to be expected in any transition between downturn and the inevitable turn for better.
 ''That is always the nature of the boomlet after recession,'' Mr. Sinai said. ''People think it's going to fade away.'' 
 Much of the improvement in manufacturing -- a small slice of the American economy -- is the result of businesses rebuilding inventories after slashing them. The economy has also been stoked by $787 billion in federal spending aimed at stimulating growth, a force that will be largely exhausted by the middle of the year.
 Those skeptical of lasting recovery assert that, once businesses have rebuilt inventories and federal largess runs dry, the economy will confront the same assortment of ills plaguing it for two years. 
 Namely, Americans are saturated in debt and nervous about job prospects, prompting many to hunker down in a mode of thrift; businesses still spooked by dysfunction in the financial system are reluctant to hire more workers until recovery proves real; and a cataclysmic drop in home prices has diminished spending power in millions of households, with another decline possible as foreclosed properties surge onto the market.
 ''You come back to the unfortunate reality that the underlying problems are still very much there,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at the market research firm MFR Inc. ''It's going to be a long grind.''
 Few economists expect a double-dip recession, in which the economy begins to expand only to contract again, but many fear a protracted period of stagnant growth that could last several years, much like Japan's Lost Decade in the 1990s following the calamitous end to an era of excessive real estate speculation. 
 Indeed, some liken signs of improvement in the American economy to events in Japan, where victory was often prematurely declared.
 ''Japan had lots of upswings,'' said Stephen King, global chief economist at the banking conglomerate HSBC in London. 
 Mr. King foresees a long period of adjustment to slower rates of economic growth in the United States. 
 The American economy expanded at a roughly 3 percent annual pace through most of the 1980s and 1990s, then dipped to about 2.5 percent from 2003 to 2007, and most of the gains stemmed from the disastrous investment bubble in real estate.
 ''What are you left with in terms of underlying growth?'' he asked. ''The answer is, not very much.''
 But economists of a more optimistic type assert that such views fail to account for what has been happening in recent months. Areas of the economy that went into deep freeze have revived and must grow just to replenish their inventories.
 Exhibit A in this narrative is the widely watched index of manufacturing activity produced by the Institute for Supply Management, which reported on Monday increasingly robust orders and production at American factories in December. 
 The purchasing manager's index rose to 55.9, its highest level since April 2006, back in the days before subprime entered the American lexicon and before economists began to fret about a potential replay of the Great Depression.Hopes for a lasting recovery were also bolstered by news from China, where data released Monday showed its economy expanded in December at a faster clip than at any time since the beginning of the global downturn. Similar data amplified evidence of recovery in South Korea, India and Taiwan.
 ''Strong growth in Asia reverberates around the world and helps U.S. exports,'' Mr. Sinai said.
 The worldwide factory revival is no momentary event, argues Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at the research and trading firm ITG, but rather the return to everyday business after an overreaction to the terror that gripped financial markets in the fall of 2008.
 During the panic, companies cut too many workers and pared back too much inventory in a frantic bid to limit costs, Mr. Barbera argues.
 ''You're having a global reversal of inventories and trade, and I don't think that's ephemeral,'' he said. ''If it was important on the way down, why shouldn't it be important on the way back up?''
 Mr. Barbera anticipates the economy will add some 2.5 million new jobs this year -- far less than the roughly 7 million net jobs that have been lost over the last two years, according to the Labor Department, but still a considerable improvement.
 As people spend paychecks at other businesses, they create jobs for more people, spreading the improvement in national fortunes. This prospect captured attention on Wall Street on Monday. As investors absorbed evidence of factory expansion, they saw signs of more cash registers ringing up sales, more insurance agents writing new policies, more trucks carrying more product and more transactions brokered by banks.
 But whether growth in manufacturing indeed spells new jobs throughout the economy remains a question. Mr. Shapiro, the MFR economist, argues that companies have become permanently lean, mastering the art of producing more with fewer people -- a trend with staying power.
 A government report on Monday, for instance, showed a slump in construction spending, which fell a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent in November to its lowest levels in six years.
 Stock markets may be reflecting the exuberance of improved news headlines more than fundamentals, say analysts, and some buyers may be jumping in out of fear of missing the next fiesta. 
 ''Typically, what happens with individual investors is they just chase the market,'' Mr. Shapiro said. ''There's an element of that for sure.''
 But while pundits are prone to dismiss the stock market as a kind of indecisive judge at a beauty pageant, its movements have substantial impact on wealth and confidence. These, in turn, shape spending and employment.
 In this context, the stock market may prove to be the wild card whose resilience cements a still nascent recovery.
 ''It's part of a process by which households that were devastated are now improving their balance sheets,'' Mr. Sinai said. ''Their net worth is going up, and some of those households are going to spend.''

HEADLINE: An Uneasy Feeling

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
I'm starting the new year with the sinking feeling that important opportunities are slipping from the nation's grasp. Our collective consciousness tends to obsess indiscriminately over one or two issues -- the would-be bomber on the flight into Detroit, the Tiger Woods saga -- while enormous problems that should be engaged get short shrift.
 Staggering numbers of Americans are still unemployed and nearly a quarter of all homeowners owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. Forget the false hope of modestly improving monthly job numbers. The real story right now is the entrenched suffering (with no end in sight) that has been inflicted on scores of millions of working Americans by the Great Recession and the misguided economic policies that preceded it. 
 As The Washington Post reported over the weekend, the entire past decade ''was the worst for the U.S. economy in modern times.'' There was no net job creation -- none -- between December 1999 and now. None! 
 The Post article read like a lament, a longing for the U.S. as we'd once known it: ''No previous decade going back to the 1940s had job growth of less than 20 percent.''
 Middle-class families in 2008 actually earned less, adjusted for inflation, than they did in 1999. The data for 2009 are not yet in, but you can just imagine what happened to those families in that nightmarish downturn. Small children over the holidays were asking Santa Claus to bring mommy or daddy a job.
 One in eight Americans, and one in four children, are on food stamps. Some six million Americans, according to an article in The Times on Sunday, have said that food stamps were their only income.
 This is a society in deep, deep trouble and the fixes currently in the works are in no way adequate to the enormous challenges we're facing. For example, an end to the mantra of monthly job losses would undoubtedly be welcomed. But even if the economy manages to create a few hundred thousand new jobs a month, it would do little to haul us from the unemployment pit dug for us by the Great Recession. We need to create more than 10 million new jobs just to get us back to where we were when the recession began in December 2007.
 What's needed are big new innovative efforts to fashion an economy that creates jobs for all who want and need to work. Just getting us back in fits and starts over the next few years to where we were when the recession began should not be acceptable to anyone. We should be moving now to invest aggressively in a new, greener economy, leading the world in the development of alternative fuels, advanced transportation networks and the effort to restrain the poisoning of the planet. We should be developing an industrial policy that emphasizes the need for America to regain its manufacturing mojo, as tough as that might seem, and we need to rebuild our infrastructure.
 We're not smart as a nation. We don't learn from the past, and we don't plan for the future. We've spent a year turning ourselves inside out with arguments of every sort over health care reform only to come up with a bloated, Rube Goldberg legislative mess that protects the insurance and drug industries and does not rein in runaway health care costs.
 The politicians will be back soon, trust me, screaming about the need to rein in health costs.
 We keep talking about how essential it is to radically improve public education while, at the same time, we're closing libraries and firing teachers by the tens of thousands for economic reasons. 
 The fault lies everywhere. The president, the Congress, the news media and the public are all to blame. Shared sacrifice is not part of anyone's program. Politicians can't seem to tell the difference between wasteful spending and investments in a more sustainable future. Any talk of raising taxes is considered blasphemous, but there is a constant din of empty yapping about controlling budget deficits.
 Oh, yes, and we're fighting two wars. 
 If America can't change, then the current state of decline is bound to continue. You can't have a healthy economy with so many millions of people out of work, and there is no plan now that would result in the creation of millions of new jobs any time soon. 
 Voters were primed at the beginning of the Obama administration for fundamental changes that would have altered the trajectory of American life for the better. Politicians of all stripes, many of them catering to the nation's moneyed interests, fouled that up to a fare-thee-well.
 Now we're escalating in Afghanistan, falling back into panic mode over an attempted act of terror and squandering a golden opportunity to build a better society.

HEADLINE: True Economic Barometer? How About Bowling

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
As New York struggles to resurrect its economy, it needs powerful new engines of growth. Wall Street may look sturdier, but it will never be the old Wall Street again, when $10 routinely became $1 million during your lunch break. Another eruption in real estate prices? Dubious. The new sports stadiums? Not going to get us there.
 There must be an answer.
 There is. 
 Bowling alleys.
 Been over to the Port Authority Bus Terminal for anything other than a bus? Gone to the second floor, next to Gate 230? Noticed the velvet ropes staffed by a black-suited bouncer, earpiece nuzzling his ear? 
 Why is he there? To select the appropriate customers to bowl at the overhauled Leisure Time Bowl. Yes, there is a dress code at the bowling alley.
 ''We don't allow those real large jeans that almost fall off your hips,'' said Ayman Kamel, the executive general manager there. ''Or those bandannas that represent gangs. None of those big visual gold chains.''
 How about a bowling shirt?
 ''Well, as long as it's a fine-looking shirt,'' he said. 
 By month's end, the place will be renamed Frames, and it will open a swank restaurant and V.I.P. lanes (two private lanes with bar), followed by a nightclub later in the year. The entrance will be on Ninth Avenue since the Port Authority is, well, the Port Authority. 
 Farther down the block, at 42nd and 12th Avenue, is Lucky Strike Lanes, another upscale alley that opened late in 2008 and is an offshoot of a chain that began in Hollywood. Alleys in other boroughs may follow. In Greenwich Village, there is Bowlmor Lanes, a front-runner among the contemporized alleys that was restyled under new ownership in 1997. Three months ago it opened a companion Coney Island games-and-burlesque club called Carnival. 
 In October, a 90,000-square-foot Bowlmor alley is set to open as the largest retail tenant in the former New York Times building on West 43rd Street. It will cost over $20 million. 
 In 2007, a comforter factory in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, became the Gutter bar, with a retro eight-lane alley, the first new one to open in Brooklyn in half a century. Brooklyn Bowl, a combination music club/bowling alley fashioned out of an old iron foundry, followed in Williamsburg last summer. Harlem Lanes arrived in 2006 on West 126th Street, the first bowling alley in Harlem since the Lenox Lanes vanished in the 1980s. These join the more established 300 New York alley at Chelsea Piers.
 O.K., maybe this trend isn't big enough to lift the entire city, but it's something.
 These are not the beer-belly bowling alleys of yesteryear, but souped-up, hipster alleys often interwoven with restaurants, V.I.P. lounges, clubs, sports bars. Dark lighting. D.J.'s and thundering music. Videos dancing over flat-screen televisions above the pins. Waiter service. Dress codes. Coolness. 
 The bowling is often a way to kill time between drink orders. The alleys rely heavily on corporate and private parties. Some customers never bother to bowl.
 Meanwhile, conventional alleys continue to close. In 2008, Woodhaven Lanes in Queens fell after 49 years, and Van Wyck Lanes in Richmond Hill surrendered the same year after 48. All told, there are 23 bowling alleys in the city, according to the United States Bowling Congress, the sport's governing body. Back in the 1970s, it figured there were close to 200. Throughout the country, there has been a continuing and pronounced decline in organized league bowling, though a rise in the number of people who bowl occasionally (which can mean once a year). 
 Bowlmor is owned by Strike Holdings, and at its downtown headquarters, Thomas Shannon, the chief executive, spoke about the old bowling, and the new bowling that might save New York. ''It used to be that if you wanted to go bowling, you had to suffer some form of deprivation,'' he said. ''Bad food -- you know, the hot dog on a roller. Stale tap beer. No service.''
 Bowlmor and the upscale alleys typically shun leagues. They don't want guys who show up with bowling outfits and excessive stomachs and their own equipment and want to pay $1.95 a game.
 ''They want the cheapest, most miserable experience,'' Mr. Shannon said. ''I would describe it as a Stalinist experience.''
 At Bowlmor, games are generally $11 to $13.
 Mr. Shannon showed plans for the forthcoming Times Square alley. Adorning the entrance will be Bowlmor Bob, a giant bowler in a red dinner jacket. The front desk will have a concierge. When you get bowling shoes, you can have your street shoes shined for another few dollars.
 The 50 lanes will be separated into six themed areas. The Chinatown section will feature a gong to bang when you get a strike. To select the food, Mr. Shannon said he was negotiating with a ''celebrity chef.''
 Considering all this, Mr. Shannon wonders why his industry doesn't get more credit. When was the last time the mayor singled out bowling alleys for their contribution to the economy?
 ''I don't think many people in government appreciate us,'' Mr. Shannon said. 
 Over at Bowlmor on University Place, the lanes were crammed, people blissfully saving New York's economy while dressed to impress. In a glass case near the lanes was a nice touch: autographed bowling pins. Christina Ricci. Rudolph W. Giuliani. Method Man. Monica S. Lewinsky. 
 The other evening at Leisure Time, owned by a Danish company called Big Bowl (yes, they bowl in Denmark), people were bowling but not bowling well. Scores were pathetic. 51. 17. 7.
 They sure were drinking. The signature drink is the beer tower, a tube that holds 11 pints of beer.
 Mr. Kamel, the general manager, does allow leagues, but social leagues, not league leagues. He said that with some of these social league members, they have to actually show them how to bowl.
 He pointed out the bar top for the soon-to-open restaurant. Onyx. Cost: $100,000.
 At Lucky Strike, Ron Garcia, 36, a biotech salesman, was entertaining a friend visiting from the West Coast who had last gripped a bowling ball seven years ago. Strikes were infrequent.
 How did he feel about saving New York simply by leveling bowling pins?
 ''Good,'' he said. ''It's always good to save New York.''
 It would be rude to ignore hardened bowlers. They want to bowl, too. 
 Cozy Lanes in Ozone Park, Queens, has 64 lanes. The food? Let's not go there. A V.I.P. lounge? None planned (though a White Castle sits next door).
 Leagues are always going. No rock music muffles the sweet crack of pins falling. As someone wrote in an online comment, it's not a place where you need to bring a credit card and pursue a second mortgage on your home to bowl. 
 The place has a tired feel. Scuffed linoleum. Bowlers grouse about their balls coming back with nicks and scratches.
 The other day, the A. J. Transit Early Birds league was knocking down pins, paying about $3 a game. The members did not voice much enthusiasm for the fancy alleys.
 T. C. Newsome, 72, a retired transit worker carrying a 190 average, completed a spare. Of the new alleys, he said: ''It's not bowling. It's for the younger generation that wants instant gratification. In bowling, it doesn't just come. You have to practice.'' 
 He rolled another frame, scattering eight pins. ''I'm stiff,'' he said. ''Can't get my knee started.''
 Down a few lanes was John Sutton, 68, with a 188 average.
 Can bowling save the city?
 ''Maybe that disco bowling can,'' he said. ''But it's not saving bowlers. It's not saving me.''

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Data Helps Invigorate Wall Street

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY and DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
Wall Street ushered in 2010 on Monday with its biggest stock market rally in nearly two months, as signs that manufacturing was strengthening around the world fed hopes that the economy would recover this year. 
 On the first day of trading for the year, new reports showed that manufacturing gained steam in China and Europe, and a closely watched index of the manufacturing sector in the United States hit its highest levels since April 2006. Businesses reported that production was growing as new orders streamed in, and said they were hiring more people to meet rising demand. 
 For investors, that spelled a rosy start to the year -- and one that stoked hopes of more market gains in the months ahead. Despite lingering jitters about the housing sector, the broad stock market rose more than 1.5 percent, to its highest level since the nation's financial system nearly collapsed in the autumn of 2008. 
 The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index, which paced the market's strong rally in 2009, led the way once again, jumping 39.27 points, or 1.73 percent, to 2,308.42.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 155.91 points or 1.5 percent, to 10,583.96, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 1.6 percent, or 17.89 points, to 1,132.99. 
 An increase in commodity prices lifted shares of oil and gas producers and companies that make industrial materials like plastic and chemicals. Oil futures climbed $2.15 to settle at $81.51 a barrel in New York trading on concerns about an energy dispute between Russia and its neighbor Belarus. 
 ''Our forecast has the private economy gaining enough momentum during the year to finally stand on its own by year end,'' Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist for the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, N.J., wrote in a report released Monday. ''The combination of greater consumer and business spending, along with rising exports, should keep growth firmly in positive territory throughout this year and next.''
 Many market watchers view January as a bellwether for the year, but the so-called January effect does not always hold up. January 2009 began with a stomach-churning 6 percent drop on the S.& P. 500, dashing many investors' hopes, until a blistering rally began on Wall Street and propelled the Dow some 20 percent higher for the year.
 ''A lot of investors are thinking maybe our economic recovery will end up being stronger than anticipated,'' said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's. ''Investors are like dieters, and they look to January as a new beginning.'' 
 The Nasdaq got a lift from an analyst's report that upgraded shares of Intel, which ended the day up 2.4 percent. The Nasdaq soared 44 percent last year.
 Yet it was the manufacturing data that pushed the broader market higher. Investors embraced a report from the Institute for Supply Management showing that manufacturing activity rose in December, bolstered by increases in new orders, inventories and employment. 
 The group's manufacturing index rose to 55.9 from 53.6 in November, the highest reading since April 2006.
 ''This was a complete package of good news,'' said Marc Pado, a market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. ''They're going to have to increase production more. They will need to hire people in order to meet that production. Demand is growing, not contracting.''
 Some economists warned, however, that the recovery in manufacturing could wane as businesses finish restocking their depleted inventories. 
 Yet companies that have slashed their inventories and pared their payrolls are seeing new orders, a sign that activity is perking up even as offices and factories operate at reduced levels. After so many months of contraction and stagnation, some businesses will soon feel pressure to expand, analysts said.
 And that is likely to presage more growth in the first quarter, and an eventual end to some two years of job losses.
 ''Much will depend on the consumer,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, wrote in a research note, ''and we feel that the headwinds for consumer spending (the foremost of which are ravaged balance sheets and lingering labor market weakness) remain too brisk to expect much help on this front.''
 Another report on Monday somewhat offset the upbeat manufacturing data and offered a reminder of the weakness in the housing market. A Commerce Department report showed a slump in construction spending, which fell a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent in November to its lowest levels in six years. The agency said that construction spending in November was 13.2 percent lower than November 2008. 
 Spending on home building fell 1.6 percent, accounting for much of the weakness. 
 The numbers could foreshadow more trouble for construction companies, which are struggling with tight credit and a drought of business, as interest rates begin to tick back up.
 But even before the opening bell, Monday looked to be a good day for Wall Street. European shares were buoyed by a report showing that manufacturing output in the euro zone rose in December at the fastest pace since September 2007. 
 And in China, the latest survey showed that manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest rate on record in December. The dollar was mixed against other currencies. The euro rose to $1.4412 from its previous close of $1.4326, while the British pound fell to $1.6094 from $1.6149. The yen rose to 92.60 yen from 92.34. 
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 6/32, to 96 13/32. The yield fell to 3.82 percent, from 3.83 percent on Thursday.
 Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths FABRICIUS, DR

 BODY:
FABRICIUS--Dr. Walter. Dr. Walter Fabricius, 72, on December 27, 2009, after a brief illness, surrounded by his loving family. Dear father to daughters Daniela Fabricius and Stephanie Weidenbecher, and grandfather to Lucas Weidenbecher; beloved husband of Dagmar, and brother to Bernhard and Guenther. Dr. Fabricius was the President of Fabricius and Company, a financial and investment services firm he established after a long and illustrious career that included serving as Managing Director at Deutsche Bank, J.P. Morgan, and Auda Advisor Associates. 
He earned his doctorate in Constitutional Law from the University of Mainz, Germany, following degrees in Law and Economics from the Universities of Heidelberg and Munich, Germany, and studies at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques in Paris and the Gordonstoun School in Scotland. After practicing law for several years in Mannheim and Heidelberg, Germany, Dr. Fabricius joined the offices of Deutsche Bank in Germany in 1973. His fluency in German, English, and French, coupled with his gift for cross-cultural diplomacy, were great assets to Deutsche Bank, which sent him to New York in 1976. There he became integral to the growth of Deutsche Bank's presence in the United States. While with Deutsche Bank in New York, he served as Executive Vice-President and Head of the Corporate Finance Group of Deutsche Bank Capital Corporation, before becoming Managing Director and Head of the Asset Management Products Group of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. In 1996, after more than twenty years with Deutsche Bank, he joined J.P. Morgan as Managing Director of the International Private Client Group. In 1999, he became Managing Director of Auda Advisor Associates, helping to expand the firm from a small company managing the wealth of the Harald Quandt family to a major provider of alternative investment products. He devoted himself full time to Fabricius & Company in 2007, and relished its location at the iconic Rockefeller Center. Born March 17, 1937 in Berlin, Germany, Dr. Fabricius was an heir of Carl Johann Freudenberg, who in 1849 founded Freudenberg & Co., which remains one of the largest and oldest family-owned companies in Germany. Dr. Fabricius grew up in the Freudenberg family home in Weinheim, Germany, and served on the company advisory board for two decades. He was heir also to a storied history of German arts and culture; his parents were from Munich's Herzogpark district, where his grandfather Walter Courvoisier, a Swiss composer, was a friend and neighbor of novelist Thomas Mann. Walter Courvoisier's father-in-law and mentor was Ludwig Thuille, himself a renowned composer and intimate friend of Richard Strauss. Having spent his earliest childhood in wartime Germany, Dr. Fabricius was of a generation that wished to rebuild the reputation of their country and promote strong international relationships. He often spoke of this and lived by example, working in both official and personal ways to strengthen ties between his birth nation and his country of residence. Dr. Fabricius is remembered as a natural diplomat, a trusted advisor, and a generous friend; a frequent trans-Atlantic traveler, his suitcase was always heavy with gifts for lifelong clients and loved ones. He was known for his elegance of manner and style, and brought to his work and life old-world discretion and charm. He possessed a boundless, youthful energy, and was an innovator in developing modern financial tools such as the industrial revenue bond. He was a consummate networker with a wide and impressive array of clients whom he treated with familial warmth, who in turn trusted his prudence, experience, and intelligence. To his daughters he was a source of unconditional love and support, of patience and wisdom, a model of integrity, a teacher and storyteller, a proud father who openly adored his girls. To his wife he was simply everything a prince, a partner, and the love of her life. Dr. Fabricius was a mentor to many, and touched many lives with his boundless willingness to lend an ear or offer help. He treated all who crossed his path with equal dignity and respect. Dr. Fabricius had an extraordinary ear for music and language, and loved to play the piano for his daughters or show off his talent for making puns and imitating dialects. He was a passionate and knowledgeable listener of jazz and classical music, and an experienced connoisseur of wine and cuisine. He also took great pleasure in making and editing home movies using the latest available technologies. Weekends were spent tending the garden at the family's house in East Hampton, where he also played handyman. Dr. Fabricius was beloved, trusted, and admired by a wide circle of family, friends, and colleagues, among whom he famously never forgot a birthday. He left us too suddenly and all too soon, but leaves behind a legacy to aspire to.

HEADLINE: Credit Suisse Is Accused of Defrauding Investors in 4 Resorts

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS

DATELINE: HELENA, Mont. 

 BODY:
Investors at four high-end resorts have filed a class-action lawsuit against Credit Suisse and the real estate services company Cushman & Wakefield, contending that they conspired to inflate the value of the properties so they could take them over.
 The suit, outlined in an 84-page complaint filed Sunday in federal court in Boise, Idaho, details what it calls a sweeping loan-to-own scheme. Credit Suisse, according to the complaint, raked in huge fees on loans against the properties, which it syndicated and sold to hedge fund managers. If the resorts could not pay back the hundreds of millions of dollars in loans, based on the inflated values, Credit Suisse could either assume ownership as the agent for the creditors or sell the resorts. 
 The properties include the Yellowstone Club at Big Sky, Mont., which has multimillion-dollar ''ski-in-ski-out'' homes and private slopes. Its members include Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman; the golfer Annika Sorenstam; former Vice President Dan Quayle; and Peter Chernin, former president and chief operating officer of the News Corporation.
 In addition, developers and property owners at Lake Las Vegas in southern Nevada, the Tamarack Resort in central Idaho and Ginn sur Mer in the Bahamas are also party to the lawsuit.
 The suit was brought on behalf of at least 3,000 investors by L. J. Gibson, who owns property at three of the resorts, and Beau Blixseth, the son and business partner of Timothy L. Blixseth, the developer who bought land near Yellowstone Park and developed the famous club. The involvement of 4,000 to 5,000 more litigants at 10 other resorts, including the Promontory Club in Utah, is pending. 
 A Credit Suisse spokesman, Duncan King, said, ''We believe the suit to be without merit, and we will defend ourselves vigorously.'' 
 Dwayne Doherty, a spokesman for Cushman & Wakefield, which provided appraisals of the property, echoed that statement. ''The allegations are completely without merit, and we will defend ourselves vigorously,'' he said.
 The lead lawyer in the suit, Michael J. Flynn, of Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., said he could not comment until the judge allowed the class action to proceed.
 The suit accuses the defendants of engaging in a sweeping conspiracy that focused on the developers of the resorts. Specifically, the complaint accuses Credit Suisse and Cushman & Wakefield of racketeering, breach of fiduciary duty, mail and wire fraud, money laundering and negligence. The suit describes Credit Suisse as an ''international banking predator.'' 
 In the complaint, the plaintiffs' lawyers contend that Credit Suisse and Cushman & Wakefield conspired by setting up a Cayman Islands branch to circumvent federal law on real estate appraisals. The complaint also alleges that they inflated the value of the resorts and made millions of dollars in fees on loans against the properties. Credit Suisse knew the resorts would most likely default under the weight of inflated values, which would allow the bank to take ownership as agent on behalf of the creditors, the suit contends. 
 The Yellowstone Club borrowed $375 million from Credit Suisse in 2005. After the economy began to falter, Edra Blixseth, who won control of the property in a divorce from her husband, Timothy, was forced to declare bankruptcy in 2008. The property was sold to CrossHarbor Capital Partners in 2009 for $115 million, about a quarter of the estimated value of the club at the peak of the market, though Credit Suisse retained the right to collect the loan after it was sold. 
 In May, in the Blixseth bankruptcy case, Judge Ralph B. Kirscher of Federal Bankruptcy Court in Butte, Mont., wrote: ''The naked greed in this case, combined with Credit Suisse's complete disregard'' for the developer and others, ''shocks the conscience of this court.''
 ''While Credit Suisse's new loan product resulted in enormous fees to Credit Suisse in 2005, it resulted in financial ruin for several residential resort communities,'' he wrote. ''Credit Suisse lined its pockets on the backs of the unsecured creditors.'' The statement was written in a judge's order that has since been vacated as part of a settlement agreement.
 The complaint also contends that the money to finance loans came from a separate case in which Credit Suisse helped Iranian banks avoid United States sanctions by hiding profits. Credit Suisse paid the government $536 million in December to settle that case.
 The suit seeks $8 billion in damages, which it says should be tripled as allowed under federal racketeering statutes.
 The decline at many posh Western resorts has been stunning. Values have dropped precipitously, projects are unfinished and investor interest has waned. At the Tamarack Resort, 90 miles north of Boise, the tennis star Andre Agassi has abandoned plans to build a five-star hotel, unfinished buildings have been mothballed and Bank of America is asking a court to allow it to repossess the resort's ski lifts. Homeowners who bought property and built homes are fuming. 
 In November, the new owners of the Yellowstone Club liquidated 13 tractor-trailer loads of antique furniture bought by the Blixseths, including a two-seat black walnut throne from a castle in Bavaria that Timothy Blixseth once planned to place in his 53,000-square-foot home. That home was never built.

HEADLINE: The Tea Party Teens

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
The United States opens this decade in a sour mood. First, Americans are anxious about the future. Sixty-one percent of Americans believe the country is in decline, according to the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey. Only 27 percent feel confident that their children's generation will be better off than they are.
 Second, Americans have lost faith in their institutions. During the great moments of social reform, at least 60 percent of Americans trusted government to do the right thing most of the time. Now, only a quarter have that kind of trust. 
 The country is evenly divided about President Obama, but state governments are in disrepute and confidence in Congress is at withering lows. As Frank Newport of the Gallup organization noted in his year-end wrap-up, ''Americans have less faith in their elected representatives than ever before.''
 Third, the new administration has not galvanized a popular majority. In almost every sphere of public opinion, Americans are moving away from the administration, not toward it. The Ipsos/McClatchy organizations have been asking voters which party can do the best job of handling a range of 13 different issues. During the first year of the Obama administration, the Republicans gained ground on all 13.
 The public is not only shifting from left to right. Every single idea associated with the educated class has grown more unpopular over the past year.
 The educated class believes in global warming, so public skepticism about global warming is on the rise. The educated class supports abortion rights, so public opinion is shifting against them. The educated class supports gun control, so opposition to gun control is mounting.
 The story is the same in foreign affairs. The educated class is internationalist, so isolationist sentiment is now at an all-time high, according to a Pew Research Center survey. The educated class believes in multilateral action, so the number of Americans who believe we should ''go our own way'' has risen sharply.
 A year ago, the Obama supporters were the passionate ones. Now the tea party brigades have all the intensity.
 The tea party movement is a large, fractious confederation of Americans who are defined by what they are against. They are against the concentrated power of the educated class. They believe big government, big business, big media and the affluent professionals are merging to form self-serving oligarchy -- with bloated government, unsustainable deficits, high taxes and intrusive regulation.
 The tea party movement is mostly famous for its flamboyant fringe. But it is now more popular than either major party. According to the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 41 percent of Americans have a positive view of the tea party movement. Only 35 percent of Americans have a positive view of the Democrats and only 28 percent have a positive view of the Republican Party.
 The movement is especially popular among independents. The Rasmussen organization asked independent voters whom they would support in a generic election between a Democrat, a Republican and a tea party candidate. The tea party candidate won, with 33 percent of independents. Undecided came in second with 30 percent. The Democrats came in third with 25 percent and the Republicans fourth with 12 percent.
 Over the course of this year, the tea party movement will probably be transformed. Right now, it is an amateurish movement with mediocre leadership. But several bright and polished politicians, like Marco Rubio of Florida and Gary Johnson of New Mexico, are unofficially competing to become its de facto leader. If they succeed, their movement is likely to outgrow its crude beginnings and become a major force in American politics. After all, it represents arguments that are deeply rooted in American history.
 The Obama administration is premised on the conviction that pragmatic federal leaders with professional expertise should have the power to implement programs to solve the country's problems. Many Americans do not have faith in that sort of centralized expertise or in the political class generally.
 Moreover, the tea party movement has passion. Think back on the recent decades of American history -- the way the hippies defined the 1960s; the feminists, the 1970s; the Christian conservatives, the 1980s. American history is often driven by passionate outsiders who force themselves into the center of American life.
 In the near term, the tea party tendency will dominate the Republican Party. It could be the ruin of the party, pulling it in an angry direction that suburban voters will not tolerate. But don't underestimate the deep reservoirs of public disgust. If there is a double-dip recession, a long period of stagnation, a fiscal crisis, a terrorist attack or some other major scandal or event, the country could demand total change, creating a vacuum that only the tea party movement and its inheritors would be in a position to fill.
 Personally, I'm not a fan of this movement. But I can certainly see its potential to shape the coming decade.

HEADLINE: Inside Obama's War on Terrorism

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER. 
Peter Baker is a White House correspondent for The Times and a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
The evening before he was sworn into office, Barack Obama stepped out of Blair House, the government residence where he was staying across from the White House, and climbed into an armored limousine for the ride to a bipartisan dinner. Joining him in the back seat were John Brennan, his new counterterrorism adviser, and two foreign-policy advisers, Denis McDonough and Mark Lippert. The three men with the president-elect were out of breath, having rushed more than a mile from transition headquarters on foot after failing to find a taxi in Washington's preinaugural madness. As the motorcade moved out, they updated Obama on gathering evidence of a major terrorist plot to attack his inauguration. After a weekend of round-the-clock analysis, the nation's intelligence agencies were concerned that the threat was real, the men told him. A group of Somali extremists was reported to be coming across the border from Canada to detonate explosives as the new president took the oath of office. With more than a million onlookers viewing the ceremony from the National Mall and hundreds of millions more watching on television around the world, what could be a more devastating target? 
 ''All the data points suggested there was a real threat evolving quickly that had an overseas component,'' Juan Carlos Zarate, President George W. Bush's deputy national security adviser for combating terrorism, told me in November. As the inauguration approached, signs of a plot ''seemed to be growing in credibility and relevance.'' Another senior Bush official involved in those tense events a year ago said last fall that protecting the new president was not enough. Even a failed attack would send a debilitating message to the world. ''If something happens on the podium and there's chaos,'' this official told me, ''that's the first time you see the new president, and you really don't want that.''
 The threat seemed to weigh on Obama. He canceled a practice session to go over his inaugural address with aides at Blair House. David Axelrod, his senior adviser, later interpreted that as a sign that Obama was thinking about the suspected plot. ''He seemed more subdued than he had been,'' Axelrod told me not long ago. Obama had not yet taken office, and he was already being confronted with the threat that consumed his predecessor's presidency. No matter how much he thought about terrorism as a senator or as a presidential candidate, it was another thing to face it as the person responsible for the nation's security -- and quite another thing again to know the threat was aimed directly at himself, his wife and their two daughters. ''It's not as if you don't know what you're getting into,'' Axelrod said. ''But when the reality comes and the baton is being passed and you're now dealing with real terrorism threats, it's a very sobering moment.''
 There was little Obama could do but ask questions and rely on the people who had been fighting this fight for years. His advisers worked side by side with the outgoing administration. The two teams gathered in the Situation Room of the White House shortly before the inauguration to sift through what was known and to hash out what should be done about it. The final iteration of Bush's team sat across the table from the brain trust of Obama's administration -- Condoleezza Rice, Stephen Hadley and their colleagues on one side, Hillary Rodham Clinton, James Jones and their colleagues on the other. 
 Clinton immediately put her finger on the problem. According to participants, she asked, what should Obama do if he is in the middle of his inaugural address and a bomb goes off somewhere on the mall? ''Is the Secret Service going to whisk him off the podium so the American people see their incoming president disappear in the middle of the inaugural address?'' she asked. ''I don't think so.''
 Among those in the room was Robert Gates, who served two years as Bush's defense secretary and would remain in that post under Obama. After the meeting, everyone eventually agreed that Gates should stay away from the inauguration in a secret location. With no other member of Obama's cabinet confirmed by the Senate, Gates -- an incumbent cabinet officer who also had the imprimatur of the newly elected commander in chief -- was the most logical person in the line of succession to take over the presidency should the worst happen.
 At the heart of the deliberations about what to do was John Brennan, a former C.I.A. officer. A Middle East specialist known for setting up the National Counterterrorism Center for Bush, Brennan was coming back after three years out of government as the top counterterrorism official in the Obama administration. He had wanted to be C.I.A. director but found his potential appointment sunk by liberal protests over his ties to the old order, so instead he was made deputy national security adviser for homeland security and counterterrorism, a position that did not require Senate confirmation.
 As he helped manage the inaugural threat, culling reports and coordinating between two administrations, Brennan was already becoming the most important voice in the ear of the new president as he moved to reshape the nation's struggle with terrorists. If it is now Obama's war, Brennan is his general. And the first battle set the tone. ''It was a poignant reminder of the seriousness of the issue the president would be facing, on the eve of the inauguration,'' Brennan told me in November. 
 Brennan suspected that the threat was a classic ''poison pen,'' when one group of radicals rats out another group to get Americans to take out its rivals, and he was right. In this case, officials familiar with the situation said, some Somali extremists knew that a rival group was traveling to the United States and planted false information about its intentions that got back to the Americans. In the end, what for 72 hours looked like a credible threat turned out to be a false alarm.
 For a fledgling president, the incident would be a lesson in the fluid, murky nature of terrorism. The challenge of leading the struggle against violent extremists is more than just hunting down bad guys; it's distinguishing between what's real and what's not, tracking down where threats begin, figuring out the right response and finding a balance between acknowledging danger and projecting confidence. The Obama administration spent its first year in office trying to find its balance. 
 Barack Obama was inaugurated as the first president to take office in the Age of Terrorism. He inherited two struggles -- one with Al Qaeda and its ideological allies, and another that divides his own country over issues like torture, prosecutions, security and what it means to be an American. The first has proved to be complicated and daunting. The second makes the first look easy.
 The attempted bombing of a Northwest Airlines passenger jet on Christmas Day heightened a debate that has percolated over the last 12 months. Obama's approach has been either a dangerous reversal of the Bush years or a consolidation of the Bush years, depending on who is talking. In fact, the new president, during his first year, has adopted the bulk of the counterterrorism strategy he found on his desk when he arrived in the Oval Office, a strategy already moderated from the earliest days after Sept. 11, 2001. He did, however, shave back some of the harsher edges of the remaining Bush policies and in the process of his recalibrations drew simultaneous fire from former Vice President Dick Cheney and the American Civil Liberties Union.
 Obama, then, found himself in a place where he seems most comfortable, splitting the difference on a tough issue and presenting it as the course of reasoned judgment rather than of dogmatic ideology. Where Bush saw black and white, Obama sees gray. Where Bush favored swagger, Obama is searching for a more supple blend of force and intellect. Where Bush saw Islamic extremism as an existential threat equivalent to Nazism or Communism, Obama contends that that view warps the situation out of proportion and plays into terrorists' hands by elevating their stature and allowing them -- even without attacking again -- to alter the nature of American society. 
 With joblessness still plaguing the economy and health care dominating his agenda, Obama has not wanted his presidency to be defined by the war on terror, as Bush's was. He has given few public speeches on the topic and declined to discuss it for this article. Rather than seeing terrorism as the challenge of our time, Obama rejects the phrase ''war on terror'' altogether, hoping to recast the struggle as one of a number of vital challenges confronting America. The nation is at war with Al Qaeda, Obama says, but not with terrorism, which, as he understands it, is a tactic, not an enemy.
 ''There was a tendency on the part of some to view the world through that prism -- you know, are you with us or against us, black and white, this global war on terror,'' John Brennan told me a couple of months ago in his windowless, low-ceilinged, soundproof office in the West Wing, where mobile phones are banned. ''It was almost all-consuming. It was the driving force for our foreign policies, that we were now engaged in this march on the global war on terror.'' That attitude, Brennan went on to say, proved counterproductive. ''This president recognizes that there's still a very serious terrorist threat that we face from organizations like Al Qaeda,'' he said. ''But at the same time, what we have to do is make sure that we're not pouring fuel on the flames by the things that we do.''
 And so perhaps the biggest change Obama has made is what one former adviser calls the ''mood music'' -- choice of language, outreach to Muslims, rhetorical fidelity to the rule of law and a shift in tone from the all-or-nothing days of the Bush administration. He is committed to taking aggressive actions to disrupt terrorist cells, aides said, but he also considers his speech in Cairo to the Islamic world in June central to his efforts to combat terrorism. ''If you asked him what are the most important things he's done to fight terrorism in his first year, he would put Cairo in the top three,'' Rahm Emanuel, his chief of staff, told me.
 The policies themselves, though, have not changed nearly as much as the political battles over closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay and trying Khalid Shaikh Mohammed in New York would suggest. ''The administration came in determined to undo a lot of the policies of the prior administration,'' Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the top Republican on the homeland-security committee, told me, ''but in fact is finding that many of those policies were better-thought-out than they realized -- or that doing away with them is a far more complex task.''
 If terrorism has not been the driving force of the Obama presidency, neither has it been the catalytic issue to the American people that it was more than eight years ago, when the twin towers collapsed in a heap of steel, concrete and bodies. Yet that mood can change in a hurry, as the Christmas Day plot showed. Obama understands that, if only by the law of averages, there is a decent chance of a major attack on the United States during his presidency. And if that attack happens, any change in policy, no matter how incidental to the facts of the case, will be fodder for critics to blame him for the attack. When the aviation screening and intelligence systems that Bush built failed to stop Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a 23-year-old Nigerian with ties to Al Qaeda's branch in Yemen, from getting on a plane bound for Detroit with explosives in his underwear last month, a number of Obama's political opponents blamed the sitting president. If Bush's system was broken, they asked, why didn't Obama fix it?
 But the underlying complaint seemed less about any particular policy than about Obama himself -- how he reacted, how he spoke, how he led. Although he held conference calls every day with Brennan, who was back in Washington, it took Obama three days to emerge from his Hawaiian vacation to address the matter in public, and when he did, he was typically cool and cerebral, with none of Bush's bring-it-on, dead-or-alive rhetoric. Never mind that Bush took six days to publicly address the 2001 case of Richard Reid, the shoe bomber, or that Reid was charged in civilian court, not as an enemy combatant; critics like Cheney argued again that Obama did not believe America was at war. Bush felt it in his gut. Obama thinks about it in his head. If he rushed out in public to talk the minute something happened, wouldn't that play into the hands of those trying to instill fear in the American people? Shouldn't he prudently wait for more information? Yet with the country afraid, is it possible to overthink it?
 ''You've got almost two extremes,'' Henry Crumpton, who led the C.I.A.'s operation in Afghanistan after Sept. 11 and who later served as counterterrorism chief at the State Department under Bush, told me several weeks before the Christmas Day attempt. ''You've got Bush 43, who aspired to have a warrior's ethos. He was driven, I think, by that, and in some ways it hurt us with the lack of rigor and examination of some of the consequences of our actions, Iraq being the most horrible extreme. Obama comes at it from the other extreme. He comes at it like a lawyer would, someone who may not accept and may even reject this idea of a warrior's ethos. And it is a war. You've got guys out there who want to kill us.''
 Obama was a state senator in Illinois when the planes smashed into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and an empty field in Pennsylvania. He was driving to a legislative hearing in Chicago when he heard early reports on the radio. ''By the time I arrived at my meeting,'' he wrote in his book ''The Audacity of Hope,'' ''the second plane had already hit, and we were told to evacuate the State of Illinois Building. Up and down the streets, people gathered, staring at the sky and at the Sears Tower. Later, in my law office, a group of us sat motionless as the nightmare images unfolded across the TV screen.''
 That day instilled in Bush a sense of unwavering purpose, but Obama's support for the pursuit of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan gave way to doubts about the circumvention of legal structures at home and eventually outright opposition to the war in Iraq begun in the name of Sept. 11. As a Harvard Law School graduate who taught constitutional law and spent part of his childhood in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, Obama saw the emerging global struggle through a different lens.
 In the spring of 2007, when he was a presidential candidate, Obama met Richard Clarke, the former White House counterterrorism chief who had become one of Bush's sharpest critics on terrorism and national security. The two got together in a run-down apartment a few blocks from the Capitol that Obama used for inconspicuous meetings. ''When I first sat down with him and started going through my standard pitch, he was finishing the sentences,'' Clarke told me. ''I'd like to think it was because he read my book, but it's a heck of a lot more involved than my book. He'd talked with a lot of people. He'd read a lot about it. And he had a real understanding.''
 Clarke became his campaign counterterrorism adviser, and Obama decided to give a speech outlining his view of how to combat extremists and how not to. His advisers told him he had a choice: he could try to out-Cheney Cheney and demonstrate that when it comes to national security, Democrats also have hairy chests, as one put it, or he could develop a new paradigm. Obama, typically, found the idea of a new paradigm more appealing, although he threw in a vow to strike terrorists in Pakistan even, if necessary, without permission of its government.
 ''It is time to turn the page,'' he declared in the speech he gave in Washington in August 2007. He said that ''America is at war with terrorists who killed on our soil; we are not at war with Islam.'' He criticized claims of ''unchecked presidential power'' and vowed ''to close Guantanamo, reject the Military Commissions Act and adhere to the Geneva Conventions.'' He said ''that means no more illegal wiretapping of American citizens, no more national-security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime'' and ''no more ignoring the law when it is inconvenient.''
 By the time he won the presidency more than a year later, he was receiving classified briefings on terrorist networks around the world. The government's top intelligence officials beat a path to Chicago to fill him in. They confronted him with the dark side, as Cheney once put it. ''The risks we are talking about are the things you don't want to talk about around the Thanksgiving table,'' Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, told me.
 Yet even some of the Bush appointees were ready for change, appealing to Obama to revamp the struggle. ''Mr. President-elect, we're doing things very well, but we're losing the messaging war,'' Michael Leiter, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told him a week after the election, according to an official informed about the session. A significant share of the global population thought America was at war against the rest of the world, Leiter maintained. ''You have an opportunity to change that message, to change how the struggle is perceived,'' he said.
 Obama was receptive to that mandate. ''We're going to do that,'' he replied.
 When Obama sat down to talk with the outgoing president, Bush pressed him to be vigilant every day. ''That's mostly what they talked about,'' a senior Bush adviser told me. ''I think President Bush came away thinking that President Obama understood at an intellectual level, but you don't really understand at a gut level until you're in that seat.''
 Martha Joynt Kumar, a professor at Towson University who wrote about the inaugural threat in a paper published last month in the journal Presidential Studies Quarterly, said the teamwork between old and new administrations marked one of the smoothest presidential transitions in modern times. Yet for all the cooperation, Obama chose to make one of his first acts a strike against the Bush legacy, signing executive orders drafted by his new White House counsel, Greg Craig, that banned interrogation techniques like waterboarding as torture and ordered the prison at Guantanamo closed within a year. The move generated debate about timing and tactics. John Podesta, who ran Obama's transition, agreed with the policy but argued against making Guantanamo the first priority right after inauguration, according to colleagues. Craig and others countered that it was important to send a signal of change from the start.
 Obama also wanted to uproot the resentments and hatred that fuel extremism. ''The language we use matters,'' he told the Al Arabiya television network a week after taking office. So Obama informally banished the rhetoric of the last administration. ''War on terror'' was out; so were ''Islamofascism'' and ''evildoers.'' The new language did not always go over well. While testifying to Congress a year ago, Napolitano used the phrase ''man-caused disasters,'' and though she said ''terrorism'' elsewhere in her remarks, she drew wide scorn. (''I was totally misinterpreted in a sense of what I was trying to communicate,'' she later told me. ''It was just a mistake. In the editing process, that phrase, usually it's'terrorism or other man-caused disasters.' '')
 John Brennan, who has emerged as the administration's public face for counterterrorism policy, is solidly built, with a weathered face and close-cropped, retreating hair. His eyes seem to take your measure when you walk into the room, studying intently as if searching for your ulterior motives. He is friendly and unfailingly polite but does not laugh easily. He is a serious man in a serious business, a career man, a survivor, someone who has navigated the treacherous politics of the intelligence world and vaulted to great heights only to be disappointed. And now he is helping Obama redirect the war against Al Qaeda. 
 A native of North Bergen, N.J., Brennan, who is 54, attended Catholic schools, all the way through Fordham University. After his freshman year, he went to Indonesia in the summer of 1974 to visit a cousin who was working there, and in the same country that helped shape Obama's worldview, he developed a case of youthful wanderlust. He studied Arabic and played basketball with Egyptians in Cairo before earning a master's degree in Middle East studies at the University of Texas at Austin. While reading The New York Times on a bus one day, he saw a C.I.A. recruitment ad and decided to apply. When I asked why, he gave one of those answers that sounds as if it came from an espionage novel. ''Nathan Hale was hanged on the day of my birth,'' he said of the nation's first spy.
 At the C.I.A., Brennan rose through the ranks, becoming station chief in Saudi Arabia during the late 1990s, a time of rising Islamic terrorism. Just months before he arrived in Riyadh, terrorists blew up the Khobar Towers apartment complex, killing 19 American service members. During his tour, they also attacked American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. A favorite of George J. Tenet, the C.I.A. director first appointed by President Bill Clinton and later retained by Bush, Brennan would become Tenet's chief of staff and later the agency's deputy executive director. 
 After Sept. 11, Brennan helped set up the Terrorist Threat Integration Center and served as its first and only director. But his steady rise reached a peak. When the center was refashioned as the National Counterterrorism Center, bringing together experts across the government to coordinate the war on terror, he served as interim director but was never given the permanent job. Brennan, unhappy, left government in 2005 and went on to write a proposed op-ed essay that he titled, ''Mr. President, You're Wrong on Iraq.'' In keeping with C.I.A. rules, he submitted it for classification review by the agency before distributing it to any newspapers for publication. A copy found its way to the White House, where it angered top officials. Brennan ultimately thought better of the article and withdrew it from C.I.A. review, but it was too late to salvage his standing at the White House. ''He was dead to them,'' says a friend and fellow senior official, who did not want to be named discussing internal matters. An attempt to later make him deputy director of national intelligence was killed by the White House. Obama presented another chance. ''This is redemption,'' the friend said.
 Anthony Lake, a former national security adviser who knew Brennan from his days as a C.I.A. briefer in the Clinton White House, was working for Obama's nascent presidential campaign and brought in the former intelligence officer to advise the candidate in 2007. Obama grew to like Brennan's precise, matter-of-fact style so much that after the election he considered making him the C.I.A. director. But the idea of appointing Tenet's right-hand man, a C.I.A. careerist who was at the center of the Bush war on terror, rankled Obama supporters on the left. 
 Stephen Soldz, a psychologist at the Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis and a leader of the Coalition for an Ethical Psychology, circulated a letter of opposition to Brennan signed by 200 other psychologists. The letter cited an interview Brennan gave in 2006 to PBS's ''Frontline,'' in which he said Tenet's concern in devising the Bush-era interrogation program was making sure it was on sound legal footing. ''We know, of course, that'the appropriate Department of Justice review' means that torture was authorized and conducted by our government,'' Soldz's letter said. 
 But the letter did not quote the rest of what Brennan said in that interview as he grappled with the morality of the government's actions. ''There was a real debate within the agency, including today, about what are the minimum standards that you want to stoop to and beyond where you're not going to go, because we don't want to stoop to using the same types of standards that terrorists use,'' he told PBS. ''We are in this business, whether it be intelligence or the government, to protect freedom, democracy and liberty, not to violate that.''
 Still, human rights advocates have a point about continuity. For all his talk of change, Obama has kept a lot of veterans of the Bush administration in place. Besides Brennan, there is Gates still atop the Pentagon, as well as Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff appointed by Bush, and Michael Vickers, still the assistant Defense secretary for special operations. While Obama tapped Leon Panetta to take over the C.I.A., he kept the deputy director, Stephen Kappes, along with Leiter, the head of the National Counterterrorism Center. Obama fired the top general in Afghanistan, but the head of the regional military command overseeing both Afghanistan and Iraq remains Bush's favorite officer, Gen. David Petraeus, and the White House coordinator for Afghanistan and Pakistan is Bush's Iraq war czar, Lt. Gen. Douglas Lute. To manage the effort to close Guantanamo, Obama named one of Bush's assistant secretaries of state, Daniel Fried. The Treasury under secretary chasing terrorist financing is still Stuart Levey, and the National Security Council's senior director for combating terrorism is still Nick Rasmussen.
 Most of those people, of course, were in the moderate camp inside the Bush administration, not the Cheney cadre, or like Brennan they present themselves as simply career professionals who followed orders or who even quietly dissented from the most extreme policies of the last eight years. ''I was somebody who did oppose waterboarding,'' Brennan told me. ''I opposed different aspects of the enhanced interrogation program. But there were some aspects of it that I concurred with.'' For instance, he offered, ''if you grab somebody by the lapels, and you say, Oh, my goodness, you've violated their rights as a person, well, I'm not going to go that far.''
 Time and circumstances have changed as well. ''Four years ago, I would have said -- and I did say -- the agency's detention program needed to continue,'' Brennan said, referring to the secret ''black site'' overseas prisons ran by the C.I.A. ''There have been a lot of developments and changes, so the things I might have advocated three or four years ago, because of the changed conditions, because of a new administration, whatever, I wouldn't necessarily advocate them now at all. I've changed my views.''
 Soldz told me he has been pleased that Brennan has said the right things since taking the White House job. But Obama's refusal to completely repudiate the Bush-era policies bothers Soldz. ''I wake up some mornings disgusted by Obama,'' he said. ''And then I think about it some more and understand the pressure he's under. So I'm having these battles inside myself.''
 Several weeks after Obama took office, I sat down with the president, along with three colleagues from The Times, in his conference room on Air Force One during a flight back from an event in Ohio. Now that he was in office, we asked what, if anything, he had come to believe that Bush had gotten right in the balance between security and civil liberties. 
 The candidate who denounced the ''color-coded politics of fear'' and rejected policies that ''compromised our most precious values'' was now a commander in chief wrestling with how to protect those values and the country at the same time. He told us that many of the worst practices he had objected to had already been corrected by the end of Bush's presidency. 
 ''I would distinguish between some of the steps that were taken immediately after 9/11 and where we were by the time I took office,'' he told us. ''I think the C.I.A., for example, and some of the controversial programs that have been a focus of a lot of attention, took steps to correct certain policies and procedures after those first couple of years.''
 The battle with terrorists evolved significantly over the course of the Bush presidency, and when Obama took office, the course he set was more about accelerating that evolution than about restarting it. Under pressure from Supreme Court rulings, Congressional legislation and disclosures in the news media, Bush in his second term trimmed back some of his most expansive programs and claims to executive power. Two years before leaving office, he told advisers he wanted to use his remaining time to institutionalize what was left so that his successor, even a Democrat, would not feel compelled to reverse direction.
 By the time Obama was inaugurated, waterboarding had been halted for years, Bush had ordered that the secret C.I.A. black site prisons be emptied and the warrantless surveillance program and the military commission system had been restructured and approved by Congress. Bush had even declared that he wanted to close the Guantanamo prison, and although he never managed to do so, his team released or transferred about 500 detainees as a first step.
 Obama built on those actions. While setting a one-year deadline to close Guantanamo and formally banning the interrogation methods that had already fallen out of favor, he left the surveillance program intact, embraced the Patriot Act, retained the authority to use renditions and embraced some of Bush's claims to state secrets. He preserved the military commissions and national security letters he criticized during the campaign, albeit with more due-process safeguards. He plans to hold dozens of suspected terrorists without charges indefinitely. And he expanded Bush's campaign of unmanned drone strikes against Al Qaeda in the tribal areas of Pakistan. Troop levels in Afghanistan are set to triple on his watch. 
 A half-dozen former senior Bush officials involved in counterterrorism told me before the Christmas Day incident that for the most part, they were comfortable with Obama's policies, although they were reluctant to say so on the record. Some worried they would draw the ire of Cheney's circle if they did, while others calculated that calling attention to the similarities to Bush would only make it harder for Obama to stay the course. And they generally resent Obama's anti-Bush rhetoric and are unwilling to give him political cover by defending him.
 Michael Hayden, the last C.I.A. director under Bush, was willing to say publicly what others would not. ''There is a continuum from the Bush administration, particularly as it changed in the second administration as circumstances changed, and the Obama administration,'' Hayden told me. James Jay Carafano, a homeland-security expert at the Heritage Foundation, was blunter. ''I don't think it's even fair to call it Bush Lite,'' he said. ''It's Bush. It's really, really hard to find a difference that's meaningful and not atmospheric. You see a lot of straining on things trying to make things look repackaged, but they're really not that different.''
 Not every Bush veteran agrees, of course. Marc Thiessen, a former White House speechwriter, has a new book called, ''Courting Disaster: How the C.I.A. Kept America Safe and How Barack Obama Is Inviting the Next Attack.'' Tom Ridge, the former homeland security secretary, told me before the Christmas Day plot that under Obama, Washington had ''lost a certain sense of urgency and commitment to combating terrorism.'' Most disturbing to the Bush camp, even to those who generally see continuity in Obama's policies, have been Attorney General Eric Holder's decisions to release legal memos that described interrogation techniques used by the C.I.A., to reinvestigate allegations of interrogation abuse by C.I.A. officers and to take Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the self-declared mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, to New York to face trial in civilian court. Hayden recalled warning Jim Jones, Obama's national security adviser, last spring not to alienate the C.I.A. by dredging up the past. ''You're about to spend the next 46 months without a clandestine service,'' Hayden recalled saying. ''If these guys don't think you have their back, they're not going to be very adventurous.''
 There is ample historical precedent for this cycle. During times of national crisis, Washington often claims more authority, sometimes to the point of excess, then slowly cedes it back, from the Sedition Act signed by John Adams to Abraham Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus during the Civil War to Franklin D. Roosevelt's internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II -- all cases in which the system eventually corrected itself in one fashion or another. ''Historically the more we move away from a crisis, the better we're able to see the costs and benefits of what we're doing, and we go from being extremely risk-averse to finding a better balance,'' says Geoffrey Stone, a professor and former dean at the University of Chicago law school.
 Bush says he sees another historical pattern. In private discussions with associates during the 2008 presidential campaign, he predicted that if a Democrat won, he or she would be like Dwight Eisenhower to his Harry Truman. Just as Eisenhower on the campaign trail criticized Truman's policies in the early years of the cold war only to essentially adopt them after taking office, Bush anticipated that his successor would preserve most of what he had put in place. Of course, this conveniently fits into Bush's hope that, like Truman, he will look better in the eyes of history. A senior Obama adviser scoffed at the idea that Bush advisers see continuity, arguing that they are trying to launder their reputations by claiming validation. But it is true that much of the Bush security architecture is almost certain to remain part of the national fabric for some time to come, thanks to Obama. 
 Stone, who helped bring Obama to the University of Chicago law school, says his former colleague must be wary of doing anything that would increase the risk of a terrorist attack against the United States. ''He may feel in fact,'' Stone says, ''that it's a more dangerous world than he thought it was, that some of these measures may be more necessary than he thought.'' 
 Stone joined a group of human-rights and civil-liberties advocates at the White House last spring for a meeting with Obama to talk about issues of interrogation and detention. Obama had struggled through a rocky few months trying to find the balance between security and liberty, arguing that America did not need to sacrifice one for the other.
 The decision to close the Guantanamo prison sparked a revolt in Congress, even among Democrats who worried about suspected terrorists being transferred to prisons in their states. An attempt to release into the United States 17 Chinese Uighurs who were deemed no threat to Americans collapsed. Obama authorized the release of the memos detailing the use of waterboarding and other techniques now banned, but he refused to release photographs showing abuse of detainees. 
 For Brennan, these issues were a chance to get right what he thought went wrong under Bush. But he has found himself at odds with other advisers at times. When Craig and Holder wanted to release the memos about C.I.A. interrogation methods, Brennan initially agreed, reasoning that the tactics in the memos had by then been banned anyway. But he later reversed himself and sided with the C.I.A., which argued that the memos would give terrorists too much information about how American interrogators work. Brennan likewise stood with Gates and military leaders who argued that releasing photographs of the abuses would inflame radicals and endanger American troops. Gen. Ray Odierno, the top commander in Iraq, made a personal appeal to Obama during a visit to Washington, and the president agreed to reject Craig's recommendation. Brennan also found an ally at times in Rahm Emanuel, who was said to think that the politics of these decisions were being mishandled and that fights over detention policy used up political capital better spent on priorities like health care and the economy.
 By the time he sat down with the human rights advocates in the Cabinet Room, Obama was preparing to make a speech at the National Archives about such issues. Everyone in the room raised hard questions, voicing the disappointment of Obama's strongest supporters. Perhaps the most dramatic appeal came from Anthony Romero, executive director of the A.C.L.U. ''Look, you're the only politician I've ever believed in,'' Romero said, according to people in the room. ''When I was a gay Puerto Rican growing up in New York, I never thought I could identify with a political leader the way I identify with you. But this stuff really pains me.''
 Obama pushed back, explaining the constraints he was under. It was a balancing act, he said; he had multiple obligations. Much of the discussion concerned the military commissions he decided to keep and the dilemma of what to do with the hardest cases at Guantanamo, those who could not be prosecuted because of tainted evidence or other reasons but were deemed too dangerous to release. ''He wasn't entirely comfortable with any of the options,'' says Tom Malinowski, the Washington advocacy director of Human Rights Watch. 
 When I talked with Romero later, he would not describe his interaction with Obama, but he expressed his frustration. While relieved that the new president seems more open to rethinking Bush-era policies, Romero said he suspected Obama suffers from the ''hubris'' of wanting to preserve much of the power he inherited in the belief that he will use it more wisely. ''He believes he can do it better and smarter and more in keeping with constitutional principles than his predecessor did,'' Romero told me. ''If he's shown himself willing to adhere to some of the Bush policies in the absence of an attack, one worries about what he'll do when an attack comes.'' 
 The activists left the meeting chilled that Obama seemed poised to continue holding terrorism suspects indefinitely without charges. Just a few years earlier, he wrote in his book that ''when we detain suspects indefinitely without trial,'' then ''we weaken our ability to pressure for human rights and the rule of law in despotic regimes.'' Now he was talking about seeking legislation that would permanently authorize such preventive detention. Romero and the A.C.L.U. began preparing a campaign against the proposed legislation if he went forward, soliciting letters from international figures like Desmond Tutu, trying to recruit Jimmy Carter and contacting law-school academics. But then the administration reversed course; while it would continue to hold indefinitely without charges perhaps 50 detainees left from the Bush era, it would not enshrine the power in law, and signaled that it would not use it for future cases. ''We were gearing up for the battle of our lives,'' Romero said. ''Fortunately, they turned back from the abyss.'' 
 Liberals were also cheered by a speech Brennan gave in Washington over the summer at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Brennan said Obama ''is bringing a fundamentally new and more effective approach,'' one that would be more ''multidimensional'' without letting terrorism define American foreign policy. Among other things, he emphasized the ''upstream factors,'' meaning the conditions that fuel extremism, and vowed to promote ''a political, economic and social campaign to meet the basic needs and legitimate grievances of ordinary people -- security for their communities, education for children, a job and income for parents and a sense of dignity and worth.''
 But something else was happening inside the White House. Some in the West Wing, like Emanuel, worried about the collateral cost of Holder's decision that would take Khalid Shaikh Mohammed to New York. Those concerns were relayed to the Justice Department, but Obama declined to intervene and let Holder make the call. Still, by the end of the year, the activists' favorite ally in the West Wing, Greg Craig, was out. He resigned after months of battles over the best way to reorient the war on terror, some that he won and others that he lost. 
 ''He was the one voice for a constant application of the rule of law in the White House,'' Romero lamented. ''The others either demur or mumble.'' Craig's ouster, he added, was ''unfortunate because it means the likes of Rahm Emanuel will consolidate power in the White House.''
 At the house that John Brennan built, about 600 government employees keep tabs on what the extremists are up to, at least as much as they can. The National Counterterrorism Center, which Brennan set up on a leafy campus overlooking the Capital Beltway in the Virginia suburbs outside Washington, is the center of the nation's efforts to hunt down Al Qaeda and its cousins. Obama came to visit last fall, and Brennan accompanied him.
 The operations center at the NCTC looks a lot like the set from ''24,'' the Fox television show, with dozens of analysts from an alphabet soup of agencies known by their acronyms -- C.I.A., F.B.I., D.O.D., N.S.A., D.I.A., D.H.S., D.N.I., T.S.A. and so on -- sitting together as they sift through surveillance videos, intercepted telephone calls, satellite imagery, reports from the field, news accounts and myriad other ''intelligence streams,'' as they are known. A dozen large flat-screen televisions tune in everything from satellite reconnaissance to CNN. Digital clocks indicate the time in hot spots around the world. Multiscreen computers help collate vast quantities of information.
 This place was supposed to help stop the attack by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab aboard a plane over Detroit on Christmas Day. Since Sept. 11, NCTC and various government agencies have connected the dots repeatedly to head off terrorist attacks. In the last few months alone, the government has arrested a number of suspected plotters in the United States. But the cliche is right -- the government has to be right 100 percent of the time, while the other side needs to succeed only once. And the system failed to pull together what its component parts knew about Abdulmutallab before he boarded Northwest Flight 253 in Amsterdam last month.
 The Christmas Day plot touched off a new round of questions among Obama's critics about whether the president is enough of a warrior for the fight against Islamic terrorism. But he has spent much of his time in office killing suspected extremists. With information processed at NCTC and elsewhere, Obama has authorized the C.I.A. to greatly expand a program inherited from Bush using unmanned Predator and Reaper drones to launch missiles at suspected Al Qaeda hideouts along the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Critics complain that such ''targeted assassinations'' are morally suspect and strategically dangerous because of the reaction among Pakistanis when civilians are killed. Obama had a searching conversation with Brennan and Denis McDonough, Catholics who oppose the death penalty, about whether to keep the program. ''He was wrestling with it,'' says one adviser. But in the end, there was no serious disagreement with the decision to continue the program. At one of his first Situation Room meetings as president, according to a participant, Obama said pointedly, ''The C.I.A. gets what it needs.''
 The C.I.A. has launched 53 such strikes in Obama's first year in office, more than during Bush's entire presidency, according to data compiled by Peter Bergen and Katherine Tiedemann at the New America Foundation. In part, that strategy owes to increasingly precise technology that has made it easier in the last couple of years to hit a desired target with fewer civilian casualties. And in part, it underscores the ability to redirect resources away from Iraq now that the war has subsided there; when the Obama administration came into office, it learned that dozens of drones were devoted to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan but just five or six in the tribal areas of Pakistan where Al Qaeda's leadership is mainly holed up, according to officials who declined to be identified discussing a classified program. Obama has authorized doubling the number of drones in the Pakistani border area, as well as increasing the presence over Yemen and Somalia, officials said. 
 Over the course of Obama's first year in office, his drones have taken out a number of ''high-value targets,'' including Baitullah Mehsud, leader of the Pakistani Taliban; Saad bin Laden, a son of Osama bin Laden; and Tahir Yuldashev, leader of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, a close ally of Al Qaeda. At the same time, according to estimates by Bergen and Tiedemann, the civilian death rate of those killed by drone strikes has fallen to about 24 percent in 2009 from about 40 percent from 2006 to 2008. Government officials insist that the civilian casualty rate is even lower. ''I don't hear anyone inside the government, including people like me who came from outside, who thinks the Predator program is anything but essential,'' says a senior Obama counterterrorism official. ''There are a lot of negatives, but it is completely essential.''
 Obama has been willing to be muscular in other ways as well. When intelligence agencies concluded in September that they had found Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, an Al Qaeda operative linked to the 2002 bombing of a Kenyan hotel, in southern Somalia, officials debated three options, including one to insert American special-operations forces in that lawless East African country, several officials told me. Obama's advisers rejected that and presented him instead with a plan for an airstrike, which he approved. Weather on the day of the strike prompted a change in plans, and commanders instead authorized attack helicopters to sweep into Somalia. Nabhan was killed. American forces landed afterward to collect bodies and evidence.
 Most salient at the moment is Obama's focus on Yemen, the poor, unstable state south of Saudi Arabia where Osama bin Laden's family hailed from. Yemen in many ways is where Obama's two wars come together. It is a breeding ground for extremism, the home of the radical cleric who inspired Maj. Nidal Hasan before he opened fire at Fort Hood last fall and, the president has stated, the origin of the Christmas Day bombing plot involving Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. At the same time, it is the place where roughly half of the remaining detainees at Guantanamo come from, making it the central focus for efforts to close the prison.
 Brennan visited Yemen in March and again in September to focus new energy on combating Al Qaeda there. Obama has ordered more training, equipment and intelligence sharing for the Yemeni government; about $70 million was set aside to bulk up Yemeni forces, doubling previous spending, and last week the administration announced it would double it again next year. Last month the American government also provided intelligence and hardware for Yemeni airstrikes on suspected Al Qaeda hideouts. Brennan has also been trying to set up a rehabilitation program for Yemen like the one in Saudi Arabia that American officials say they believe has been largely successful in transitioning former Guantanamo detainees back into society -- although some have joined up with Al Qaeda nonetheless. And by the time Brennan returned from his most recent trip, many of his colleagues had despaired of ever finding a safe way to repatriate the nearly 100 Yemenis still at Guantanamo. That was before Detroit.
 Obama was singing Christmas carols with his family at a house in Hawaii when a military aide arrived to tell him that someone tried to blow up a plane over Detroit. The president got on the phone with Brennan, who told him a Nigerian man tried to ignite chemicals secreted in his underwear, only to have passengers and crew jump him. Soon enough, Abdulmutallab would be tied to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which operates in Yemen.
 Notwithstanding Janet Napolitano's statement last month that ''the system worked,'' Obama suspected that it had not. While on vacation he was given an 80-page review of the Fort Hood shooting, looking at how information about Hasan was not well circulated within the federal government. The night after his first statement, his advisers learned that the government possessed National Security Agency-intercepted conversations that could have helped to stop Abdulmutallab if they had been shared widely. 
 Obama talked with Brennan and other advisers by phone the next morning. He was simmering. ''Let me make this very clear to you,'' he told the advisers, according to two of them. ''While I understand intelligence is hard, and I'll never fault anybody for not having full intelligence, what I will fault is when we have full intelligence that's not shared.'' After hanging up with Brennan, aides scrambled to organize a statement to the news media. Denis McDonough, the National Security Council chief of staff, typed out a draft on the president's laptop as Obama hovered over his shoulder.
 ''What's the deal?'' Obama asked.
 ''I'm just about done,'' McDonough said.
 ''Well, just move over.'' Obama sat down and finished it himself.
 The president's statement that there was a ''systemic failure'' did not quell the political furor, and White House officials were caught off guard by the intensity of the criticism. After reading a Cheney statement that attacked Obama for only pretending to be at war with terrorists, David Axelrod angrily wrote a long statement trashing the former vice president and gave it to Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director, who revised it and posted on the White House Web site. The criticism got Brennan's back up too, particularly coming from some of his former colleagues in the Bush administration.
 ''A lot of the knuckleheads I've been listening to out there on the network shows don't know what they're talking about,'' he told me after the Christmas Day attempt. Some Republicans, including Cheney, were blatantly mischaracterizing the record, he fumed. ''When they say the administration's not at war with Al Qaeda, that is just complete hogwash.'' It was the angriest I had heard him during months of conversations. ''What they're doing is just playing into Al Qaeda's strategic effort, which is to get us to battle among ourselves instead of focusing on them,'' he said.
 It is moments like these when Brennan's disaffection from the last administration becomes evident. ''I much prefer talking with someone who is interested in understanding the situation and responding to it appropriately,'' Brennan told me.
 For all of the attention on the Nigerian underwear bomber, some experts say they believe the more insidious threat will be a new generation of homegrown extremists. In recent months, authorities have arrested a number of American residents, including Najibullah Zazi, an airport-shuttle driver who is suspected of plotting to attack New York after receiving training in Pakistan, and David Coleman Headley, a Pakistani-American accused of aiding terrorist attacks in Mumbai. There was the Fort Hood shooting rampage, as well as a group of Somali-Americans from Minnesota who reportedly wanted to fight in Somalia and five American Muslims from Virginia who traveled to Pakistan supposedly to join the jihad.
 If they are the next wave, American extremists are going to be hard to track and stop. The Internet makes it possible for Al Qaeda and its allies to reach out from the dusty villages of Waziristan all the way to Illinois and Colorado. ''Although no one wants to admit it, I think a watershed has been crossed in the terrorist threat in the United States,'' Bruce Hoffman, a Georgetown University terrorism scholar, told me. ''It's way different than it was in the Bush years.''
 The Obama administration has been trying to figure out how to counter it. In October, Obama secretly ordered a review of the ways different agencies track travels between the United States and places like Pakistan to look for holes to close. Napolitano told me: ''We can't operate in the paradigm that if they attack us, they would be coming from other countries into the United States. We have some that are homegrown. That is a change.'' 
 After all the lawyerly focus on Guantanamo and the rules of war, the latest threats put more focus on Obama in the role of commander in chief. It did not go unnoticed that when he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize last month, he declared that ''evil does exist in the world.'' His press secretary, Robert Gibbs, went on the Sunday shows after the Christmas Day plot and, consciously or not, used the term ''war on terror.''
 The White House then dispatched Brennan for a blitz of four Sunday shows, the first such foray for the C.I.A. veteran. In his first radio and Internet address of the new year, Obama implicitly rebutted Cheney by noting that he used the word ''war'' is his inaugural address. ''Our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred,'' Obama said.
 The war goes on, abroad and at home.

I.O.U. 
 Why Everyone Owes Everyone and No One Can Pay 
 By John Lanchester 
 260 pages. Simon & Schuster. $25. 
 If you wanted to try to make sense of the global banking crisis, instead of merely weeping openly at your A.T.M. balance, 2009 was a very good year. Bookstores were filled with volumes that, with expert 20-20 hindsight, explained how capitalism went to hell. The blame was spread around: to politicians (for deregulating financial markets), to bankers (for gambling with exotic derivatives they barely understood) and to the rest of us (for living beyond our means, like insatiate zombie piglets).
 This nightmare isn't over. We'll be living with the fallout from the banking crisis for decades and devouring plenty more books about it too. The whole episode is a kind of intellectual and moral Superfund site, an oozing gift that will keep giving. But here's a prediction: Few if any of these books will be as pleasurable -- and by that I mean as literate or as wickedly funny -- as John Lanchester's ''I.O.U.: Why Everyone Owes Everyone and No One Can Pay.'' 
 Mr. Lanchester, who is British, isn't an economist or a business journalist. He's a novelist (and a talented one; try ''The Debt to Pleasure''), a man with no special financial expertise whatsoever. A few years ago he began following the financial meltdown for research purposes, as background for a novel he was writing. He soon realized, he says, ''that I had stumbled across the most interesting story I've ever found.''
 It's a story that begins, as these stories are wont to do, with the fall of the Berlin Wall. The capitalist West won its ''ideological beauty contest'' with the communist East, Mr. Lanchester writes, which was good news except for this: Suddenly ''there was no global antagonist to point at and jeer at the rise in the number and size of the fat cats; there was no embarrassment about allowing the rich to get so much richer so very quickly.'' 
 Once upon a time in America and Britain, he observes, ''the jet engine of capitalism was harnessed to the ox cart of social justice, to much bleating from the advocates of pure capitalism, but with the effect that the Western liberal democracies became the most admired societies that the world had ever seen.'' 
 Then the Wall crumbled, and ''the jet engine was unhooked from the ox cart and allowed to roar off at its own speed. The result was an unprecedented boom, which had two big things wrong with it: It wasn't fair, and it wasn't sustainable.'' 
 The snidest villains and the greediest buffoons in the narrative are the bankers and other financial wizards who began recklessly playing with new, risky, little-understood tools to get richer faster -- tools that ostensibly hedge against risk but also dramatically increase it. If you don't know how derivatives or credit default swaps work, or what securitization is, or why futures are riskier than options, this is a book for you. Mr. Lanchester explains these things methodically, with mathematical rigor, but he is also, crucially, guided as much by perception and feel. 
 ''We are a long, long way from a single quote for next season's wheat crop,'' he notes. ''The contemporary derivative is likely to involve a mix of options, futures, currencies and debt, structured and priced in ways which are the closest extant thing to rocket science. Mathematics Ph.D.'s are all over the place in this business.'' 
 Mr. Lanchester finds loads of bleak humor here. ''Warren Buffett was doubly right to compare the new financial products to 'weapons of mass destruction' -- first, because they are lethal, and, second, because no one knows how to track them down,'' he writes. 
 He also compares the banking crisis to the birth of postmodernism. ''For anyone who studied literature in college in the past few decades, there is a weird familiarity about the current crisis,'' he says. ''Value, in the realm of finance capital, parallels the elusive nature of meaning in deconstructionism.'' 
 ''I.O.U.'' crosses over into black satire when Mr. Lanchester describes how bankers used their new tools to make money from poor people, the worst credit risks, by prying their cash loose through predatory lending, then pooling this money and selling it off. Who cared if these people defaulted on their mortgages? The risk had already been passed along to others, and ultimately, when banks failed, to taxpayers. Mr. Lanchester calls this ''a 100 percent pure form of socialism for the rich.'' 
 With steam shooting from his ears, he summarizes: ''So: a huge, unregulated boom in which almost all the upside went directly into private hands, followed by a gigantic bust in which the losses were socialized. That is literally nobody's idea of how the world is supposed to work.'' 
 Mr. Lanchester's history lesson is peppered with dead-on references to everything, including ''Annie Hall,'' ''The Simpsons,'' ''The Wire,'' Hemingway and Jacques Derrida. He is effortlessly epigrammatical. (''In a sense, credit isn't just an aspect of the economy, it is the economy.'') 
 His wit pops out at unexpected angles. About the ever-riskier wages bankers were making, he writes: ''This wasn't just looking for trouble, it was sending trouble a 'save the date' card, followed by a formal invitation, followed by nagging e-mails and phone calls just to make absolutely sure.'' 
 He also lays out a wide series of necessary reforms, including requiring banks to keep more capital on hand and separating investment banking from everyday banking (''the casino'' from ''the piggy bank''). 
 These reforms include personal ones, aimed at me and at you. Do we need so much stuff in our lives? he asks. ''In a world running out of resources, the most important ethical, political and ecological idea can be summed up in one simple word: 'enough.' ''
 Mr. Lanchester is no admirer of George W. Bush, but he does enjoy citing Mr. Bush's comment in late 2008 about the worsening economy: ''This sucker could go down.'' Mr. Lanchester, in 2010, isn't quite that pessimistic. But he does note that we're all about to get the bill from the financial bailouts, a bill that could easily top $4.6 trillion. 
 How much money is that, anyway? Brace yourself. That number, Mr. Lanchester writes, paraphrasing one expert, ''is bigger than the Marshall Plan, the Louisiana Purchase, the Apollo moon landings, the 1980s savings and loan crisis, the Korean War and the total cost of NASA's space flights, all added together -- repeat, added together (and yes, the old figures are adjusted upward for inflation).''
 Before you begin to cry, pick up a copy of ''I.O.U.'' Good humor and good company will be the things that'll get us through.

HEADLINE: Rare Breeds, Frozen in Time

BYLINE: By BARRY ESTABROOK

DATELINE: NEWPORT, R.I. 

 BODY:
 IT didn't take long for Chip, a Tennessee fainting goat sporting a luxuriant Vandyke beard and an impressive pair of curlicue horns, to live up to his breed's name. When Peter Borden, accompanied by a stranger, entered the immaculate stable that Chip calls home, the goat pressed his velvety nose through the bars of his stall, begging for a scratch. But at the visitor's approach, Chip apparently had second thoughts. His left foreleg stiffened, his brown eyes went glassy and he began to list to one side. 
 ''There he goes,'' said Mr. Borden, the executive director of the SVF Foundation, a heritage livestock preservation facility here. The guest turned away, and Chip quickly recovered, his dignity intact.
 Located on a 45-acre estate in Newport, SVF is the only organization in the country dedicated to conserving rare heritage livestock breeds by freezing their semen and embryos, a technique called cryopreservation. Chip, now SVF's unofficial mascot, was the proof that the foundation had mastered the process. In early 2004, as a six-day-old embryo, he was flushed from his mother's womb and spent the next several months frozen. Thawed and transplanted into a surrogate Nubian doe, a common breed, he was born on May 7, 2004, a perfectly normal fainting goat. 
 The building adjacent to the one that houses Chip contains three stainless-steel tanks about the size of commercial washing machines. About 45,000 semen and embryo samples from 20 breeds of rare cattle, sheep and goats are preserved there in liquid nitrogen chilled to minus 312 degrees -- essentially a frozen ark. Each time the foundation freezes a batch of embryos from a new breed, it thaws a few and transplants them into surrogate animals, repeating the test that Chip once passed. 
 Keeling over when frightened by a potential predator is not the most desirable trait in a small ruminant, so it is easy to see why fainting goats became an endangered breed. In the eyes of modern agribusiness, Chip and his companions at SVF are a collection of misfits.
 Huge dreadlocked Cotswold sheep are too big and slow-growing for commercial acceptance. Sleek Milking Devon cattle have the flaw of being dual-purpose livestock in a farm economy that demands specialization -- a bovine must produce either rivers of milk or massive cuts of well-marbled beef. 
 But in other ways, the foundation's four-legged barnyard nerds are ideally suited to meet the demands of evolving culinary and farming trends. ''People are demanding choice at a time when commercial livestock are being bred for consistency,'' Mr. Borden said.
 Consider goat meat, once relegated to Caribbean, Hispanic and Middle Eastern immigrant enclaves. A decade ago, who would have guessed that it would become a culinary phenomenon, readily available at farmers' markets nationwide and cutting-edge restaurants like David Schuttenberg's Cabrito in the West Village, Rick Bayless's Frontera Grill in Chicago and Tom Douglas's Lola in Seattle? There is no way of telling which of the forgotten breeds preserved by SVF might someday find itself in similar demand, but the foundation will be prepared.
 Chip will never end up on a kebab skewer, but a glance at his stocky wrestler's build shows that he carries plenty of meat. His squat stature means that, unlike other goat breeds, he can't leap tall fences, making him suited to small, diversified family farms near urban areas where goat meat is popular.
 ''These animals lend themselves well to the locavore movement,'' Mr. Borden said. ''They don't need a lot of attention. They do well on small pastures, and require no grain.''
 Set on rolling hills among Newport's mansions, the SVF complex, with its restored stone buildings that resemble a Swiss village (the ''SV'' in the name), is an odd combination of an early 20th-century ''gentleman's folly'' hobby farm and a scientific facility. Visitors are confronted by locked electronic gates and signs warning: ''Biosecure area. Absolutely no trespassing. Please leave immediately.''
 ''Think of this as a safety valve program,'' said Dr. George Saperstein, the foundation's chief scientific adviser, who is chairman of the Department of Environmental and Population Health at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University. ''If there was a disaster, if something like the potato famine of livestock ever hit, these frozen embryos would be made available, and in one generation we would be back in business.'' It is up to a small group of trustees and advisers to determine whether a severe emergency or some other circumstance requires release of the frozen germ plasm.
 That possibility is not altogether remote. For all their efficiency and high output, modern livestock breeds have become a weak, inbred bunch, Dr. Saperstein said. Fifty years ago there were a half-dozen popular dairy breeds in this country. But today, according to Lindsey Worden of Holstein Association USA, an organization representing farmers and breeders, the country's 8.6 million Holstein cows make up 93 percent of America's dairy herd. Fewer than 20 champion bulls are responsible for half the genes in today's Holsteins.
 As an example of how vulnerable our milk supply is, Dr. Saperstein points to a heat wave in California in 2006 in which some 16,500 Holsteins died, despite farmers' efforts to save them with cooling mists of water and fans. In contrast, the Pineywoods cattle in SVF's collection were introduced into the forests of the South by Spaniards in the 1500s specifically because they tolerated heat. In all likelihood, the hearty animals would have survived the heat wave.
 ''Heritage breeds have not been continuously 'improved' by humans,'' Mr. Borden said. ''They have been shaped by natural survival-of-the-fittest forces and can get along without human intervention. Typically, rare varieties exhibit good birthing and mothering abilities. They can thrive on native grasses and other natural forage, and many know how to avoid predators.''
 The foundation, a nonprofit group, was founded by Dorrance Hill Hamilton, known as Dodo. Mrs. Hamilton, 82, is a summer resident of Newport who inherited a major stake in the Campbell Soup Company, making her one of the country's wealthiest women, according to Forbes magazine. An avid preservationist, she realized that the pastures and fieldstone buildings could not only serve as a greenbelt, but would also be ideal for the conservation of livestock. 
 After consulting with Tufts scientists, she decided to create a frozen library of genetic material from farm animals in danger of being lost to extinction. The facility operates on an annual budget of approximately $2 million supplied by Mrs. Hamilton.
 ''No one else was doing this work,'' Mrs. Hamilton said through a spokesman. She was visiting Britain in 2001 when millions of farm animals were destroyed to prevent the spread of foot-and-mouth disease, and she thought that something had to be done in case a similar outbreak happened here. ''I didn't have enough land to maintain herds of animals, so I realized that cryopreservation was where we should go,'' she said.
 Before SVF, the preservation of heritage livestock was through natural reproduction and largely the purview of dedicated amateur and professional breeders and organizations like the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy and Slow Food USA, as well as organizations promoting specific varieties. ''On-the-hoof conservation is important,'' Mr. Borden said. ''But used in conjunction with it, cryopreservation is a great long-term solution.''
 In an operating room at SVF late last month, an 87-pound black-muzzled ewe lay anesthetized on an operating table. She was one of about 300 Hog Island sheep, remnants of a tough, healthy and highly maternal colonial population that had survived essentially as wild animals for hundreds of years on a barrier island off Virginia. Technicians had given her fertility treatments to increase her egg production, and six days earlier she had mated.
 After examining the ewe's womb through a strawlike laparoscope inserted into a tiny hole in her belly, Dr. David Mastas, a Tufts veterinarian who spends nearly all his time working at SVF, enlarged the incision and lifted her uterus from her abdominal cavity and flushed out four embryos.
 Barely visible to the naked eye, they resembled salmon roe when magnified under a microscope. Once it was determined that they were viable, the embryos were frozen. Dr. Mastas performed the procedure on two more Hog Island sheep that day, resulting in 21 frozen embryos. A typical Hog Island ewe produces one lamb each year. 
 About an hour after the procedure had begun, the ewe stood woozily in a stall next to the operating room. Like two-thirds of the 100 or so animals at the facility at any given time, she was there on loan and would be returned to her owner in Virginia. In other cases, the foundation leases animals or, occasionally, buys them outright. Once these have had their germ plasm preserved, they are sold to other farms to create satellite populations.
 Having mastered the techniques of cryogenics, SVF has expanded its efforts to educating the public about the value of conserving heritage breeds. To that end, the foundation is donating about $30,000 for a pilot program with the Fair Food Farmstand in Reading Terminal Market in Philadelphia. Working with consultants, SVF and the farmstand started the brand Fair Food Farmstand Heritage Breed for meat, dairy and eggs. The effort includes point-of-sale information explaining the merits of rare farm animals. 
 ''We have to eat these animals to save them,'' Mr. Borden said. ''Ultimately, food is the reason heritage breeds are important.''

HEADLINE: Japan's Finance Minister Considers Quitting

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Japan's new government braced for another setback Tuesday after reports that its ailing 77-year-old finance minister was pressing to resign, although it appeared that the prime minister might try to persuade him to remain in his job. The news comes at a difficult time -- when the government, already weakened by a series of policy blunders and scandals, is attempting the delicate task of stimulating an economy already burdened with enormous debt. 
 The minister, Hirohisa Fujii, a fiscal conservative trusted by investors, is considered one of the few experienced hands in the cabinet of Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, whose Democratic Party swept to power in September.
 Mr. Fujii, who had said he was suffering from exhaustion and high blood pressure, announced early on Tuesday that he was awaiting doctors' advice on whether he should stay in office.
 Early Wednesday, several news agencies reported that Mr. Fujii had decided he wanted to resign, citing unnamed lawmakers from the governing party. But Mr. Hatoyama said he hoped that Mr. Fujii would remain in his post to see the coming fiscal year's budget through Parliament. He added, however, that he would also respect medical recommendations on the finance minister's health.
 Officials at the Finance Ministry declined to comment. 
 Mr. Fujii, a veteran bureaucrat turned politician, has been seen by investors as a reassuring check on the left-leaning government's spending plans. In recent months he has wrangled with ministries over budget cuts as Japan struggles to rein in its runaway public debt, close to twice the size of the country's economy. 
 He has repeatedly insisted that the government stick to a $477 billion cap on new bond issuance for the fiscal year starting in April. 
 Mr. Fujii checked into a hospital Dec. 28 and has commuted to work from the hospital since. He told reporters at a news conference on Tuesday that he had discussed his health with Mr. Hatoyama. 
 Japanese news agencies later said that Mr. Fujii ultimately told the prime minister that he did not feel well enough to face long days of questioning in Parliament this month over next year's record $1 trillion budget, a major challenge for Mr. Hatoyama's government. 
 The government fears that the economy, which has been struggling for years, could slide back into recession. 
 Mr. Fujii's deputies, Yoshihiko Noda and Naoki Minezaki, are among those who have been mentioned as possible successors. 
 Public approval ratings for Mr. Hatoyama's government have slid from postelection highs of more than 70 percent to less than 50 percent in recent polls. The drop comes as negotiations over the relocation of an American military base in Japan have stalled and amid financing scandals linked to the prime minister and his party's secretary general. 
 Mr. Fujii said last year that he intended to retire, but he stayed on after the Democratic Party victory, which ended a half century of almost uninterrupted single-party rule in Japan.

HEADLINE: As Clout Grows, Working Families Party Faces a Question: Has It Reached Too Far?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL

 BODY:
Bill de Blasio, New York City's new public advocate, is a lifelong Democrat and a likely future mayoral contender. But ask him to name the most innovative political force in the state, and he points to the Working Families Party.
 ''On the issues they care about, from minimum wage to tenant issues to development, they are absolutely definitional -- they can set the debate at the city and the state level,'' Mr. de Blasio said.
 Unabashedly left-leaning, the Working Families Party is the latest in a line of little-known but powerful third parties in New York. The party, whose leaders hail from unions and liberal corners of the Democratic Party, rarely runs its own candidates. Leaders recruit and cross-endorse Democrats and put savvy field operatives to work in primaries and general elections.
 Since its founding in 1998, the Working Families Party has accumulated a handsome pile of scalps, and prodded and sometimes dragged Democrats to the left. This year it successfully championed a so-called millionaire's tax and a bill to train workers and weatherize houses -- and its troops helped push Mr. de Blasio to victory. 
 Its ambitions, too, remain outsize: Leaders have seeded chapters across the nation. ''They are the only state party that's a full-time party with ideas,'' said Ed Ott, former political director of the Central Labor Council. ''You call the Democratic Party in between an election, and it's a ghost town.''
 But in its moment of triumph, the party faces an imposing threat, along with an implicit question: Did this hybrid of political party and political movement get too clever and overreach? The United States attorney's office in Manhattan recently issued subpoenas seeking campaign documents from the Working Families Party and from Mr. de Blasio and City Council candidates who contracted with the party.
 ''Having this investigation hanging out there during a gubernatorial election could make it problematic for Democrats,'' said Brad Lander, a new councilman from Brooklyn who is a fan of the Working Families Party and paid its staff members to work on his campaign. 
 Federal prosecutors have declined to discuss the subpoenas, but critics, from Republicans to the online City Hall News to a few prominent Democrats, say the Working Families Party has constructed an end run around campaign finance laws. After making an endorsement, party leaders ask a candidate to consider hiring the party's for-profit arm, Data and Field Services, to run the campaign. Critics accuse party leaders of providing that service at a discount, in effect making an under-the-table campaign contribution.
 The city's Campaign Finance Board has cautioned the Working Families Party that it intends, in routine campaign audits, to examine the fees charged by Data and Field Services.
 Party officials dismiss the complaints as baseless. Four candidates who ran for City Council seats with the backing of the Working Families Party, as well as an adviser to a prominent Democratic candidate, said in interviews that the prices for the party's campaign services were on the high end rather than artificially low.
 Dan Cantor, the party's top official, is a graying veteran of what is known as movement politics, from antiwar protesting to union organizing, and he occupies a crowded jumble of an office in Downtown Brooklyn. The accusations, he acknowledges, cast a shadow across the party's reformist identity. The party's influential members include the United Automobile Workers, the Communication Workers of America, the United Federation of Teachers and the health-care workers union 1199 S.E.I.U., as well as tenant and community organizing groups like Acorn.
 Mr. Cantor invited this reporter to look through piles of election records, which appear to support his claim that Data and Field Services charges a standard rate. The for-profit arm took in $2.3 million last year, from candidates and from the party itself, which paid the corporation $966,000 to knock on doors for donations and to work on issue and electoral campaigns in Syracuse, Yonkers and Suffolk County.
 ''Not only are we not subsidizing campaigns, we charge on the high end for our services,'' Mr. Cantor said.
 The party also faces growing ideological challenges. Prominent business leaders have fixed their bayonets, saying that the party's pursuit of expanded rent protections, higher taxes for the rich and mandatory sick days for workers is ill-advised as the economy hits a recessionary bottom.
 ''To the extent that the party has fixed ideological goals it will pursue at any price, it is challenging the way business and labor have worked together,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, which represents large corporations. ''It's a party designed to tug the Democrats to the left.''
 For this reason, she says the counterpressure must come from the Democratic Party. Some real estate professionals, intent on a direct challenge to the Working Families Party, have taken partial control of the Independence Party. They poured about $700,000 into races in 2009.
 Mention this threat and Mr. Cantor cracks a smile. He is wary of having his party pegged as tax-hungry. ''But a tenant-oriented party against a party of landlords?'' he said. ''I'll take my chances.''
 Mr. Cantor acknowledges that his party might step too heavily now and then, and endorse a few less-than-remarkable candidates. But, historically, third parties served as incubators for abolitionism, women's suffrage and the minimum wage, and he said the Working Families Party consistently pushed issues like health care and affordable housing that liberals became accustomed to viewing as hopeless.
 And sympathetic Democrats suggest that rivals are paying a visceral compliment: They see the party as a threat.
 ''This is a fight over that rarest of animals in America, a progressive political party that believes in living wages,'' said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester County. ''And conservatives and the business community have become highly exercised and want to stop it. That's really not a shock, is it?''
 Third-party politics offer a cottage industry in New York, and the practical goal is to draw enough votes to retain the political gold that is a ballot line. Most parties practice fusion politics, which is to say they cross-endorse candidates from bigger parties. 
 The Independence Party is a curious amalgam, split between upstate, where the libertarian billionaire Tom Golisano has underwritten the party, and downstate, where remnants of a Marxist sect mix with supporters of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and real estate developers.
 Other parties tug Republicans and Democrats right or left. The Conservative Party operates out of a second-floor office above a liquor store in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, owned by the party's chairman, Michael R. Long. When the cream of the Republican Party come calling, they pay fealty to the party's anti-abortion and tax-cutting politics.
 The Liberal Party once dominated the opposite end of the spectrum. When John V. Lindsay, a liberal New York mayor, lost the Republican primary in 1969, he ran on the Liberal line and won.
 In time that party fell into the hands of Raymond Harding, a prominent patron of Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani's popularity redounded to the party's favor, and members found jobs in his mayoral administration. But Mr. Harding recently pleaded guilty to a felony related to securities violations, and the party lies moribund.
 In 1997, as the Liberal Party moved rightward, five labor and Democratic advocates gathered at a Manhattan diner and hammered out the idea for the Working Families Party.
 The party began by cross-endorsing a Democrat, Peter F. Vallone Sr., for governor in 1998, and to its surprise drew 51,325 votes, enough to guarantee it a line on the ballot in the next election. Larger unions quickly joined. In coming years the party scored victories in upstate Congressional races, not to mention claiming the first minor-party victory, by Letitia James of Brooklyn, in a New York City Council election in a quarter-century. It pushed the Legislature to overhaul drug laws and force developers to build lower-income housing in return for tax abatements.
 Last year the party raised about $1.8 million, from nearly 30,000 donors, as well as unions and elected officials.
 The party's internal politics remain a complicated stew. The party sat out the New York mayoral race in 2005, when its biggest unions stuck by Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican. Last year the party endorsed a Democrat, William C. Thompson Jr., but large unions remained neutral and party efforts were underwhelming. The party also angered some supporters when it endorsed two candidates handpicked by the Democratic chairman in Brooklyn, Vito J. Lopez.
 The party, too, can play bare-knuckle politics, in what Fred Siegel, a professor at the Cooper Union, calls the ''new Tammany Hall'' style.
 In 2005, the party endorsed Scott M. Stringer rather than Councilwoman Eva Moskowitz in the Democratic primary for Manhattan borough president. The teachers' union, a traditional power in New York, had clashed with Ms. Moskowitz, and wanted to leave her career stillborn.
 Ms. Moskowitz recalled carefully spooning out her dollars in a tight primary race. Then the Working Families Party and the unions loosened a broadside.
 ''If a third party can put that massive infusion of money in at the 11th hour of a primary campaign, you're dead,'' she said. ''It's very problematic to have a third party spending huge sums of money in a party primary.''
 State Senator Eric T. Schneiderman, a supporter of the party, shrugs off such complaints. Ms. Moskowitz, he said, crossed a powerful union in liberal Manhattan and reaped what she sowed.
 But her criticism circles back, after a fashion, to the crisis confronting the party. 
 Even if nothing comes of it, the federal investigation could prove perilous to the party's reputation. Should Democratic politicians shy away from the party for fear of taint, Mr. Cantor's party could die aborning.
 ''We welcome a battle at the ballot box,'' he said. ''But it's not fun being investigated; it endangers what we are about most.''

HEADLINE: In Harlem, Blacks Are No Longer A Majority

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
For nearly a century, Harlem has been synonymous with black urban America. Given its magnetic and growing appeal to younger black professionals and its historic residential enclaves and cultural institutions, the neighborhood's reputation as the capital of black America seems unlikely to change soon.
 But the neighborhood is in the midst of a profound and accelerating shift. In greater Harlem, which runs river to river, and from East 96th Street and West 106th Street to West 155th Street, blacks are no longer a majority of the population -- a shift that actually occurred a decade ago, but was largely overlooked.
 By 2008, their share had declined to 4 in 10 residents. Since 2000, central Harlem's population has grown more than in any other decade since the 1940s, to 126,000 from 109,000, but its black population -- about 77,000 in central Harlem and about twice that in greater Harlem -- is smaller than at any time since the 1920s. 
 In 2008, 22 percent of the white households in Harlem had moved to their present homes within the previous year. By comparison, only 7 percent of the black households had. 
 ''It was a combination of location and affordability,'' said Laura Murray, a 31-year-old graduate student in medical anthropology at Columbia, who moved to Sugar Hill near City College about a year ago. ''I feel a community here that I don't feel in other parts of the city.''
 Change has been even more pronounced in the narrow north-south corridor defined as central Harlem, which planners roughly define as north of 110th Street between Fifth and St. Nicholas Avenues.
 There, blacks account for 6 in 10 residents, but those born in the United States make up barely half of all residents. Since 2000, the proportion of whites living there has more than doubled, to more than one in 10 residents -- the highest since the 1940s. The Hispanic population, which was concentrated in East Harlem, is now at an all-time high in central Harlem, up 27 percent since 2000. 
 Harlem, said Michael Henry Adams, a historian of the neighborhood and a resident, ''is poised again at a point of pivotal transition.''
 Harlem is hardly the only ethnic neighborhood to have metamorphosed because of inroads by housing pioneers seeking bargains and more space -- Little Italy, for instance, has been largely gobbled up by immigrants expanding the boundaries of Chinatown and by creeping gentrification from SoHo. But Harlem has evolved uniquely. 
 Because so much of the community was devastated by demolition for urban renewal, arson and abandonment beginning in the 1960s, many newcomers have not so much dislodged existing residents as succeeded them. In the 1970s alone, the black population of central Harlem declined by more than 30 percent. 
 ''This place was vacated,'' said Howard Dodson, director of Harlem's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. ''Gentrification is about displacement.'' 
 Meanwhile, the influx of non-Hispanic whites has escalated. The 1990 census counted only 672 whites in central Harlem. By 2000, there were 2,200. The latest count, in 2008, recorded nearly 13,800.
 ''There's a lot of new housing to allow people to come into the area without displacing people there,'' said Joshua S. Bauchner, who moved to a Harlem town house in 2007 and is the only white member of Community Board 10 in central Harlem. ''In Manhattan, there are only so many directions you can go. North to Harlem is one of the last options.''
 In 1910, blacks constituted about 10 percent of central Harlem's population. By 1930, the beginnings of the great migration from the South and the influx from downtown Manhattan neighborhoods where blacks were feeling less welcome transformed them into a 70 percent majority. Their share of the population (98 percent) and total numbers (233,000) peaked in 1950. 
 In 2008, according to the census, the 77,000 blacks in central Harlem amounted to 62 percent of the population.
 The number of blacks living in greater Harlem hit a high of 341,000 in 1950, but their share of the population didn't peak until 1970, when they made up 64 percent of the residents. In 2008, there were 153,000 blacks in greater Harlem, and they made up 41 percent of the population. 
 About 15 percent of Harlem's black population is foreign-born, mostly from the Caribbean, with a growing number from Africa.
 Some experts say the decline in the black population may be overstated because poorer people are typically undercounted by the census, and Harlem has a disproportionate number of poor people. Others warn that proposed development and higher property values may force poor people out, and they say that when the city was the neighborhood's leading landlord it should have increased ownership opportunities for Harlem residents . 
 ''Gentrification -- the buying up and rehabilitation of land and buildings, whether by families or developers, occupied or abandoned -- means a rising rent tide for all, leading inevitably to displacement next door, down the block, or two streets away,'' said Neil Smith, director of the Center for Place, Culture and Politics at the City University of New York Graduate Center. 
 Mr. Dodson of the Schomburg Center moved from Riverside Drive to Newark not long ago. He said, ''I tell people that I can't afford to live in Harlem or in New York in the manner I deserve to.''
 Other analysts point to the outflow of some blacks and the influx of others as positive evidence that barriers to integration have fallen in other neighborhoods and that Harlem has become a more attractive place to live. 
 ''It's a mistake to see this only as a story of racial change,'' said Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president. ''What's interesting is that many African-Americans are living in Harlem by choice, not necessity.''
 Andrew A. Beveridge, a sociologist at Queens College, said, ''Harlem has become as it was in the early 1930s -- a predominantly black neighborhood, but with other groups living there as well.'' 
 Ronald Copney, a former limousine driver, and his two sisters share a brownstone on West 147th Street that his grandmother bought in 1929. He rents two floors to tenants, one of whom is white.
 ''This was always a very nice neighborhood,'' he said. ''In a way, it's better now as far as property values are concerned.''
 Geneva Bain, the district manager of Community Board 10, blamed the economy and the lack of jobs for the dwindling number of blacks. 
 She acknowledged, though, that white newcomers have sometimes been greeted ambivalently. ''Integration is very subjective,'' Ms. Bain said. ''One person's fellowship is another person's antagonism. I am one who thinks that central Harlem has become a better place because of integration.'' 
 Mr. Dodson, the Schomburg Center director, said one source of historic resentment remained: that blacks still accounted for a tiny minority of the area's property owners.
 ''There are people who would like to maintain Harlem as a 'black enclave,' but the only way to do that is to own it,'' Mr. Dodson said. ''That having been said, you can't have it both ways: You can't on the one hand say you oppose being discriminated against by others who prevent you from living where you want to, and say out of the other side of your mouth that nobody but black people can live in Harlem.''
 ''The question of whether it's a good thing or not,'' he added. ''I honestly can't make that judgment yet.''

HEADLINE: China's U.N. Envoy Objects to Tougher Penalties for Iran Over Its Atomic Ambitions

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS 

 BODY:
Imposing tougher sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program is a poor idea while diplomatic negotiations remain possible, Zhang Yesui, the Chinese ambassador to the United Nations, said Tuesday.
 ''Sanctions themselves are not an end,'' Mr. Zhang said at a news conference to observe China's assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for January. 
 Efforts to reach an accord with Iran over its nuclear ambitions need ''some more time and patience,'' he said, noting that senior political officials from the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany were expected to meet in the coming weeks to discuss the next steps. 
 Mr. Zhang said remarks by Iranian officials over the past few days indicated their interest in finding a diplomatic resolution. ''This also represents that there is more to happen in the area of talks,'' he said.
 China has long opposed using the Security Council to impose sanctions, particularly economic sanctions in countries where it has strong business interests. The Chinese buy about 15 percent of their oil from Iran. 
 State-run companies like the China National Petroleum Corporation have signed billions of dollars' worth of deals to help Iran develop oil and gas fields and to expand its refining capacity. 
 China and Russia, which has also expressed reservations about new sanctions on Iran, supported three previous Security Council resolutions that authorized sanctions aimed at Iranian individuals and organizations involved in the nuclear effort. The sanctions were devised to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, which the government denies seeking.
 The United States and many other Western nations suspect that Iran has been enriching uranium so that it can eventually create nuclear weapons. Iran insists that its nuclear program is intended to generate electricity and for other peaceful purposes.
 Under a deal tentatively reached by negotiators in October, Iran would export much of its stock of enriched uranium abroad for processing to higher enrichment levels for use in a research reactor in Tehran. The accord appeared to be a major accomplishment for the West, reducing Iran's ability to make a nuclear weapon quickly and buying more time for negotiations.
 But the agreement stalled after Tehran's negotiators in Geneva initially endorsed it. Western officials have expressed exasperation that Iran seems to alter its position repeatedly, its nuclear policy entangled in longstanding disputes among internal factions.
 The Obama administration, supported by France and Britain, which like the United States are permanent Security Council members, had set the end of 2009 as a deadline for Iran either to reach a compromise or to face more sanctions. The United States still seeks to create a ''dual-track approach'' and to consult with other countries on both negotiations and sanctions, said Mark Kornblau, the spokesman for the United States Mission to the United Nations.
 American and European officials have said that any new sanctions would probably be aimed at the Revolutionary Guards, which controls Iran's nuclear program. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Monday that new sanctions were needed to put pressure on Iran. The Obama administration and allies that support more sanctions have questioned whether the Security Council would be the appropriate organization to create ''meaty'' sanctions, as one diplomat put it, given the reluctance of China and Russia. 
 Because any Iranian effort to build a nuclear bomb might set off a wider conflict with Israel, not to mention a regional arms race, Western negotiators still hope that concerns about regional stability may prompt China and Russia eventually to agree to more sanctions, choosing stability over their economic interests. 
 Given low expectations for action at the United Nations, the United States and the European Union are likely to pursue sanctions on their own, trying to enlist trading partners like Japan, Australia and perhaps Turkey. 
 With China the current Security Council president, just getting Iran's nuclear program on the Council's agenda could prove difficult this month. That may be far more likely to occur next month, when France has the presidency.

HEADLINE: A City's Specialty, Japanese in Name Only

BYLINE: By JOHN T. EDGE

DATELINE: Seattle 

 BODY:
 SALAAMA, a Somali roadhouse near the airport here, serves chicken suqaar, a dish of griddled halal chicken, onions and peppers, popular with cab drivers. Interlopers to this clubhouse restaurant order the dish the way the menu advertises it -- as chicken teriyaki. 
 At 5 Seasons Grill, a Vietnamese restaurant north of the city, a banner promises ''The Best Teriyaki in Town.'' That would be Item 38, com bo nuong, beef short ribs, marinated with lemon grass and other nontraditional teriyaki ingredients. 
 ''This is just like teriyaki,'' said Cat Vo, an owner. ''Only it's much better.'' 
 In Seattle, teriyaki is omnipresent, the closest this city comes to a Chicago dog. 
 At Safeco Field, home of the Seattle Mariners, fans eat chicken teriyaki. Specialty food retailers stock teriyaki sauces, including a triple garlic take from Tom Douglas, perhaps Seattle's most well-known chef. 
 Many Hawaiian restaurants serve a version. Some Thai restaurants do too. Tokyo Garden Teriyaki in the University District violates the dictates of traditional American and Japanese cookery with its corn dog teriyaki, a $5 gut punch of deep-fried corn dogs, sliced, tossed with wok-fried vegetables and drizzled with teriyaki sauce. 
 The Washington State Restaurant Association has identified 83 Seattle restaurants with teriyaki in their name, including I Love Teriyaki and I Luv Teriyaki. (A concurrent search yielded about 40 restaurants named Burger King, McDonald's or Wendy's.) 
 In Seattle, teriyaki is shorthand for a range of dishes, from teriyaki burgers, piled with chopped beef, to pineapple teriyaki, platters of chicken paved with canned pineapple. 
 The phenomenon, now in its fourth decade, has roots in Asian immigration. (For a 2007 Seattle Weekly article, Jonathan Kauffman wrote that Toshihiro Kasahara, a peripatetic Japanese-born restaurateur, may have popularized the teriyaki sauce style now standard in Seattle when he opened Toshi's Teriyaki Restaurant in 1976.) 
 Teriyaki is derived from the Japanese root words teri, to shine, and yaki, to broil or grill. That's the way traditional teriyaki looks: shiny and incised with grill marks. In Japan, teriyaki is a mix of soy sauce, sake and the rice wine mirin, which imparts a subtle sweetness. 
 In Seattle, subtlety gets short shrift. Cooks sweeten with white sugar and pineapple juice. They thicken with cornstarch and peanut butter. Ginger and garlic go into the mix, because of the Korean ancestry of many cooks. 
 Tokyo Garden's owner, Sujan Shrestha, immigrated from Nepal 11 years ago to attend college. He stayed to help his brother run a company that imports dried cow's milk and yak's milk cheese for pet treats. 
 For Mr. Shrestha, opening a teriyaki shop was just another entrepreneurial tack. ''In Seattle, they eat teriyaki,'' he said. ''It's American, it's cheap and it's good. I'm a businessman; that's enough for me.'' 
 He serves Nepalese dumplings, known as momo, with a side of coleslaw, along with gyoza, Japanese dumplings. All are prepared under the direction of the sushi chef, Jose Ramirez, born in Puebla, Mexico. 
 That corn dog teriyaki is a stunner. But his signature dish is chicken teriyaki: butterflied boneless thighs, marinated in a soy-based sauce, then grilled, glazed with a thicker version of that sauce and sliced into strips. 
 ''Chicken teriyaki is the best cheap food there is,'' he said. ''It's ideal for international students. I got through school on oatmeal cookies and coffee. If only I could have had teriyaki, things would have been different.'' 
 Seattle is not the sole American city that loves teriyaki. 
 Dozens of manufacturers market sauce riffs, like Veri Veri Teriyaki from Soy Vay Enterprises in Felton, Calif. Waba Grill Teriyaki House, which promotes skinless chicken, cooked without oil or MSG, has more than 20 California locations. Teriyaki Madness, based in Las Vegas (but owned by Seattle natives) is selling Nevada on teriyaki, pitched by an Elvis impersonator. 
 Only in Seattle, however, are teriyaki restaurants so ubiquitous that they're virtually invisible, said Knute Berger, the author of ''Pugetopolis,'' a book of essays on modern Seattle mores. 
 ''Seattle likes to talk about local foods, about ridiculous things like fiddlehead coulis,'' Mr. Berger said. ''Seattle yuppies love the idea of going to some obscure Chinese place for dim sum but won't dare tell you that they eat chicken teriyaki. Those places are so much a part of the streetscape that we can't even see them.'' 
 Teriyaki claims its place at white tablecloth restaurants, too. Daniel's Broiler, a steakhouse on Lake Union serves teriyaki-marinated beef as well as poached rock lobster tails. 
 But the average Seattle teriyaki spot is utilitarian, with fluorescent lights overhead and neon signs glaring from smudged storefront windows. The quality of ingredients is often measured by the salt water that packers inject into the restaurant's chicken thighs. ''We use a 2 percent chicken,'' said Mr. Shrestha, decrying competitors who, in an effort to save money, buy chicken with much higher saline levels. 
 Economy is one of the virtues of Seattle teriyaki. It's part of the problem, too. ''Teriyaki is cheap and kind of dirty,'' said Debbie Sarow, a bookstore owner who often eats a brown-bag lunch at her desk. ''Everybody here is focused on what's in their food, but teriyaki sauce is mysterious. You can't figure out what's in there, and that scares some people off.'' 
 Boo Yul Ko and her husband, In Ja Ko, own Manna Deli & Teriyaki, cater-corner from the 5 Seasons Grill. She sells chicken, beef and pork teriyaki plates. 
 On the front counter, Ms. Ko stacks teriyaki wraps with the heft of lead piping. Engorged with meat, sauce, rice and salad -- the constituent ingredients of a teriyaki plate -- they rise in pyramids near a ceramic cat statuette, its paw raised in a gesture of welcome. She takes great pride in selling those wraps for $3.99, a price that first-generation immigrants (and college students) recognize as a bargain. 
 The Kos, Korean natives, moved to Seattle from Idaho in 1999, when their son, Sam Ko, enrolled in Seattle University as an undergraduate. (He went on to earn a dual M.D./M.B.A. degree from the University of Rochester.) 
 ''Seattle has a thousand teriyakis,'' Mrs. Ko said one afternoon. Her tone was dismissive, as if explaining the looming presence of the Space Needle to a not particularly bright child. ''No Americans do the cooking. Koreans do.''
 ''This is Seattle food,'' she said, extending her argument. ''For Seattle people. This is what we eat here. Seattle people eat teriyaki. This isn't Dallas.'' 
 Recipe: Chicken Teriyaki Adapted from Sujan Shrestha, Tokyo Garden Teriyaki, Seattle Time: 30 minutes, plus overnight refrigeration
 Adapted from Sujan Shrestha, Tokyo Garden Teriyaki, Seattle
 Time: 30 minutes, plus overnight refrigeration
 1 cup soy sauce
 1 cup granulated sugar
 1 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar
 6 cloves garlic, crushed in a press
 2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger
 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
 1 3-inch cinnamon stick
 1 tablespoon pineapple juice
 8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs
 2 tablespoons cornstarch.
 1. In a small saucepan, combine all ingredients except cornstarch and chicken. Bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and stir until sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. Discard cinnamon stick and mix in 1/2 cup water. 
 2. Place chicken in a heavy-duty sealable plastic bag. Add soy sauce mixture, seal bag, and turn to coat chicken. Refrigerate overnight. 
 3. Remove chicken and set aside. Pour mixture into a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low. Mix cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water and add to pan. Stir until mixture begins to thicken, and gradually stir in enough water (about 1/2 cup) until sauce is the consistency of heavy cream. Remove from heat and set aside. 
 4. Preheat a broiler or grill. Lightly brush chicken pieces on all sides with sauce, and broil or grill about 3 minutes per side. While chicken is cooking, place sauce over high heat and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a bare simmer, adding water a bit at a time to keep mixture at a pourable consistency. To serve, slice chicken into strips, arrange on plates, and drizzle with sauce.
 Yield: 8 servings.

HEADLINE: The Beacon Is Booked, So Allmans Will Move

BYLINE: By DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
No rock 'n' roll tradition lasts forever. Bob Dylan plugged in his guitar. Kiss (temporarily) washed off its face paint. And now the Allman Brothers Band is leaving the Beacon Theater.
 On Tuesday night the Allman band, whose annual routine of residencies at that Upper West Side theater once seemed as permanent as the bathroom-wall graffiti at CBGB, announced that when it came to New York in March, it would not appear at the Beacon, where it has played 190 shows over the past 20 years.
 Instead the band will perform at the United Palace Theater in Washington Heights, having lost its longtime Manhattan home to another group. 
 ''Cirque du Soleil came and bought it out from under us,'' Gregg Allman, the band's singer and keyboard player, said in a telephone interview.
 ''It's a drag,'' Mr. Allman added. ''But one monkey don't stop no show.''
 Mr. Allman and his roots-rock band have been associated with the Beacon since 1989, having made it their concert hall of choice for monthlong, multinight stands after a lengthy diaspora that followed the closing of the Fillmore East in 1971.
 In 2000 the group released a live album, ''Peakin' at the Beacon'' (Epic), culled from performances there. Its 2008 dates there were canceled while Mr. Allman underwent treatment for hepatitis C. But when the 2,800-seat theater was reopened last year after a seven-month renovation, executives at Madison Square Garden Entertainment, which operates the Beacon, made sure that the Allman Brothers Band was among the first acts to play the refurbished space; a 20th-anniversary run in 2009 featured high-profile guest stars like Eric Clapton. 
 Melissa Ormond, the chief operating officer of MSG Entertainment, told The New York Times last March that the band was ''a mainstay, a staple of the Beacon and everything it stands for.''
 But in June, said Bert Holman, the band's manager, he received a phone call from an MSG executive informing him that she had bad news: the Beacon had been booked for a new show by Cirque du Soleil, the Montreal circus troupe, that would use the theater from January through June -- and possibly into August.
 Mr. Holman said the band might have considered rescheduling its residency to February or April, but ''that answered that question.'' The MSG executive, whom he did not name, was ''very chagrined.'' He added, ''She didn't have her marquee booking.'' 
 In a statement Bob Shea, the executive vice president for bookings of MSG Entertainment, said: ''We are proud of our long-standing history with the Allman Brothers Band at the Beacon Theater. We hope to have them back at the Beacon in 2011 and beyond.''
 MSG executives did not say why they offered the Beacon to the Cirque du Soleil show, called ''Banana Shpeel,'' instead of the Allman band, but economics may have played a role. The theater stands to gross far more from ''Banana Shpeel,'' which is booked for nearly 100 performances at the Beacon, than it did from the Allman Brothers Band, which played 15 shows there in 2009. (Last month Cirque du Soleil said it had postponed the New York opening of ''Banana Shpeel'' by three weeks so the production could have more rehearsal time at the Beacon, after a Chicago run was poorly received by critics there.) 
 In the meantime, the Allman band and its representatives contemplated several other New York spaces for its residency. But the Hammerstein and Roseland Ballrooms and the Nokia Theater were deemed too small, as were several Broadway houses, which do not typically host rowdy Southern rock bands and their fans. Radio City Music Hall, another MSG property, seemed better suited to other acts. 
 ''Forget about it,'' Mr. Allman said. ''That's Hannah Montana's place. I think she's great, by the way.'' So, ''by process of elimination,'' Mr. Holman said, the group came to the United Palace, a 3,293-seat auditorium, where it will play eight shows from March 11 through 20. (More dates may be added if those shows sell out.)
 Though the space has been criticized by concertgoers for its echo-filled acoustics, Mr. Allman said, ''With our sound system, we'll make our own damn acoustics.'' 
 The band is also looking into other ways that it could make the Washington Heights neighborhood more familiar to its itinerant followers, who might not have spent much time there. Mr. Allman said he and his colleagues might rent a bar there during the residency that would offer ''a safe, safe place to get loaded or talk to the pretty women -- do the things that us guys do.''
 Anticipating the reaction of his audience, Mr. Allman lamented the loss of the Beacon. ''The location was perfect,'' he said. ''But then we went through the same thing with the Fillmore.'' He, too, was frustrated for making fans follow him from theater to theater, adding, ''It's not us that's running them around, though.''
 Mr. Allman said the band's coming performances at the United Palace were an experiment. ''If for some strange reason it doesn't work,'' he said, ''then next year we'll try a different place.''
 But one way or another, Mr. Allman said, his band would remain a fixture in New York. ''I'll play up there till I drop,'' he said. ''You can print that.''

HEADLINE: New Year but No Relief For Strapped States

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO 

 BODY:
It is one of the bleakest new years that states have seen in over a decade. 
 On Wednesday, governors in California, Kentucky and New York kick off the season of addresses to state lawmakers as at least 36 states struggle to close budget shortfalls and also begin confronting the next fiscal year's woes.
 For many of the states, the new year spells the end to accounting maneuvers, one-off solutions, tax increases and service cuts that were as deep as lawmakers thought they could bear. And governors confront this situation in an election year in which dozens of their jobs are in play, and as many state legislators face their own election challenges.
 ''A budget gap of 5 percent or 10 percent in any given year is a tough problem,'' said Corina Eckl, fiscal director at the National Conference of State Legislatures. ''But we're talking about gaps in excess of 20 percent over multiple years. The size of these gaps is staggering.'' 
 California's problems, including a projected budget deficit of $20 billion, are as outsized as the state itself. 
 In his state-of-the-state message here, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, will proclaim California close to incapable of paying for social services in the next fiscal year, which begins in July, unless the Obama administration greatly increases aid to the state. That will be just one of many bleak assessments -- and far-from-slam-dunk prescriptions -- that Mr. Schwarzenegger will proffer as he and nearly every other governor face another year of extraordinary fiscal distress. 
 High unemployment, continued reverberations from the foreclosure crisis and a severe drop in all forms of taxes have combined to leave states -- which historically have lagged behind the private sector in recession recoveries by about two years -- reeling. 
 State tax collections for the third quarter of 2009 showed a drop of 10.7 percent, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue decline, according to the Rockefeller Institute, though the dip was smaller than the preceding two quarters. 
 While some states are showing modest improvement, others continue to set record lows. Revenues for Michigan, one of the nation's most fiscally challenged states, are at a 45-year low, when adjusted for inflation. Many of the states that increased spending generally during the rosier years of the last decade are paying for it now.
 Oklahoma's projected budget gap of $1.3 billion for the next fiscal year is the largest since the Depression, said Scott Meacham, the state treasurer.
 ''Government is subject to a bit of mission creep over time,'' Mr. Meacham said. ''We do things that are great to do but not maybe the core mission of government. We need to look at some more fundamental shifts.'' 
 Further, the federal stimulus dollars that helped keep many local governments afloat last year will begin to evaporate. Debt service -- a Peter-Paul system for many states last year -- has also grown. The cost of keeping citizens in government programs, like Medicaid, has also risen, as unemployment funds have teetered toward insolvency over the last 18 months. 
 Cost savings so far have included cuts to specific programs; Michigan and California both stopped offering dental services to some Medicaid recipients last year. But there have also been layoffs -- Kentucky's state work force has shrunk by 1,600 over the last two years -- and symbolic moves, like Delaware's decision last year to turn state-office thermostats down in the winter and up in the summer.
 In many ways, states averted deeper cuts than anticipated last year because of the federal stimulus package. But those dollars will shrink over the next fiscal year, and unless jobs return and tax revenues rise, or Congress sends them more aid, states will most likely continue to be overextended. 
 ''We are still cash positive,'' said Ann Visalli, the director of Office of Management and Budget for Delaware, where two auto plants and a major oil refinery closed this year. ''However, because of the drop-off in federal stimulus and state revenues not materializing, we do have to continue with budget cuts.'' 
 Some governors will almost certainly be looking to the federal government for help. While proclaiming that the state is not seeking a bailout, according to a draft part of his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Schwarzenegger will say, ''We need to work with the feds so that we can fix the flawed formula that demands that states spend money they do not have.'' 
 Some states will most likely continue with across-the-board cuts, accounting moves like moving last payroll dates into the next fiscal year, as California has done in the past, and furloughs. But more states are expected to face an equally unpopular choice between eliminating services or raising taxes. 
 Last year nine states raised income taxes, and 15 states and the District of Columbia raised taxes on cigarettes. 
 ''There is pressure for more tax increases in more states,'' said Joseph Henchman, the director of state projects for the Tax Foundation, a research group. ''It will be a hard sell in states where people think spending hasn't been cut enough.''
 One test of voter tolerance for new taxes will come next month in Oregon, where voters will be asked to consider two measures that would increase taxes on corporations and wealthy taxpayers to help balance the state's budget, specifically for education, health care and public safety.
 ''This will be an indication on whether or not people are willing to invest in core areas of government right now,'' said Jim Ross, a political consultant who has run Democratic campaigns in Oregon. ''It is true in Oregon and most other places in the country.''
 There are some signs of sunshine, and opportunity, in the budget problems. Over the past three months, coincident indexes -- measures of current economic conditions in a state boiled down to a single statistic -- have increased in 20 states, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, even as they decreased in 25 and remained unchanged in five. Unemployment has slowed in many states as well. 
 Further, states have had no trouble tapping the bond market; 2010 is expected to be a record year for municipal bonds, $450 billion compared with $409 billion in 2009. That is an indication that there remains investor interest and a willingness among state leaders to continue to invest in infrastructure, which can preserve or even create jobs. 
 States have also been forced to rethink how they do business, with examples like energy savings, new approaches to the management of prisons or the ways they manage gambling. Kentucky, for instance, wants video lottery terminals at race tracks. 
 ''The good news is that there's a target-rich environment for any states interested in new ideas,'' said Robert B. Ward, the director of Fiscal Studies at the Rockefeller Institute, which is based in Albany.

HEADLINE: Extended Period of Cold Raises Fears for Florida Crops

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN

 BODY:
As a cold spell continued its rigid hold on much of the eastern United States on Tuesday, farmers in central and southern Florida were bracing for freezing temperatures overnight that could damage orange, strawberry and tomato crops. 
 The frigid weather was also blamed for four deaths in Tennessee and has produced record snowfalls in New England.
 In Nashville, the police said the body of an 81-year-old man was found in the front yard of his home on Monday morning. The man's family told the police that he had had Alzheimer's disease, and that they believed he had walked out of his home in the night dressed in his bathrobe. 
 The deep freeze, brought on by surges of high-pressure arctic air masses moving down from northwestern Canada, has been lingering since the weekend in many places that are not accustomed to subfreezing weather, meteorologists said.
 Schools were closed in Arkansas and parts of West Virginia, where up to eight inches of snow has fallen in the last few days. 
 ''This cold snap is lasting longer than normal,'' said Rick Davis, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Tampa, Fla., where the temperature can fall below freezing several times a year but will usually rebound by the next day. ''We've had it the last three or four days, and it will last for the better part of the week and this coming weekend, so we're going to have a solid 7- to 10-day stretch of lower-than-normal temperatures.''
 Mr. Davis said the conditions were particularly problematic for farmers, especially in central and southern Florida, where January is the middle of the growing season for strawberries and citrus fruit.
 Gov. Charlie Crist signed an executive order giving state agencies the authority to provide growers help.
 Farmers are so worried about the effects of a prolonged freeze that Charles H. Bronson, Florida's agricultural commissioner, asked Mr. Crist on Tuesday to lift a weight limit on trucks that haul produce. 
 ''That way farmers can load up the crops they're already harvested and get them out of harm's way,'' said Terence McElroy, press secretary for the State Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. ''This thing isn't over yet, and we don't know where we'll be at the end of it.''
 Mr. McElroy said agriculture, the state's second-biggest industry after tourism, had an economic impact in excess of $100 billion a year.
 Andrew Meadows, director of communications for Florida Citrus Mutual, a growers' association, said crop damage occurred when the temperature stayed at 28 degrees or lower for at least four hours. Readings as low as 27 have been seen the last few nights, Mr. Meadows said, but generally just before daybreak and for only an hour or so before the rising sun heated things up again. There were no reports of damage so far, he said.
 But a forecast of a more lingering frost on Tuesday night prompted farmers in many parts of Florida to take precautions to protect their crops, he said. One favored method is to activate microsprinklers when the temperature is below freezing to make ice that protects a fruit-bearing plant or tree from the frigid air.
 ''If you were paying attention in your high school physics class, you may know that the formation of ice creates heat,'' he said, referring to an effect that scientists call the heat of fusion. ''That will protect the tree or that portion of the tree -- the bottom and the trunk -- from freezing.''
 Mr. Meadows said there were some freezing spells last winter that caused damage in some pockets of Florida, but nothing like the big freeze of 1989, when frigid temperatures for several days caused huge crop losses throughout the state. Many growers moved their operations farther south after that winter.

HEADLINE: Promise to Trim Deficit Is Growing Harder to Keep

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama is making final decisions on his budget for next year and is still promising to outline a path to substantially lower federal deficits. But on nearly every front, that goal has gotten harder since his first budget a year ago.
 A deeper recession and slower recovery than the administration initially forecast have increased the tab for economic stimulus measures beyond the original $787 billion package, adding hundreds of billions of dollars for programs like unemployment relief and tax credits for homebuyers. 
 The savings Mr. Obama once projected from winding down the war in Iraq are being eroded by a bigger buildup in Afghanistan than he had initially contemplated. Congress has rejected or ignored his proposals to raise revenues by changing tax rules for multinational corporations and capping deductions by wealthy individuals; for Mr. Obama to reprise those proposals could raise questions about the credibility of the numbers in his budget. 
 Meanwhile, the biggest tool usually employed to chisel away at projected deficits -- shaving Medicare payments to health care providers -- is already being used to offset the costs of overhauling the health care system.
 At the same time, the persistently high unemployment rate has intensified the pressure on the White House and Congress to not emphasize deficit reduction so much that they risk undercutting the already sluggish recovery or even tipping the economy back into recession. In February, Mr. Obama must submit his budget for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1.
 ''The White House faces a tough challenge preparing a budget with very different goals: cutting the deficit while maintaining stimulative policies designed to keep the recovery going,'' said Thomas S. Kahn, staff director for the House Budget Committee. ''There are unfortunately no politically painless ways to cut the deficit. Virtually all the low-hanging fruit has already been picked.''
 Not least among the president's constraints, this is a Congressional election year. His party is on the defensive, and less inclined than usual to take politically risky votes on cutting spending and raising taxes. 
 Moreover, the party is somewhat split over how aggressively to pursue deficit reduction, with many liberals warning that fiscal contraction could set off a double-dip recession as well as crimp their agenda.
 While Mr. Obama has few budget decisions left, administration officials say, those decisions are ''weighty,'' as one put it.
 The intensity of his struggles to show lower deficits over the next decade is captured by one idea that was considered and apparently shelved. 
 With most Bush tax cuts scheduled to expire at the end of this year, some officials, including Mr. Obama's budget director, Peter R. Orszag, suggested that instead of permanently extending the cuts for all but the richest Americans -- as the president has long promised -- Mr. Obama could instead propose to extend them a year or two, arguing that further action would await the recommendations of a bipartisan budget commission that leading Senate Democrats want to create.
 Critics countered that Republicans would say Democrats were laying the groundwork to raise taxes on the middle class, violating Mr. Obama's campaign promise. Mr. Obama has decided to stick with his plan to extend the tax cuts permanently for those making less than $250,000, officials familiar with the deliberations say.
 Among other issues is how to account for additional stimulus spending and tax cuts now that Congress and the president are committed to producing in coming weeks a new package of measures to spur businesses to create jobs. The president and Congressional Democrats argue that the new costs are offset in effect by the one recent bit of good fiscal news: that losses from the government's financial bailout effort, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, will reach about $120 billion, or roughly $220 billion less than forecast last year.
 In its August review of the fiscal outlook, the administration acknowledged that without further cuts it would not reduce the deficit to about 3 percent of the size of the economy -- the maximum most economists consider prudent -- by the end of Mr. Obama's term, as his first budget projected. Instead, the review of the Office of Management and Budget forecast that the fiscal year 2013 deficit would be 4.6 percent of the gross domestic product.
 Mr. Orszag, the budget office's director, told a group of business leaders in November that he was committed to reaching 3 percent of the gross domestic product by 2015, a formidable challenge since that is nearly a full percentage point below current administration projections for that year. He has since said that goal will require a bipartisan commission to force some policy changes.
 ''The administration faces a dual challenge: promoting job growth in the near term while also addressing our out-year deficits,'' Mr. Orszag said in a statement on Tuesday. ''We remain firmly committed to putting the nation back to work and also back on the path to fiscal sustainability.'' 
 The $1.4 trillion deficit for the 2009 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, was about 10 percent of the gross domestic product. Assuming the economy resumes growing, future deficits will be lower simply because of rising tax revenues, lower safety-net spending and the end of the temporary stimulus programs. But they will still be consistently higher than is considered fiscally responsible, mainly because of costs for Medicare and Medicaid.
 Mr. Obama last year proposed $622 billion in savings from the health care programs' payments to hospitals, doctors and insurance companies over the next 10 years to help pay for an overhaul of the health insurance system. That exceeds by almost $200 billion the amount in pending House and Senate bills, leading some administration officials to suggest that the budget could call for additional Medicare cuts. 
 But James R. Horney, director of federal fiscal policy for the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said that especially in an election year, ''it would be very difficult to come back this year and say, 'Oh, we're going to have big cuts in Medicare after presumably we're going to pass a health reform bill that has pretty substantial Medicare cuts.' ''
 Mr. Obama could also again propose various tax increases that would raise about $600 billion over a decade. One would limit to 28 percent the deductions rich taxpayers could claim, and others would increase taxes for companies operating internationally. But because Congress has refused to act on those proposals, they would not be seen as realistic ways to reduce the deficits.
 Increasingly, even supporters are saying Mr. Obama cannot keep both his promise to bring deficits under control and his vow not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000.

HEADLINE: Democratic Senator Won't Run Again

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, announced abruptly on Tuesday that he would not seek re-election this year -- a clear sign of the difficulties Democrats will face in defending their large Congressional majorities in the midterm elections. 
 Mr. Dorgan, who is completing his third term, has been regarded for months as one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents. Gov. John Hoeven, a popular Republican, has been weighing a run for Senate, and recent polls indicate he would easily defeat Mr. Dorgan, who nonetheless remains well-regarded by voters. 
 His announcement came only hours before word spread that a Democratic senator considered even more vulnerable than Mr. Dorgan, Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, had decided not to seek re-election.
 Mr. Dorgan's decision increases both the likelihood that Mr. Hoeven, a three-term governor will pursue the open Senate seat and that Democrats will lose it. 
 For now, Democrats nominally control 60 seats in the Senate, which is the precise number needed to overcome Republican filibusters. The major health care legislation, for instance, is advancing only because all 60 members of the Democratic caucus, including two independents, have united in support of it.
 Democratic incumbents also face serious challenges in Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut and Pennsylvania, among other states, while Senator Harry Reid, the party leader, is in his own tough fight for re-election in Nevada. 
 At the same time, Democrats have some opportunity to pick up Republican seats because of retirements in Florida, Missouri, New Hampshire and Ohio. 
 Mr. Dorgan has grown increasingly pessimistic about his prospects for re-election in recent weeks as he traveled around the state and met with constituents, and he did not hide his sentiment that the Congress and the Obama administration erred in putting too much emphasis on the health care overhaul and not enough on job-creating economic programs. 
 But in a statement released Tuesday he said his decision was based on a desire to engage in other pursuits after more than 30 years in public service.
 ''Although I still have a passion for public service and enjoy my work in the Senate, I have other interests and I have other things I would like to pursue outside of public life,'' Mr. Dorgan said, adding that he was interested in writing, teaching and working on energy policy in the private sector. 
 Senate Republicans quickly hailed the news of Mr. Dorgan's retirement as a sign of their brightening political prospects. 
 ''This development is indicative of the difficult environment and slumping approval ratings that Democrats face,'' said Brian Walsh, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

HEADLINE: Sourcing Of Article Awkward For Paper

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Facing criticism for publishing the work of a start-up news organization, The Washington Post said Tuesday that it should have disclosed more about the group's financier and his connections, and the paper's ombudsman said he was looking into the relationship.
 The start-up, The Fiscal Times, covers economic issues, with a particular focus on the federal budget, the growing deficit and efforts to rein in health care and Social Security spending. Its financing was provided by Peter G. Peterson, the billionaire investment banker who advocates deficit reduction and restrictions on entitlement programs. 
 On Dec. 31, The Post published the first news article produced by The Fiscal Times, a report on the support in Washington for a proposed deficit-reduction commission. The primary expert quoted in the article is from the Concord Coalition, whose mission is also balanced budgets and limits on safety-net spending.
 But the article did not mention Mr. Peterson, his backing of The Fiscal Times, that he was a co-founder of the Concord Coalition or that his foundation was a major underwriter of the coalition.
 A group of mostly liberal policy analysts say the problem is more basic than a lack of transparency -- that The Fiscal Times has a built-in bias, so The Post should not publish its work. The Fiscal Times, which has hired a team of journalists with experience at several prominent news organizations, insists that it has no policy agenda and is independent of any influence by Mr. Peterson.
 The Post published a correction on Tuesday, saying that the article should have explained the connections to Mr. Peterson, but the correction did not address the propriety of the paper's relationship with The Fiscal Times. Andrew Alexander, The Post's ombudsman, said Tuesday that he was looking into that question.
 ''We wouldn't put anything in the paper that we didn't believe was independent journalism,'' said Marcus W. Brauchli, executive editor of The Post. ''We had complete editorial control. Our editors conceived of the story. We asked if The Fiscal Times was interested in producing the story. We edited the story.''
 The inaugural article's authors were Eric Pianin, the Fiscal Times's Washington editor and a former Post reporter and editor; and Elaine S. Povich, a former reporter for Newsday. Mr. Pianin said that Mr. Peterson was not involved in news coverage, but that the authority to hire and fire the top editors rested with Mr. Peterson's son Michael. The Fiscal Times signed several prominent journalists as contributors, including other Post alumni and Edmund L. Andrews, who recently left The New York Times.
 Critics of The Fiscal Times said that first article was not evenhanded and failed to acknowledge criticism of the commission proposal. Dean Baker, an economist who contributes to several news organizations, wrote on Politico.com that the episode ''marks the unfortunate demise of The Washington Post as a serious newspaper.''
 Several news organizations that have sprung up in recent years, including Politico and ProPublica, also have a dominant backer and supply material to established newspapers. (The New York Times has published articles by ProPublica.)
 Politico is owned by the Allbritton family, which has ties to prominent Republicans, and ProPublica's financing comes primarily from Herbert and Marion Sandler, who have been major Democratic donors. What sets The Fiscal Times apart is its relatively narrow focus on issues that are also pet causes of its sponsor.
 Frank Sesno, director of the School of Media and Public Affairs at the George Washington University, said only time would tell how reliable The Fiscal Times was, and whether The Post's relationship to the new group was a mistake. But Mr. Sesno said the arrangement was troubling.
 ''I don't think it's possible to have organizations where there's a single source of funding, and not think there's a point of view,'' he said. ''There can be big ethical problems with jobbing out reporting to an organization when there's a discernable point of view.''

HEADLINE: Home Contracts Fall, Thwarting Optimism

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
The number of houses placed under contract fell sharply in November in the first drop in nearly a year, figures released Tuesday show. It was the clearest sign yet that predictions of another downturn in real estate may become a reality.
 The National Association of Realtors said that its index of pending home sales plunged to 96 from a revised level of 114.3 in October. Analysts had predicted a drop, but nothing like that. 
 ''We thought it would drop 2 percent,'' said Jennifer Lee of BMO Capital Markets. ''When you see 16 percent, the first thing you say is, what the heck happened here?'' 
 Since the majority of pending sales become final in six weeks to two months, the index is considered a reliable indicator of where the market is headed. The index is calculated by comparing the number of pending sales with the level of 2001, when the index was formulated. 
 The data indicates that the weakest parts of the country are the Northeast and Midwest, both of which fell 26 percent in November from the previous month after adjusting for seasonal variations. The South dropped 15 percent, while the West was off 3 percent.
 Ms. Lee called the drop from October to November ''unnerving'' but said that the index remained well above the level of a year ago. In November 2008, when the financial crisis was at its peak and buying a home required a faith in the future that many did not feel, the index was 83.1. 
 As the overall economy improves and the employment situation grows a little less dire, the question becomes whether real estate can muddle through -- or if it will need a new round of government support to ward off another damaging downturn.
 There are plenty of reasons for worry. The Obama administration's effort to compel lenders and servicers to modify loans has not been a success. Many of these owners will eventually lose their homes to foreclosure.
 Meanwhile, a quarter of homeowners with mortgages owe more than their houses are worth. If prices start dropping again, some will be induced to walk away, further undermining the market.
 ''I wouldn't rule out more stimulus, especially in an election year,'' said Ivy Zelman, an analyst.
 Last year's stimulus efforts, however expensive and divisive, calmed a market where prices had plummeted by a third. Even now, the government's efforts to push down interest rates and entice buyers with a tax credit appear to be having an effect, keeping a weak market from getting weaker.
 Walter Martin and Paloma Munoz, artists in Dingmans Ferry, Pa., are a stimulus success story. They are paying $360,000 for a new home 10 miles away without even having an offer for their current home.
 ''The new home has enough space for us both to have studios,'' Ms. Munoz said. ''The price is amazing, we are getting a mortgage at a 5.125 rate, and we qualify for a $6,500 credit.''
 It is a leap of faith, she acknowledged, but an eminently sensible one. ''When houses were expensive, everyone wanted to buy, and now that they're cheap everyone is scared,'' she said.
 Buyers like Ms. Munoz and Mr. Martin are outnumbered, however, by people who think the market still has room to fall. While some of these may indeed be scared, others simply see a virtue in patience. 
 ''With two growing boys, we are busting out of our small house,'' said Stephen Sencer, deputy general counsel at Emory University in Atlanta. ''But I'm still waiting for sellers to capitulate.'' His agent is telling Mr. Sencer that may happen in the spring.
 Starting from a low of 80.4 last January, pending sales rose for nine consecutive months in 2009. The index proved a harbinger of both completed sales, which began climbing in April, and prices, which started rising over the summer.
 As the Nov. 30 expiration of the tax credit drew near, would-be buyers hastened to secure deals. Sales in November roared at a 6.54 million annual pace, the highest since February 2007. 
 At the last minute, Congress extended and broadened the credit. The urgency immediately dissipated. ''We were really, really pushing hard, and I think everyone just wore out,'' said Steve Havig, president of Lakes Area Realty of Minneapolis.
 Buyers now have until April 30 to qualify for the credit. Many analysts say the effect this time around will be mild.
 ''It could turn out the second credit has such a small impact it doesn't show up in the data,'' said Patrick Newport of IHS Global Insight.
 Nevertheless, he predicts the downturn this time will be gentler. ''The economy is improving, and that is what the market needs to get back on a sustainable path,'' Mr. Newport said.
 Long before the tax credit ends, another stimulus effort is due to disappear. The Federal Reserve has bought more than a trillion dollars of mortgage-backed securities in a successful effort to push down mortgage rates. The Fed is scheduled to wind down the program by March 31. 
 Rates are already moving higher, exceeding 5 percent in some lender surveys. Perhaps as a result, mortgage applications to buy homes in late December were a third lower than during the corresponding period in 2008, the Mortgage Bankers Association said.
 The Fed's Open Market Committee left itself leeway in its December meeting to start buying again, saying it ''will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities.''
 Rising rates could hamper Mr. Martin and Ms. Munoz's search for a buyer for their old house. 
 ''It's been on the market for almost three months,'' she said. ''We have had very few viewings.''

HEADLINE: Wall St. Ends Mixed on Disappointing Home Sales

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Major stock indexes ended mixed Tuesday, a day after the Dow Jones industrials soared more than 150 points on upbeat manufacturing reports in the United States and China. Uncertainty over crucial reports this week on employment and the service industry also kept buyers at bay.
 The Commerce Department reported that factory orders roseby more than twice as much had been expected in November, reflecting demand in the steel, computer and chemical industries. The gain of 1.1 percent easily beat the 0.5 percent forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. 
 But the number of buyers who agreed to purchase previously occupied homes fell sharply in November, an indication that sales will fall this winter. The National Association of Realtors said its index of pending home sales declined 16 percent, the first drop after nine months of gains. Some drop had been expected as investors raced earlier to buy homes ahead of a tax credit deadline, which was later extended.
 In addition, a strengthening dollar held stocks to modest gains. A strong dollar makes commodities and shares of the companies that produce them less attractive to foreign buyers. It also hurts the profits of companies that do business overseas.
 Investors continue to search for clues about the economy in 2010 after a nine-month rally pushed stocks to steep gains for 2009. Now, analysts say, further signs of strengthening are needed to help stocks hold those gains. Major stock indexes stand at 15-month highs.
 The Dow industrials slipped 11.94 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,572.02. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.53 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,136.52, its highest close since Oct. 1, 2008. The Nasdaq edged up 0.29, or less than 0.1 percent, to 2,308.71.
 Crude oil rose 26 cents to settle at $81.77 a barrel in New York trading.
 The early days of January are when many investors, including pension funds as well as individuals, pump money into the markets as they set up their investment strategies for the year. Markets often rise as the new money arrives.
 Nick Kalivas, vice president for financial research at MF Global in Chicago, said, however, that investors were cautious ahead of reports on the service industry and employment later in the week because they wanted to confirm that the economy was healing.
 ''There is a lot of data out the next couple of days that people want to see before they chase a market at its highs,'' Mr. Kalivas said.
 The Institute for Supply Management will report its index of activity in the service industry on Wednesday, and on Friday the market will get the most important economic reading of the month, the Labor Department's employment report.
 In the auto sector, shares of the Ford Motor Company soared after the automaker said its December sales jumped 33 percent fed by demand for midsize cars like the Ford Fusion, whose sales rose 83 percent. Ford also had its first full-year gain in United States market share since 1995. Ford rose 68 cents, or 6.6 percent, to $10.96.
 The FTSE 100 in London settled 22.16 points higher, at 5,522.50, while the DAX in Frankfurt was down 16.44 points, to 6,031.86. The CAC-40 in Paris was 1.06 points higher at 4,012.91. 
 In Asia, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 2.1 percent and Shanghai's main exchange climbed 1.2 percent.
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 14/32, to 96 27/32. The yield fell to 3.76 percent, from 3.82 percent late Monday.
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: Reprieve Eases Medical Crisis for Illegal Immigrants

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
ATLANTA -- After a largely sleepless night, Cruz Constancia got up Tuesday morning wondering whether this would be the day that she finally stopped receiving dialysis without charge. 
 It was not. When Ms. Constancia, an illegal immigrant from El Salvador, arrived at her dialysis clinic at 6 a.m., she was escorted promptly to her recliner. ''I thanked God,'' she said after concluding the three-hour session, ''because he is really the only one that can allow us to continue our treatments.''
More immediately, it was Grady Memorial Hospital that allowed it on Tuesday.
 In early October, when Grady, Atlanta's public hospital, closed its outpatient dialysis unit for budgetary reasons, it agreed to pay for three months of dialysis at private clinics for about 50 dislocated patients. The patients, mostly illegal immigrants with no access to insurance, signed documents stating they understood that Grady's payments would end on Jan. 3. Until then, the hospital would help them relocate to their home countries or other states. 
 But only a few immigrants left, and many of those who remain acknowledge that they have done little to explore what they regard as untenable options at home. Nonetheless, Grady officials announced this week that they would extend the deadline to Feb. 3, and continue to pay for dialysis and relocation services until then.
 ''We think it's the right thing to do,'' said Matt Gove, a senior vice president at Grady, ''to help give patients more time to make long-term arrangements.''
 The one-month reprieve prolongs a standoff that has become emblematic of the medical crisis facing illegal immigrants. An estimated 7 million of the country's 11 million illegal immigrants have no health coverage and are not eligible for government insurance programs like Medicare and Medicaid. 
 Ms. Constancia, 44, heard the news about the extension Tuesday from a nurse with Fresenius Medical Services, which operates her dialysis clinic in an Atlanta office park. ''To think that today was my last day, and then hear that I've got another one makes me happy,'' she said. ''Obviously, I was scared because my life depends on this.''
 When serious illness strikes, many immigrants have few options beyond presenting themselves at charity hospitals like Grady. Supported by direct appropriations from Fulton and DeKalb Counties, as well as insurance payments subsidized by state and federal taxpayers, the hospital accepts patients regardless of their insurance or immigration status.
 But caring for uninsured immigrants has imposed a heavy financial burden, particularly for public hospitals with broad missions to care for the indigent. At Grady, where thrice-weekly dialysis treatments cost about $50,000 a year, the outpatient clinic ran a deficit of $3.5 million in 2008. That was one-tenth of the hospital's loss that year, although the clinic served only about 90 patients. 
 The hospital's recently reconfigured board, eager to demonstrate its newfound discipline, announced last summer that it would close the clinic. The offer to provide three months of transitional dialysis came later, in unsuccessful negotiations to end a lawsuit filed by patients. A state court judge has twice dismissed the case, but on Tuesday the patients' lawyer filed a notice of appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court.
 To a degree, Grady's extension of its deadline may be beside the point. For reasons that Mr. Gove has not explained, the hospital made its contract with Fresenius for a year, locking in a payment rate of $280 per session. While Grady had said it would cut off assistance after Jan. 3, Fresenius officials consider the contract to require treatment -- at Grady's expense -- until Sept. 1. 
 ''Our understanding of the contract is that we will treat the Grady patients that are referred to us for a period of one year, and we expect to be reimbursed,'' said Terry L. Morris, a spokeswoman for Fresenius.
 Mr. Gove said the hospital would consider assisting patients beyond Feb. 3 case by case. He declined to say whether it might pay for some until September. 
 ''It should be clear to the patients that there's a responsibility on their side to continue trying to find a long-term plan because at some point this care won't be available,'' Mr. Gove said.
 He said that he did not know how much Grady had spent on the patients since the clinic's closing, but that a rough calculation put the figure at close to $700,000.
 In interviews Monday and Tuesday, some patients said they had not made detailed investigations of options for dialysis in their own countries. They said that they were convinced it would not be economically viable and that the quality of care would be poor. Several mentioned that two Grady dialysis patients who returned to Mexico had died (as has one who stayed in Atlanta). 
 Most of the seven patients interviewed said their plan was to stay put until Grady stopped paying, and then to present themselves at emergency rooms if necessary. Federal law requires that emergency rooms treat anyone in serious jeopardy. Going without dialysis can be fatal in as little as two weeks. 
 ''I'm going to stay here until there's really not a hope of getting it any more,'' said Jesus Neave, 32, who crossed illegally from his native Mexico in 1992 and was diagnosed with kidney disease four years later.
 Like the others, Mr. Neave, a maintenance worker, said he would not be able to make enough in Mexico to afford regular dialysis. ''Mexico is my country,'' he said, ''but over there if you don't have money, the doctors won't treat you.''
 Ms. Constancia said the same of El Salvador: ''People die very fast. The way it works down there is that if you do not have money, they don't put medicine in your machine.''
 Several of the patients said the nearest dialysis provider would be a four-or-five-hour drive from their towns. Many said their families and support systems were all in the United States. 
 While recognizing that Grady is providing care they would not receive at home, some said it had been unfair to withdraw it. ''If somebody holds your hand to support you and then stops, you're going to fall,'' said Bineet Kaur, an Indian who said she had had overstayed a visa by three years.
 ''They don't have the obligation, but they have a moral duty to help us,'' said Rosa Lira, 78, a legal immigrant from Mexico. ''They cannot let us die.''
 Many of the immigrants said they simply had no plan for when Grady stopped paying the bills. 
 ''The only thing that came to my mind is if they don't treat me I would go to the emergency room,'' said Adolfo Sanchez, 31, an illegal immigrant from Mexico. ''At Grady.'' 
 THE BREAKING POINT: Gaining an Extra Month. This is the third in a series of articles about closing the dialysis unit at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta. Previous articles: nytimes.com/national

HEADLINE: Bulgarian Journalist Gunned Down in Sofia

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE and DAN BILEFSKY; Dan Bilefsky contributed reporting from Prague.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
A prominent radio journalist and author of a book on Bulgaria's gangsters was shot and killed Tuesday in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, the first such murder since a new government was elected last July promising to clamp down on organized crime and corruption. 
 The shooting adds to a lengthy list of apparent contract killings that have stained the country's reputation since it achieved membership in the European Union in 2007, and it prompted the European Commission on Tuesday to urge the Bulgarian authorities to bring the killers to justice. 
 The victim, Bobi Tsankov, was killed in central Sofia in broad daylight, and two other men were wounded, Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov and the Bulgarian police told the Focus news agency. 
 Mark Gray, a spokesman for the European Commission, the E.U.'s executive body, said the commission's ''immediate thoughts are with the family of those affected by the shooting.''
 But he also added: ''Shootings continue to be a problem that needs to be urgently addressed in Bulgaria. Any shooting is unacceptable, and we hope that the Bulgarian authorities will bring those that have perpetrated this act to justice as quickly as possible.''
 Despite Mr. Tsankov's high-profile role in exposing the Bulgarian underworld, there was some uncertainty about the motive for the fatal attack on Mr. Tsankov.
 Evgeniy Daynov, a Bulgarian political commentator, said Mr. Tsankov was not just a chronicler of the Bulgarian underworld but someone who enjoyed inhabiting it. 
 ''He was a man who liked to go around Sofia in a giant S.U.V. surrounded by bodyguards and boasted about his gangster affiliations,'' Mr. Daynov said. ''It was part act and part reality. In a fragile democracy like Bulgaria, the gangsters are the rock stars and this is what Bobi tried to be.'' 
 Mr. Daynov said the killing was a blow for Prime Minister Boiko Borisov, a center-right leader who has made his ability to fight organized crime a critical test of his government.
 In 2008 there were more than 125 contract killings in Bulgaria, according to a list compiled by the United States Embassy there.

HEADLINE: What's in a Naming Right? Certainly Not Cash

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR. 
E-mail: sandor@nytimes.com

 BODY:
What shall we call the new stadium that will house the Jets and the Giants starting next season?
 Without a naming-rights deal, it is New Meadowlands Stadium, a blah-yet-refreshing reminder of the era before names like Invesco, Reliant, Ford, Lucas Oil, Gillette, Qwest, FedEx and Heinz adorned N.F.L. homes.
 For the Giants and the Jets, finding a naming-rights buyer for the new stadium will take time. If they planned to dedicate revenue from such a deal to help pay their construction debt, they will have to use money from other sources. 
 The market has been largely dormant and may never return to its prerecession peak, when Citigroup agreed in late 2006 to pay the Mets $400 million over 20 years to name the team's ballpark Citi Field and Barclays followed soon after with a similarly priced deal to put its moniker on the Nets' proposed arena in Brooklyn.
 ''The market is still completely frozen,'' said Jim Biegalski, the senior vice president for consulting at the Marketing Arm, a sports marketing company based in Dallas. ''From an overall sponsorship perspective, naming rights have such a taboo connotation that very few marketers will entertain a conversation about it.''
 He said that it might take two or three years for the market to exhibit signs of significant life.
 Meanwhile, New Meadowlands, Cowboys Stadium and Nationals Park in Washington await a turn in the market. Soon, Land Shark Stadium, the home of the Miami Dolphins, will lose its corporate name. It will revert to one of its former appellations, Dolphin Stadium, after Tuesday night's Orange Bowl. 
 The short-term arrangement announced last year did not pay the Dolphins any money; it was a marketing deal with Jimmy Buffett, the singer and Land Shark Lager entrepreneur.
 The biggest naming-rights deal anywhere was supposed to come to the Meadowlands. The prospect of two teams, the Giants and the Jets, inhabiting the same stadium, was supposed to yield the fattest fee (unless the Yankees changed their minds and sold naming rights to their new stadium). Allianz, the German insurer, was willing to pay $25 million a year to puts its name on what was going to be the only stadium in the N.F.L. with two teams.
 But talks collapsed in September 2008 after sharp criticism about the company's Nazi past, which included insuring facilities at Auschwitz and other concentration camps. The unraveling of that agreement came days before Lehman Brothers lurched into bankruptcy, which accelerated the crisis in the foundering economy.
 Still, on the day Lehman declared its insolvency, one stadium deal was announced: Target Corporation said it would put its name on the Minnesota Twins' new ballpark for a quarter-century at perhaps $5 million annually.
 Then naming rights turned toxic. 
 The Citi Field deal was excoriated as a symbol of corporate excess and egomania. Citigroup and other banks that received federal bailout money -- and had existing naming-rights deals and other sports sponsorships -- were viewed as spendthrifts. Citi could not find an escape clause from its Mets contract.
 Bank of America, which received bailout cash, stepped away from a deal worth more than $10 million a year to be the new Yankee Stadium's top sponsor and opted for a less expensive sponsorship.
 The recession and the departure of the star architect Frank Gehry led to the renegotiation of some terms of the Barclays-Nets deal. According to a bond document, the arena naming rights were halved. 
 The Nets insist that they have given Barclays more for its sponsorship money and that the bank's total annual payments, including fees for other rights, remain unchanged.
 The Giants, the Jets, the Cowboys and the Nationals' expectations have been scaled back or deferred. A Cowboys spokesman, Rich Dalrymple, said in an e-mail message, ''The subject has pretty much gone away since the stadium here opened.''
 Biegalski, the marketing executive, said that the recession ''has made marketers look deeply at naming rights and how they drive their brands.'' He added that he could not foresee deals priced like Citigroup's unless they give the sponsor equity in the stadium or the team. 
 Steven D. Korenblat, a partner at the law firm Bryan Cave who negotiated Citigroup's deal with the Mets, said that companies that were formerly interested in naming rights were looking at sponsoring events, which tend to be less expensive and have shorter terms. He added, ''I think any stadium that is built with the expectation of naming rights is going to have to adapt and try to seek a greater number of lesser deals.'' 
 In a way, that is what the Jets and the Giants have done, even as they hope to one day snare a naming-rights deal. They have signed four cornerstone partners, at $8 million a year (more than many companies pay for naming rights). MetLife and Anheuser-Busch signed up as sponsors in 2008, before the economy tanked. Pepsi and Verizon made sponsorship deals last year.
 Giants and Jets officials did not respond to requests for comment about the status of their talks with potential naming-rights buyers. But Mark Lamping, the president of what we'll call NewMead, wrote in an e-mail message that ''we continue to have positive discussions but at this point we do not have anything we wish to discuss publicly.''

HEADLINE: Fresh Arrival In Cul-de-Sac Is Optimism

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: MORENO VALLEY, Calif. 

 BODY:
Phil Winkler pays a neighborhood kid to mow his lawn, that small-bore transaction of the American suburb, where adults are generally busy and teenagers offer a price that's right. But for Mr. Winkler, the relinquishing of his mower was something remarkable. 
 Only a few months ago, he was selling auto parts on eBay to help pay his bills. Out of work, he depended on his wife and his unemployment checks to keep his family clothed and fed. The situation was much the same in the homes around his: unemployed dads, women on small salaries carrying the weight, home repairs and yard work relegated to adults with too much time to spare. 
 Pockets of America are haltingly on the mend, and the Beth Court cul-de-sac here is one of them. A dozen lives unraveled on the block during the recession; now the empty houses are full, and Mr. Winkler and the other fathers are working again.
 The remnants of financial disaster linger. Many neighbors have no credit cards. Repossessed family cars have not been replaced. Vacation destinations remain for most the stuff of advertisements in newspapers from which coupons continue to be clipped. 
 But hanging on has been replaced, in part, by holding steady.
 The teacher who got a pink slip last spring has been hired by a new school, and the guy on the corner who had struggled for months with the bank over his mortgage finally got a loan modification. The lawn of an empty house, littered with broken bikes and weeds over the summer, has been made pristine once more by its new owners.
 ''Things are pretty much better around here,'' said Eladio Soto, a landscaper, who is among the unemployed fathers who has found work again. ''I am thinking about a little minivan. That's my life goal right now.''
 Beginning last January, The New York Times made regular visits to Beth Court, about 60 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, to chronicle how the foreclosure crisis had reshaped a middle-class neighborhood. Four of the eight houses went through foreclosure, and the others barely escaped the same fate. Beth Court was a microcosm of a nation in deep recession, a block of neighbors whose bad choices -- often with the complicity of lending agencies -- came crashing into a global economic downturn.
 Now, a year later, California's unemployment rate continues to grow, its housing market remains depressed and the state's fiscal situation is dire. But the economic and policy shifts that are slowly changing parts of the country are also making a mark here.
 Mr. Winkler, a factory worker, was hired at the end of September by Kimberly-Clark at the company's mill in Fullerton, about 50 miles from here. He had gone more than year without a job.
 The commute is long, and so are the hours. When he works the overnight shift, he can go days without seeing his two daughters, who had become accustomed to Mr. Winkler's shuttling them to and from school and taking charge in times of trouble at home. 
 When Eva, the 12-year-old, was doing poorly in school, Mr. Winkler literally followed her from class to class for a week. She did not care for it. Good thing for both of them she is on the honor roll now, he said.
 ''I'm not going to complain,'' Mr. Winkler said the other day at his dining room table. ''It's a lot of work and a lot of hours, but it's more interesting than my old job because I stay so busy. I have insurance for the kids. I'm happy. I'm thankful. And in four months, I'll be getting a raise.'' 
 His next-door neighbor, Mr. Soto, has managed to steady his home life after being forced to sell his house to make ends meet. He has reduced his monthly housing costs by about $900 by renting back from the new owner. He misses the large truck, repossessed by his lender, that had ferried his family of seven. 
 ''We don't go places as a family anymore,'' Mr. Soto said. ''The other day my daughter's band was playing in Pomona, so my wife had to stay with some kids here. I am a little sad about that.''
 In recent years, nearly every homeowner on Beth Court took thousands of dollars of equity out of their homes as values skyrocketed; properties that cost $120,000 in 1997 were worth more than $350,000 at the height of the market. 
 The balloons have since floated back to earth, and the way houses are paid for has, too. Of the four houses on Beth Court that were foreclosed on between October 2008 and August 2009, two are now owned by families that got loans through the federal Housing Finance Agency program that allows borrowers to buy homes with lower down payments than conventional loans.
 One of them is the Almeida family. Joy now nearly bursts from the doors of their home at 11054 Beth Court, a two-story house with three bedrooms and a nice backyard. Last summer, it was a house in foreclosure, where children sat home alone in front of the television while their mother marched dolefully to her job at the mall.
 In late October, the house was bought by Jose Almeida for $150,000, about 70 percent of what the previous owners paid for it in 2003. It is the Almeidas' first home; they previously lived in an apartment in a struggling neighborhood in Los Angeles.
 ''We put down everything we have, but we're so happy,'' said Mr. Almeida, standing with his wife, Maria, on the newly tiled kitchen floor. ''It's so quiet at night, my wife says to me, 'How come we can't hear anything?' '' 
 Connie and Ted Hanson were anomalies on the sidelines of Beth Court -- retired, older and living at the entrance to the cul-de-sac on adjoining Parkland Avenue. Having saved and spent wisely over the decades, they were able to travel to Europe each summer and take off in their camper whenever the whim grabbed them, as it often did. 
 And for years, they were the glue that kept the neighborhood together -- leading the neighborhood association, tending to neglected front lawns, checking in on troubled friends and giving odd jobs to the neighborhood kids.
 But the Hansons' daughter lost her teaching job in Northern California last summer, and in a sudden reversal of fortunes, the Hansons now look to the neighborhood for support as they have taken in their daughter and her two sons, ages 13 and 9. (Turtles and tarantulas were part of the package.) 
 The Hansons once paid the Winkler girls to feed their cat and water the plants while they were away; now their 13-year-old grandson cuts the Winklers' lawn. The strain of three new mouths to feed and that many more loads of laundry is upon the Hansons.
 ''It's not exactly a hardship,'' Mr. Hanson said. ''We're still going to Europe next year.'' 
 ''Yes, but we don't have the extra income anymore,'' Mrs. Hanson countered. ''You go to spend $100 now and you think twice.''
 There is still joblessness on the block, but Adrian Blanco, who lost his job as an electrician when he hurt his back a year ago, shares the unyielding sense of optimism here these days. After months of being rebuffed for a mortgage modification -- something many troubled homeowners have run into -- Mr. Blanco got his monthly payment reduced.
 Mr. Blanco and his wife, Gloria, had just come back from a leisurely walk on a recent Sunday afternoon, relaxing together for the first time in months. 
 ''I haven't found work yet, and I am in constant pain,'' he said. ''But I'm happy. I'm still here.''

HEADLINE: Asia Gains A Tech Edge By Backing Start-Ups

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

DATELINE: SUNNYVALE, Calif. 

 BODY:
For years, the process remained relatively static: PC makers like Hewlett-Packard and Apple, with well-staffed research labs and design departments, would dream up their next product and then hire a Chinese or Taiwanese fabricator to manufacture the largest number of units at the lowest possible cost.
 But lately, this traditional division of labor has been upended. Many of those Asian companies have moved well beyond manufacturing to seize greater control over the look and feel of tomorrow's personal computers, smartphones and even Web sites. 
 The investment arms of large Taiwanese and Chinese manufacturers have created an investment network in Silicon Valley operating under the radar that pumps money into a variety of chip, software and services companies to gain the latest technology. As a result, some Asian manufacturers have proved more willing than entrenched Silicon Valley venture capitalists to back some risky endeavors. 
 ''In the past, the manufacturers would sneak around and get inside information on technology by investing in these companies,'' said K. Bobby Chao, the managing partner at DFJ DragonFund China, a business that invests in technology companies in China and the United States. ''Now, they're more involved, more visible and charging after more complex maneuvers.''
 As manufacturing of electronics in the United States began moving offshore decades ago, some feared the American economy would suffer. But the American companies, as well as economists and policy makers, said that as long as the high-value jobs like research and design remained in the United States, there was little danger. 
 Asian investments in Silicon Valley present some risks for America's top technology companies, which could lose their connection to top innovations. 
 Asian manufacturers like Foxconn or Quanta, as a result, could wrestle away the edge in research and design.
 ''The manufacturers have gotten more competitive as it relates to innovation, and in some instances they're already competing directly with their customers,'' said Patrick Moorhead, a vice president at Advance Micro Devices, a major PC chip maker.
 The investments by Asian companies have already started to pay off. At the Consumer Electronics Show this week in Las Vegas, people will see laptops that end sluggish start times and instead boot up instantly and TVs that do not require remotes because they can see the gestures of viewers. These features are a result of strategic investments in technology by Asian manufacturers. One Asian manufacturer turned investor is Quanta, based in Taiwan, which has long been one of the largest manufacturers of laptops and personal computers for major brands like H.P., Acer and Dell. 
 To keep those customers coming back, it needs unique product designs and technologies that give it an edge over competitors. Last October, Quanta invested $10 million into Tilera, a chip start-up based in San Jose, Calif., in the heart of Silicon Valley, that has designed a radical computer processor. Tilera is gambling that it can take business from the major chip makers like Intel and A.M.D.
 Quanta also joined a group investing $16 million in Canesta, another chip maker based in Silicon Valley. When combined with a digital camera, Canesta's products let computers, televisions and other devices view objects in three dimensions. That means that a person could move photos or documents around a PC's desktop or change TV channels simply by waving a hand. 
 Elton Yang, a vice president at Quanta, said there was a high likelihood that the technology could make its way into laptops in 2010. Eventually all makers of personal computers will have a chance to buy Canesta's technology, but Quanta's investment gives it a temporary design lead. 
 ''The PC companies are looking for a new future, and we want to attract them to our machines,'' Mr. Yang said. Over the last 10 years, Canesta has made its pitch to more than 100 venture capitalists in Silicon Valley -- only to be rejected time and again. James Spare, the chief executive of Canesta, praised the willingness of companies like Quanta to back risky start-ups needing many years to turn ideas into products. 
 ''It's no secret that these companies make most of the devices we use in our daily lives,'' Mr. Spare said. ''And they're only becoming more and more influential when it comes to innovation and guiding technology choices.''
 Foxconn, one of the largest electronics makers, has found technology investments, too. It has backed Innovation Works, an investment and incubation company started last year by the former president of Google's Chinese operations, Kai-fu Lee.
 With $115 million at its disposal, Innovation Works, based in Beijing, has pledged to ''build dream teams to collect, analyze, prioritize and execute on the most promising ideas'' in the Internet and mobile computing markets. 
 Ambitious Taiwanese manufacturers are now talking to influential component makers like Intel and A.M.D. to help shape what tomorrow's chips and hard drives will do. 
 ''They do have a much bigger voice in what companies are doing on the chip level than before,'' said Mr. Moorhead. ''We are interfacing more with them than we ever have.''
 Some former manufacturers have already made the transition and are gaining global brand recognition. Acer and Asustek are Taiwan's most prominent computer brands, but both companies were contract fabricators for major American companies. Some of their executives steeped in this manufacturing tradition now run the investment arms of the companies. 
 For example, the Silicon Valley start-up DeviceVM has developed software that lets computers boot up in about five seconds, rather than the minutes many computers can take to start. Both Asustek and Acer, through its investment arm called iD Innovation, have put money into DeviceVM, and the company's software now appears on computers from a variety of makers including the world's largest PC company, H.P.
 The Asian companies often back projects that Silicon Valley's financial heavyweights pass on because pay offs are too low and take too long. The Asian companies are ''thinking that they didn't get their fair share of the technology pie in the past,'' Mr. Chao said. ''Now they have money and will take the risks needed to build up new levels of expertise.''
 For entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, the money flowing from Taiwan and China represents a blessing. 
 ''It's great,'' said Mr. Spare of Canesta, ''to have another pool of money to go after.''

HEADLINE: Senator Dodd Will Not Seek Re-election, Democrats Say

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the embattled Connecticut Democrat who was facing an increasingly tough bid for a sixth term in the United States Senate, has decided not to seek re-election this year, Democrats familiar with his plans said Wednesday.
 Mr. Dodd, 65, a pivotal figure in the major debates now confronting Congress, is to announce his decision at a news conference Wednesday afternoon in Connecticut. 
The decision came hours after another Democratic senator, Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota, also announced that he would not seek re-election this November. The developments underscored the fragility of the Democrats' 60-vote Senate majority, which is just enough to block Republican filibusters. Democratic incumbents also face serious challenges in Arkansas, Colorado, Nevada and Pennsylvania among other states.
 In this case, Mr. Dodd was already considered one of the most vulnerable Democrats facing re-election this November, and party officials had been privately hoping he would step aside. His move opens the way for the state's highly popular attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, to run. Democrats and Republicans said he would be a much stronger candidate in what is a Democratic state.
 Mr. Dodd's decision was reported by The Washington Post on its Web site late Tuesday night, and later confirmed by his associates. As of early Wednesday morning, Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, had not heard from Mr. Dodd about his decision, according to aides to Mr. Reid.
 Mr. Dodd has been a fixture in the Senate since his election in 1980 and had been at the center of the contentious recent debates on overhauling the health care system and financial regulation. In November he proposed an overhaul that included consolidating bank regulators, creating a consumer financial protection agency and imposing new restraints on exotic financial instruments and credit rating agencies. 
 But his standing in Connecticut had been on the decline starting when he made an unsuccessful run for the presidency in 2008 -- moving his family to Iowa -- and when questions arose about a disputed loan he took from Countrywide Financial, the fallen subprime company.
 On the Republican side, Mr. Dodd faced the prospect of running against Linda McMahon, a political novice who was prepared to use her vast personal fortune to beat the incumbent senator. Also challenging the senator was former Representative Rob Simmons, a Republican. 
 Mr. Dodd's troubles escalated in 2008 when he was one of two Democratic senators -- the other was Kent Conrad of North Dakota -- who had been accused of receiving improper discounts from Countrywide Financial. In August, the Senate Select Committee on Ethics ruled that it had found ''no credible evidence'' that the senators had violated gift rules in accepting the loans.
 But the committee criticized Mr. Dodd and Mr. Conrad for not avoiding the appearance of impropriety.
 Both Mr. Dodd and Mr. Conrad had been members of the ''Friends of Angelo'' V.I.P. program at the bank, named after Angelo R. Mozilo, the chief executive of Countrywide.
 Polling in Connecticut suggested that Mr. Dodd had been hurt both by his association with Countrywide and by criticism for his role in legislation that appeared to clear the way for bonuses to be paid to executives of American International Group, the insurance firm that received a government bailout.
 Republicans had viewed the issues as powerful weapons to use against him, particularly considering the depth of anger toward A.I.G. and Countrywide.
 Even as his political prospects seemed to plummet, Mr. Dodd was so busy over the last few months that some colleagues have joked about whether 2009-10 should be called the ''Dodd Congress.'' 
 As chairman of the Senate banking committee, he had a central role in both the huge government rescue of the financial system and the economic stimulus package that was adopted at the start of last year. 
 Then, with his close friend, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, battling terminal brain cancer, Mr. Dodd stepped in as acting chairman of the Senate health committee, which became the first Congressional panel to approve a version of far-reaching health care legislation last year. 
 Amid all of this, Mr. Dodd found out early last summer that he was suffering from prostate cancer and spent the August recess undergoing surgery and recuperating. 
 He is said to be in good health now. But even as he has been at the center of the action on Capitol Hill, the looming re-election battle in Connecticut has seemed to weigh heavily on him. And his decision to retire did not surprise his Senate colleagues.

HEADLINE: If Fed Missed Bubble, How Will It See New One?

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
If only we'd had more power, we could have kept the financial crisis from getting so bad.
 That has been the position of Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, and other regulators. It explains why Mr. Bernanke and the Obama administration are pushing Congress to give the Fed more authority over financial firms.
 So let's consider what an empowered Fed might have done during the housing bubble, based on the words of the people who were running it.
 In 2004, Alan Greenspan, then the chairman, said the rise in home values was ''not enough in our judgment to raise major concerns.'' In 2005, Mr. Bernanke -- then a Bush administration official -- said a housing bubble was ''a pretty unlikely possibility.'' As late as May 2007, he said that Fed officials ''do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime market to the rest of the economy.'' 
 The fact that Mr. Bernanke and other regulators still have not explained why they failed to recognize the last bubble is the weakest link in the Fed's push for more power. It raises the question: Why should Congress, or anyone else, have faith that future Fed officials will recognize the next bubble? 
 Just this week, Mr. Bernanke went to the annual meeting of academic economists in Atlanta to offer his own history of Fed policy during the bubble. Most of his speech, though, was a spirited defense of the Fed's interest rate policy, complete with slides and formulas, like (pt - pt*) > 0. Only in the last few minutes did he discuss lax regulation. The solution, he said, was ''better and smarter'' regulation. He never acknowledged that the Fed simply missed the bubble. 
 This lack of self-criticism is feeding Congressional hostility toward the Fed. Mr. Bernanke is still likely to win confirmation for a second term, based on his aggressive and creative policies once the crisis began. But Congress hasn't decided whether to expand his regulatory authority and is considering reining in the Fed's other main mission -- setting interest rates. 
 A once-marginal proposal -- from Representative Ron Paul, the Texas Republican -- that would give Congress the power to review interest rate decisions recently passed the House and will soon be considered by the Senate. 
 Economists are generally horrified by this idea. If Congress could force Fed officials to answer questions about every interest rate move, the process could easily become politicized. A politicized central bank is a first step toward runaway inflation. 
 But politicizing monetary policy isn't the only mistake Congress could make. It also could end up going in the other direction and handing Fed officials more power without asking them to grapple with their failures.
 When Mr. Bernanke is challenged about the Fed's performance, he often points out that recognizing a bubble is hard. ''It is extraordinarily difficult,'' he said during his Senate confirmation hearing last month, ''to know in real time if an asset price is appropriate or not.'' 
 Most of the time, that's true. Do you know if stocks will keep going up? Is gold now in the midst of a bubble? What will happen to your house's value? Questions like these are usually an invitation to hubris.
 But the recent housing bubble was an exception. By any serious measure, houses in much of this country had become overvalued. From the late 1960s to 2000, the ratio of the median national house price to median income hovered from 2.9 to 3.2. By 2005, it had shot up to 4.5. In some places, buyers were spending twice as much on their monthly mortgage payment as they would have spent renting a similar house, without even considering the down payment. 
 More than a few people -- economists, journalists, even some Fed officials -- noticed this phenomenon. It wasn't that hard, if you were willing to look at economic fundamentals. You couldn't know exactly when or how far prices would fall, but it seemed clear they were out of control. Indeed, making that call was similar to what the Fed does when it sets interest rates: using concrete data to decide whether some part of the economy is too hot (or too cold). 
 And Fed officials could have had a real impact if they had decided to attack the bubble. Imagine if Mr. Greenspan, then considered an oracle, announced he was cracking down on wishful-thinking mortgages, as he had the authority to do. 
 So why did Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Bernanke get it wrong?
 The answer seems to be more psychological than economic. They got trapped in an echo chamber of conventional wisdom. Real estate agents, home builders, Wall Street executives, many economists and millions of homeowners were all saying that home prices would not drop, and the typically sober-minded officials at the Fed persuaded themselves that it was true. ''We've never had a decline in house prices on a nationwide basis,'' Mr. Bernanke said on CNBC in 2005.
 He and his colleagues fell victim to the same weakness that bedeviled the engineers of the Challenger space shuttle, the planners of the Vietnam and Iraq Wars, and the airline pilots who have made tragic cockpit errors. They didn't adequately question their own assumptions. It's an entirely human mistake.
 Which is why it is likely to happen again.
 What's missing from the debate over financial re-regulation is a serious discussion of how to reduce the odds that the Fed -- however much authority it has -- will listen to the echo chamber when the next bubble comes along. A simple first step would be for Mr. Bernanke to discuss the Fed's recent failures, in detail. If he doesn't volunteer such an accounting, Congress could request one.
 In the future, a review process like this could become a standard response to a financial crisis. Andrew Lo, an M.I.T. economist, has proposed a financial version of the National Transportation Safety Board -- an independent body to issue a fact-finding report after a crash or a bust. If such a board had existed after the savings and loan crisis, notes Paul Romer, the Stanford economist and expert on economic growth, it might have done some good.
 Whether we like it or not, the Fed really does seem to be the best agency to regulate financial firms. (It now has authority over only some firms.) As the lender of last resort, it already has a vested interest in the health of those firms. The Fed's prestige also tends to give it its pick of people who want to work on economic policy.
 ''The Federal Reserve has unparalleled expertise,'' Mr. Bernanke told Congress last month. ''We have a great group of economists, financial market experts and others who are unique in Washington in their ability to address these issues.''
 Fair enough. At some point, though, it sure would be nice to hear those experts explain how they missed the biggest bubble of our time.

HEADLINE: IRAN IS SHIELDING NUCLEAR EFFORTS IN TUNNEL MAZES

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
Last September, when Iran's uranium enrichment plant buried inside a mountain near the holy city of Qum was revealed, the episode cast light on a wider pattern: Over the past decade, Iran has quietly hidden an increasingly large part of its atomic complex in networks of tunnels and bunkers across the country. 
 In doing so, American government and private experts say, Iran has achieved a double purpose. Not only has it shielded its infrastructure from military attack in warrens of dense rock, but it has further obscured the scale and nature of its notoriously opaque nuclear effort. The discovery of the Qum plant only heightened fears about other undeclared sites. 
 Now, with the passing of President Obama's year-end deadline for diplomatic progress, that cloak of invisibility has emerged as something of a stealth weapon, complicating the West's military and geopolitical calculus. 
 The Obama administration says it is hoping to take advantage of domestic political unrest and disarray in Iran's nuclear program to press for a regimen of strong and immediate new sanctions. But a crucial factor behind that push for nonmilitary solutions, some analysts say, is Iran's tunneling -- what Tehran calls its strategy of ''passive defense.'' 
 Indeed, Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates has repeatedly discounted the possibility of a military strike, saying that it would only slow Iran's nuclear ambitions by one to three years while driving the program further underground.
 Some analysts say that Israel, which has taken the hardest line on Iran, may be especially hampered, given its less formidable military and intelligence abilities. 
 ''It complicates your targeting,'' said Richard L. Russell, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst now at the National Defense University. ''We're used to facilities being above ground. Underground, it becomes literally a black hole. You can't be sure what's taking place.''
 Even the Israelis concede that solid rock can render bombs useless. Late last month, the Israeli defense minister, Ehud Barak, told Parliament that the Qum plant was ''located in bunkers that cannot be destroyed through a conventional attack.''
 Heavily mountainous Iran has a long history of tunneling toward civilian as well as military ends, and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has played a recurring role -- first as a transportation engineer and founder of the Iranian Tunneling Association and now as the nation's president.
 There are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of big tunnels in Iran, according to American government and private experts, and the lines separating their uses can be fuzzy. Companies owned by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps of Iran, for example, build civilian as well as military tunnels.
 No one in the West knows how much, or exactly what part, of Iran's nuclear program lies hidden. Still, evidence of the downward atomic push is clear to the inquisitive. 
 Google Earth, for instance, shows that the original hub of the nuclear complex at Isfahan consists of scores of easily observed -- and easy to attack -- buildings. But government analysts say that in recent years Iran has honeycombed the nearby mountains with tunnels. Satellite photos show six entrances. 
 Iranian officials say years of veiled bombing threats prompted their country to exercise its ''sovereign right'' to protect its nuclear facilities by hiding them underground. That was their argument when they announced plans in November to build 10 uranium enrichment plants. Despite the improbability and bluster of the claim, Iran's tunneling history gave it a measure of credibility. 
 ''They will be scattered in the mountains,'' the chief of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Ali Akbar Salehi, told Iran's Press TV. ''We will be using the passive defense so that we don't need to have active defense, which is very expensive.''
 Mr. Gates, along with other Western officials, has dismissed that line of argument as cover for a covert arms program. 
 ''If they wanted it for peaceful purposes,'' he said of the Qum plant on CNN, ''there's no reason to put it so deep underground, no reason to be deceptive about it, keep it a secret for a protracted period of time.'' 
 Iran denies that its nuclear efforts are for military purposes and insists that it wants to unlock the atom strictly for peaceful aims, like making electricity. It says it wants to build many enrichment plants to fuel up to 20 nuclear power plants, a plan many economists question because Iran ranks second globally in oil and natural gas reserves.
 Ploy or not, any expansion seems unlikely to zoom ahead. After a decade of construction, Iran's main enrichment plant, at Natanz, operates at a tiny fraction of its capacity. The Qum plant is only half built. Nuclear experts say the new plants, if attempted, may not materialize for years or decades. Even so, they note that tunnels would be the easiest part of the plan and may get dug relatively soon.
 Despite the questions about whether the West can credibly threaten to destroy Iran's nuclear program, analysts insist that the United States, Israel and their allies will never rule out that option. The Pentagon, in fact, is racing to develop a powerful new tunnel-busting bomb.
 ''Deeply buried targets have been a problem forever,'' said Greg Duckworth, a civilian scientist who recently led a Pentagon research effort to pinpoint enemy tunnels. ''And it's getting worse.''
 A Tunnel Expert
 Mr. Ahmadinejad began professional life as a transportation engineer with close ties to the Revolutionary Guards and an abiding interest in tunnels.
 He helped found the Iranian Tunneling Association in 1998, according to the group's Web site. That year, the Tehran subway began a major expansion, and Iran, in secret, accelerated its nuclear program.
 In early 2004, while mayor of Tehran, Mr. Ahmadinejad served as chairman of the Sixth Iranian Tunneling Conference. He praised the leaders of ancient Persia for creating networks of subterranean waterways and called for the creation of new ''tunnels'' between the government, universities and professional groups.
 ''I ask God to help us all,'' he said in a paper. Such tunneling conferences, held regularly in Tehran, draw global manufacturers of tunnel-boring machines -- giant devices as big as locomotives that dig quickly through rocky strata. Terratec, an Australian maker, noted early last year that Iran had recently become ''one of the most active markets in the world.'' 
 Many of the companies keep offices in Tehran. Herrenknecht, a German firm considered the market leader, lists three. Engineers say Iran has hundreds of miles of civilian tunneling projects under way, including subways in Tehran, Isfahan, and Shiraz, highway tunnels across the country and water tunnels to irrigate the dry interior. 
 By all accounts, the seeds of the downward military shift were planted during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, when Iraq hit Tehran and other Iranian cities with waves of missiles. Constructing shelters, bunkers and tunnels became a patriotic duty.
 An Opposition Watchdog
 In 2002, the National Council of Resistance of Iran, an opposition group, revealed that Iran was building a secret underground nuclear plant at Natanz that turned out to be for enriching uranium. Enrichment plants can make fuel for reactors or, with a little more effort, atom bombs.
 Satellite photos showed the Iranians burying two cavernous halls roughly half the size of the Pentagon. Estimates put the thickness of overhead rock, dirt and concrete at 30 feet -- enough to frustrate bombs but not to guarantee the plant's survival. 
 The disclosure of Natanz set off the West's confrontation with Iran. Two years later, the International Atomic Energy Agency found to its surprise that Iran was tunneling in the mountains by the Isfahan site, where uranium is readied for enrichment. ''Iran failed to report to the agency in a timely manner,'' an I.A.E.A. paper said in diplomatic understatement. 
 Then, in late 2005, the Iranian opposition group held news conferences in Paris and London to announce that its spies had learned that Iran was digging tunnels for missile and atomic work at 14 sites, including an underground complex near Qum. The government, one council official said, was building the tunnels to conceal ''its pursuit of nuclear weapons.'' The council further charged that Mr. Ahmadinejad and the tunneling association were providing civilian cover for military work and acquisitions. 
 The council's assertions got little notice. Some Western experts saw them as overstated. Some questioned the council's objectivity because it sought the government's overthrow. Perhaps the biggest impediment was a suspicion of defectors at a time when the American invasion of Iraq was proving to be based in part on Iraqi dissidents' false claims about Saddam Hussein's unconventional weapons. 
 United Nations atomic inspectors did check out a few of the tunnels at Isfahan, but not at Qum because the plant was on a military base and thus off limits for inspection without strong evidence of suspicious activity.
 ''We followed whatever they came up with,'' Mohamed ElBaradei, the recently departed head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said of the council in an interview. ''And a lot of it was bogus.''
 Frank Pabian, a senior adviser on nuclear nonproliferation at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, strongly disagreed. ''They're right 90 percent of the time,'' he said of the council's disclosures about Iran's clandestine sites. ''That doesn't mean they're perfect, but 90 percent is a pretty good record.''
 In 2007, the council announced that Iran was tunneling in the mountains near Natanz, the sprawling enrichment site. Satellite photos confirmed that.
 And Qum became a vindication, though belatedly, in late September, when President Obama, flanked by the leaders of France and Britain, identified ''a covert uranium enrichment facility'' being constructed there. 
 Military Warrens
 In December, the opposition group capitalized on its new stature to issue a report on Iranian military tunneling. It said Iran had dug tunnels and bunkers for research facilities, ammunition storage, military headquarters and command and control centers. ''A group of factories'' in the mountains east of Tehran, it said, specialize in ''the manufacturing of nuclear warheads.'' 
 Over all, the report raised to 19, from 14, the number of locations where it said tunnels -- often multiple tunnels -- were hiding military bases and work on arms.
 American war planners see Iran's tunnels -- whatever their exact number and contents -- as a serious test of military abilities. Most say there is no easy way to wipe out a nuclear program that has been well hidden, widely dispersed and deeply buried. 
 Among the difficulties, military experts say, are decoy tunnels and false entrances, the identification of which requires good intelligence. The experts add that Iran's announcement about new enrichment plants may simply produce a blur of activity meant to confuse Western war planners. 
 David A. Kay, a nuclear specialist who led the fruitless search for unconventional arms in Iraq, said the hiding of a plant or two among the rocky labyrinths could pose a particular challenge for Israel. ''They have limited intelligence for targeting,'' Dr. Kay said, adding that the United States was better equipped to map out Iran's nuclear terrain.
 Raymond Tanter, an Iran expert at Georgetown University who served in the Reagan White House, agreed. ''So far, the tunneling has not succeeded to the point that the American technology couldn't get to it,'' he contended. ''But it makes Israel's options more problematic, because they have less of a military edge.''
 Doubts notwithstanding, the Obama administration has been careful to leave the military option on the table, and the Pentagon is racing to develop a deadly tunnel weapon.
 The device -- 20 feet long and called the Massive Ordnance Penetrator -- began as a 2004 recommendation from the Defense Science Board, a high-level advisory group to the Pentagon.
 ''A deep underground tunnel facility in a rock geology poses a significant challenge,'' the board wrote. ''Several thousand pounds of high explosives coupled to the tunnel are needed to blow down blast doors and propagate a lethal air blast.''
 The bomb carries tons of explosives and is considered 10 times more powerful than its predecessor. It underwent preliminary testing in 2007, and its first deployments are expected next summer. Its carrier is to be the B-2 stealth bomber.
 Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters in October that budget problems had delayed the weapon but that it was now back on track. Military officials deny having a specific target in mind. Still, Mr. Whitman added, war planners consider it ''an important capability.''

HEADLINE: Colorado Governor Won't Seek Second Term

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON and DAN FROSCH

DATELINE: DENVER 

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Ritter Jr. of Colorado, a first-term Democrat, and spokesman for a band of upstart Democratic governors in historically Republican strongholds in the West, will not seek a second term in office this fall, a Colorado Democrat with knowledge of the governor's plans said Tuesday. 
 ''He is publically announcing tomorrow that he is dropping out of the race,'' said the Democrat, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the situation, and so spoke on condition of anonymity. Mr. Ritter faced a tough race, with an apparently unified Republican party against him, a somewhat divided Democratic party on his flanks and a state still stumbling economically. But the news still shook Colorado politics, and shifted the dynamic of the fall contest, with no incumbent -- for better or worse -- to rally behind or to attack. 
 People close to Mr. Ritter, 53, said he would have an announcement on Wednesday at 11 a.m. Mountain Time.
 The governor, who grew up on a dairy farm in rural Colorado, often came off in public as boyish and geeky, if not sometimes simplistic in his enthusiasms, especially for alternative renewable energy that he hoped would help rebuild and reshape Colorado's economy.
 And more than once he took steps that ran counter to the wishes of other leaders in his party, most recently last year when he appointed Michael Bennet, Denver's former superintendent of schools, to fill the seat vacated by Ken Salazar, a Democrat who left the Senate to become secretary of the interior under President Obama.
 Many members in the Democratic-controlled state legislature had been vocal -- before Mr. Bennet's appointment and afterward -- in expressing their support for another choice, the former speaker of the state House of Representatives, Andrew Romanoff.
 Mr. Bennet, who is running for election this fall, will now face a potentially altered political terrain as well, with no champion in the governor's mansion in Denver to back him.
 Republicans, meanwhile have been sharpening their knives in Colorado for months in anticipation of the 2010 race. In 2006, Mr. Ritter, Denver's former district attorney, faced a deeply divided Republican Party, split between factions that had divided over the policies of former Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican who left office after eight years because of term limits.
 Republicans this year rallied early around a front-runner, Scott McInnis, a former Congressman who served in a largely rural district in the state's southern and western areas from 1993 to 2004.

HEADLINE: Immigration's New Year

 BODY:
The quest for overhauling immigration received two very welcome lifts on New Year's Day. 
 Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City, at his inauguration, pledged to help the Obama administration pass immigration reform. Mr. Bloomberg is a force to reckon with, as he proved with his national campaign against illegal guns. On the same day, four young people in Miami, current or former students at Miami Dade College, began their own determined march to Washington in an effort to bring pressure from the grass roots. 
 Three of the four were brought to this country illegally as children. Like thousands of other young people, they bear no blame for their status, and they are frustrated that their hard work and bright promise lead to a brick wall. Their protest for a chance to become Americans is courageous because it exposes them to possible arrest and deportation. ''We are risking our future because our present is unbearable,'' one of them, Felipe Matos, told The Times. 
 The Obama administration has vowed to press ahead with reform this year. Given the hard economic times, the politics may be bleaker even than in 2007 when reform was scuttled in an ugly battle. The need is just as real -- for the undocumented and for the country. 
 America needs to shut the path to illegal entry and employment while opening smoother and more rational routes to legal immigration. Opponents of reform say the downturn is a terrible time to fix the system, but they are wrong. When the recovery comes, the country will need a functioning system more than ever -- one that encourages legal entry and bolsters all workers' rights. 
 To do this, the country needs to bring its huge undocumented underclass into the light. This means putting 12 million people on a path to being assimilated. It is not a question of adding new people to the work force; they are here, many helping keep the economy afloat while tolerating low pay and abuse from lawbreaking employers who prefer them to American workers. 
 Representative Luis Gutierrez, a Democrat of Illinois, already has offered a sensible bill that legalizes immigrants who show that they have been employed, pay a $500 fine, learn English and undergo a criminal background check, among other things. 
 Opponents will try their best to scuttle reform by claiming to be open to compromise while they insist on prohibitive fees, penalties and requirements that turn the path into a fiction -- not a wait of months but of decades or never. That is not reform. And it won't solve the problem. 
 After years of tightening the screws, the system is hopelessly frozen. Those who want to fix it will have to shut out the choruses of no-amnestys and over-my-dead-bodys, sidestep the false arguments and press into the headwinds while holding firm to the core of the better solution. To legalize the undocumented, collect their unpaid taxes, free them to earn more and spend more, to get the immigrant escalator to the middle class moving again. The country needs it; the economy needs it; the immigrants need and deserve it.
 ''No city on earth has been more rewarded by immigrant labor, more renewed by immigrant ideas, more revitalized by immigrant culture,'' Mr. Bloomberg said of New York City last week. Substitute ''country'' in that sentence, as in America, and it is every bit as true.

HEADLINE: Senator Dorgan of North Dakota Will Retire

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, announced abruptly on Tuesday that he would not seek re-election this year a clear sign of the difficulties Democrats will face in defending their large Congressional majorities in the upcoming mid-term election. 
 Mr. Dorgan, who is completing his third term, has been regarded for months as one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents. Gov. John Hoeven, a popular Republican, has been weighing a run for Senate, and recent polls indicate he would easily defeat Mr. Dorgan, who nonetheless remains well-regarded by voters. 
Mr. Hoeven has yet to announce his plans, but Mr. Dorgan's decision not to run increases both the likelihood that the three-term governor will pursue the open Senate seat and that Democrats will lose it. 
 For now, Democrats nominally control 60 seats in the Senate, which is the precise number needed to overcome Republican filibusters. The major health care legislation, for instance, is advancing only because all 60 members of the Democratic caucus, including two independents, have united in support of it.
 Mr. Dorgan's decision underscores how fragile that 60-vote majority is. Democratic incumbents also face serious challenges in Connecticut, Arkansas, Colorado and Pennsylvania among other states while Senator Harry Reid, the party leader, is in his own tough fight for re-election in Nevada. 
 At the same time, Democrats have some opportunity to pick up Republican seats due to retirements in Missouri, Ohio, New Hampshire and Florida. 
 Mr. Dorgan has grown increasingly pessimistic about his prospects for re-election in recent weeks as he traveled around the state and met with constituents and he did not hide his sentiment that the Congress and the Obama administration erred in putting too much emphasis on the health care overhaul and not enough on job-creating economic programs. 
 But in a statement released Tuesday he said his decision was based on a desire to engage in other pursuits after more than 30 years in public service. 
 ''Although I still have a passion for public service and enjoy my work in the Senate, I have other interests and I have other things I would like to pursue outside of public life,'' Mr. Dorgan said. ''I have written two books and have an invitation from a publisher to write two more books. I would like to do some teaching and would also like to work on energy policy in the private sector.''
 Senate Republicans quickly hailed the news of Mr. Dorgan's retirement as a sign of their brightening political prospects. 
 ''Senator Dorgan's retirement now provides us with another excellent pick-up opportunity,'' said Brian Walsh, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ''This development is indicative of the difficult environment and slumping approval ratings that Democrats face.'' 
 Despite the challenging political climate allies had still expected Mr. Dorgan to try to take on Mr. Hoeven and the announcement of his retirement was a surprise to many. 
 While Mr. Dorgan's decision to retire could be costly in the long-term, the decision does free him from some of the political constraints he was under as the Senate debated difficult issues and the leadership will be looking for his vote on tough economic and environmental legislation facing the Democratic Congress in 2010.
 His home-state Democratic colleague, Senator Kent Conrad, predicted Mr. Dorgan could eventually join the Obama administration.
 ''Although Senator Dorgan is leaving the Senate at the end of 2010, I have a feeling that this will not be the last of his public service,'' Mr. Conrad said in a statement. ''It is my guess he will be on a short list of future Cabinet nominees to the Obama administration in the coming years.'' 
 Democrats picked up seats in the Senate in both 2006, when they regained the majority, and in 2008 in large part because Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and former chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, worked hard to prevent any retirements. 
 The only recent Democratic retirements have been as a result of the party's success in reclaiming the White House. Barack Obama of Illinois and Joseph R. Biden Jr. left to become president and vice president; Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York to become secretary of state; and Ken Salazar of Colorado to be secretary of the interior. In all of those cases, Democratic governors appointed the successors. 
 Mr. Dorgan, who is chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee, has expressed some frustration with the direction of his party this year. While other Democrats wanted to pursue major health care legislation, Mr. Dorgan though they should focus more on jobs and the economy. 
 Mr. Dorgan had faced the prospect of a difficult re-election battle in North Dakota, where voters overwhelmingly supported Senator John McCain of Arizona in last year's presidential race, and broadly express negative views of the Obama administration. 
 In his statement, Mr. Dorgan stressed that he was not leaving out of frustration. 
 ''Let me be clear that this decision does not relate to any dissatisfaction that I have about serving in the Senate,'' he aid. ''Yes, I wish there was less rancor and more bipartisanship in the U.S. Senate these days. But still, it is a great privilege to serve and I have the utmost respect for all of the men and women with whom I serve.'' 
 He also said he would work hard on a number of economic and financial issues during his remaining months in office. 
 ''We need to get the economic engine restarted and put people back to work,'' he said. ''We need to reform our financial system to make sure that which happened to cause this deep recession will not happen again. And we need to get our fiscal and budget policies under control. The federal budget deficits are not sustainable.''

HEADLINE: U.N. Official Says Priorities Threaten Work In Afghanistan

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS 

 BODY:
Kai Eide, the departing United Nations envoy to Afghanistan, warned the Security Council on Wednesday that an emphasis on security matters over social issues would doom international efforts to stabilize the country. 
 ''The political strategy is too often shaped as an appendix to military thinking,'' Mr. Eide said. 
 Although Mr. Eide, a Norwegian, did not mention the United States by name, his comments appeared to be a criticism of the American-led focus on a military surge, with the Obama administration committing 30,000 more troops there and some allies increasing their forces as well. 
 Rosemary A. DiCarlo, the American envoy addressing the Security Council, noted that the United States planned to triple the number of civilians sent to help with reconstruction and economic and agricultural development; the number will grow to 1,000 experts from 320 now. 
 But Mr. Eide said the growing impatience among the countries contributing troops and aid, the frustration of Afghans that so many promises had gone unmet and the Taliban resurgence had the potential to bring chaos. 
 ''If these negative trends are not reversed and reversed soon, then there is a danger that the combination of them will become unmanageable,'' he said. 
 Mr. Eide noted that 80 percent of the aid flowing into Afghanistan went to projects financed directly by foreign governments, most of it bypassing the central government and thus weakening its ability to deliver services and speed crucial economic development. ''These figures do not demonstrate a mind-set in which Afghans are allowed to take the lead,'' Mr. Eide said.
 While acknowledging corruption, he cited examples of the many unmet needs of civilians. Among them: There are seven million children in elementary schools this year but just 60,000 university slots and 20,000 places in vocational schools. The government has the ability to train its own personnel, but salaries are too low to make such management posts attractive. And Afghanistan is rich in iron ore but lacks the ability to mine it. 
 ''If we do not take these civilian aspects of the transition strategy as seriously as the military, then we will fail,'' he said. 
 Although his job does not end until March, his replacement is expected to be named this month. Possible successors include Jean-Marie Guehenno, a French general who had led the United Nations' global peacekeeping operations; Staffan de Mistura, a longtime United Nations official from Sweden; and Ian Martin, a Briton who has served the United Nations in Asia after running Amnesty International. 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 11, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about Kai Eide, the departing head of the United Nations mission in Afghanistan, misstated the background of Jean-Marie Guehenno, the former head of peacekeeping operations for the United Nations, who is one Mr. Eide's possible successors. He is a career diplomat from France, not a general.

HEADLINE: Recalling I.D., A Beacon in Design

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
IT was by and large a jovial crowd that filled the back rooms of the Half King bar in Chelsea on Tuesday night, as a crush of former staff members, contributors and friends of I.D. magazine, the 56-year-old design bible that folded last month, gathered, ostensibly to mourn its passing. Though the evening was billed as a wake -- its invitation was composed, appropriately, in a font called Requiem -- the gestalt was more like a class reunion, a gaggle of bright former students who all seemed to like one another very much. 
 It is sometimes the case that employees of shuttered publications have a distorted sense of their magazines' importance. When an underfinanced two-year-old city weekly went belly-up two decades ago, the wake was covered by The New York Times, and the weekly's former staff members, including this reporter, were photographed by Dith Pran, a survivor of the Cambodian killing fields, after which an editor turned to Mr. Dith and said breathlessly, ''After what you've been through, this must seem like nothing!'' (Big wince.) 
 Still, I.D. really did matter, as a laboratory of ideas and a breeding ground for generations of designers and makers of all stripes. George Nelson was an early contributor; John Gregory Dunne, an editor. Andy Warhol illustrated a story about tractor design. Paola Antonelli, senior curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art, once analyzed the design of pasta. Bruce Mau engineered a redesign of the magazine in the early 1990s, the decade in which it won five National Magazine awards, with Chee Pearlman, now an independent curator and consultant, as its editor in chief. On Tuesday, Ms. Pearlman was a den mother, brandishing her digital camera and herding staff members into grinning clinches. 
 Under Ms. Pearlman's direction, everyday objects were analyzed for their elegance and utility, and, in photographs, given ''the Hollywood celebrity portrait treatment,'' as Phil Patton, a longtime contributor, said Tuesday. (Mr. Patton once gathered up the plastic coffee cup lids that littered the floor of his car and dumped them on Ms. Pearlman's desk. Et voila! An article was born.)
 Staff members blamed the current owners, F+W Media, rather than the economic climate, for their beloved magazine's demise, suggesting that there had long been a philosophical disconnect between the culture of a Cincinnati-based company that published titles like Deer and Deer Hunting, and the Manhattan-centric I.D. (F+W bought the magazine about a decade ago, and temporarily moved its offices to Ohio.) In a statement about the magazine's closing, the publisher cited a variety of reasons, including the downturn in print advertising. ''At the end of the year,'' David Blansfield, president of F+W Media, said, ''we weren't prepared to call a recovery.'' 
 When Ralph Caplan, one of the first editors, took the mike that Ms. Pearlman had set up, his noting of the Cincinnati years was greeted with a hiss. 
 In fact, he said, that move remained ''so upsetting to so many of us that things were only made right'' on Sunday, when the New York Jets beat the Cincinnati Bengals. 
 (After he spoke, the evening's unofficial M.C., Michael Bierut, a partner at the design firm Pentagram, endeavored largely unsuccessfully to adjust the microphone to fit the varying heights of the successive speakers. ''A classic fallacy,'' Mr. Patton said later, ''turning to a graphic designer to solve a product-design problem.'') 
 Earlier, Mr. Caplan explained that money had always been tight at the magazine, recalling how he sent hungry actor friends to product introductions to retrieve the press kits. 
 ''The actors had lots of time on their hands, looked good, were grateful for the free drinks and snacks, and I didn't have to pay them,'' he said proudly. 
 As the evening wound down, Jesse Ashlock, the magazine's last editor, a job he held for seven months, remarked that this was his fifth layoff in a decade. (Mr. Ashlock is all of 32 years old.) For the next decade, he said: ''My goal is to not break things, but make them. You don't want to be called the Undertaker unless you're in the World Wrestling Federation.''
 He brightened up as he considered Mr. Caplan's thrifty habits. ''I once worked at Visionaire,'' he said, referring to the precious fashion magazine. ''And I know a lot of models. I could see redeploying them like Ralph did.''

HEADLINE: Courts Seek More Lawyers to Help the Poor

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
The recession has swelled the number of people showing up in New York State courts who cannot afford lawyers to 2.1 million annually, often turning eviction, foreclosure, debt collection and other civil cases into lopsided battles that raise questions about the fairness of the legal system.
 In response, the state court system is beginning an unusual new program this week to try to fill the gap with volunteer retired lawyers, hoping partly to attract Baby Boomer lawyers who may be ready to slow down but are not keen on full-time golf. 
 New York's chief judge, Jonathan Lippman, said in an interview that officials changed the state's rules this week to add a new category of lawyer, attorney emeritus, that will free lawyers of some burdens of full-time practice, like paying for malpractice insurance, while channeling them to dozens of legal programs around the state that represent low-income people without charge. Until now, lawyers were required to register with the state as either active or retired.
 Judge Lippman said that the program could sharply increase the number of lawyers volunteering for such public interest work, after decades of efforts that have not come close to meeting the demand. ''This is putting a gold star on their chest, saying, 'You are doing something important,' '' Judge Lippman said. 
 Although such work is often described as an ethical obligation of law practice, some studies have shown that more than half of the state's 250,000 lawyers provide no free services.
 In interviews, judges described the growing ranks of people who say they cannot afford lawyers as a crisis in the courts. They said that unrepresented people sometimes blundered into errors that could lead to destitution and homelessness. Court officials said the number of people who say they cannot afford lawyers statewide has grown by 300,000 since 2005, to 2.1 million annually by 2009.
 Nationally, court officials and bar associations have begun to talk about the potential for volunteer work from some 400,000 of the country's 1.1 million lawyers in the Baby Boom generation who are moving toward retirement. 
 In the New York program, lawyers over 55 who register in the attorney emeritus category will be trained and supervised in the work for low-income clients. Steven Banks, the attorney in chief of the Legal Aid Society in New York City, said the program could be a breakthrough in efforts to draw more volunteer lawyers. ''It is an innovative idea to tap into untapped resources,'' Mr. Banks said. 
 He said that because of limited resources, the society was turning away eight of every nine people who come to it seeking legal help in civil cases. 
 Bar associations and other groups around the country have worked for decades to increase lawyers' volunteer efforts. Court officials said that at least six states, including Florida, Illinois and Nevada, have attorney emeritus programs like the one New York is adopting. 
 At many large corporate law firms there is now an established culture of regularly handling public-interest cases without charging fees.
 But there has also been resistance to participation in volunteer programs by some lawyers. A statewide study in 2002 said only about a quarter of all lawyers worked more than 20 hours a year on such voluntary efforts.
 Many of the organizations that provide free legal services in the state are facing their own fund-raising and other financial challenges because of the economy, at a time when more people need lawyers, said Fern Schair, the chairwoman of the board of the Feerick Center for Social Justice at Fordham Law School, which works to expand representation for people who cannot afford lawyers.
 Judge Lippman said that Ms. Schair proposed the attorney emeritus program to him last summer as a way that New York might try to cope with the challenge of the growing number of unrepresented people in the courts.
 ''I immediately said to her, 'We're going to do it,' '' Judge Lippman said on Wednesday. ''This struck me as a unique opportunity to kind of seize the day.''

HEADLINE: A Program Helps Sharpen the Business Acumen of Those on the Rise

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
Taza Chocolate, whose stone-ground organic chocolate bars are made in a factory near here, in Somerville, Mass., was growing. The next step, according to its co-founder, Alex Whitmore, was to hire a marketing manager, preferably someone with many years of experience. 
 But should the three-year-old business, still small by most standards, make such an expensive hire? 
 Mr. Whitmore, who had never before owned a business, ended up turning to Inner City Entrepreneurs to figure out an answer. The program, which enrolls a small group of entrepreneurs for eight intensive months of classes, helps business owners expand companies that are thriving. Despite the economic downturn, the 25 entrepreneurs who took classes in the Boston area in the first half of 2009 secured nearly $500,000 in financing from April through November, and none has closed. 
 While there are other programs around the country with similar goals, Inner City's is longer and more intense. It is the brainchild of a Boston University professor, Daniel Monti, and Andrew Wolk, founder and chief executive of Root Cause, a nonprofit group that supports social innovators. 
 Inner City Entrepreneurs became a nonprofit group in 2003 and started offering classes the next year. It is aimed at businesses, all located within an urban core, that are at least three years old and have a minimum $250,000 in annual revenue. The group makes a particular effort to help female and minority owners. 
 The goal is not only to help individual owners grow and create a peer network group, but to help cities thrive. 
 ''Eighty percent of business development is focused on start-ups, and only 20 percent of start-ups survive,'' said J. Jean Horstman, the chief executive of Inner City Entrepreneurs. ''These business owners have been in the trenches, and they need to climb up onto a ridge and see where they fit.'' 
 The program offers what it calls a ''Streetwise M.B.A.'' Owners use their own companies as case studies and must write a three-year growth plan for a final project. 
 The classes teach fundamentals that many executives, despite having owned a business, are often unfamiliar with, like hiring, financial planning, marketing and styles of management. Some skills come naturally, and others do not, Ms. Horstman said. Many companies, for instance, have trouble putting in place a marketing plan, she said, because they are afraid of too much self-promotion. 
 Companies must apply to the program, which charges a $3,000 fee. Classes typically have 10 to 15 students, although just eight enrolled this year because of the troubled economy. A diverse pool is then chosen -- someone with marketing experience might be in a class with a florist, machine shop owner or head of a wind power company -- allowing students to share their expertise. The program also offers a peer network of alumni for participants to consult. 
 While the instructor guides the discussions, class members are encouraged to ask one another questions and share their own experiences. 
 ''It's a combination of an actual educational program where there's course work, reading materials and networking that goes on around small businesses and local business organizations,'' Mr. Whitmore said. ''That's really the powerful blend of ingredients that they bring to the table.'' 
 The program expanded to Worcester, Mass., in 2007 and Lowell, Mass., this year. It worked with the Small Business Administration in 2008 -- the agency uses the program's curriculum in 15 cities nationwide as part of its Emerging 200 Entrepreneurship program, which helps existing businesses grow.
 ''People are more likely to have success and sustainability if they have solid management and technical assistance, not only at the beginning, but during the life cycle of a business,'' said Ellen Thrasher, director of the office of entrepreneurship education at the S.B.A. ''There are opportunities, even in an economy that's struggling.'' 
 Arthur Eberle, owner of Compliance Assurance Associates, an environmental services company in Memphis, said he took the class last year to help in the transition from sole proprietorship to a larger company. 
 Mr. Eberle said the class provided him with invaluable advice on hiring and firing employees. 
 Mr. Eberle said he recently hired a bookkeeper because the course helped him realize that he needed someone to handle the financials so he could focus on the direction of the company. 
 ''I have an M.B.A. in marketing and I really think they did as good a job in that course as the four years I spent working on my M.B.A.,'' Mr. Eberle said. ''My M.B.A., frankly, was targeted theory and how they work in a Fortune 500 company. If I worked at Procter & Gamble, it would be fine, but I don't.''
 Mr. Whitmore said he asked his classmates whether he should hire an experienced marketing manager: ''Is now the time to hire a $60,000 or $70,000 sales director?'' 
 Taza, Mr. Whitmore's company, produces fair trade chocolate. It has 25 employees, most of whom he hired ''on the cheap,'' but who are still ''excited about what we're doing.'' 
 ''They say when you pay with peanuts you hire monkeys, but we have some smart monkeys,'' Mr. Whitmore said. ''I'm not experienced as a marketing director. I don't know what I'm doing. I want to hire someone with experience and pay them what they deserve, which is a lot of money.'' 
 Kevin Low, who runs Secured Network Services, a computer business in Norwood, Mass., asked Mr. Whitmore if he considered paying the employee a smaller base salary that is more in line with others at the company and offering incentives based on profit and revenue. 
 ''Your traditional salesperson may not fit in with your culture,'' Mr. Low said. ''Maybe someone will be willing to take less peanuts but you can reward them with additional incentives.'' 
 Mr. Whitmore took the advice, and said it changed how he was going about the hiring. Instead of posting the position on a job Web site, he said, he started to look for candidates at networking events. The company has interviewed several candidates and will make a decision by the end of this month. 
 ''If we find the right person that really wants to be a part of a company like ours and a culture like ours, we can provide value for that employee, and a sense of belonging and fulfillment that money can't provide,'' Mr. Whitmore said.

HEADLINE: Men Who Jump the Picket Fence

BYLINE: By MICHAEL TORTORELLO

 BODY:
THE house was an ordinary house: It bore him no malice. Alan Berks knows that now. But back in the spring of 2005, when Mr. Berks, a playwright, and his wife bought the three-bedroom home for $214,000, it often seemed that it was trying to ruin his life. 
 Alan Berks the renter had spent his evenings with friends at African dance nights and jazz clubs. Alan Berks the homeowner lost an entire day rearranging the living room furniture. ''I did find a spot for the couch that made me happy,'' he said. ''I was proud of myself. But where the couch is -- that's how I'm going to measure my happiness from now on? I remember thinking: 'This is how people live? Why am I doing this?' ''
 There were other problems, too. 
 ''I couldn't walk to anything,'' said Mr. Berks, 37, who lived in the Powderhorn Park neighborhood, south of downtown Minneapolis. And routine maintenance distracted him from writing. ''Why would I have any interest in fixing the bathroom sink?'' he said. ''I'm in my 30s. If fixing something made me happy, I would have learned how to do it.''
 Mr. Berks's wife, Leah Cooper, 40, a theater director, initially liked the house. But ''I was miserable,'' he said, so she came to dislike it, too.
 If the couple's relationship with their home was like a bad love triangle, it was clear which partner needed to go. Eighteen months after moving in, Mr. Berks and his wife took drastic action: They dumped their house (managing to break even), sold almost everything in it, loaded up their Subaru and drove to Honduras for a six-month adventure. 
 Mr. Berks said he would not recommend that solution to every homeowner. He and his wife are back in Minneapolis now, in a rental in the Uptown neighborhood, within strolling range of restaurants, bookstores and coffee shops. But looking back, he wonders why so many friends encouraged him to buy a house.
 ''I understand why the government or society wants people to have homes,'' he said -- they fix them up, and their commitment stabilizes neighborhoods. ''I get it, the whole beneficial aspect of homeownership. But individually, I'm not seeing it as a moral good.'' 
 As it turns out, Mr. Berks is not alone in his disdain. For reasons practical, financial and definitely emotional, there seems to be a growing cohort of men like him who are falling out of love with the holy institution of homeownership.
 The numbers behind this disenchantment are only suggestive. Men and women under the age of 40 report roughly equal levels of satisfaction with homeownership, according to a large national study by the Center for Community Capital at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Yet the behavior of single men and women hints at divergent gender attitudes toward homeownership.
 Married couples make up the largest group of new home buyers. Next, according to research from the National Association of Realtors, are single women, who in the last 12 months represented 21 percent of home buyers; single men were just 10 percent. That gap has opened up in the last decade, said Paul Bishop, vice president for research at the association.
 Mr. Bishop's survey is silent on the motivation behind the gender split. Younger single men may be more likely to change jobs and cities, he speculates. They may be more willing to squeeze into an apartment with two or three buddies. Or they may be cowering in the nest with Mom and Dad.
 Whatever the case, a number of men seem to be newly aware of what economists describe as a peculiarity of homeownership: it has an asset value (as an abstract investment) and a consumption value (as a place to watch VH1 and wash underwear). 
 ''Once upon a time, people bought houses to live in,'' said William Clark, a geography professor at UCLA, who has written widely about homeownership. That fairy-tale attitude began to change in the 1970s, Mr. Clark said. And in the housing mania of the last decade, he said, many buyers started to see their homes as speculative investments -- high-flying stocks that happened to come with wine cellars and four-car garages. 
 Today, ''with the sudden run-up in foreclosures, you're starting to see people ask, is housing a good investment?'' he said. ''In fact, it probably never was.''
 For the first time in a generation, homeowners can look at their dwellings without hearing the distracting jingle of the real estate jackpot. And a number of them, having stepped onto the property ladder just as it was becoming shaky, would very much like to get off.
 Men have no monopoly on domestic discontent. There are also women who wish they had signed their mortgage with disappearing ink. But for men, rejecting homeownership may involve broader questions of manhood, said Dr. Roy Baumeister, a psychology professor at Florida State University.
 ''There are a lot of extra stresses that men have,'' he said, a claim he advances in a book to be published in the summer, ''Is There Anything Good About Men?'' (Short answer: probably.)
 In almost every culture, Dr. Baumeister said, ''men are expected to produce'' more than they consume. In a similar fashion, men naturally compete for status. Buying a home, he said, is often tied up with those pressures.
 For 31-year-old Nathan Quevedo, public information officer for the Merced County Office of Education in California, buying a house with his then-wife marked a conscious arrival in adulthood. But that was before the value of his house in Merced dropped by half in just over two years. And before $500 worth of pool pump filters died -- ending the swimming season for the foreseeable future. And it was definitely before he and his two young daughters took in a roommate to help pay the bills.
 As his relationship with his 1,800-square-foot tract home has gone bad, Mr. Quevedo said, he has started to question his assumptions.
 ''I had some goals that I had set for myself before I turned 30,'' Mr. Quevedo said. ''The first one was to be a homeowner. The second one was to make X amount of money. I accomplished those goals. And they were good goals. I don't fault myself for wanting to have that American dream: a good job, a place to call my own for me and my kids. But I don't think that homeownership is essential for that anymore.'' 
 AS a business consultant for start-up ventures, Kirt Greenburg, 41, roams widely from his base in Atlanta. But the frustrations with his 3,300-square-foot colonial revival house, where he lives alone, follow him everywhere. Mr. Greenburg, by his own account, is a ''methodical, list-oriented person,'' and his laptop is full of spreadsheets that document what's wrong with the house. 
 He started his first file in 2002, before he closed on the cedar shake house on a tree-covered acre. The electrical, plumbing and heating systems needed an overhaul; the roof leaked. Mr. Greenburg expected that the repair bill would run $60,000, maybe $70,000. The new Quicken file he clicks open, though, shows he has spent $130,000 (a sum that includes a new kitchen and a complete paint job). 
 And the place still isn't fixed to his satisfaction. He clicks on another spreadsheet that tallies the unfinished repairs, room by room. There are closet floors to patch, sand and finish. There's a basement crawl space to weatherproof. ''There have been a lot of times when I haven't wanted to go home at all,'' Mr. Greenburg said. ''Because home reminds me of all the things I need to get done. It's not an escape for me.''
 Looking back, Mr. Greenburg questions why he thought he would want to own such a spacious, high-maintenance home. He grew up with five siblings and enjoyed the noise and hubbub. Yet the home he bought feels silent -- so much so that he sometimes doles out rooms to luckless acquaintances who need a place to crash. 
 His real estate agent described the home as an ideal spot for parties and sit-down dinners. But most of his friends live in condos and apartments across town, where they eat takeout and drop into restaurants, he said.
 As a kind of entrepreneurial ''nomad'' in the 1990s, Mr. Greenburg bounced among eight cities in one five-year span. Recently, he and his newish boyfriend, a French national who has a short-term job in Atlanta, have daydreamed about starting a new business together -- in the south of France. Owning a house, he said, ''ties me down.''
 ''People who are particularly mobile should not be a homeowner because of the high transaction costs'' of unloading a house, said Donald Haurin, an economics professor at Ohio State University, who has studied the civic virtues of homeownership. And younger men, he pointed out, tend to relocate more often than young women do. ''In economic literature, there's certainly nothing that says everyone should be a homeowner.''
 Mr. Greenburg has belatedly come to the same conclusion. ''I was perfectly content to be in a rental, but I thought it didn't make financial sense,'' he said. After a few years of halting gentrification, neighborhood real estate values remain depressed -- and depressing. ''Now that I've sunk in all this money and taken out a mortgage, the main reason it made sense for me is gone,'' he said. 
 While Mr. Greenburg tethered his fate to a fixer-upper, Hanyul Lee bought a new 4,400-square-foot condo in Medford, just outside Boston. The two-story unit had once been an auditorium, and he and his fiancee customized the vast space while they planned their wedding. 
 The sale closed three days after they returned from their honeymoon, in November 2006. Within a week, a wall had cracked and bowed, he said. The ceiling leaked. Before long, rain was pouring in through the windows. There were more travails, Mr. Lee said, but he is suing the developer and said that he would rather not talk about it. 
 Though he considers himself financially savvy -- at 29 he is a director at a consulting firm that advises Fortune 500 companies -- he wonders if he might have been too optimistic about buying in a new development.
 Mr. Lee's parents gave him a toolbox to celebrate the new digs. Yet the gift only showed him that he didn't know how to make the most basic repairs. 
 ''It's a humbling experience,'' he said. With his wife taking care of their infant daughter, ''the general expectation is that the man in the household will have competence in fixing things and building things. Whether or not that's warranted, I do not.'' 
 Adam Ratner said he found fatherhood to be incompatible with homeownership -- he could take care of either his infant daughter or the yard. He picked the one that cooed. Dr. Ratner, a 39-year-old pediatric infectious disease specialist at Columbia University Medical Center, was starting a fellowship in Philadelphia when he bought a house in the Main Line suburb of Narberth.
 ''My first day in the house, I managed to lock myself out,'' he said. ''Of course there's no super.''
 He was working ''60 or 70'' hours a week, he said; his wife, Shari Gelber, an obstetrics resident at another hospital, was working ''80 or 90.'' 
 Ultimately, Dr. Ratner admitted, his landscaping neglect went too far. His next-door neighbor, a dentist with an in-home practice, ''got so sick of seeing our grass that he started coming over to mow the lawn,'' he said.
 And the yard, Dr. Ratner added, was not a large one. ''I wish I were making this up.''
 In 2006, with their medical assignments completed, Dr. Ratner and his wife returned to New York and faculty housing in Morningside Heights. ''We ended up chasing a falling market,'' he said of their old house. ''Eventually we just lowered our price enough to sell it.''
 He recollects his old house without bitterness. He misses grilling year-round on his deck, he said.
 Yet his aversion to homeownership may be more powerful than he lets on. When an infestation of bedbugs spread through his apartment building last year, Dr. Ratner and his family had to jettison furniture, carpets and clothing. 
 They did not consider, even for a moment, leaving their rental and buying another house.

HEADLINE: Message of the Tea Party Movement

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 David Brooks, in ''The Tea Party Teens'' (column, Jan. 5), describes the tea party movement as ''a large, fractious confederation of Americans who are defined by what they are against.'' 
 Like Mr. Brooks, I am not a fan of this movement. It starts from a position of negation. 
 In these troubled times, when our economic and security status quos register very low on the scale, and our confidence in government to help remedy these ills is off the scale completely, we are in dire need not of negation but of the quintessential American values of optimism and fortitude. 
 If we don't like the status quo, we should stop saying no and instead say yes to change. 
 We should demand of our politicians that they, too, say yes to change by working with one another to craft meaningful legislation that addresses our problems related to energy, climate change, entitlement spending and campaign financing.
 By scoring our politicians on their willingness to tackle these issues head on rather than retreating to the safety of the naysaying special-interest fringes, we will be sending the most powerful message we can -- with our votes.
 Kevin Abel Alpharetta, Ga., Jan. 5, 2010
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks raises an important issue: rejection of the so-called educated class. Rather than blaming the left or the right, Republican or Democrat, we should all be concerned. 
 What the tea party movement is calling for could lead our country into greater economic, political and social stagnation. 
 In a peculiar way, the world that Mr. Brooks is describing reminds me of ''Atlas Shrugged,'' by Ayn Rand. 
 Without taxes and without government, there will be little or no investment in infrastructure, transit, education, science, national parks and so on. 
 As the educated elites are banished and the lights go out across the country and the final bridge across the Mississippi River collapses, disrupting the food supply, whither the America we once knew? 
 Rand blamed socialist ideology. In this case, we can blame only ourselves. 
 Pamela S. Chasek New York, Jan. 5, 2010
 The writer is an associate professor of political science at Manhattan College.
 To the Editor:
 I think that David Brooks is missing something here. 
 I am a 50-year-old husband and father of two. My wife and I vote and are not affiliated with any political party. We are not activists by any stretch of the imagination. Our idea of a good night is a good movie or a book and a comfortable chair. 
 We are both displeased with our government of late and are concerned about our nation's future. Our Depression-era parents taught us to live within our means. And to keep our house in order. This is a lesson lost in Washington. 
 When the next tea party rally comes to our area, we plan on attending. If the tea party can get middle-aged people like us to brave the cold to make our voices heard, it is time for the Democrats and the Republicans to worry. 
 Robert G. Stewart Tewksbury, Mass., Jan. 5, 2010
 To the Editor: 
 I think that David Brooks allows the tea party too much consideration in his analysis of today's political scene. The party is not organized around any single idea other than the thought that its members don't like our president. 
 They get their inspiration and justification from the right-wing extremists who hang on the fringes of the Republican Party, and who continue to incite the groups but take no responsibility for the tea party activists' actions. 
 Thus, when tea party members shout down members of Congress, or shout racist slogans, or hold racist signs, or openly carry firearms, or defend anarchy, Republican Party leaders opt to look the other way, or feign moral outrage. 
 The tea partiers are reactionary, and shrill out of fear. They are the bully on the playground. We just need to hold steady to show them up for what they are.

HEADLINE: Shares Show Little Change As Oil Continues Its Rise

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks ended little changed but modest gains pushed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to a new 15-month high. The cautious tone came as investors awaited the government's monthly employment report on Friday. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 10,573.68, up 1.66 points. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.62, or less than 0.1 percent, to 1,137.14, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 7.62, or 0.3 percent, to 2,301.09.
 Oil continued its rise, with benchmark crude settling at $83.18, up $1.41, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest close since Oct. 9, 2008.
 Stocks drifted in a narrow range after signs of growth in the services industry. The Institute for Supply Management said its services index rose to 50.1 in December from 48.7 in November. A reading above 50 signals growth.
 The welcome news about service companies was offset by a report that employers cut 84,000 private sector jobs last month. The ADP National Employment Report came in worse than the forecasts of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. The latest batch of reports is similar to what investors have seen for months -- figures that reveal modest improvements but remind them that the economy remains weak.
 John Dorfman, chairman of Thunderstorm Capital in Boston, said the market was probably being weighed down by investors who waited until this week to sell some of their winning stocks from last year so the taxes would fall under 2010. 
 Beyond tax moves, however, he said many traders are going to be reluctant to wade back into stocks until the market shows more direction. ''My own view is that a genuine and fairly strong recovery is under way and that the market will probably gain 10 percent or more in 2010,'' Mr. Dorfman said.
 Separately, minutes from the Fed's December meeting showed that a ''few members'' thought that the central bank's $1.25 trillion program to buy mortgages could need to grow, rather than be phased out on March 31. The report did little to deepen investors' insight into the Fed's intentions for interest rates.
 Traders are also cautious ahead of a major employment report coming up Friday from the Labor Department. Economists expect that the unemployment rate rose to 10.1 percent in December from 10 percent in November.
 Three stocks rose for every two that fell on the New York Stock Exchange.
 The dollar mostly fell against other major currencies as gold rose.
 The Treasury's 10-year note fell 16/32, to 96 11/32. The yield rose to 3.82 percent from 3.76 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Minorities and the Poor Predominate in the South's Public Schools

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
The South has become the first region in the country where more than half of public school students are poor and more than half are members of minorities, according to a new report. 
 The shift was fueled not by white flight from public schools, which spiked during desegregation but has not had much effect on school demographics since the early 1980s. Rather, an influx of Latinos and other ethnic groups, the return of blacks to the South and higher birth rates among black and Latino families have contributed to the change. 
 The new numbers, from the 2008-9 school year, are a milestone for the South, ''the only section of the United States where racial slavery, white supremacy and racial segregation of schools were enforced through law and social custom,'' said the report, to be released on Thursday by the Southern Education Foundation, a nonprofit group based here that supports education improvement in the region. But the numbers also herald the future of the country as a whole, as minority students are expected to exceed 50 percent of public school enrollment by 2020 and the share of students poor enough to qualify for free or reduced-price lunches is on the rise in every state. 
 The South, desperate for a well-educated work force that can attract economic development, will face an enormous challenge in tackling on such a broad scale the lower achievement rates among poor and minority students, who score lower than average on tests and drop out more frequently than whites. Four of the 15 states in the report -- Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas -- now have a majority of both low-income and minority pupils. Only one, Virginia, has neither.
 ''This is the beginning of a very clear trend that has enormous implications,'' said Michael A. Rebell, the executive director of the Campaign for Educational Equity at Teachers College, Columbia University. ''When we realize that the majority of graduates of our schools in the long run are going to come from backgrounds with educational deprivation, it makes it imperative that schools be improved.''
 School districts in the South are already struggling to adapt, but it is not clear which methods are most effective. 
 ''That's the question that Congress, the legislature, the Gates Foundation -- everybody's trying to solve that,'' said Arthur C. Johnson, the superintendent of the Palm Beach School District in Florida, which has gone from 40 percent minority students to 63 percent in 15 years. Remedial programs, career-centered academies, and intensive teacher training have helped, Mr. Johnson said, but have not closed the gap in achievement and graduation rates.
 Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia and Maryland have been among those states where poor and minority students have shown the most improvement in fourth-grade reading and eighth-grade math. From 2003 to 2007, black fourth-graders in Alabama showed the most improvement of any state in reading on the National Assessment of Economic Progress, though they still rank slightly below average. 
 In Tennessee, where many districts have seen Hispanic enrollment increase by factors of 10 or more, districts have scrambled to hire more teachers of English as a second language. In Mississippi, which has no publicly financed preschool, some schools have used federal money for poor students to prepare 4-year-olds for the classroom.
 In Louisiana, a recent study has tried to determine which teacher-training programs are most effective. Districts are experimenting with ways to attract more experienced teachers to high-risk schools. 
 ''We've got to figure out how to break the cycle of poverty, and the way we're doing it now isn't working,'' said Hank M. Bounds, the Mississippi commissioner of higher education and, until recently, the state superintendent of schools. ''An affluent 5-year-old has about the same vocabulary as an adult living in poverty.''
 More minority students in a district does not mean that classrooms are more integrated, said Richard Fry, a senior research associate with the Pew Hispanic Center, whose research shows that most white children in the South attend predominantly white schools and an even higher percentage of black and Hispanic children attend predominantly minority schools. 
 Southern schools are far more segregated now than they were at the height of integration in the '70s and '80s, a period that saw a narrowing of the achievement gap, said Gary Orfield, the co-director of The Civil Rights Project/Proyecto Derechos Civiles at U.C.L.A. The South has the lowest percentage of children in private school of any region, Mr. Orfield said. 
 Minority schools tend to be larger, have higher student-teacher ratios and have higher poverty rates, Mr. Fry said. For some education advocates, such correlations raise the possibility that politicians will be less likely to adequately finance public schools as they fill with poor and minority students. 
 ''We have a history of providing the least educational resources to the students who need the most,'' said Steve Suitts, the vice president of the Southern Education Foundation and the author of the study. ''The people in the South have to be concerned about all children, not just their own grandchildren.''
 On the other hand, Southern politicians are keenly aware of the need for an educated work force. Spurred in part by school financing lawsuits, more than half the 15 states included in the study already provide more state and local financing to heavily poor or minority districts than to affluent or low-minority ones, according to figures compiled by Education Trust, an advocacy group in Washington. But schools often layer programs on top of programs without analyzing which are effective, said Daria Hall, the trust's director of K-12 policy.

HEADLINE: Antitrust Case Has Implications Far Beyond N.F.L.

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and ALAN SCHWARZ

 BODY:
Is the National Football League a single entity, or a collection of 32 teams that compete against one another every week?
 The question forms the core of an antitrust case that will be heard by the United States Supreme Court next week. How the court rules could shake some pillars of sports law by reshaping the definition of a sports league, which would in turn affect professional leagues, teams and players, as well as the constellations of companies that do business with them.
 The roots of the case, American Needle v. National Football League, date to 2000, when the N.F.L. chose Reebok to become the exclusive provider of its licensed apparel. The league determined that the 10-year, $250 million deal would generate more money than the agreements it had with American Needle and others.
 American Needle sued the N.F.L., arguing that the Reebok deal violated antitrust statutes because the league conspired to stifle competition and inflate prices. 
 Although experts consider it unlikely that the court will issue a broad ruling for the N.F.L., defining the league as a single entity rather than 32 competing ones has the potential to adversely affect fans through higher prices for merchandise, concessions, parking at stadiums and even in fees to join fantasy football leagues. Salaries could be unilaterally capped and strikes or lockouts could increase. Companies that have done business with the league could be shut out.
 Conversely, if the court rules in favor of American Needle, the N.F.L. may be forced to annul its exclusive contracts, opening the door for more competition and potentially lower prices.
 American Needle is not the first company to challenge the N.F.L.'s single-entity argument, which has often been rejected by courts. But a trial court in Chicago and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals surprised some experts when they agreed with the N.F.L. in the American Needle case that it could act as a single entity when forging licensing deals.
 The league argued that although its 32 teams compete against one another on the field, they are economic partners of necessity off it. The teams are so intertwined, the league said, they share more than 80 percent of their revenue. (The players union says the figure is 40 percent.)
 ''For nearly 50 years, the N.F.L. has promoted its entertainment product through collective, integrated licensing of the names, markets, colors and logos of its member clubs, all of which derive their economic value from their association with N.F.L. Football,'' the league said in a filing to the court.
 American Needle appealed to the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments Jan. 13 and is expected to rule by late June.
 According to Mark Conrad, a professor of legal and ethical studies at Fordham, the court took on the case partly to prevent court shopping, whereby plaintiffs take advantage of inconsistent lower court rulings by filing suits where they feel they have the best chance of winning.
 In what legal experts called a calculated move, the N.F.L. backed American Needle's application to the Supreme Court, reasoning that if the court sides with the league, other companies will have less recourse to sue on antitrust grounds.
 A victory by the N.F.L., lawyers say, could allow it to sign even broader commercial deals with everything from banks to beermakers. A victory could also help the N.B.A. and the N.H.L., which have filed briefs in support of the N.F.L. Major League Baseball, unlike the other leagues, has a longstanding antitrust exemption.
 ''The biggest story coming out of that case is not the immediate implication for the parties and whether American Needle can get a headwear contract, but the downstream repercussions that would treat the league as anything but a single entity,'' said Ben Mulcahy, a partner with the law firm Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton.
 Those repercussions could include a significant shift in the leverage sports leagues have over players unions, a concern now that the N.F.L. and its union have begun to renegotiate their collective bargaining agreement. The other three major sports leagues will discuss their deals in the next 18 months.
 A broad ruling for the N.F.L., however unlikely, could give the league latitude to implement a salary structure of its choosing without fear of antitrust scrutiny and penalties for collusion. That prospect has led the players unions of all four major sports, none of which were a party to the American Needle suit, to submit a joint brief disputing the N.F.L.'s logic.
 In that filing, the N.F.L.'s players union even disputes the exclusivity of the N.F.L.'s deal with Reebok, noting that the Dallas Cowboys have opted out of the agreement, paid the league a fee and decided to strike their own deal for licensed apparel.
 Other teams have challenged the league's attempts to present itself as a single entity, including the Raiders, who won the right to move from Oakland to Los Angeles in the 1980s.
 Michael Weiner, the executive director of baseball's players union, said that conferring antitrust immunity upon sports leagues would restrict legal options that unions have for exerting leverage, leading to more work stoppages.
 ''If athletes were to be in a dispute, their only alternative to fight against what they perceive to be an unreasonable demand would be to strike or withstand a lockout,'' he said.
 Jeff Pash, the general counsel for the N.F.L., disagreed.
 ''The American Needle case arose out of an issue that could not possibly have less to do with labor,'' he said. ''We think it would be good to get a ruling on this that would apply nationwide in all courts to the extent to which the clubs are required to compete in their own lines of business with one another.''
 Since the 1960s, sports leagues have used a specific exemption from antitrust laws to negotiate exclusive national television contracts. If the Supreme Court grants the N.F.L. even broader immunity, the league could push for more control over the digital rights to its games, whether they appear online, are embedded in video games or are part of fantasy sports leagues, lawyers say.
 The N.F.L. insists that it is not out to gouge consumers or throw its weight around in negotiations with companies and the players union. Rather, it says it wants to prevent what it calls frivolous lawsuits from companies objecting to exclusive licensed agreements.
 Still, fans may ultimately feel an impact. According to American Needle, prices for licensed hats jumped immediately after the N.F.L. signed its deal with Reebok, which is now owned by Adidas. If the court rules in the league's favor, the N.F.L. might consider exclusive deals with stadium vendors and parking operators, deals that for now are done by individual teams. This could drive up the price of attending games.
 ''It's not just headwear,'' said Robert Kronenberger, the president of American Needle, whose sales fell 25 percent after the Reebok deal was completed. ''It could be beyond that: television, concessions, food, beer. It's not just about me.''
 Legal experts said that the N.F.L. would not necessarily strong-arm consumers, because Congress could respond with laws addressing any court decision. (A subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee is planning a hearing Jan. 20 to discuss possible ramifications of the case.) Higher prices could also hurt sales and public relations.
 ''If the N.F.L. wins partial or full exemption, that doesn't mean we'll suddenly see player salaries at some floor or that an N.F.L. logo sweatshirt will be $200,'' said Gabriel Feldman, the director of the Sports Law Program at Tulane. ''Even without Congress stepping in, the N.F.L. won't do it because peoplewould just go buy a baseball sweatshirt instead.''

HEADLINE: Interior Dept. to Toughen Review of Oil and Gas Leases

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The interior secretary, Ken Salazar, said Wednesday that his department would conduct more rigorous reviews of oil and gas leasing on public lands, declaring that the agency would no longer be a ''candy store'' for the petroleum industry, as he said it had been during the Bush administration.
 ''The previous administration's 'anywhere, anyhow' policy on oil and gas development ran afoul of communities, carved up the landscape and fueled costly conflicts that created uncertainty for investors and industry,'' said Mr. Salazar, a former senator from Colorado. ''We need a fresh look -- from inside the federal government and from outside -- at how we can better manage Americans' energy resources.'' 
 In a telephone press briefing, Mr. Salazar said the new layer of review would probably increase the time needed to make leasing decisions but would not necessarily result in less oil and gas exploration beneath public lands. 
 He said the goal was to reduce the number of public and court challenges to leasing decisions, which can take years, consume millions of dollars in legal costs and sometimes create uncertainty for investors in drilling projects.
 Mr. Salazar said that in 2008, some 40 percent of rulings to permit or deny drilling rights were challenged by one or more parties, compared with only 1 percent in 1998.
 The Bureau of Land Management, which oversees oil and gas rights beneath public property, will issue new guidelines to its field staff on how to review proposed parcels for development.
 Many auditors and judges have found that previous decisions were made arbitrarily and with little consultation with other agencies. Under the new guidelines, teams from several agencies will consult and officials will physically inspect the sites rather than making decisions from behind their desks, said Bob Abbey, the bureau's director.
 ''We already have industry, B.L.M. and local, state and tribal governments working together to mitigate impacts,'' he said. ''But we all believe we can do better.''
 The chairmen of the House and Senate natural resources committees praised the new policy, saying it would bring certainty to leasing decisions while assuring continued development of domestic oil and gas resources.
 But Republicans in Congress and representatives of the petroleum industry panned it. ''In 2009, we observed a severe slowdown in permitting, project environmental analyses, and leasing,'' said Kathleen Sgamma, director of governmental affairs for the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States. ''We are disappointed to see the DOI moving to a bureaucratic command-and-control system in which government bureaucrats -- rather than scientists with expertise in natural gas and oil development -- dictate where energy development should occur.''
 Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's dominant trade group, said the decision would make it more difficult to produce domestic oil and gas and would be a setback for the economy. ''Under the guise of offering certainty for investors, Interior Secretary Salazar has taken steps to further delay and limit American energy resources for all Americans,'' Mr. Gerard said in a statement from Washington.
 He said that in the year the Obama administration had been in office, federal revenue from oil and gas leases in the region known as the intermountain West had fallen by more than 80 percent.
 Mr. Salazar said that as part of his department's ''balanced'' approach to oil and gas policy, he had approved potential exploration in tens of millions of acres under the Gulf of Mexico and nearly three million acres of Western lands.
 ''In 2009,'' Mr. Salazar said, ''B.L.M. held 35 onshore oil and gas leases for 2,542 parcels covering 2.9 million acres.''
 As for industry's complaints, he added: ''I think they're wrong. In the prior administration the oil and gas industry essentially were the kings of the world. Whatever they wanted to happen, happened. The agency was essentially the handmaiden of the industry.'' He said he did not intend to halt or delay exploration, but added, ''I expect the shrill nature of criticisms from the oil and gas industry will come anyway.''

HEADLINE: Labour Insiders Seek Ballot on Brown

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Months before a national election, two senior leaders in Britain's governing Labour Party issued an unusual appeal on Wednesday for a secret ballot on the leadership of Prime Minister Gordon Brown, adding to a catalog of woes ranging from recession at home to criticism of his handling of the war in Afghanistan.
 The dissidents -- former cabinet ministers Patricia Hewitt and Geoff Hoon -- said in a letter to Labour lawmakers, many of whom could lose their jobs in the election, that the party was ''deeply divided'' over Mr. Brown's leadership and that the issue should be resolved ''once and for all.'' 
 ''The continued speculation and uncertainty is allowing our opponents to portray us as dispirited and disunited,'' the letter said. ''It is damaging our ability to set out our strong case to the electorate. It is giving our political opponents an easy target.''
 In a radio interview, Ms. Hewitt, a former health secretary, declared: ''This is not an attempted coup. It's exactly what we say in the letter -- it's an attempt to get this matter sorted out once and for all.'' 
 But the maneuver highlighted disarray in Labour ranks at a time when the party is fighting to stave off a widely forecast defeat in the June vote that would end a 13-year stretch in power since Tony Blair's resounding victory in 1997. As the day wore on, Mr. Brown mustered the support of the more influential members of his cabinet, notably the chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling; the home secretary, Alan Johnson; and the foreign secretary, David Miliband. 
 The letter threatened to undermine Mr. Brown's international stature at a time when he is seeking to project himself as the architect of global recovery from the financial crisis and as the central European player in the fight against the Taliban. Britain is the second biggest contributor to the United States-led coalition in Afghanistan, with 9,000 soldiers deployed there, compared with more than 68,000 Americans.
 Mr. Brown has said he will host a major international conference on Jan. 28 on Afghanistan.
 At home, though, the war is deeply unpopular, with casualties in 2009 reaching the highest level among British troops since the Falklands war in 1982. Conservatives have accused Mr. Brown of failing to ensure that British troops were properly equipped to withstand attack by the resurgent Taliban.
 Mr. Brown also announced that a parallel meeting would be held on Jan. 28 on counterterrorism measures in Yemen, in light of the attempted bombing of a flight bound for Detroit on Dec. 25, an attack for which a group in Yemen called Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula took responsibility.
 In their letter, Ms. Hewitt and Mr. Hoon, a former defense secretary, said Labour politicians were frustrated at divisions in the party as the election approaches. 
 ''We have therefore come to the conclusion that the only way to resolve this issue would be to allow every member to express their view in a secret ballot,'' the letter said, according to the BBC.
 While the two politicians said they were not plotting Mr. Brown's overthrow, there seemed little doubt that their letter would strengthen perceptions of division in Labour ranks at the moment when Mr. Brown is seeking unity and support.
 Since he succeeded Mr. Blair in 2007, Mr. Brown's position has sometimes seemed shaky because of efforts to force him out.

HEADLINE: G.M. Chief Says Company Is on Road to Profitability

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The new chief executive of General Motors, Edward E. Whitacre Jr., sought to assure the public on Wednesday that the automaker was on track to be profitable in the wake of its bankruptcy last summer. 
 If it comes to pass, it would be a major turnaround for G.M., which has not posted an annual profit in five years.
 In a media briefing at the G.M. headquarters, Mr. Whitacre predicted that G.M. would both become profitable and repay its government loans this year. 
 Asked whether the automaker would make money in 2010, Mr. Whitacre did not hesitate.
 ''I'm hoping so,'' he said. ''My prediction is we will be.'' He stopped short, however, of guaranteeing a profit in 2010. 
 He added that the company was committed to paying back $6.7 billion in federal government loans by June. ''We want to pay that back and get that burden off of us,'' he said.
 Mr. Whitacre, the retired head of AT&T, was appointed the chairman of G.M.'s board by the government after it emerged from bankruptcy in July. He took on the chief executive job on an interim basis on Dec. 1, after the board asked for and received the resignation of Fritz Henderson.
 Since then, Mr. Whitacre has moved quickly to shake up G.M.'s management ranks and establish new levels of accountability throughout the company.
 G.M. has received $50 billion in federal aid in the last year, but most of that debt has been converted to equity in what Mr. Whitacre said was now essentially a private company.
 The federal government owns 60 percent of G.M.'s shares, and an important goal of Mr. Whitacre's is to position the company for a public stock offering that would help taxpayers recoup some of their investment.
 Mr. Whitacre said that an offering could be made by the end of this year, but declined to be more specific about that timetable. But he made it clear that he not only expected G.M. to make money this year, but also to increase its market share and improve its spotty reputation among consumers.
 G.M. sales in the United States fell 30 percent in 2009 from the previous year, compared with an overall industry decline of 21 percent. The company's market share dipped to just below 20 percent, from 22 percent the previous year.
 Mr. Whitacre said he was encouraged by G.M.'s sales in December. The company is discontinuing two of its brands, Pontiac and Saturn, and is trying to sell off its Hummer and Saab divisions. Sales in December were up 2 percent at the four brands G.M. is keeping: Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC. 
 Mr. Whitacre said that executives had been given targets to increase market share this year.
 ''We are focused on the revenue side,'' he said. ''We have to sell more stuff.''
 G.M. downsized its operations considerably during the bankruptcy process, and shed the bulk of its debt to banks and other private lenders.
 The company still must contend with fragile economic conditions and weak overall demand for new vehicles.
 ''Do we have obstacles in our way? Of course we do,'' Mr. Whitacre said.
 Mr. Whitacre has consistently said he does not expect to be a long-term chief executive at G.M. The company has hired a search firm to evaluate candidates, but has yet to propose a list of possible contenders to the board.
 One potential candidate is Christopher P. Liddell, G.M.'s new chief financial officer. Mr. Liddell had previously held the same post at the software giant Microsoft. 
 Mr. Whitacre called Mr. Liddell a ''terrific addition'' to G.M.'s management team, and said he could be considered for the chief executive position.
 ''I would say he certainly could be,'' Mr. Whitacre said.
 But Mr. Whitacre, for his part, appears to be settling into his new job, even if on a temporary basis. He recently moved from a Detroit hotel into an apartment, and is working closely with a cadre of recently promoted young executives.
 He also is working to shore up G.M.'s reputation not only with consumers, but also in Washington.
 Last month, G.M. hired two former AT&T executives who had worked with Mr. Whitacre to run its Washington office.
 Mr. Whitacre said he felt G.M. needed to improve its image with some lawmakers who had opposed its government bailout. ''I think we need to take a new look at our relationship with Congress,'' he said.
 Mr. Whitacre also said he expected that ''a large number'' of G.M. dealers who had been jettisoned during bankruptcy were likely to be reinstated through an appeals process approved by Congress.
 He said that G.M. made ''some mistakes'' when it cut more than 1,000 dealers, and that some would be welcomed back if they were reinstated through appeals.
 Other dealerships that were cut might not get the same welcome, even if they win their appeals. ''If they were a lousy dealer with a lousy storefront and they are put back, that wouldn't be a good thing,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Colorado Governor Says He Will Not Run

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: DENVER 

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Ritter Jr. of Colorado, a Democrat who was elected in 2006 and hailed as a leader of what his party called a new strategy in the Rocky Mountain West, a region long dominated by Republicans, said on Wednesday that he would not seek a second term.
 Mr. Ritter said he wanted to find a better balance in life and to spend more time with his family. He also said that being ''unencumbered'' by the demands of a campaign would allow him the freedom to make tough decisions about the state budget without worrying so much about politics between now and Election Day in November. 
 ''This decision allows me to make my family a priority,'' he said at a news conference at the State Capitol. ''Quite frankly, they need me.''
 Mr. Ritter, 53, was facing a tough fight for the governorship, with an apparently unified Republican Party against him, a somewhat divided Democratic Party at his back and a state economy limping from recession. 
 At the news conference, he said that he thought the race was winnable and that no one had nudged him toward the exit. But the news shook Colorado politics and shifted the dynamic of the coming contest. 
 Democrats began their strategy sessions almost before Mr. Ritter had left the news conference.
 ''In the coming days we are talking with various individuals,'' the party's state chairwoman, Pat Waak, said in a five-sentence statement. ''Our goal is to commit ourselves to fielding the best candidate.''
 An equally important question is how the presumed Republican front-runner, former Representative Scott McInnis, who had been preparing for months to run against Mr. Ritter, might fare against another opponent.
 Mr. McInnis, whose Web site on Wednesday afternoon still featured a running banner about his lead over Mr. Ritter in a recent poll, said in a statement that his campaign's focus on jobs and economic growth would not change.
 Mr. Ritter, a former Denver prosecutor who also served as a Catholic missionary and volunteer in Africa with his wife, Jeannie, grew up on a dairy farm in rural Colorado and often came off as an earnest and thoughtful, if sometimes uninspiring, leader. 
 But he also sometimes took bold steps that ran counter to the wishes of some influential state party members, notably last year when he appointed Michael Bennet, who was the superintendent of schools in Denver, to fill the seat vacated by Ken Salazar, a Democrat who left the Senate to become secretary of the interior under President Obama.
 The decision divided Democrats, with many in the Democratic-controlled Legislature expressing vocal support for another choice, a former speaker of the State House of Representatives, Andrew Romanoff.
 Republicans, meanwhile have been sharpening their knives for months in anticipation of the 2010 race. In 2006, Mr. Ritter faced a divided Republican Party, split over the policies of Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican who was leaving office after eight years because of term limits. But last year they rallied early around Mr. McInnis, who represented a huge, mostly rural district in the state's southern and western reaches in Congress from 1993 to 2005. 
 Mr. McInnis's district, like much of Colorado, has evolved politically and demographically since then. It is now represented by a Democrat, Representative John T. Salazar, Ken Salazar's brother. Representative Salazar was elected in 2004, succeeding Mr. McInnis, who chose not to run again, and has been re-elected twice with roughly 60 percent majorities.

HEADLINE: New York to Create Global Insurance Exchange to Cover Complex Risks

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
In a bid to create jobs and bolster New York's position as a financial center, Gov. David A. Paterson announced plans on Wednesday to create an international insurance exchange, modeled after Lloyd's of London. 
 The exchange would specialize in coverage of complicated risks -- oil rigs in hurricane regions, tall buildings that are potential targets of terrorists or corporate directors who could be blamed for accounting scandals. 
 Such risks are hard to insure because they are unpredictable and potentially catastrophic. As a result, many companies go offshore for such coverage, usually to Lloyd's or to other exchanges in Bermuda and Dublin. Currently, about 50 percent of the insurance placed through Lloyd's originates in North America. 
 Governor Paterson is hoping to keep some of that business at home because insuring complex risks can be very profitable. The governor announced his plans in his State of the State address, calling it ''part of a bold and decisive plan to rebuild our state's economy.''
 Officials associated with the project said they believed it could eventually generate 2,000 to 3,000 jobs, both for market participants and regulators. The exchange would be regulated by the state. It is unrelated to the Obama administration's proposals to allow uninsured individuals to buy health coverage through exchanges. 
 The New York insurance superintendent, James J. Wrynn, said it would be easier for New York to create an insurance exchange than for most other states because it tried to start such an exchange in the 1980s. That attempt failed, but the laws allowing it are still on the books, Mr. Wrynn said. 
 He said the 1980s effort was doomed because the companies participating were not required to have adequate capital and did not always understand the risks they were taking on. The market was also ''soft'' then, meaning the participating insurers had a hard time charging large enough premiums to both cover their risks and turn a profit. 
 Mr. Wrynn said New York had been studying what went wrong with the earlier exchange and would see to it that the mistakes were not repeated. He said the state was about to start working with people from various financial institutions in the private sector to draft the rules and procedures for the exchange. Members of the working groups are to be named on Thursday. 
 Another crucial difference between the 1980s and now is the rise of hedge funds and other unconventional financial companies, which might want to try insuring catastrophic risks to balance investment portfolios. Such investors would participate directly in insurance syndicates, underwriting risks without having to become licensed insurers.
 By forming syndicates, participants would be able to buy into relatively small slices of certain risks. The idea would be that the syndicate as a whole would have the capacity to absorb huge losses that might topple an insurance company working on its own. 
 In addition to hedge funds, private equity firms, banks and wealthy individuals might want to participate. Licensed insurance companies might also want to participate, officials said. If, for example, a homeowner's insurance company decided its coverage was too heavily concentrated on the coasts of Florida, it could come to the New York exchange and seek an exchange to assume some of the risks, spreading them over a bigger pool.

HEADLINE: Bowing Out, Dodd Said He Didn't Have the Stomach for a Gritty Uphill Fight

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER; Lynnley Browning in New Haven; Alison Leigh Cowan in Stamford, Conn.; and Robert Davey in Bridgeport, Conn., contributed reporting.

DATELINE: EAST HADDAM, Conn. 

 BODY:
Christopher J. Dodd has been in politics 36 years, including an ill-starred presidential run in 2008 and a record three decades as a United States senator from Connecticut. He can, then, count votes with anyone in Congress. But with his popularity at a nadir, he was not sure he could count enough votes in his home state to assure his election to a sixth term.
 Mr. Dodd is also 65, and in the past year he has battled prostate cancer, helped bury an older sister (his closest sibling) and Edward M. Kennedy ( his closest friend in the Senate), and seen another former Senate colleague, Jon S. Corzine, go down to defeat after a nasty re-election fight for governor in New Jersey.
 A fight just as tough would have been the only way for Mr. Dodd to survive a Republican challenge in November, his advisers say. And even if he could imagine scraping his way to victory, the senator told the advisers, he did not have the stomach for the fight. 
 To hear Mr. Dodd tell it on Wednesday, not one but all of those things together -- a lifetime of accomplishment, a bruising year, a forbidding way forward -- equipped him to make up his mind and bow out of any re-election effort. He did so, he said, early on a cold Christmas Eve, an hour after voting to overhaul the health care system, when he visited Senator Kennedy's grave at Arlington National Cemetery. 
 ''In the long sweep of American history, there are moments for each elected public servant to step aside and let someone else step up,'' he said, standing outside his flag- and wreath-bedecked clapboard home, a 19th-century schoolhouse on Main Street in East Haddam, with his 8-year-old daughter, Grace, resting her chin on his elbow, and Christina, 4, in her mother's arms. ''This is my moment to step aside.'' 
 Mr. Dodd's aides and White House officials all strove to say that he was not pushed to this decision. They said the president, vice president and leading Democrats like Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, chairman of the party's senatorial campaign committee, had done everything Mr. Dodd had asked of them; President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had even appeared at fund-raisers in Connecticut in recent months. 
 But they were all also mindful that Richard Blumenthal, the popular Connecticut attorney general who has eyed the Senate for years, might have a better shot of winning in November.
 ''None of us are irreplaceable,'' Mr. Dodd said. ''None of us are indispensable. Those who think otherwise are dangerous.''
 His announcement, which, he noted, was made on the Christian Feast of the Epiphany, dominated conversations in Connecticut. Supporters expressed dismay at the loss of Mr. Dodd's seniority, and said that his image problems might have been worse in his bachelor days and that he could have pulled out a victory if the economy recovered.
 But at the New Colony Diner in Bridgeport, Charles Cunningham, 70, an independent voter, greeted Mr. Dodd's announcement with a word: ''Good.''
 He said he believed Mr. Dodd should have faced far more serious treatment for one of the issues that had dogged him for more than a year: the fact that he had received favorable personal loans from one of the giant mortgage firms implicated in the nation's financial crisis. He said the Senate ethics committee's decision not to seriously criticize or sanction Mr. Dodd was a mistake.
 ''He got a special deal; he's a senator,'' Mr. Cunningham said. ''He should be held to a higher standard than the ordinary person, but they held him to a lower standard.''
 Mr. Dodd had all but owned Connecticut politics for much of his adult life, and he was reared to it. His father was Thomas J. Dodd, a three-term senator whose career ended ignominiously: After he was censured for converting campaign funds for his personal use, the Democratic Party dumped him in 1970, and he ran as an independent, clearing the way for Lowell Weicker, a Republican, to capture the seat.
 The younger Dodd, who idolized his father, served in the Peace Corps in the Dominican Republic before law school and won election to Congress in the post-Watergate Democratic avalanche of 1974. Six years later, pursuing what many saw as an effort to redeem the family name, he campaigned for Senate, biking across western Connecticut and pressing the flesh in union halls and shopping centers, handily defeating James Buckley in the race to succeed the retiring Senator Abraham A. Ribicoff.
 The gregarious and shrewd Mr. Dodd was in many ways a natural in the Senate, aides and colleagues said, whether dismantling a nominee before the Foreign Relations Committee in his first few months on the job, championing early childhood education, or pressing legislation on voting rights, health care or the environment.
 He stayed at it long enough to accumulate a hefty list of accomplishments, including playing a central role in the federal rescue of the financial system in 2008 and the economic stimulus package early last year. And he stepped in as acting chairman of the Senate health committee when Mr. Kennedy battled brain cancer.
 Roy Occhiogrosso, a political consultant who worked on Mr. Dodd's 2004 campaign, said his signature may turn out to be writing the Family and Medical Leave Act. ''If the measure of a politician is for how long their impact will be felt, arguably, in Dodd's case, it'll be forever,'' he said.
 Still, his failed presidential run in 2008 -- for which Mr. Dodd, the Senate banking committee's chairman, pulled up stakes and moved to Iowa even as the mortgage crisis mushroomed -- drew ridicule back home.
 But Mr. Dodd was hammered harder, and repeatedly, over the low-rate mortgage loans he received from Countrywide Financial; he eventually received something of a scolding from the Senate ethics committee, though it found no evidence he had knowingly sought special treatment. Then, early last year, a revision inserted into legislation by Senator Dodd -- he said it was at the urging of Treasury officials -- appeared to clear the way for bonuses for executives of American International Group, the troubled insurance company that received billions in federal bailout money. 
 As Republicans went on the attack, Mr. Dodd waited months before addressing questions over his personal finances -- and was stunned by his reception in his home state. 
 ''Let's put it this way: the discrepancy between Washington and Connecticut was obvious and painful,'' said one confidant who insisted on anonymity to protect his relationship with Mr. Dodd. In Washington, the confidant said, ''He is 'Mr. Chairman.' He's in the front of the line in a press conference. He is a powerful and respected political leader.
 ''You go back to Connecticut and you suffer the indignities of the problems that occurred. You show up and the crowd is not as huge as it used to be. You go to town meetings and you get questions that would have been astounding a year or two ago.''
 Mr. Dodd spent heavily, running $600,000 in commercials over the summer. But he stumbled, too, producing campaign videos portraying him as the bane of lobbyists, even as the pharmaceutical industry's lobbying arm ran its own commercials praising him and mailed brochures on his behalf to 100,000 Connecticut homes.
 His polls numbers didn't improve. A former state Democratic chairman, Ed Marcus -- with whom Mr. Dodd once battled -- publicly called on him to bow out, saying his presence on the Democratic ticket in November could cost the party the governor's office.
 And on Christmas Eve, after his stop at Mr. Kennedy's grave, Mr. Dodd flew to Hartford to trumpet that morning's Senate vote on health care. He was rattling off the bill's benefits when a heckler interrupted him, shouting, ''Talk while you can -- you're not going to get re-elected,'' according to The Hartford Courant.
 By deciding not to seek re-election, Mr. Dodd will free himself to focus on health care and on an overhaul of financial regulations.
 And so with a health scare behind him, and with his young daughters beside him, Mr. Dodd exits the arena having put aside the risk that he might duplicate the last, unhappy chapter of his late father's political career.
 ''He watched his dad engage in a lot of struggle toward the end,'' said Sandy Cloud, a former Connecticut legislator who befriended Mr. Dodd when both were college students. ''I think he decided he was going to be the one to determine when he would complete this part of his life's journey.''

HEADLINE: At Tavern Auction Preview, a Hunt for Antiques and Nostalgia

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
They kicked the tires. Grandly. 
 For the first time, dozens of potential bidders for 25,000 orphaned treasures from Tavern on the Green were admitted to the shuttered and bankrupt landmark restaurant in Central Park on Wednesday. They previewed next week's three-day auction of 1,000 lots of items that have been valued at $100 to $1.2 million. 
 ''I'd like to buy something if I can afford it,'' Arthur Ashendorff, a retired engineer from Manhattan, said as he made a flyby of offerings in the restaurant's Chestnut Room. ''Possibly something -- '' he searched for a word -- ''small.'' 
 He was in the advance guard of visitors, touring the large assemblage of candelabras, samovars, weather vanes, sculptures, murals, prints, lighting fixtures, silver and china place settings and other eccentric assets of the sprawling restaurant, which was padlocked early on New Year's Day.
 ''Everything must go,'' said Arlan Ettinger, president of Guernsey's auction house, which is mounting the sale. He hosted the sprawling walk-through in the company of his inquisitive dog, Rascal, a mixed-breed rescue pup. Previews will be from noon to 8 p.m. every day through Tuesday. Then the three-day sale -- in the Crystal Room of Tavern -- is to begin with sessions at 1 p.m. and 6 p.m. on the following day.
 Many visitors had a visceral connection to the restaurant. Elizabeth and Larry Becker -- who arrived with their 24-year-old daughter, Beth -- recalled their 1983 wedding reception in the Crystal Room and were hunting for a token that would remind them of the Tavern of yore. ''We came here every Mother's Day,'' said Mr. Becker, a financial consultant. 
 Mr. Ettinger said he was optimistic about auction attendance, since some 20 million patrons visited Tavern during the 33 years it was operated by the family of Warner LeRoy -- who, as its operator, reinvented the restaurant in 1976.
 ''It's all here, and it's all authentic,'' said Michael Desiderio, Tavern's chief operating officer, who admitted that ''I'd like some of these things myself -- but I can't afford them.'' 
 The preview of the sale -- called a nonreserve auction because there was no presale estimate of the prices of individual objects -- is expected to attract more than 1,000 visitors and, ultimately, many hundreds of bidders.
 Although Mr. Ettinger declined to put a specific value on the offerings, a Sotheby's appraisal of a portion of the LeRoy inventory a few years ago estimated the value at $8.17 million, including $1.2 million for the leaded-glass ceiling of Maxwell's Plum that was eventually moved to the Russian Tea Room (both restaurants were owned by Mr. LeRoy) and $300,000 for the antique green-crystal chandelier that is the centerpiece of the Crystal Room. 
 Although many dealers critically gauged the preview merchandise hoping to resell it, Joanna Figlia, who lives in Manhattan, had a more personal connection: she and her husband, Peter, were married in Tavern on Oct. 18, 1998. ''But I see some pieces that would be possible,'' she said, for the shelves of her antique store in Huntington, W.Va., Hattie and Nan's. 
 Of course, nostalgia was not foremost on the auction agenda. The sale could help placate a disquieted herd of more than 450 unsecured creditors -- including butchers, bakers, balloon artists and a host of purveyors -- who are trying to keep alive their hopes for repayment. 
 The assets of Tavern, a victim of the economic meltdown and changing tastes, are being contested in two federal courts. In dispute is even the ownership of the restaurant's name, which was bestowed on the property by its landlord, New York City, in 1934.
 But it was trademarked in 1981 by Mr. LeRoy, who died at the age of 65 in 2001, and now the city has given the 20-year operating license for Tavern, starting this year, to Dean J. Poll, operator of the Boathouse restaurant in Central Park.
 Even the ownership of some of the items at the sale -- including the rare chestnut paneling in the room of the same name -- are being contested by the LeRoys and the city. A federal bankruptcy judge has suggested that the items be auctioned and their proceeds put in escrow until the disputes are resolved. 
 During the eight-hour preview, which began at noon, visitors meandered though a cornucopia of Tavern memorabilia. There was a fair amount of ooh-ing and ahh-ing. The artifacts ''are a snapshot of a unique era,'' said Dr. Gail Petrosky, a dentist in Manalapan, N.J. ''I don't think the workmanship in these pieces will be replicated.'' 
 Closely examined were the restaurant's animal-shaped topiaries and dozens of new or slightly used Japanese lanterns for the illumination of the summer courtyard. ''I'd like to put the King Kong topiary on my terrace, but the cost is $50,000 and the co-op board might not approve,'' said Jeffrey Levitas, a real estate broker at the Corcoran Group. ''But I'm thinking these lanterns might work.'' 
 On the restaurant tables, regiments of samovars stood at attention, along with nickle-silver chafing dishes, Champagne stands, candelabras and a silvery cake stand. 
 Also on view was Mr. LeRoy's flamboyant wardrobe: racks full of his wildly patterned custom-made suits from Dunhill and from his tailor in Hong Kong -- many worn but a few times.
 Even his eyeglass collection was up for grabs -- including a rainbow of sunglasses in exotic colors, not to mention a pair of spectacles embellished with little silver forks.

Estimated to be worth $8.17 million, the treasures include samovars, statuary, stained-glass light shades and sculptures.

HEADLINE: Obama Urges Excise Tax On High-Cost Insurance

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama told House Democratic leaders at a meeting on Wednesday that they should include a tax on high-priced insurance policies favored by the Senate in the final version of far-reaching health care legislation, aides said. 
 The White House has long expressed a preference for the excise tax on high-cost plans, which health economists say could be an important tool in controlling long-term health care spending for the government and for individuals and families. 
 But House Democrats have resisted the idea, which is also strongly opposed by many organized labor groups -- an important part of the party's base -- because the tax may hit a number of more generous union-sponsored health plans. 
 The Senate proposal would impose a 40 percent excise tax on the cost of individual insurance policies above $8,500 and on family policies above $23,000, with higher thresholds for retirees and employees in high-risk fields like police officers. 
 The tax would raise $149 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The Senate bill would cost $871 billion over 10 years, while the House bill would cost nearly $1.1 trillion. 
 The meeting among Mr. Obama, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and top committee chairmen responsible for the health care bill came as Congressional leaders have stepped up efforts to reconcile differences between the House and Senate bills. 
 Ms. Pelosi, emerging from the meeting, said she expected those differences to be worked out soon. 
 ''We have had a very intense couple of days with meetings in our leadership, meetings with our staff,'' she said. ''After our leadership meeting this morning, our staff engaged with the Senate and the administration's staff to review the legislation, suggest legislative language. I think we're very close to reconciliation.'' 
 Mr. Obama has mostly tried to avoid taking public positions on potential disputes between the chambers, to the point that some lawmakers, including some Congressional leaders, have complained that the White House has not provided enough guidance. 
 Instead, the president and some of his advisers have talked circuitously about what they believe to be some of the more useful policy goals. 
 The budget director, Peter R. Orszag, for instance, has repeatedly extolled the potential economic merits of the proposed tax on high-cost insurance plans, as well as an independent agency to recommend potential government savings in Medicare. 
 Both of those ideas were included in the Senate bill, but not the House measure. 
 Senate Democrats are generally believed to have greater leverage in the negotiations to reconcile the two bills because they cannot afford to lose a single vote and some centrists have warned that they would turn against the bill depending on how it changes. 
 The Senate approved its bill on a party-line vote, 60 to 39, on Dec. 24. 
 But the House does not have much wiggle room either. It approved its bill on Nov. 7 by a vote of 220 to 215, with just one Republican joining 219 Democrats in favor. That means Ms. Pelosi could spare just two votes without jeopardizing the bill's chances. 
 Among the big differences between the two bills are the provisions to pay for the legislation. Both measures rely on huge reductions to slow the growth in government spending on Medicare. 
 The Senate also proposed an increase in the Medicare payroll tax for individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning more than $250,000. The House proposed an income surcharge on individuals earning more than $500,000 and couples earning more than $1 million. 
 Joining Mr. Obama and Ms. Pelosi at the meeting on Wednesday were the principal authors of the health care bill: Representative George Miller of California, the chairman of the Education and Labor Committee; Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee; and Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
 Representative Louise Slaughter of New York, the chairwoman of the House Rules Committee, also attended. 
 Mr. Rangel, who has expressed frustration at the pressure on the House to defer to the Senate, said he appreciated Mr. Obama's time and attention. 
 ''The president has been very patient with his time and understanding that we have to get 218 votes and we really have to be able to sell it -- not just to our Democratic caucus, but to the American people,'' Mr. Rangel said. ''And we could not have asked the president to be more cooperative -- even though he's doing more listening than talking.'' 
 Mr. Obama may have little choice but to emerge from listening mode in the days ahead. Senate leaders return to Washington next week, and pressure will only mount on him to help broker the final differences between the bills.

HEADLINE: Restructuring Of Simmons Is Approved

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Simmons Bedding Company said on Tuesday that a bankruptcy judge had approved its plan to be taken over by a group that owns its rival Serta. Simmons plans to emerge from bankruptcy around Jan. 20. 
 Simmons, based in Atlanta and the maker of Beautyrest and ComforPedic mattresses, said that the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Delaware had approved its prepackaged restructuring plan, which allows it to cut its debt by more than half and be acquired by Ares Management and Teachers' Private Capital. In a prepackaged bankruptcy, a company reaches agreements with creditors on reorganization and debt before it files for bankruptcy protection.
 Ares, an asset manager, and Teachers' Private Capital, the private investment department of the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, will take control of Simmons in a transaction valued at about $760 million. The deal has already been cleared by United States antitrust regulators. The new owners plan to operate Simmons and Serta separately, Simmons has said.
 Erol Uzumeri, senior vice president of Teachers' Private Capital, said, ''With its new capital structure, we are confident this investment will produce significant returns for us and all of its stakeholders -- both now and over time.''
 Under the restructuring plan, all trade vendors, suppliers, employees and senior secured lenders will be paid in full, and the company will cut its debt to about $450 million, from $1 billion. Simmons had struggled with debt taken on when it was bought by the private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners in 2003 in a $1.1 billion transaction.
 Simmons filed for bankruptcy protection in November; its sales had slumped along with the economy. 
 Miller Buckfire & Company and the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges are advising Simmons. Goldman Sachs; the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell is advising the buyers.

HEADLINE: The Happiest People

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Costa Rica 

 BODY:
 Hmmm. You think it's a coincidence? Costa Rica is one of the very few countries to have abolished its army, and it's also arguably the happiest nation on earth.
 There are several ways of measuring happiness in countries, all inexact, but this pearl of Central America does stunningly well by whatever system is used. For example, the World Database of Happiness, compiled by a Dutch sociologist on the basis of answers to surveys by Gallup and others, lists Costa Rica in the top spot out of 148 nations.
 That's because Costa Ricans, asked to rate their own happiness on a 10-point scale, average 8.5. Denmark is next at 8.3, the United States ranks 20th at 7.4 and Togo and Tanzania bring up the caboose at 2.6. 
 Scholars also calculate happiness by determining ''happy life years.'' This figure results from merging average self-reported happiness, as above, with life expectancy. Using this system, Costa Rica again easily tops the list. The United States is 19th, and Zimbabwe comes in last.
 A third approach is the ''happy planet index,'' devised by the New Economics Foundation, a liberal think tank. This combines happiness and longevity but adjusts for environmental impact -- such as the carbon that countries spew. 
 Here again, Costa Rica wins the day, for achieving contentment and longevity in an environmentally sustainable way. The Dominican Republic ranks second, the United States 114th (because of its huge ecological footprint) and Zimbabwe is last.
 Maybe Costa Rican contentment has something to do with the chance to explore dazzling beaches on both sides of the country, when one isn't admiring the sloths in the jungle (sloths truly are slothful, I discovered; they are the tortoises of the trees). Costa Rica has done an unusually good job preserving nature, and it's surely easier to be happy while basking in sunshine and greenery than while shivering up north and suffering ''nature deficit disorder.''
 After dragging my 12-year-old daughter through Honduran slums and Nicaraguan villages on this trip, she was delighted to see a Costa Rican beach and stroll through a national park. Among her favorite animals now: iguanas and sloths. 
 (Note to boss: Maybe we should have a columnist based in Costa Rica?)
 What sets Costa Rica apart is its remarkable decision in 1949 to dissolve its armed forces and invest instead in education. Increased schooling created a more stable society, less prone to the conflicts that have raged elsewhere in Central America. Education also boosted the economy, enabling the country to become a major exporter of computer chips and improving English-language skills so as to attract American eco-tourists.
 I'm not antimilitary. But the evidence is strong that education is often a far better investment than artillery.
 In Costa Rica, rising education levels also fostered impressive gender equality so that it ranks higher than the United States in the World Economic Forum gender gap index. This allows Costa Rica to use its female population more productively than is true in most of the region. Likewise, education nurtured improvements in health care, with life expectancy now about the same as in the United States -- a bit longer in some data sets, a bit shorter in others. 
 Rising education levels also led the country to preserve its lush environment as an economic asset. Costa Rica is an ecological pioneer, introducing a carbon tax in 1997. The Environmental Performance Index, a collaboration of Yale and Columbia Universities, ranks Costa Rica at No. 5 in the world, the best outside Europe.
 This emphasis on the environment hasn't sabotaged Costa Rica's economy but has bolstered it. Indeed, Costa Rica is one of the few countries that is seeing migration from the United States: Yankees are moving here to enjoy a low-cost retirement. My hunch is that in 25 years, we'll see large numbers of English-speaking retirement communities along the Costa Rican coast.
 Latin countries generally do well in happiness surveys. Mexico and Colombia rank higher than the United States in self-reported contentment. Perhaps one reason is a cultural emphasis on family and friends, on social capital over financial capital -- but then again, Mexicans sometimes slip into the United States, presumably in pursuit of both happiness and assets.
 Cross-country comparisons of happiness are controversial and uncertain. But what does seem quite clear is that Costa Rica's national decision to invest in education rather than arms has paid rich dividends. Maybe the lesson for the United States is that we should devote fewer resources to shoring up foreign armies and more to bolstering schools both at home and abroad.
 In the meantime, I encourage you to conduct your own research in Costa Rica, exploring those magnificent beaches or admiring those slothful sloths. It'll surely make you happy.

HEADLINE: Cuba: Official Says American Was a Spy

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

 BODY:
A Cuban official said Wednesday that an American contractor detained last month in Havana for distributing communications equipment to community groups worked for ''the American secret services.'' The official, Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban National Assembly, offered no evidence for his claim, which was disputed by Development Alternatives Inc., a company based outside Washington. It said it employed the American for a pro-democracy contract provided by the United States Agency for International Development.

HEADLINE: U.S. Service Sector Shows Modest Growth

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
A gauge of the United States service sector returned to growth last month, aided by the holiday season's retail sales. a private trade group reported Wednesday. The expansion reflected a slowly improving economy, but it was too slight to generate much hiring. 
 The trade group, the Institute for Supply Management, said its service index rose to 50.1 in December, from 48.7 in November. A level above 50 signals growth. Seven industries out of 18 reported growth, led by agriculture and retail.
 The I.S.M.'s employment gauge, which has not grown in two years, shrank again in December, though at a slower pace than in November. It reached 44 in December, compared with 41.6 a month earlier.
 Job generation throughout the economy has been weak even as layoffs have slowed. Economists expect the Labor Department to report Friday that the unemployment rate ticked up to 10.1 percent in December, from 10 percent in November, and that the economy lost a net total of 8,000 jobs.
 The I.S.M. said the four service-sector groups that added jobs in December were retail, finance and insurance, public administration and a category of other services.
 The overall service-sector gauge returned to growth in September for the first time in 13 months. But the comeback has been fitful amid scant gains in consumers' incomes and weak bank lending. The I.S.M.'s service-sector gauge is closely watched because service jobs make up more than 80 percent of nonfarm employment in the United States.
 ''We don't think the increase was all that convincing,'' said Millan Mulraine of TD Securities, because growth in new orders slowed and employment still signaled contraction.
 The Labor Department reported last month that the service sector added jobs in November, even though that was not reflected in the I.S.M. survey. The service sector is so large that the I.S.M. survey may not be effective in calculating changes in employment, Mr. Mulraine said. He predicts the economy will post a net increase of 25,000 jobs for December.
 The I.S.M. report said that new orders, a signal of future business, expanded for the fourth straight month, though less quickly than in November. Business activity also grew, as did the prices paid by businesses. That may mean service companies will pass their higher costs on to consumers, collecting higher revenue.
 More spending by American consumers would translate into higher sales for the nation's service providers and eventually should mean more jobs.
 ''Retail might very well be the shot in the arm,'' said Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics.
 Retailers will release December sales results on Thursday. But Mr. Ashworth cautioned that strong growth in spending was unlikely, with American shoppers constrained by slow income growth and tight credit.
 On Monday, the I.S.M. reported that manufacturing grew in December for the fifth consecutive month. A rebound in the industrial sector has been helping the United States limp out of the recession, but manufacturing does not add many American jobs. The service sector, which depends on consumer spending, is a much bigger factor in job creation.
 The ADP National Employment Report said on Wednesday that 84,000 private-sector jobs were lost in December, an improvement from November. ADP said private nonfarm employment in the service sector grew by 12,000 jobs, while manufacturing lost 43,000 jobs.

HEADLINE: Fighting Trend, China Is Luring Scientists Home

BYLINE: By SHARON LaFRANIERE; Zhang Jing, Sun Huan and Zhao Nan contributed research.

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
Scientists in the United States were not overly surprised in 2008 when the prestigious Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Maryland awarded a $10 million research grant to a Princeton University molecular biologist, Shi Yigong. 
 Dr. Shi's cell studies had already opened a new line of research into cancer treatment. At Princeton, his laboratory occupied an entire floor and had a $2 million annual budget. 
 The surprise -- shock, actually -- came a few months later, when Dr. Shi, a naturalized American citizen and 18-year resident of the United States, announced that he was leaving for good to pursue science in China. He declined the grant, resigned from Princeton's faculty and become the dean of life sciences at Tsinghua University in Beijing. 
 ''To this day, many people don't understand why I came back to China,'' he said recently between a crush of visitors to his Tsinghua office. ''Especially in my position, giving up all I had.'' 
 ''He was one of our stars,'' Robert H. Austin, a Princeton physics professor, said by telephone. ''I thought it was completely crazy.'' 
 China's leaders do not. Determined to reverse the drain of top talent that accompanied its opening to the outside world over the past three decades, they are using their now ample financial resources -- and a dollop of national pride -- to entice scientists and scholars home.
 The West, and the United States in particular, remain more attractive places for many Chinese scholars to study and do research. But the return of Dr. Shi and some other high-profile scientists is a sign that China is succeeding more quickly than many experts expected at narrowing the gap that separates it from technologically advanced nations.
 China's spending on research and development has steadily increased for a decade and now amounts to 1.5 percent of gross domestic product. The United States devotes 2.7 percent of its G.D.P. to research and development, but China's share is far higher than that of most other developing countries. 
 Chinese scientists are also under more pressure to compete with those abroad, and in the past decade they quadrupled the number of scientific papers they published a year. Their 2007 total was second only to that of the United States. About 5,000 Chinese scientists are engaged in the emerging field of nanotechnology alone, according to a recent book, ''China's Emerging Technological Edge,'' by Denis Fred Simon and Cong Cao, two United States-based experts on China. 
 A 2008 study by the Georgia Institute of Technology concluded that within the next decade or two, China would pass the United States in its ability to transform its research and development into products and services that can be marketed to the world. 
 ''As China becomes more proficient at innovation processes linking its burgeoning R.&D. to commercial enterprises, watch out,'' the study concluded. 
 Quantity is not quality, and despite its huge investment, China still struggles in many areas of science and technology. No Chinese-born scientist has ever been awarded a Nobel Prize for research conducted in mainland China, although several have received one for work done in the West. While climbing, China ranked only 10th in the number of patents granted in the United States in 2008. 
 Chinese students continue to leave in droves. Nearly 180,000 left in 2008, almost 25 percent more than in 2007, as more families were able to pay overseas tuition. For every four students who left in the past decade, only one returned, Chinese government statistics show. Those who obtained science or engineering doctorates from American universities were among the least likely to return.
 Recently, though, China has begun to exert a reverse pull. In the past three years, renowned scientists like Dr. Shi have begun to trickle back. And they are returning with a mission: to shake up China's scientific culture of cronyism and mediocrity, often cited as its biggest impediment to scientific achievement. 
 They are lured by their patriotism, their desire to serve as catalysts for change and their belief that the Chinese government will back them. 
 ''I felt I owed China something,'' said Dr. Shi, 42, who is described by Tsinghua students as caring and intensely driven. ''In the United States, everything is more or less set up. Whatever I do here, the impact is probably tenfold, or a hundredfold.'' 
 He and others like him left the United States with fewer regrets than some Americans might assume. While he was courted by a clutch of top American universities and rose swiftly through Princeton's academic ranks, Dr. Shi said he believed many Asians confronted a glass ceiling in the United States. 
 Rao Yi, a 47-year-old biologist who left Northwestern University in 2007 to become dean of the School of Life Sciences at Peking University in Beijing, contrasts China's ''soul-searching'' with America's self-satisfaction. When the United States Embassy in Beijing asked him to explain why he wanted to renounce his American citizenship, he wrote that the United States had lost its moral leadership after the 9/11 attacks. But ''the American people are still reveling in the greatness of the country and themselves,'' he said in a draft letter. 
 These scientists were not uniformly won over by the virtues of democracy, either. While Dr. Rao said he hoped and believed that China would become a multiparty democracy in his lifetime, Dr. Shi said he doubted that that political system ''will ever be appropriate for China.'' 
 As a Tsinghua student, Dr. Shi joined the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square. As a registered Democrat in the United States, he participated eagerly in elections. ''Multiparty democracy is perfect for the United States,'' he said. ''But believing that multiparty democracy is right for the United States does not mean it is right for China.'' 
 Yet the re-entry to the politicized world of science in China can be challenging. Some scientists with weaker resumes have shunned returnees. In its biennial election of academicians last month, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China's highest advisory body on science and technology, passed over Dr. Shi and Dr. Rao. It also did not recognize Wang Xiaodong, a well-known Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator who recently left the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas for Beijing's National Institute of Biological Sciences. 
 The tension has spilled over into the Chinese blogosphere, where Dr. Shi has been attacked as insincere and untrustworthy. In a posting in 2008, Liu Zhongwu, a professor of science and engineering at South China University of Technology, said that Dr. Shi should be excluded from any projects that touch on China's national interests. ''Bear in mind, he is a foreigner,'' he wrote. 
 ''The last year and a half have been like 10 years to me,'' said Dr. Shi, who says the criticism is redolent of the Cultural Revolution. ''I am rejoicing that I am still standing.'' 
 But the returnees also have powerful friends, including their universities' presidents and some officials within the Communist Party's Central Committee. Dr. Shi and Dr. Rao helped draft the party's new program to hire top-flight overseas scientists, entrepreneurs and other experts -- the latest incarnation of the government's campaign to lure its scholars home. 
 In May 2008, Dr. Shi was invited to speak about the future of Chinese science and technology to Vice President Xi Jinping and other high-ranking officials at Zhongnanhai, the leadership compound in Beijing.
 Dr. Rao says the government is generous -- maybe overly so -- in financing science. The challenge, he said, is making sure that the funds are spent wisely, not simply handed over to those in bureaucratic favor. 
 Five years ago, as head of a scientific institute at Northwestern University, he made the same argument in the British journal Nature. Dr. Rao wrote that connections too often trumped merit when grants were handed out in China. He recommended abolishing the Ministry of Science and Technology and reassigning its budget to a ''more reputable'' agency. 
 His critique was banned in China. But last October, China Daily, the state-run English-language newspaper, summarized it in a profile of Dr. Rao headlined ''A Man With a Mission.'' 
 ''It is going to be an uphill battle,'' said Mr. Cao, an author of the book on China. ''They are excellent scientists. But they must form a critical mass to reform the system. If they don't reform it, they will leave.'' 
 At Tsinghua, Dr. Shi says he is optimistic. In less than two years, he has recruited about 18 postdoctoral fellows, almost all from the United States. Each has opened an independent laboratory. Within a decade, he said, Tsinghua's life sciences department will expand fourfold. 
 Dr. Shi does not pretend that science there is now on a par with Princeton. Rather, he likens Tsinghua to a respected American state university. 
 But ''in a matter of years,'' he said, ''we will get there.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Jan. 7 about China's efforts to lure back expatriate scholars and scientists referred incorrectly to the resume of Wang Xiaodong, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and a director of Beijing's National Institute of Biological Sciences. Mr. Wang remains a full-time professor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas -- he has not left. (He simultaneously serves as director of the Beijing institute.)

HEADLINE: Suicide Bombing Puts a Rare Face on C.I.A.'s Work

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and MARK MAZZETTI; James Risen and Eric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington, and Alissa J. Rubin from Kabul, Afghanistan. Kitty Bennett contributed research.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In the fall of 2001, as an anguished nation came to grips with the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, a slender, soft-spoken economics major named Elizabeth Hanson set out to write her senior thesis at Colby College in Maine. Her question was a timely one: How do the world's three major faith traditions apply economic principles?
 Ms. Hanson's report, ''Faithless Heathens: Scriptural Economics of Judaism, Christianity and Islam,'' carried a title far more provocative than its contents, said the professor who advised her. But it may have given a hint of her career to come, as an officer for the Central Intelligence Agency specializing in hunting down Islamic extremists.
 That career was cut short last week: Ms. Hanson was one of seven Americans killed in a suicide bombing at a C.I.A. base in the remote mountains of Afghanistan. 
 In the days since the attack, details of the lives of the victims -- five men and two women, including two C.I.A. contractors from the firm formerly known as Blackwater -- have begun to trickle out, despite the secretive nature of their work. What emerges is a rare public glimpse of a closed society, a peek into one sliver of the spy agency as it operates more than eight years after the C.I.A. was pushed to the front lines of war.
 Their deaths were a significant blow to the agency, crippling a team responsible for collecting information about militant networks in Afghanistan and Pakistan and plotting missions to kill the networks' top leaders. And in one sign of how the once male-dominated bastion of the C.I.A. has changed in recent years, the suicide bombing revealed that a woman had been in charge of the base that was attacked, Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost Province.
 On Wednesday, the operational leader of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan issued a statement praising the work of the suicide bomber, Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi, and said that the Khost bombing, which also killed a Jordanian intelligence operative, was revenge for the killings of a number of top militant leaders in C.I.A. drone attacks.
 ''He detonated his fine, astonishing and well-designed explosive device, which was unseen by the eyes of those who do not believe in the hereafter,'' said the statement from the Qaeda leader, Mustafa Abu al-Yazid, which was translated by the SITE Intelligence Group.
 Those who died came from all corners of the United States but were thrown together in one of the most dangerous parts of the world. Several had military backgrounds. One of the fallen C.I.A. employees, a security officer named Scott Roberson, had worked undercover as a narcotics detective in the Atlanta Police Department, according to an obituary, and spent time in Kosovo for the United Nations. Postings on an online memorial site describe a hard-charging motorcyclist with a remarkable recall of episodes of ''The Benny Hill Show.'' 
 Another, Harold Brown Jr., was a former Army reservist and father of three who had traveled home from Afghanistan briefly in July to help his family move into a new home in the Northern Virginia suburbs. 
 Mr. Brown's mother, Barbara, said in an interview that her son -- she had believed he worked for the State Department -- had intended to spend a year in Afghanistan, returning home in April. He did not relish the work, she said, and talked little about it.
 ''The people there just want to live their lives. They're normal people,'' she recalled him saying, adding that he had told her parts of Afghanistan were ''just like back in biblical times.''
 The base chief, an agency veteran, had traveled to Afghanistan last year as part of the C.I.A.'s effort to augment its ranks in the war zone. After consulting with the C.I.A., The New York Times is withholding some identifying information about the woman. The agency declined to comment about the identities of any of the employees. Some of the names were disclosed by family members. Ms. Hanson's name was first reported in The Daily Beast, an online magazine.
 In a telephone interview, her father, Duane Hanson Jr., said an agency official called several days ago to let him know that his daughter, who he said would have turned 31 next month, had been killed. He knew little of her work, other than that she had been in Afghanistan. ''I begged her not to go,'' he recalled. ''I said, 'Do you know how dangerous that is? That's for soldiers.' ''
 The other woman killed, the chief of the Khost base, was, before the Sept. 11 attacks, part of a small cadre of counterterrorism officers focused on the growth of Al Qaeda and charged with finding Osama bin Laden.
 Working from a small office near C.I.A. headquarters, the group, known inside the agency as Alec Station, became increasingly alarmed in the summer of 2001 that a major strike was coming. One former officer recalls that the woman had a seemingly encyclopedic knowledge of Al Qaeda's top leadership and was so familiar with the different permutations of the leaders' names that she could take fragments of intelligence and build them into a mosaic of Al Qaeda's operations. 
 ''She was one of the first people in the agency to tackle Al Qaeda in a serious way,'' said the former officer, who, like some others interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity because the victims' identities remain classified. 
 She was not the only veteran Qaeda expert killed in the attack. One victim, whose name has not been disclosed, was one of the C.I.A.'s most knowledgeable analysts about the terrorist network, according to a retired senior agency official. 
 Two of the dead, Jeremy Wise, 35, a former member of the Navy Seals from Virginia Beach, Va., and Dane Clark Paresi, 46, of Dupont, Wash., were security officers for Xe Services, the firm formerly known as Blackwater. 
 The company did not respond to a request for comment about the deaths, but they have been widely reported in local newspapers. The Jeremy Wise Memorial on Facebook had 3,189 fans on Tuesday, filled with recollections of Mr. Wise's childhood as the son of a doctor in Arkansas; his parents currently live in Hope, Bill Clinton's hometown.
 ''RIP, Jeremy Wise, American hero,'' one wrote.
 The suicide bomber has been identified as a Jordanian double agent who was taken onto the base to meet with American officials who thought he was an informant.
 In a message to the C.I.A. work force after the attack, President Obama told agency employees that ''your triumphs and even your names may be unknown to your fellow Americans.'' And indeed, some relatives and friends of the dead did not seem to know of their agency connections.
 Ms. Hanson's economics professor, Michael Donihue, said he was shocked to discover her career path. At Colby, from which she graduated in 2002, she paired her economics major with a minor in Russian language and literature.
 ''She was a thoughtful person; she had an intellectual curiosity that I really liked,'' Professor Donihue said.
 Officials in Afghanistan and Washington said the C.I.A. group in Khost had been particularly aggressive in recent months against the Haqqani network, a militant group that has claimed responsibility for dozens of American deaths in Afghanistan. One NATO official in Afghanistan spoke in stark terms about the attack, saying it had ''effectively shut down a key station.''
 ''These were not people who wrote things down in the computer or in notebooks. It was all in their heads,'' he said. The C.I.A. is ''pulling in new people from all over the world, but how long will it take to rebuild the networks, to get up to speed? Lots of it is irrecoverable. Lots of it.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Wary As Two Senators Decide to Retire

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The sudden decision by two senior Democratic senators to retire shook the party's leaders on Wednesday and signaled that President Obama is facing a perilous political environment that could hold major implications for this year's midterm elections and his own agenda.
 The rapidly shifting climate, less than a year after Mr. Obama took office on the strength of a historic Democratic sweep, was brought into focus by the announcements that Senators Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut and Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota would retire rather than wage uphill fights for re-election.
With the chances growing that the election in November would end the 60-vote majority Democrats enjoy in the Senate -- the practical threshold for being able to overcome united Republican opposition -- the president and his party face additional urgency to make progress on his agenda this year.
 There was no immediate sign that the developments would further complicate White House efforts to secure final passage of Mr. Obama's main domestic priority, the overhaul of the health care system, but the political pressure on Democrats from competitive states and districts will not make it any easier. 
 Following on the heels of the news of the senators' retirements, Gov. Bill Ritter Jr. of Colorado, a Democrat, also announced Wednesday that he would not seek a second term. 
 Together, the developments heightened a perception that a conservative push against the president's ambitious agenda, a sluggish recovery from the deep recession and an outbreak of angry populism have combined to deplete Mr. Obama's political strength and give Republicans a chance for big gains in this year's races for the Senate and the House.
 To the degree that the retirements reflect increasing skepticism among voters about the direction Democrats are pushing the country, Mr. Obama could face a tougher time winning legislative support as he presses ahead with initiatives on climate change, financial regulation, education and other issues. 
 Republicans seized on the resignations as a way to raise money and generate enthusiasm among voters in their conservative base.
 ''Voters and donors out in the country see two senior Democrats, both of whom were perceived to be safe a year ago, now retiring for fear of losing,'' said Rob Jesmer, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ''This further underscores our belief that with each passing day, the environment is getting better and better for Republicans, which energizes our people and demoralizes theirs.''
 The White House and Democratic Party leaders reached out on Wednesday to reassure other potentially vulnerable Democrats in an effort to prevent any more retirements or party-switching. Obama aides played down the developments, saying it would be foolish to make predictions now about the November elections before Mr. Obama had even delivered his State of the Union address. If health care legislation passes and the economy improves, advisers believe the president and the party will be in a stronger position by fall.
 ''We're weathering the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression,'' said David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, ''so it's not a hospitable environment for incumbents generally. We're in the majority party, so the brunt of that falls on us.''
 ''There's not an election tomorrow,'' he said. ''There's not an election next week. There's not an election for 11 months.''
 The effects of the retirements are not entirely negative for Democrats. Mr. Dodd had been widely expected to lose if he had stayed in the race; his departure clears the way for Democrats to put in a stronger candidate -- Richard Blumenthal, the state attorney general, who announced Wednesday that he was running. 
 Mr. Dorgan was facing tough going as it was; his departure, Democrats and Republicans said, left the Democrats with an uphill battle to hold on to the seat in North Dakota. 
 While Democrats seemed confident about holding on to a majority in the Senate, they acknowledged that keeping their 60-seat majority would be difficult and that 51 votes are not enough to advance most legislation in the face of united Republican opposition. 
 For Mr. Obama, that means the legislative clock is ticking. Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said the retirements of Mr. Dodd and Mr. Dorgan would not create a ripple effect among other senators facing re-election. Mr. Menendez said the senators were hiring campaign staff and raising money with an eye toward November. 
 ''They are all in it to win it,'' he said. 
 Still, seldom has a week passed in the last few months when a House or Senate Democrat, fearful of the outcome in the midterm elections, has not switched parties or retired. And the image of Democrats struggling could have the effect of encouraging other Democratic officeholders worried about the political climate to step aside. ''We should be concerned,'' said Gov. Edward G. Rendell, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, ''and we should develop our plans and our policies and the programs we are going to push for with an eye to 2010. But there's no reason to panic.''
 While Republicans appear to be in a position to make strong gains in Congress, analysts say they appear unlikely to regain control of either the House or Senate, given the strong margins Democrats built in 2008. In the Senate, Democrats hold 58 seats, and two independents align themselves with the Democrats; Republicans hold 40 seats. About seven Democratic seats and four Republican-held seats appear to be in play now.
 In the House, Democrats have a 256-to-178 seat majority. Analysts on both sides say Democrats could lose from 20 to 25 seats in the current climate, though obviously a whole host of factors -- the strength of the economy, public views of Mr. Obama's health care plan, another attempted terrorist attack -- could reshuffle that deck.
 Despite the focus on the Democrats' problems, Republicans are faring worse this year in terms of resignations putting seats in play. In the House, 14 Republicans and 10 Democrats are retiring, and Representative Robert Wexler, Democrat of Florida, has resigned, leaving one vacancy. In the Senate, six Republicans, including several in swing states requiring expensive campaigns, and four Democrats, including Mr. Dodd and Mr. Dorgan, are retiring.
 Republicans have to defend open Senate seats in New Hampshire, Ohio and Missouri, after a spate of retirements last year.
 When the Republican Party's national chairman, Michael Steele, was asked on Sean Hannity's syndicated radio program earlier this week if he believed Republicans could win the House, he replied: ''Not this year.''
 One day later, after facing considerable criticism from his own party, he revised his assessment in an interview with MSNBC. ''Yes, we can,'' Mr. Steele said.

HEADLINE: Paterson Says Legislators Put State in Danger

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and JEREMY W. PETERS

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
In a strikingly blunt State of the State address, Gov. David A. Paterson chastised the lawmakers seated before him on Wednesday, saying they had spent the state into near-ruin and stood by as a plague of political corruption destroyed New Yorkers' trust in their government.
 Dispensing with the ritualized flattery that typically precedes the annual address, Mr. Paterson said that the Legislature's reluctance to make hard decisions and rein in its own excesses had plunged the state even deeper into crisis.
 ''You have left me and other governors no choice,'' Mr. Paterson, the former State Senate minority leader, said. ''Whether it be by vetoes or delayed spending, I will not write bad checks, and we will not mortgage our children's future.'' 
 The public scolding drew a cold response from lawmakers, who gave Mr. Paterson little applause and rose from their chairs only when he entered and exited the Assembly chamber. 
 Some sat stony-faced during the speech, while others fidgeted with BlackBerrys.
 The speech -- and its reception -- stood in stark contrast to Mr. Paterson's first speech in the chamber two years ago -- after taking office when Eliot Spitzer resigned -- when he earned thunderous praise from lawmakers, whom he charmed with self-effacement and nonstop jokes.
 Now, after months of bruising battles with a Legislature resistant to the broad spending cuts that he believes are necessary to save the state, Mr. Paterson's relationship with his former colleagues could not be more strained.
 The governor entered the packed chamber with nary a handshake for the hundreds of lawmakers and other officials who had assembled to hear him speak, and did not crack a single smile during his 30-minute address. Instead, he issued calls for tougher ethics oversight, the abolition of programs he called wasteful and a cap on state spending, often drawing on Biblical language. 
 ''Prosperity hides all manner of sin, but no longer,'' Mr. Paterson declared. ''We have to rise to the highest expectation of our people and bring them the lasting change they have long, long fought for and desired.'' 
 New York is facing a fiscal crisis decades in the making and a $7 billion shortfall projected for the coming year. Last year, buoyed in part by federal stimulus aid, state officials increased total spending by nearly 9 percent, even as the economy faltered and revenues plummeted.
 Lawmakers, Mr. Paterson charged, had too often bowed to the wishes of powerful special interests, feeding an ''addiction to spending, power and approval'' and plunging the state into economic catastrophe.
 ''No longer are we going to run New York like a payday loan operation,'' the governor vowed.
 Referring to industry and labor lobbyists in the chamber, he declared, ''The moneyed interests -- many are here today as guests -- have got to understand that their days of influence in this town are numbered.''
 But after warning lawmakers for months of the state's impending fiscal ruin, Mr. Paterson seemed determined to offer hope as well as caution, suggesting that state officials now had an opportunity to restore New York to glory.
 ''There is still time to rebuild the Empire State,'' Mr. Paterson told the lawmakers. ''Work with me, follow me, so that New York can turn the corner.''
 Mr. Paterson's ethics proposals are the most ambitious ever offered by a New York governor, and would not only set term limits for all lawmakers and statewide officials, but also ban corporate campaign contributions, reduce individual contribution limits from a maximum of $55,900 to $1,000, and require all lawmakers to disclose all their outside sources of income.
 The governor also proposed new policies aimed at spurring job creation and economic development, especially in the beleaguered upstate region. Chief among Mr. Paterson's goals is scrapping the scandal-plagued Empire Zone program of business tax breaks and replacing it with new one, called the Excelsior Jobs program, that would focus on high-tech development and so-called green jobs. 
 With statewide elections less than a year away, and his own future as uncertain as New York's finances, Mr. Paterson's speech carried an inevitable subtext -- not least because he delivered his remarks with Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, his likely challenger in the Democratic primary, standing just a few feet away on the dais.
 ''Some say that we will not succeed -- that the story has already been written and the ending is ordained,'' Mr. Paterson told the lawmakers, a thought that might just as easily be applied to the widespread belief among fellow Democrats that he cannot win election as to pessimism about the state's finances. ''But story lines change, and people change.''
 Mr. Cuomo said that the governor ''hit most of the right issues. It's about ethics reform, there's no doubt, it's about fiscal reform. The trick for us this year is actually getting it done.'' 
 Mr. Paterson's remarks drew quick praise from business groups and budget hawks. But some Democratic lawmakers expressed resentment at Mr. Paterson's finger-wagging.
 ''The people want statesmen to fix our problems, not politicians who ascribe blame without offering a solution,'' Senator John L. Sampson, the Democratic leader in the State Senate, said, adding: ''We have to put aside our differences. We don't have to like one another, but we need to respect one another.''
 The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, who has shied away from criticizing Mr. Paterson in public, was less direct, suggesting that the governor's priorities were misplaced and that the state should be focusing on creating jobs above all else.
 Neither Mr. Sampson nor Mr. Silver commented directly on the governor's call for an ethics overhaul, a centerpiece of his address. Though the proposals were spelled out in detail in a briefing book distributed after the address, both men said they could not comment until they had seen draft legislation from Mr. Paterson.
 Notably, most of the praise for the governor's remarks came from Republicans. Edward F. Cox, the state Republican Party chairman, said Mr. Paterson delivered ''a Republican message of fiscal responsibility and capping spending.''
 Most of Mr. Paterson's applause also came from Republicans, who have been shut out of power since losing control of the State Senate last year, but have high hopes that public outrage over taxes and spending will propel them back this fall. But Republican leaders also suggested that Mr. Paterson had talked about fiscal restraint more than he had delivered on it. 
 ''Last year, he gave a similar speech and promised to hold the line on spending and not raise taxes,'' said Senator Dean G. Skelos, the Republican minority leader. ''Unfortunately, that did not happen. Along with his Democrat colleagues in the Senate and Assembly, the governor approved a budget that included record increases in spending.''
 Some Democrats were more receptive to Mr. Paterson.
 ''I thought he gave the speech of his life,'' said Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright, a Harlem Democrat and one of the governor's staunchest allies in the Legislature. ''Whether you agree with him or not, you know where he's going.''

HEADLINE: The Year the Senate Fell

BYLINE: By IRA SHAPIRO. 
Ira Shapiro, a lawyer and former Clinton administration official, is working on a book about the Senate in the '60s and '70s.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 ON Wednesday, Senator Chris Dodd announced his retirement after 30 years in the Senate. As a Senate Democratic staffer in 1980, I remember Mr. Dodd's election well -- it was the only bright spot on the night that changed the Senate drastically, and in ways we still feel today.
 In the 1960s and '70s, a great Senate had occupied a unique place in our country. It was the Senate that broke the Southern filibuster to enact the Civil Rights Act of 1964; became the arena for challenging, and ultimately ending, the Vietnam War; called Richard Nixon to account; spearheaded new environmental and consumer protections; and advanced equal treatment for women. In an era marked by war, assassinations and political scandal, the Senate provided continuity, gravitas and leadership. 
 The Senate's fall was as swift as it was surprising. In 1977, the Senate greeted a new president, Jimmy Carter, with a new leadership team of its own, Robert Byrd as majority leader and Howard Baker as minority leader. Several iconic members -- Sam Ervin, J. William Fulbright, Mike Mansfield, Philip Hart -- were gone. But the core of the great Senate, the liberal Democrats elected in 1958 and 1962, and the moderate-to-progressive Republicans who had forged so many bipartisan alliances, was still intact. 
 The Russell and Dirksen Senate Office Buildings were filled with young, talented, ambitious staff members like Madeleine Albright, Tim Russert, Susan Collins and Tom Daschle. And after battling the imperial presidencies of Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon, the Senate was armed with new legislative tools, including the War Powers Act, the Budget Control Act and the Freedom of Information Act. 
 There was every reason to think that the Senate would continue with a solid Democratic majority, operate in a bipartisan fashion, and have a powerful, positive influence in the country. But the assertive Senate Democrats and the new, outsider president clashed from the start. Republicans formed strong alliances with an energized business community and surging social conservatives. Jesse Helms, finishing his first term, and Orrin Hatch, newly elected, mastered and exploited the Senate rules; liberal senators retaliated in kind. The filibuster, previously a weapon of last resort, became increasingly commonplace. 
 Still, thanks to statesmanship and bipartisan traditions, the 95th Congress compiled a respectable record, including passage of a far-ranging energy program, the Civil Service Reform Act and financial relief for New York City. 
 America's politics, however, had already started moving to the right, spurred by anger over the Panama Canal treaty and a tax revolt that started in California and swept across the country. In the 1978 election, conservatives helped oust several Democratic senators and purged Republican liberals: defeating Clifford Case in a primary; standing by while Ed Brooke, the only African-American senator, lost; and causing Charles Percy, who won re-election only after pledging that he had ''gotten the message,'' to turn hard to the right. 
 Nixon's 49-state sweep in 1972 had not diminished the Democratic majority. But by 1980, with America facing an economy in tailspin and the hostage crisis in Iran, the conservative tide was running too strong, and the veteran liberal senators had plainly lost a step.
 Frank Church, who had overseen the Senate investigation into intelligence abuses, turned hawkish in a desperate effort to revive his sagging political fortunes. George McGovern, who had provided singular leadership in opposing the Vietnam War and fighting hunger, slumped badly in his re-election bid. Jacob Javits, the most liberal Republican and perhaps the greatest legislator of his era, unwisely sought one more term despite failing health.
 Before joining Thomas Eagleton's staff, I had worked for Gaylord Nelson, the great Wisconsin environmentalist who was now campaigning unconvincingly as a champion of small business. One afternoon, I found Eagleton scribbling furiously on a pad, talking on the phone, smoking constantly.
 ''We've got to help Gaylord,'' Eagleton boomed. ''He just did a three-day California fund-raising trip.'' 
 Nelson hated fund-raising. ''That sounds like a good thing,'' I ventured. 
 ''He actually came out behind,'' Eagleton told me. ''The trip cost more than he raised.'' 
 On election night, my wife, Nancy, and I got into the car to go to the first of several parties. It was just after 8 p.m.; the radio told us that Birch Bayh had been defeated by Dan Quayle. 
 ''They're all going down,'' I said. Nancy knew I meant the veteran Senate liberals. 
 That night, they were all defeated as Ronald Reagan won a crushing victory over Jimmy Carter. Additionally, Abraham Ribicoff, one of the liberal stalwarts, had retired, as had Adlai Stevenson, while Ed Muskie had left the Senate in May to become secretary of state. It was the greatest exodus of talent and experience in Senate history. The incoming Republican class had a few promising politicians, but it also included many who came with no visible accomplishments, and left, one term later, with that record intact. 
 In the weeks that followed, we Democrats were virtual zombies, numb with grief and shock. It didn't help that the Republicans celebrated boisterously and endlessly. At the end of one long day, the elevator opened in front of me, and a group of happy Republicans, dressed in formal wear, poured out. I noticed a heavily made-up but still strikingly attractive woman: Senator John Warner's wife, better known as Elizabeth Taylor. 
 The 1980 election was more than just a change of party control from Democratic to Republican. Gone was the Senate that had been experienced, progressive and bipartisan; 30 years have passed, and the decline has only accelerated. The Senate today is bitterly divided, frequently paralyzed and borderline bizarre. Olympia Snowe offered this sad observation: ''We have been miniaturized.'' 
 Can the Senate renew itself? In late 1963, the Senate was also in crisis, to the point that Mike Mansfield, the majority leader, prepared to offer his resignation as majority leader. But one towering achievement, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, transformed the legislative body and began the period of great accomplishment that lasted until 1980. Against the odds, let us hope that the Senate's recent passage of landmark health care legislation can have the same effect.

HEADLINE: Will the Real Chris Dodd Stand Up?

 BODY:
Senator Christopher Dodd's decision to not seek re-election in November could be a fatal blow to meaningful financial regulatory reform -- or a desperately needed boost. It depends on what he does now. 
 Mr. Dodd has been in the Senate since 1981 and has been chairman of the banking committee since 2007. Over the years, we have seen two very different Chris Dodds. 
 There is the reformer who championed the Family and Medical Leave Act and helped to expand Head Start. There is also the all-too-cozy pal of Wall Street who is one of the top recipients of millions of dollars in donations from commercial banks and the securities industry. Recently, Mr. Dodd's fingerprints were on legislation that allowed the American International Group to pay big bonuses after the firm was bailed out by taxpayers. 
 That coziness -- especially the V.I.P. cut-rate mortgage he received from the now-defunct subprime lender, Countrywide Financial -- is one of the reasons his state's voters have turned against him. With a legacy to burnish, and no need to drum up campaign contributions, we hope the reformer will be unleashed. 
 Last year, Mr. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, put forth a strong financial reform proposal that would have gone a long way toward protecting ordinary Americans and avoiding a replay of the banking meltdown. It included robust consumer protection, sound regulation of derivatives and limits on too-big-to-fail firms. Naysaying senators on the committee -- Republicans and a few Democrats -- blocked the proposal. Mr. Dodd then set up four bipartisan teams to come up with alternatives. They are supposed to report back this month. 
 We would love to be pleasantly surprised, but odds are that they will offer up a watery gruel. Much like fiscal stimulus and health care reform, Republicans appear determined to block significant financial reform, no matter how desperately needed, lest it be perceived as a victory for President Obama. 
 This is where Mr. Dodd can try to make a difference.
 Impending retirement frees him from having to woo donors or listen to anyone or anything other than his own best instincts. He is free to criticize and, if need be, condemn the working groups' proposals -- to contrast their proposals with his own and challenge them to explain how anything less than sweeping reform will be enough to protect Americans. 
 (We would be disappointed if he decided to go through the revolving door and seek a job in the industry he now oversees. But if that is his eventual choice, he would be doing Wall Street a real favor if he works now to save the financial industry from its own excesses.) 
 Mr. Dodd's fellow senators certainly need a lot of goading. So does the White House. President Obama has vowed to rein in Wall Street, but the White House has pushed for loopholes in derivatives legislation and recently proclaimed itself satisfied with a House-passed reform bill that was weaker on consumer protection than what's needed. 
 At the top of the agenda, Mr. Dodd and the White House should loudly resist attempts to defang the proposed consumer protection legislation. Mr. Dodd should also insist that dangerous gaps in proposed derivatives' regulation be closed. 
 Mr. Dodd may be a lame duck. But he is still chairman of the committee. That gives him a formidable bully pulpit. He should use it.

HEADLINE: Some Honesty in Albany

 BODY:
Long before Gov. David Paterson delivered his annual report on New York's condition on Wednesday, everyone knew that the state of the state was desperate. New York is crippled by a mounting budget crisis and saddled with a Legislature that is incompetent in its governance and corrupt in its behavior.
 To his great credit, Mr. Paterson skipped the usual, and usually insincere, homages to his fellow politicians and went straight into an unsparing assessment of fiscal and political reality. He insisted that the Legislature attack economics and ethics at the same time. 
 ''Cultures of addiction to spending, power and approval have ruined empires, and now they threaten the Empire State,'' he said, reciting his powerful speech from memory because his limited eyesight prevents him from reading from paper or a teleprompter.
 The full details of his economic plans will become clearer when he presents his budget later this month. But Mr. Paterson made a good start on Wednesday by asking the assembled lawmakers -- who mostly looked on sullenly or applauded wanly -- to cap spending so Albany can finally get a grip on a deficit that is expected to be about $8 billion this year. ''There are more deficits up ahead that will require an even greater sacrifice,'' he said.
 Mr. Paterson said he directed Lt. Gov. Richard Ravitch to create a four-year budget plan to replace the year-by-year recklessness that leaves counties, cities and towns vulnerable to economic downturns like the one now paralyzing them. Among other things, the governor proposed eliminating the costly and increasingly corrupt Empire Zone economic development program, which ended up shuffling jobs around from place to place. He suggested replacing it with a program focused on creating jobs in the high-tech and clean-energy sectors. 
 But Mr. Paterson went beyond the necessary hard talk about budgets and demanded that legislators ''bring fairness and openness to government, which has very little of either.'' Albany's lawmakers should be worried about both of those things, and many swiftly denounced his proposal as an attempt to bolster low poll ratings. That's fine with us. At this point, anything that forces the State Legislature to confront reality is valuable.
 Here are a few of Mr. Paterson's best ideas:
 To clean up one of the nation's most notoriously corrupt campaign finance systems, he proposes encouraging much-needed competition by phasing in public financing of campaigns. That would mean limiting contributions to $1,000 instead of $55,900 for state races. Lobbyists would be allowed to pitch in only $250. He would end the scandalous practice of writing checks for party ''housekeeping'' that have no limits at all.
 He wants to ban all contributions from corporations, including limited liability corporations, one of the latest tricks for adding big bucks to campaigns. His bill would also ban transfers from committee to committee, which allows politicians to pile money from various sources into one campaign. He wants to limit personal use of campaign dollars, finally, and he wants to increase penalties for violations of this new law.
 To tackle the pay-to-play culture, the governor's bill would require everybody earning public money to disclose all outside business income in detail. His bill would even require lawyers to itemize their income and clients -- an idea that the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, an attorney who profits handsomely from New York's lack of transparency, is expected to fight ferociously.
 He proposed creating a board of financial experts to help oversee the state pension fund. The comptroller is now the sole trustee of $126 billion in pensions.
 He wants to end double-dipping by closing a 1995 loophole that permits legislators to collect a state pension along with their legislative salary.
 He also proposed a truly independent ethics commission to oversee all branches of the government. The state's top politicians would appoint a ''designating committee'' that would then appoint the commission. That is a far cry from today's Legislative Ethics Commission, which is made up of legislators who -- to everyone's disgust but no one's surprise -- generally find nothing wrong with their colleagues' misbehavior.
 Not all of Mr. Paterson's ideas are useful, like his suggestion for term limits on state politicians. For Albany, that is a particularly seductive idea since most legislators only leave office if they retire, die or go to jail. The democratic way to impose term limits is at the ballot box. The state must make it easier to challenge incumbents who have been in Albany for far too long.
 Albany's time-serving politicians wasted no time attacking the ethical reforms. State Senator Dean Skelos, the Republican leader, scoffed that most New Yorkers are interested in jobs and taxes, not reform. Joseph Bruno, the former Republican leader, made that same point about a year before he was convicted for abusing the public trust. These denizens of the old Albany have not gotten the message that fiscal responsibility and ethical responsibility are inseparable. New Yorkers want both.
 Mr. Paterson will have to negotiate with Mr. Silver and the Democrats in the State Senate to get any ethics bill passed, and it is not clear that he has the political will, or the political muscle, to make that happen. But he was right to set the bar high at the start.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Senate Defeats Same-Sex Marriage Bill

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
The State Senate on Thursday rejected a proposal that would have made New Jersey the sixth state in the nation to allow marriages involving same-sex couples. The vote was the latest in a succession of setbacks for advocates of gay marriage across the country.
 After months of intense lobbying and hours of emotional debate, lawmakers voted 20 to 14 against the bill, bringing tears from some advocates who packed the Senate chambers and rousing applause from opponents of the measure, who also came out in force. The vote ends the effort to win legislative approval of the measure, and sets the stage for a new battle before the New Jersey Supreme Court. 
 ''We applaud the senators for upholding a time-tested institution: marriage,'' said Len Deo, president of the New Jersey Family Policy Council, which has argued that gay marriage would weaken the social fabric by redefining one of society's bedrock institutions.
 Supporters of gay marriage had hoped to win approval for the measure before Jan. 19, when Gov. Jon S. Corzine, who promised to sign it, will be replaced by Gov.-elect Christopher J. Christie, who opposes it. 
 With the effort to win legislative approval now dead, supporters of same-sex marriage vowed to focus their efforts on the state's highest court, which in 2006 ordered lawmakers to give same-sex couples the same rights as others whether or not they called such unions marriages. The Legislature responded by enacting a civil unions law, but gay-rights leaders say that the measure still leaves them subject to discrimination when applying for health insurance or trying to visit partners in hospitals, and that they will ask the court to grant them equal treatment.
 ''Even our opponents in the Legislature acknowledge that the civil-union law has not provided equal protection,'' said Steven Goldstein, chairman of Garden State Equality, who has led the lobbying for the past six years and wept as the bill's sponsor, Senator Loretta Weinberg of Teaneck, introduced it.
 The defeat in New Jersey, which has widely been viewed as one of the nation's most socially tolerant states, was a significant setback for advocates of gay marriage. Last month, a similar measure was defeated in New York's Legislature, and in November voters in Maine repealed a gay-marriage law in a referendum. 
 But leaders of Lambda Legal Defense Fund, which has helped coordinate gay rights causes in New Jersey and elsewhere, said they said they were confident that the court would prove more receptive than the Legislature.
 ''We are upset, we are disappointed, but we aren't done fighting,'' said Leslie Gabel-Brett, Lambda's director of education and public affairs.
 Opponents of gay marriage said that they, too, were prepared for a legal fight. Jon Tomicki, a leader of the New Jersey Coalition to Preserve and Protect Marriage, said that legislators had already complied with the court order by enacting civil unions, and urged lawmakers to let the public cast its verdict on gay marriage in a referendum.
 ''In 30 other states, voters have gotten the chance to decide,'' Mr. Tomicki said. ''There's no reason why New Jerseyans shouldn't have the same right.'' In nearly every instance in which gay marriage has been put up for a referendum, it has been defeated.
 But supporters of gay marriage view their cause as a matter of civil rights which should be settled by the courts and Legislature, and point out that in 1915, New Jersey voters in a referendum rejected giving women the right to vote. Five years later, the 19th Amendment granted women voting rights.
 Although it was not a major issue in the governor's race, the effort to win legislative approval of same-sex marriage is widely viewed as a casualty of Mr. Corzine's defeat in November. Some Democrats who had been receptive to the issue, and took financial and organizational support from gay activists, grew squeamish.
 Senator Stephen M. Sweeney, who is scheduled to become Senate president this month, said he thought voters would look unkindly on the Legislature if it pushed for a social issue at a time of economic suffering. Senator Sweeney did not cast a vote on the measure on Thursday. In all, five senators did not vote and one was too ill to attend.
 Senator Gerald Cardinale, a Republican from Cresskill, said during the debate on the Senate floor on Thursday that the results of the governor's race were a clear indication that voters opposed gay marriage. Senator Cardinale said that although the civil unions statute was flawed, the state would be doing ''violence'' to the institution of marriage by changing its current definition as a union between one man and one woman.
 ''There are many who believe that this bill will change our entire culture,'' he said, shortly before casting his ''no'' vote.
 But Senate President Richard J. Codey, a Democrat from Essex, said that the furor surrounding gay marriage was based on the same type of unfounded fear of the unknown that was used to justify discrimination against women and racial minorities.
 ''One day people will look back and say, 'What were they thinking?' '' Senator Codey said, and, '' 'What were they so afraid of?' ''
 After the vote, hundreds of supporters of the bill gathered in front of the State House to exchange tearful hugs and plot the next move in their effort. Among them was Christi Sturmont, who said she and her partner were dejected, but not despondent. 
 ''We were holding out hope that we'd be able to get married and have full citizenship,'' she said. ''But now we'll have to settle for second-class citizenship. For now. We're not done fighting.''

CORRECTION-DATE: January 12, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about the New Jersey Senate's defeat of a bill that would have allowed same-sex marriages misstated, in some editions, the length of time between 1915, the year that New Jersey voters rejected a referendum that would have allowed women the right to vote, and the year that the 19th Amendment was ratified, granting women the vote nationwide. The amendment was ratified five years later, in 1920, not three years later.

HEADLINE: As the Senate Turns

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Ira Shapiro tells an important story and tells it well in ''The Year the Senate Fell'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 7). The 1980 Senate election was truly a hinge of history both ideologically and institutionally. Since then the Senate has operated well below its historic responsibilities and expectations. 
 Mr. Shapiro might have added that this election signaled the end of the New Deal era, whose demise had begun with Vietnam. Unfortunately, the Democratic Party failed to employ the information revolution and trade expansion as instruments to expand the economic pie and provide resources for our agenda of social justice.
 Gary Hart Kittredge, Colo., Jan. 7, 2010
 The writer was a Democratic senator from Colorado from 1975 to 1987.

HEADLINE: Hospital Cuts Dialysis Care For the Poor In Miami

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
To chip away at an overwhelming budget deficit, Miami's public hospital system stopped paying for kidney dialysis for the indigent this week, officials said, leaving some patients to rely on emergency rooms for their life-sustaining treatments.
 A total of 175 patients were affected by the decision by Jackson Health System, which runs South Florida's largest charity hospital, Jackson Memorial, and a number of smaller hospitals and clinics. 
 The situation at Jackson is similar to that at Atlanta's public hospital, Grady Memorial, which closed its outpatient dialysis clinic in early October to curb costs. 
 At Jackson, officials said patients could come to the emergency room for treatment, and eight have this week. ''That's the best we can do right now,'' said Dr. Eneida O. Roldan, Jackson's chief executive.
 Federal law requires that emergency rooms treat patients in serious medical jeopardy, regardless of their ability to pay. For patients with end-stage kidney disease, going without dialysis can prove fatal in as little as two weeks.
 To be treated in an emergency room, however, dialysis patients often must show up in severe distress. In an interview, Dr. Roldan said patients could be treated in Jackson's emergency room as often as three times a week, the national standard for continuing dialysis. 
 Dialysis provided through an emergency room admission is considerably more expensive than routine treatment at a clinic. But while Jackson was not reimbursed for treating uninsured patients at private clinics, it can receive emergency Medicaid payments for dialysis provided through emergency rooms. 
 The hospital's decision thus shifts the financial burden from Miami-Dade County taxpayers, who support Jackson's charity care through various levies, to the state and federal governments, which finance the Medicaid program.
 Dr. Roldan said the hospital hoped that South Florida hospitals and dialysis providers would form a consortium to pay for the care of uninsured renal patients.
 At Grady in Atlanta, most of the patients were illegal immigrants who were not eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. The hospital helped about 10 immigrants relocate to their home countries and paid for dialysis there for a transitional three-month period.
 About 50 patients have remained in Atlanta because Grady offered to pay for their dialysis at commercial clinics until Jan. 3. This week, the hospital extended that deadline by a month.
 Industry officials said they did not know of other hospitals that had ended dialysis services.
 Unlike Grady, Jackson did not operate its own dialysis unit but rather paid private clinics to provide the service to indigent patients. The treatments run about $50,000 a year. 
 The hospital was losing more than $4 million a year on dialysis, contributing to a deficit approaching $200 million this fiscal year. Over the last year, the economy has generated a nearly 50 percent increase in uncompensated care, and the hospital is also closing two community clinics this week.
 All but 41 of Jackson's 175 patients continue to be treated -- at least for the short term -- at the commercial clinics, hospital officials said.
 Jackson discovered that some dialysis patients were eligible for government insurance. Others will be treated for a few more months because of contractual obligations.
 Some clinics accepted small numbers of uninsurable patients as charity cases. One patient wed her boyfriend of two years to qualify for his health insurance, a clinic social worker said.
 For the patients, including a dozen illegal immigrants, it is a time of worry. ''My hair has been falling out,'' said one of them, Josefina Tello, 37, from Mexico. ''From everything I'm seeing, the only choice is the emergency room.''

HEADLINE: Top Shooter From Downtown Plays in Upper Manhattan

BYLINE: By BRIAN HEYMAN

 BODY:
There was a garbage can playing the part of a defender along the right part of the 3-point stripe. Noruwa Agho crouched over, the basketball in his hands. He made a quick dart to his left and released a rainbow from beyond the arc that swished through the net.
 This snapshot of Agho working on his game came Monday night inside Columbia's Levien Gymnasium. This was more than a half-hour after the Lions defeated American, 56-51. This was after he had poured 33 minutes of sweat into the victory and 21 points through the net. Agho nailed all three of his 3-point attempts. 
 The top 3-point percentage shooter in Division I, for those with at least 2.5 made per game, plays for Columbia, and that is Agho, a 6-foot-3 sophomore shooting guard. There is a reason for his fabulous 59 percent accuracy, for 36 of his 61 3-point attempts to have hit the target in the Lions' 6-7 start.
 ''He has the best work ethic of any kid I've been around,'' Columbia Coach Joe Jones said. ''He just lives in the gym.''
 The Agho name may not sound that familiar yet, but the secret is starting to get out. He is attracting more attention from opponents. Agho is averaging 51.9 percent over all from the field and a team-high 17.9 points, with seven games of at least 20 points. He ranks third among Ivy League scorers after averaging 9.1 last season. ''He's made big strides,'' American Coach Jeff Jones said. ''You look at the percentage, and this far into the season, he's a legitimate big-time shooter.''
 Agho, who is also first on the team in steals, dented Syracuse's vaunted zone for 4 3-pointers and 22 points before about 20,000 fans at the Carrier Dome during a loss Nov. 27. It is that nation-leading 3-point touch for the nation's leading team in 3-point percentage that separates him now.
 ''It's very ironic because I never really considered myself a shooter,'' Agho said. ''But I worked really hard at it the past spring and summer. I think our offense is little bit more geared toward 3-point shooting. I've just been putting in the effort and trying to concentrate each game and take every shot seriously.''
 Issa Mase, his sophomore teammate, best friend and workout partner, sees that focus all the time.
 ''He's his own biggest critic,'' Mase said. ''Sometimes he gets so down on himself. He has to be perfect.''
 His father, Dr. Peter Agho, calls him ''driven.'' Noruwa played soccer and baseball early on in a childhood spent mostly in Rockland County, N.Y. He was 9, maybe 10, when he told his father about a new game plan.
 ''He said he wants to go to the N.B.A.,'' his father said. ''I said, well, we'll see.''
 He began playing basketball day and night. The court was often the driveway at his New City house, where a basket stood.
 ''It bugged my mom because me and my friends used to stay out there till after dark because we had a little light on the side of the house,'' Agho said. ''I had a couple of guys at home who I was really close to, and they loved basketball as much as me. We got to play a lot. It made it enjoyable. I think that's why I work so hard today because I don't really see it as a job.''
 Even though he became a McDonald's all-American nominee at St. Joseph Regional High School in Montvale, N.J., he was playing as a 6-3 forward and felt unhappy with his Division I choices as a senior.
 That is why he attended the Peddie School in Hightstown, N.J. First, he gained more notice playing Amateur Athletic Union basketball that summer. One of Jones's assistants at the time, Jim Engles, tried to land him. But Agho decided he was going to play at Yale for Coach James Jones, Joe's brother. Then Engles showed Agho around Columbia. He fell in love with the place, the staff, the sense of community and the city location.
 So Joe Jones edged his brother in the recruiting game.
 ''We lucked out,'' he said.
 While the N.B.A. is still Agho's dream, he is keeping his options open. He has an interest in stocks and economics, psychology and medicine as the son of a doctor and a nurse.
 ''I don't really know what the plan is for me,'' Agho said. ''I have tons of goals. At the end of each day, I really think I want to be as good as I can be because life is definitely more than a game. If I can provide good to the world through basketball or any other job, I'd love to do that.''

HEADLINE: When Museums Sell Art to Raise Cash

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Art of the Deal,'' by Judith H. Dobrzynski (Op-Ed, Jan. 2):
 All who care about our art museums should be grateful to Ms. Dobrzynski for raising an issue about which few choose to speak. But I disagree with her conclusion -- that selling works of art to deal with a museum's financial crisis is justified -- for two reasons. First, it would not work, and second, it would probably have unintended consequences. 
 To raise substantial amounts of income, you must sell good, and thereby potentially important, works of art. The smaller the amount raised by sales of works of art, the more this solution becomes stopgap. If a long-term solution is to be achieved, not only must substantial amounts be raised, but also the money must be put into an endowment with an annual spendable rate that preserves the principal. 
 The unintended consequences could well include a change in the board's perception of its fiduciary responsibility to one more focused on asset management than philanthropy. Human nature has shown us that if there is an accepted alternative to giving one's own money, many, if not all, will seize it. And potential and past donors of works of art will be uncertain as to the future use of their gifts. 
 The decisions that would need to be made by the ''impartial arbitrator'' suggested by Ms. Dobrzynski -- What art is too important to sell? Have all the possible reductions in operating costs been achieved? Has the board contributed to the maximum of its capacity? -- are too central to the integrity of a museum to be given to others, even if that were to provide temporary political and ethical cover.
 James N. Wood Los Angeles, Jan. 4, 2010
 The writer is president and chief executive of the J. Paul Getty Trust, which operates the J. Paul Getty Museum.
 To the Editor:
 The argument that museums should come before an arbitrator or regulatory agency to seek permission to deaccession objects from their collections fails to recognize the realities of deaccessioning today. 
 While it is true that the economic downturn has caused more museums to capitalize their collections and to consider the unethical action of deaccessioning to finance general operating costs, in most cases deaccession through sale, transfer and exchange is a routine part of responsible and sustainable collections management, especially in the absence of adequate public funding to maintain museums' ever-growing inventory of objects.
 An appropriate response is to educate museum trustees that collections are not just another asset but central to an institution's identity, to draft sound acquisition policies shaped by a museum's mission and to make the deaccession process transparent to the communities they serve.
 If museum directors routinely made public their deaccession activity, as the Indianapolis Museum of Art does on its Web site, then we could move beyond the polarizing nature of deaccession discussions.
 Janet Marstine South Orange, N.J., Jan. 3, 2010
 The writer is an assistant professor and director of the Institute of Museum Ethics at Seton Hall University.
 To the Editor:
 It's unreasonably paternalistic to subject institutions to some supposedly objective case-by-case system, like the one proposed by Judith H. Dobrzynski, for the purpose of determining how an institution like an art museum should be permitted to use its assets. 
 Here's a simpler, sounder system to guide deaccession: The bought can be sold. 
 This system reserves the sanctity of donor intent, as well as that of artwork acquired under special circumstances. And it ignores the largely unjustified slippery-slope paranoia that if allowed to sell one piece of artwork in a time of need, then institutions would more easily part with others in the future.
 If the struggling institution purchased a piece of artwork free of restrictions preventing resale, then that institution should be permitted to sell it at will. Extraordinary times need not call for extraordinary measures -- just reasonable ones.
 Hillel Buechler Dix Hills, N.Y., Jan. 2, 2010
 The writer is a student at Brandeis University, which has been considering a plan to close its art museum and sell the works to raise money. 
 To the Editor:
 Typically when museums run into the kinds of financial difficulties that prompt thoughts of selling off parts of their ''permanent'' collections, those difficulties arose from years of fiscal mismanagement by the very same directors and trustees now looking for quick monetary fixes. 
 This is why museum professionals argue that when museums sell holdings, the income should be reserved for future acquisitions rather than smoothing over bad fiscal decisions. Doing otherwise only removes the museum world's equivalent of moral hazard.
 All too often a root cause of a museum's financial crisis is a building expansion compelled by the growth of its collection. A more effective, long-term solution to the perennial problem of museums spending beyond their means is to rework the professional practices regarding acquisitions.
 When a trustee or someone else donates a work to a museum, the conditions of the gift should include a cash payment to the museum's operating endowment equal to a set percentage of the tax-deductible value of the work. Similarly, when a museum uses money from an acquisition fund to purchase a work, a set percentage of the price should be paid into the operating endowment.
 To allow museum directors and trustees to keep growing their institutions' collections without taking responsibility for the long-term costs of accommodating and caring for them is irresponsible. To permit them to start selling off collections, no matter how carefully the sales are vetted, will only perpetuate a problem that prompted the sales in the first place.
 Jeffrey Abt Huntington Woods, Mich., Jan. 2, 2010
 The writer is an associate professor of art at Wayne State University and the author of ''A Museum on the Verge: A Socioeconomic History of the Detroit Institute of Arts, 1882-2000.''

HEADLINE: A Campaign Linking Clean Clothes With Stylish Living

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
PROCTER & GAMBLE is taking a nontraditional tack to help Tide, the best-selling detergent in America, fend off challenges from lower-priced rivals as strapped consumers continue to ponder practically every purchase.
 An image campaign for Tide, now under way, eschews the brand's long-time pitches celebrating its ability to get clothes clean. The most recent such ads, which began appearing in 2007, carried the theme ''Tide knows fabrics best.''
 In the new campaign, clean clothes are presented as a means to an end -- expressing personal style -- rather than the end itself. That is a far cry from vintage campaigns for Tide with slogans like ''Dirt can't hide from intensified Tide,'' ''If it's got to be clean, it's got to be Tide'' and ''Tide's in, dirt's out.'' 
 By comparison, the theme of the new campaign is ''Style is an option. Clean is not.'' The focus is on how Tide enables its loyal users to dress for success, to impress or just for fun.
 For instance, one ad shows a woman accessorizing a T-shirt in a dozen ways, from casual to chic. The headline declares: ''100 ways to wear a T-shirt. 1 detergent to help keep it white.''
 Another ad, depicting a well-dressed young woman, carries this encouraging headline: ''You make it work. We'll keep it clean.''
 In a third ad, a girl wears a top decorated with hearts, a skirt festooned with polka dots and striped socks. ''Mismatched? Maybe,'' the headline says. ''Stained? Nope.''
 In short, the ads suggest that at a time when buying new clothing is almost as out of style as a leisure suit, a detergent that cares for the clothing already in closets and dressers may be worth the extra cost.
 Since the economy soured, Tide has maintained its lead as the country's most popular liquid and powder detergent, with a market share exceeding 40 percent. But less expensive brands -- among them All, Arm & Hammer and Purex -- have been making inroads.
 Procter is worried enough to have started running ads for Tide asserting that it is a better value than other detergents because, the ads say, Tide contains ''more cleaning ingredients'' and ''less water.''
 And Procter is testing, in three Southern states, a version of Tide called Tide Basic, that costs about 20 percent less than the mainstay versions. The new campaign is meant to stimulate demand for full-priced Tide rather than the budget variety.
 ''These are tough times,'' said Suzanne Watson, North American Tide associate marketing director at Procter in Cincinnati. ''Making your current clothes look newer longer, cleaner longer, fresher longer, is important.''
 The goal is ''having a sense of pride and dignity when you walk out the door that what you wear is clean,'' Ms. Watson said, so the campaign seeks to persuade consumers they ''don't have to go out and buy a new white T-shirt when there's one detergent that's going to keep it really clean day after day.''
 At Procter, Ms. Watson acknowledged, ''we here analyze, and overanalyze, the importance of whiteness, brightness, stain removal'' when it comes to consumers choosing among detergents, but they ''don't think about it in those terms.''
 So ''rather than saying, 'This is dirty; now it's clean,' '' Ms. Watson said, the new campaign ''is expressing it in a different way: 'You rock what you love to wear. We'll be behind the scenes keeping it clean.' ''
 Eight agencies are working on the campaign, among them Saatchi & Saatchi in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe, for the advertising.
 Research among consumers to determine the direction of the campaign was initiated ''at the beginning of when the economy started going bad,'' said Wanda Pogue, senior vice president and global planning director at Saatchi & Saatchi, and those interviewed spoke of how they had ''stopped eating out and buying new clothes.'' 
 From that came a decision to center the ads on ''maintaining your clothes and keeping them at their best despite your wearing them time and time again,'' Ms. Pogue said, which could contribute to ''having your family not feel the impact of the downturn.''
 Andrea Diquez, senior vice president and global director at Saatchi & Saatchi, said: ''In the past, we've been about superior cleaning. Now, it's about how to make that relevant. It's not 'I take out the stain.' Why does that matter? Because at the end of the day, it affects how you look.'' 
 Elements of the campaign extend well beyond traditional media like television and print ads, reflecting Procter's increasing comfort with the new media. There will be clips on YouTube, material on Facebook, signs known as wildpostings in urban locations, events held at style centers like South Beach and content on the tide.com Web site.
 Procter spent $90.2 million to advertise Tide detergent in major media during the first nine months of 2009, according to data from the TNS Media Intelligence division of WPP, almost as much as the $90.3 million spent during all of 2008. By comparison, spending for the first nine months of 2008 totaled $51.5 million, TNS reported.
 The other agencies on the campaign are the Burrell Communications Group, for ads aimed at black consumers; Conill Advertising, part of Publicis, for ads aimed at Hispanics; DeVries Public Relations; Digitas, also part of Publicis, for digital ads; the Integer Group, a unit of the Omnicom Group, for ads in stores; Landor Associates, part of WPP, for design, including a jazzed-up version of the venerable Tide bull's-eye logo; and SMG United, part of the Starcom MediaVest Group unit of Publicis, for media.

HEADLINE: Shares End Mostly Higher, Helped by Stronger Retail Data

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Wall Street traders set aside worries about looming interest rate increases on Thursday and focused on stronger-than-expected holiday sales, helping cement modest gains for stocks.
 Shares tumbled in early trading after China raised a key interest rate, creating concern that other governments might begin to tighten monetary policy and slow down lending.
 Stocks fluctuated for much of the day, but by afternoon, gains in the financial and industrial sectors helped to offset losses in utilities. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 33.18 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 10,606.86. The broader Standard & Poor 500-stock index was up 4.55 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,141.69, while the Nasdaq slipped 1.04 points to 2,300.05. 
 Many investors expect 2010 to be a year of steady growth for equity markets and the broader economy, bolstered by increases in consumer spending. But traders are still hesitant about several sectors, particularly the housing and labor markets, and they are waiting to see how soon governments will raise interest rates to thwart inflation.
 Oil fell from a 15-month high on Thursday after 10 days of gains, slipping 52 cents to $82.66 a barrel, after the Energy Information Administration said crude oil supplies rose last week. Natural gas supplies declined, in line with expectations.
 The dollar strengthened against most world currencies, including the Japanese yen and the Swedish krona. Since March, the dollar has generally weakened as stocks have risen, but that relationship has shown signs of softening in recent weeks. 
 Frank M. Pavilonis, senior markets strategist for Lind-Waldock, attributed the shift to concerns about sovereign debt, especially in places like Greece and Poland. ''That's a big, horrible situation right there, and it's making the United States look attractive by comparison,'' Mr. Pavilonis said.
 Equity investors were encouraged by news that retailers reported modest gains during the 2009 holiday season. Sales increased 2.9 percent in December compared with the previous year, which was one of the worst in decades.
 In Asia, shares fell after China's central bank raised a key interest rate slightly for the first time in nearly five months. The move was seen as a harbinger of tighter monetary policy as governments seek to stave off inflation.
 Policy makers must balance low interest rates, meant to spur lending, against the fear of rising prices, which could hurt spending by businesses and consumers.
 ''We're not seeing a market that's absolutely falling to pieces,'' said Marc Harris, co-head of global research for RBC Capital Markets. ''We've been living in a bit of a magical thinking world where money is free and seemingly available everywhere, but now we're seeing that free money and excessive stimulus is not going to be the environment we live in forever.''
 In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng fell 0.7 percent, while in Japan, the Nikkei index fell 0.5 percent. European markets were mixed, with the FTSE in Britain down 0.1 percent, the DAX in Germany falling 0.3 percent, and the CAC 40 in France rising 0.2 percent.
 In the bond market, the Treasury's 10-year note was unchanged at 96 11/32. The yield was also unchanged from Wednesday, remaining at 3.82 percent.
 In the United States, stocks were helped by several analyst upgrades. J.P. Morgan said General Electric was among its top choices for electrical stocks, helping send shares of the company up 5 percent. An encouraging outlook from Credit Suisse helped drive shares of Bank of America up 3 percent. 
 The government reported Thursday that weekly unemployment claims rose to 434,000 -- a small increase of 1,000 over the previous week, beating expectations. Total unemployment claims remained at record levels, reaching 10.4 million this month. 
 Even as the pace of layoffs slows, economists fear that high levels of unemployment could hurt the recovery as consumers cut back on spending. 
 On Friday, when the government releases its monthly employment report for December, economists expect the jobless rate to remain at 10 percent, according to a survey by Bloomberg News. Before last fall, the United States had not had double-digit employment since 1982.
 At the same time, some economists predicted that the report would show an actual increase in jobs in December, which would be the first month of net gains since the recession began in late 2007.

HEADLINE: Partners Near Default On Stuyvesant Town

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The owners of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, the sprawling sister complexes overlooking the East River in Manhattan, will miss a $16 million loan payment on Friday, which would put them in technical default on their mortgages, and the 20,000 residents in limbo.
 The $5.4 billion purchase of the complexes' 110 buildings and 11,227 apartments by Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock Realty in 2006 made headlines. But the denouement at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper has cast a pall over what had been a comfortable harbor for the city's middle class since the complexes opened in the late 1940s. 
 ''It worries me,'' said Anne Granberry, a nurse who moved into Stuyvesant Town in June. ''They haven't told us anything.''
 Tishman Speyer declined to comment, although executives who had been briefed on the matter said the partners could not pay the entire amount due.
 City Councilman Daniel R. Garodnick, who lives in Peter Cooper Village, said Tishman Speyer notified him on Thursday afternoon that it would not make its mortgage payment on Friday.
 Tishman Speyer and its partner have been negotiating since November to restructure $3 billion worth of debt and to hold on to the properties, which cover 80 acres east of First Avenue, from 14th Street to 23rd Street. But their reserves, once stuffed with $890 million for capital improvements, interest payments and renovations, are now virtually depleted.
 Banking and real estate executives say that untangling the financial structure and either foreclosing or devising a new deal will take months. Aside from the $3 billion in mortgages, there is another $1.4 billion in secondary, or mezzanine, loans and almost $1 billion in equity invested by the partners, a Florida pension fund, the Church of England and others.
 Also in the mix are the government-controlled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which together hold a bond that is secured by as much as $2 billion of debt on the property. Those two companies will get paid first with whatever revenue comes from the property, but they are not involved in the negotiations.
 The latest appraisal puts the value of the complexes at only $1.9 billion, about 65 percent less than the purchase price. So the investors and the debt holders for the mezzanine loans are likely to be left with nothing. The mortgage lenders must apportion the losses and decide whether to sell the properties, or to restructure the loans in the hope that Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper will be worth more at some point.
 The tenants wonder what will happen next.
 ''For so many years, this was the epitome of stability for middle-class New Yorkers,'' said Mr. Garodnick, who has lived there for much of his life. ''Now there are endless questions about its future.''
 Metropolitan Life built the complexes for World War II veterans in the 1940s, when the city was in desperate need of new housing. It received tax breaks and other incentives in return for maintaining low rents. The buildings became home for generations of workers searching for an affordable spot in Manhattan.
 But with the real estate market soaring in 2005, MetLife decided to sell. Tishman Speyer and BlackRock won an auction the following year. 
 The rents collected did not cover the mortgage payments, but like other investors and developers at the time, the partners had a plan to increase net income by steadily renovating and deregulating vacant apartments while raising rents substantially.
 For tenant advocates and urban planners, the sale underscored the loss of affordable housing in the city and the highly speculative financial structures that, they warned, would only end in disaster.
 ''People used to move in and settle down here,'' said Soni Fink, a tenant since 1961. But, she said, the turnover increased as the new owners began moving single executives and New York University students into expensive apartments. ''Now there are moving vans in the circle all the time. You hardly ever saw moving vans in here unless someone died.'' 
 Ultimately, Tishman Speyer, like many similar buyers, was unable to convert rent-regulated apartments to market-rate rents as quickly as it had anticipated. Rents fell as the recession deepened, and then last fall the state's highest court ruled that the owners had improperly deregulated and raised rents on about 4,400 of the apartments while getting special tax breaks from the city.
 The 15-story red-brick buildings are in good shape, tenants say, but they noted that the maintenance and security staffs had been cut. And the owners may owe $200 million in rent overcharges to thousands of tenants as a result of the court ruling.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 12, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article in some editions on Friday about an expected mortgage default by the owners of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, sister apartment complexes in Manhattan, misspelled, in some copies, the given name of a longtime tenant at Peter Cooper who said apartment turnover had increased under the current landlords. She is Soni Fink, not Sonni.

Sensible Rules
 To Regulate Risk 
 Sheila C. Bair looks to be leading the regulatory race to the top. The agency she oversees, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, recently unveiled a handful of clever ideas to contain risky bank behavior and protect the nation's deposit insurance fund. Rival watchdogs fighting for turf will find it difficult to ignore the F.D.I.C.'s latest tactics.
 Generating the most buzz is a sensible plan to tie the amount that banks pay for deposit insurance to the risk in their compensation plans. Banks with plans that favor short-term gains would pay more than those that, for example, include multiyear clawbacks on bonuses. The agency will vote on the plan next week. 
 Of course, this comes as the Federal Reserve is also putting in place its own proposal to include executive pay in its overall assessment of bank stability. It's not clear which agency will be more stringent. But a little competition between the two wouldn't be the worst outcome after years in which banking regulators rivaled each other in their laxity. 
 Linking pay to insurance premiums follows a handful of other changes the F.D.I.C. is making. It recently revised the formula it uses to assess how much interest undercapitalized banks can pay to attract deposits. The net effect of the changes will be to reduce the rates banks can pay by an average of 12 basis points, the analytics firm Market Rates Insight estimates. 
 That is a clever way to limit moral hazard. Failing banks, more concerned with survival than profitability, often make last-ditch attempts to attract new deposits by offering ultrahigh rates on savings products wrapped by the F.D.I.C.'s insurance.
 Similarly, the F.D.I.C. is pushing for a form of insurance from the buyers of failed bank assets. To mitigate some losses the fund incurs on assets in receivership, the F.D.I.C. is pushing for the buyers of the assets to make payments linked to the increase in their share prices after the announcement of a deal.
 In isolation these may look to be incremental, if sensible, changes to the way the F.D.I.C. does business. But in the context of a regulatory turf battle over power and resources in Washington, it's an encouraging sign indeed. 
 Cuddling With Bears 
 The bulls and bears on the price of oil have both had their triumphs in recent history. The price of crude rose to $145.29 a barrel in July 2008 only to plummet to $33 a barrel a few months later. It swung past $82 a barrel this week because of a cold snap, and is up 18 percent since mid-December. But barring heightened tension in the Middle East, oil looks likely to slide in the short term.
 Demand remains relatively subdued, in spite of the huge stimulus applied to the global economy. This is especially true in developed countries that are part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and in the United States, the largest consumer of energy. American crude oil inventories actually rose by 1.3 million barrels last week when temperatures plummeted, according to the latest figures by the Energy Department. Elsewhere in the O.E.C.D., oil inventories have fallen slightly, according to the International Energy Agency, to nearly 60 days of demand.
 Other factors could weigh on the price in the immediate future, too. A combination of easy money from the world's central banks and the weak dollar has made investing in commodities relatively attractive. But the central bankers' generosity could soon come to an end if inflation moves from a theoretical threat to a reality.
 Oil bulls argue that global economic growth, in particular in China and other emerging markets, will be strong enough to sustain further gains. But the recovery remains too uncertain to call. China has just increased interest rates on its three-month bills in an effort to slow bank lending, a move that could lead to a damping of demand. That alone shaved a few cents off the oil price Thursday.
 The bulls may eventually have their day. Production is falling in non-OPEC countries, even factoring in some megafields coming on stream in Russia and elsewhere. But it will not be until mid-2011 that global demand will outpace supply, according to Goldman Sachs, which predicts an average oil price of $110 for that year. It may make sense to snuggle up with the oil bears -- at least for the rest of the winter.ROLFE WINKLER and FIONA MAHARG BRAVO

HEADLINE: In Massachusetts, Surprise Anxiety for Favored Democrats

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
Martha M. Coakley, the Democrat running for Senator Edward M. Kennedy's seat in Massachusetts, had seemed so certain of winning the special election on Jan. 19 that she barely campaigned last month.
 But the dynamic has changed in recent days. The news that two senior Democratic senators will retire this year in the face of bleak re-election prospects has created anxiety and, even in this bluest of states, a sense that the balance of power has shifted dramatically from just a year ago.
 With the holidays over and public attention refocused on the race, Ms. Coakley's insistence on debating her Republican opponent, Scott P. Brown, only with a third-party candidate present has drawn mounting criticism. 
 And a new poll that showed a competitive race between Ms. Coakley and Mr. Brown has generated buzz on conservative blogs and energized the Brown campaign -- though many news organizations dispute its methodology. 
 In a sudden flurry of activity, the Coakley campaign released its first television advertisement on Thursday and accepted the endorsement of Mr. Kennedy's widow, Victoria Reggie Kennedy, at a splashy event outside Boston. 
 A Brown win remains improbable, given that Democrats outnumber Republicans by 3 to 1 in the state and that Ms. Coakley, the state's attorney general, has far more name recognition, money and organizational support. 
 But a tighter-than-expected margin in the closely watched race would still prompt soul-searching among Democrats nationally, since the outcome will be the first real barometer of whether problems facing the party will play out in tangible ways at the polls later this year. 
 ''If I had to bet a week's salary,'' said Dennis Hale, a political science professor at Boston College, ''I'd still bet it on Coakley. But this is going to be like in the military, where the bullet misses you but it still scares you to death.''
 While Ms. Coakley kept a low profile over the holidays, Mr. Brown hammered her as soft on terrorists and as a ''crusader'' for abortion rights. He has played up his military credentials -- he serves in the Army National Guard -- and his opposition to the health care overhaul headed for a final vote in Congress. That, too, has unnerved Democrats, who cannot afford to lose a single vote on the embattled legislation. 
 Republicans are hoping that diminished support for President Obama and his party among independents could give Mr. Brown a shot at winning. About half of the state's voters are not affiliated with a party.
 ''Scott's done a great job of tapping into the economy as an issue and the fact that people aren't happy with what's going on in Washington,'' said Charles Manning, a Republican strategist here. ''When you couple that with the coronation campaign that Martha's been trying to run, it's really made a difference.''
 Democrats dismiss such statements as wishful thinking whipped up by conservative commentators outside Massachusetts. Still, Mary Anne Marsh, a Democratic strategist, said Ms. Coakley erred in not campaigning more aggressively last month.
 ''By taking a low-profile approach, she invited more of a race than she would have had otherwise,'' Ms. Marsh said. ''Sometimes I wanted to say, 'My God, woman, take it up a notch.' ''
 Massachusetts voters have not sent a Republican to the Senate in 37 years, though they have elected three Republican governors since 1990. Polls suggest that Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, will face a tough re-election battle this year despite his landslide victory in 2006.
 The poll that suggested Ms. Coakley's lead was narrowing, which was conducted by Rasmussen Reports and does not meet the polling standards of The New York Times because it relied on automated telephone calls, suggested Mr. Brown had strikingly strong support among independent voters. But most of them are unlikely to come out for a special election at an odd time of year, Ms. Marsh said. 
 ''The only people who come out in an election like this,'' Ms. Marsh said, ''are the diehards.''
 Ms. Coakley won the Democratic primary election on Dec. 8 with 47 percent of the vote, compared with 28 percent for her closest opponent. Mr. Brown won 89 percent of the vote in the Republican primary. Election officials said turnout was among the lowest for a contested primary in the state's history. 
 After receiving Mrs. Kennedy's endorsement on Thursday at a center for the elderly in Medford, Ms. Coakley said she had been busy preparing for debates and ramping up a get-out-the-vote effort, among other things.
 ''A campaign is composed of many parts,'' she told reporters. ''I think Jan. 19 will show the results of how busy we've been.''

HEADLINE: Seeking Grants, Paterson Urges Education Changes

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
Gov. David A. Paterson on Thursday proposed a host of changes in state education law, including eliminating the cap on the number of charter schools, which he said would make the state more likely to receive $700 million in federal grant money. 
 The governor's bill would also repeal a 2008 law that banned the use of standardized test scores in tenure decisions, as well as give the state the ability to pay for charter school construction and allow the state to take over low-performing schools. 
 The Obama administration has offered a total of $4 billion in so-called Race to the Top grants to states that show the most progress in education reform. Aides to the governor said that he had spoken with Education Secretary Arne Duncan in recent weeks and was convinced that the changes he proposed on Thursday were necessary to qualify for a slice of the fund. New York is estimated to be eligible for up to $700 million.
 The current law caps charter schools, which are privately run but publicly funded, at 200, and officials expect to reach the cap in a matter of months. The law also limits the use of state money for charter school construction, forcing the schools to raise millions on their own.
 The State Legislature has just days to pass the bill -- the application for the first round of federal grants is due on Jan. 19, and the governor has said that the law would have to be passed five days earlier in order to be signed into law. 
 ''Our children, our schools and the economy of the State of New York cannot afford to wait for the Legislature to implement these changes,'' Mr. Paterson said in a statement. ''The money received will benefit all of our children, not just those who attend charter schools.''
 Many of the proposals are similar to those championed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and are seen as anathema by teachers' unions. Most charter school teachers are not union members, and in New York City, where most charters are located, their growth has coincided with a decrease in the number of students attending regular public schools, whose teachers are union members. The unions have also fought the use of test scores in tenure decisions, saying they were an unfair gauge of ability and would turn classrooms into test-preparation mills.
 Michael Mulgrew, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, the city teachers' union, said on Thursday that he would fight any increase in the cap on charter schools without other major changes to the law, including more oversight of school spending and charter school admissions policies. 
 His union has complained that charter schools draw away the most talented students, leaving the neediest ones for traditional public schools.
 Malcolm A. Smith, a Democrat and president of the State Senate, said he would support many of the governor's proposals, but Sheldon Silver, the leader of the Democratic-controlled Assembly, seemed far more tepid about the proposals; a spokeswoman said only that he would review them. 
 ''We all recognize that this in an important issue of resources,'' Mr. Smith said, adding that he was confident that the Senate would vote on legislation within the next week. 
 With the state facing a deep budget gap, money might prove to be a driving force. On Thursday, the city schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein, announced that schools would lose 1 percent of their budget and that the central administrative office would cut 5 percent of its work force. 
 For the past several months, states have scrambled to make changes to their education laws in an effort to make them more likely to receive the money. Several observers have expressed skepticism that New York would be able to act swiftly and forcefully enough to win the competition early this spring. Another round of funding is expected to be distributed later in the year. 
 Joe Williams, the executive director of Democrats for Education Reform, who has been critical of the state, said that it was an ''important sign'' that the governor had begun to make some changes, but added that many of them were what ''we've always considered low-hanging fruit.'' 
 ''I think we're at a time when the State Legislature can't afford the possibility to overlook $700 million,'' Mr. Williams said.

HEADLINE: A Special Visa Program Benefits Abused Illegal Immigrants

BYLINE: By KATHERINE ELLISON

 BODY:
She was 14 when her mother smuggled her into Los Angeles. She met her future husband, a legal resident, two years later.
 He had all the cards, and played them cruelly, as she recalls. He would not let her go to school or work, dragged his feet on supporting her citizenship request, and called her fat and ugly after she became pregnant.
She endured it all -- until she caught him romancing a 13-year-old girl from their church choir. When she complained, he beat her bloody, tried to rape her, and fled, with the girl, to Arizona, she said in an affidavit that is now part of federal immigration records. 
 Today, he is in prison, and she is caring for her children in San Francisco, with a driver's license and a legal job baby-sitting. Her legal status came about through what is known as a U visa -- a humanitarian ''island of niceness,'' as one advocate called it, in a sea of restrictive United States immigration laws. 
 Victims of domestic violence are often deeply reluctant to press charges, fearing retaliation or simply hoping their abusers will change. The risk of deportation only escalates the aversion to go to the police. That is a main reason that Congress passed legislation in 2000, creating the U visa. It allows immigrants who have endured substantial mental or physical abuse and who cooperate with law enforcement officials to work legally and stay in the United States for up to four years while applying for permanent residence.
 After nearly a decade of delays, federal officials began allowing the visas en masse only early last year, after sustained efforts from immigrant rights groups, particularly several based in Oakland and San Francisco. The pace of approvals has since stepped up, as has the controversy, with both defense lawyers and groups opposed to immigration contending that the process invites scams. 
 For millions of immigrants and their supporters, however, the program is truly an island of niceness, as Catherine Ward-Seitz, the regional immigration coordinator for Bay Area Legal Aid in San Francisco, put it. With a soured economy encouraging hostility at worst and apathy at best toward illegal immigrants, the U visas are a bittersweet consolation prize. 
 In a compassionate twist on the idea that felons should be imprisoned, victims who can show that guns (or knives or fists) were used against them can be released from the fear of deportation. 
 While victims of several specified crimes are eligible, at least three-fourths of the applicants for U visas to date, like the Guatemalan baby sitter, who asked that her name not be used for fear of retaliation from her spouse, say they have suffered domestic violence, said Chris Rhatigan, a spokeswoman for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. Immigration lawyers said this was largely because of the prevalence of domestic violence in general.
 Ending impunity in cases of domestic violence makes whole communities safer, proponents say. 
 ''These are disclosure-driven crimes, meaning people have to come forth and report them; there's no gunshot to bring it to our attention,'' said Lt. Kevin Wiley, commander of the Oakland Police Department's special victims unit, which certified 153 U visas last year.
 ''It's all about building trust,'' Lieutenant Wiley said, adding that police certification of the visas was a powerful tool in creating bonds among wary residents who have long been the silent victims of a range of crimes, like the robberies of illegal immigrants known on the streets as ''amigo checkings.'' 
 What is more, Lieutenant Wiley said, the police often discover that domestic violence offenders have multiple victims. 
 Congress approved an annual limit of 10,000 U visas. Yet the regulations that would put the law in force were not made final by the Department of Homeland Security until September 2007.
 A few dozen U visas were approved in 2008. Then the pace increased. In the fiscal year ending last September, immigration officials approved 5,825. Another 2,244 were approved in October and November. More than 10,000 applications are pending.
 Ms. Rhatigan said the long delay resulted mostly from the complexity of the new rules, although some immigration advocates say the change of administrations in Washington played a part. 
 Lawyers defending clients on the other side of the visa petitions worry that the incentives of a U visa are creating new wrongs as well as righting old ones. 
 Marin County's deputy public defender, Tamara Chellam, argued that the U visas might create irresistible incentives for people to invent or exaggerate offenses. A recent client of Ms. Chellam is married to a woman who applied for a U visa while fighting her spouse for custody of their daughter. The woman testified that in early 2008, the defendant followed her to work at 5 a.m. and broke the window of her car. Although there were no other witnesses, the husband was convicted of stalking and assault. Ms. Chellam said she expected him to be deported on his release from prison.
 A decade earlier, the woman had reported that her husband had abused her but subsequently said she wanted to drop charges, Ms. Chellam said. She applied for a U visa in 2007 on the basis of that incident, but court testimony revealed she had worried that it would not suffice because victims are required to cooperate continuously. Ms. Chellam said she suspected that the wife had tailored the 2008 incident to help support her subsequent successful application for a visa.
 ''The U visa offers a wonderful opportunity when used appropriately, but it can be lopsided and misused,'' Ms. Chellam said. ''If a person wants to get rid of a spouse fighting for custody, or a rival gang member, these visas are very convenient, while the people on the other side can lose everything: their children, their jobs, their liberty and their right to stay here.''
 On the other hand, applicants for U visas tend to be unusually sympathetic, helping to explain why the law creating the visa gained nearly unanimous bipartisan support at the end of the Clinton administration. 
 ''Undocumented immigrants are unbelievably vulnerable to abuse, exploitation and victimization because their fear of detection keeps them from reporting that victimization,'' said Susan Bowyer, the managing lawyer for the Oakland office of the International Institute of the Bay Area. ''It's like they're in a never-ending nightmare, where people kick them while they're down because they are down.'' 
 While struggling to break the bureaucratic logjam surrounding U visas, immigration lawyers and other advocates in this region, which is rich in both immigrants and immigrant advocates, formed a coalition. The group met regularly and communicated by frequently by e-mail to encourage one another, trade ideas and pressure immigration officials.
 Keen pressure was brought in March 2007, when the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law in Los Angeles -- joined by three Bay Area advocacy groups -- filed a federal lawsuit in San Francisco against Citizenship and Immigration Services. The Bay Area groups included Ms. Bowyer's team in Oakland, the Asian Pacific Islander Legal Outreach group in San Francisco and Catholic Charities CYO, also based in San Francisco. 
 The Bay Area has since taken a prominent position nationwide in winning approvals for visas, with 16 local advocacy groups gaining 773 visas for their clients -- more than 12 percent of the national total.
 Ms. Bowyer's office alone claimed 148 approvals. She calls herself a ''U-vangelist'' and churns out long e-mail messages and reports late into the night.
 But not everyone applauds her success. 
 ''The U visa goes beyond what's necessary -- or what should be necessary -- to get people's cooperation,'' said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for Immigration Reform. ''Why should we have to provide incentives for people not here legally when we do nothing extra for people who are here legally?'' 
 For the baby sitter from Guatemala, the idea of getting a U visa in return for cooperation played no role in her decision to go to the police. She had done so in 2003, six years before she sought a visa. When she later learned she could apply for the visa, it was more, she suggested, like a gift from a universe that now seemed just a little more kind.
 ''Of course, I would have preferred another way to stay here,'' she said. ''But this was the way it happened, and it was worth it.''

HEADLINE: When Running for Office, Be Careful What You Wish For

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
James Warren is a longtime Chicago journalist and the publisher of The Chicago Reader.

 BODY:
The only thing missing in the most notable television ad in the Illinois governor's race is Englebert Humperdink singing, ''Release Me.''
 His verse, ''Please release me, let me go'' would be vividly apt for Dan Hynes, the mild-mannered Illinois comptroller. Mr. Hynes, the Democratic challenger, issued a broadside at Gov. Patrick J. Quinn that included photos of ominous-looking souls (all Caucasians, in a tidy example of Democratic Party political correctness) let go in an early release program that freed some violent offenders who soon returned to prison after alleged crimes and parole violations.
As Mr. Quinn blames his corrections chief for the program's faults, he reminds us of the steep learning curve for gadflies, political dissidents, freedom fighters and consumer activists who gain power. Early stumbling suggests that Mr. Quinn is more our Jimmy Carter than our Nelson Mandela or Vaclav Havel, even if more honest than most in proposing how to deal with messes left behind by the former Gov. Rod Blagojevich, Mr. Quinn's impeached predecessor. 
 The governor now concedes a ''mistake'' was made with last fall's early release program. This resembles the itsy-bitsy contrition of Jim Ryan, the Republican front-runner, who says he's ''sorry'' for crucial involvement as a prosecutor in the notorious wrongful-death convictions of two men in the 1983 kidnapping, rape and murder of a Naperville girl, Jeanine Nicarico. At least Mr. Quinn's admission wasn't 26 years late.
 Meanwhile, the two Democratic and seven Republican candidates for governor face a short primary, an awful economy, a disastrous state budget, voter disenchantment, a most likely low turnout on a surely cold Feb. 2 and the prospect of life with the House speaker, Michael Madigan, the Little Napoleon who runs Springfield. 
 In theory, the Republicans should be primed for revival. Mr. Madigan and the Democrats have rather bungled things despite controlling all seven constitutional statewide offices, owning big majorities in the Legislature and having their former colleague Barack Obama in the White House.
 Certainly, the Legislature did bid adieu to Mr. Blagojevich and passed campaign finance reform, positive changes in the Freedom of Information Act, procurement overhaul and a much-needed capital program (partly to be financed with dubious video gambling). 
 With the help of federal money, Mr. Quinn protected important state programs from disastrous cuts. And he at least broached the idea of an amalgam of a desperately needed two-tier pension system -- hated by unions and their ally, Mr. Hynes -- frequent furlough days or layoffs for state employees and a need to confront inefficiencies in the expensive Medicaid program.
 But the real problems of the budget remain, and political courage is minimal.
 Initial polls indicate the Republican race is led by the better-known Mr. Ryan, the cancer-surviving former attorney general, who lost to Mr. Blagojevich in 2002 and is again running a low-energy campaign. His primary rivals, taking a curious high road, have not muddied him with ties to Stuart Levine, the convicted swindler and Blagojevich buddy who was a former aggressive Ryan fund-raiser.
 A majority of the Republicans have signed a no-tax pledge. When forced to tell us how we'll deal with the budget catastrophe, they resemble the public policy versions of contortionists at the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus.
 They include Andy McKenna, the state G.O.P. chairman and establishment figure improbably posing as a businessman outsider; State Senator Bill Brady of Bloomington, a hail-fellow-well-met downstater; Adam Andrzejewski, a Hinsdale businessman who better fits the outsider self-description of Mr. McKenna's ads; Dan Proft, a public relations consultant and the beneficiary of huge sums from the ethical swamp of the Cicero government; and Bob Schillerstrom, the DuPage County Board chairman and a partner in an Indianapolis-based clout law firm.
 Mr. Ryan hasn't signed the pledge. Ditto State Senator Kirk Dillard of Hinsdale, who might actually be the best suited for the job and is backed by the former Gov. Jim Edgar, whom he served as an able chief of staff. Trivia buffs should recall, too, his nervy TV ad for Mr. Obama during the Iowa caucuses.
 On the Democratic side, style may reign, with the more affable Mr. Quinn besting the smart but publicly stiff Mr. Hynes. With the Republicans, seven candidates means that a low vote total wins. If Mr. Ryan, Mr. Dillard and Mr. Schillerstrom split the Chicago suburbs, perhaps downstate oomph brings home Mr. Brady in an upset. 
 Meanwhile, we learned this week that Mr. Blagojevich will surface on ''The Celebrity Apprentice,'' competing against B-listers, former sports stars and a lingerie model seeking similar image enhancement.
 They'll run around Manhattan, raising money for charity. It's a lot easier than running around Springfield, dealing with Little Napoleon and confronting a deficit higher than any Trump Tower.

HEADLINE: Stores Post Strong Gains In December

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
In the game of chicken between American retailers and consumers this holiday season, the retailers won.
 For most of November and December, traffic in the nation's stores was light, with many people seemingly holding out for the eye-popping bargains of the year before. But figures released Thursday showed that retailers, by keeping tight control over their inventories, were able to avoid deep discounting. And many consumers finally surrendered, buying what they needed in a last-minute sales surge right before Christmas.
 ''The consumer blinked first,'' said Bill Dreher, a senior research analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities. 
 On Thursday, retailers reported robust December sales gains, suggesting that stores might be in the early stages of a comeback. The industry collectively turned in a 2.9 percent year-over-year sales increase at stores open at least a year, according to Thomson Reuters. Some 75 percent of retailers beat analysts' estimates -- the most companies to do so since March 2007, said Jharonne Martis, director of consumer research for Thomson Reuters. 
 Several retailers -- including Macy's, Nordstrom, Aeropostale, TJX Companies, Ross Stores, American Eagle Outfitters and Limited -- expressed their growing confidence by raising their earnings estimates.
 ''The window shoppers are turning into spenders,'' Mr. Dreher said.
 The Christmas results were the latest sign that the economy, while still a long way from boom times, has turned a corner. On Friday, the government is to release employment figures for December that many economists say they believe will show further progress.
 A truly robust recovery for retailers requires that the nation's unemployment rate begin to fall.
 ''Until the unemployment number heals, we're not going to see consumers come back,'' Ms. Martis said. ''That is the one economic indicator that all consumers understand.''
 The International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group, said that for the crucial holiday shopping season, November and December combined, the industry posted a 1.8 percent sales increase for stores open at least a year, a figure known as same-store sales. That is a marked contrast from the 5.6 percent decline in 2008. By the council's calculations, it is the best seasonal pace since 2006, when sales increased 4.4 percent. 
 ''You're starting to feel stability, and hopefully we'll start to see growth from here,'' said Stephen I. Sadove, chairman and chief executive of Saks, the luxury retailer.
 December's best sellers were electronics, shoes and toys. In fact, Toys ''R'' Us said its same-store sales rose 4.6 percent at United States stores and 1.1 percent at international stores. 
 A cold spell and snowstorms helped drive sales of clothing and gift cards. The weather also prompted more consumers to shop on the Web rather than don their boots. Macy's, for one, said its online sales soared 29.4 percent in December. 
 Analysts were pleased that the results were at the high end of estimates and that retailers managed their inventory well -- ordering far less merchandise but selling it at full or almost full price. 
 Yet the industry's 1.8 percent increase is not an all-clear signal. Retailing professionals are careful to characterize any signs of life as fragile. Consumers are still not spending at the levels they were before the recession. And in December, the stores were measuring their performance against the bleak numbers of 2008. Chains also benefited this winter from an extra selling day before Christmas, as well as pent-up demand from consumers who had been pinching pennies all year. 
 Nonetheless, December was a reversal of the recent gloomy trend, with sales growth the norm across retail chains rather than the exception. 
 Luxury chains, among the stores hit hardest by the downturn in 2008, are seeing especially robust growth. Sales in December were up 9.9 percent at Saks, 7.4 percent at Nordstrom and 4.9 percent in the specialty retail segment of Neiman Marcus, which includes Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman stores. 
 Saks's results were helped by a year-over-year shift in the timing of the chain's designer clearance sale. Nordstrom introduced new lower-priced merchandise, which it sold at full price, a tactic that served the company well.
 ''Is the high-end consumer fully back?'' Ms. Martis said. ''No. They're still being frugal. They're only buying if it's a promotion or a good value.'' 
 It should come as no surprise, then, that discount retailers were among the month's best performers. Same-store sales climbed 9 percent at Costco, 4.8 percent at BJ's Wholesale Club and 1.8 percent at Target. (Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, stopped reporting monthly sales figures last year.) 
 Clothing chains that sell designer names at low prices also continued to shine. TJX Companies, which owns T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores, had a 14 percent same-store sales increase. Ross Stores, a TJX competitor, posted a 12 percent increase. Same-store sales at value-priced retailer Kohl's rose 4.7 percent. 
 Midprice department stores, which have been struggling for a while, posted some of the month's weakest numbers. Sales declined 7 percent at Dillard's, 3.8 percent at J. C. Penney, 2.6 percent at Bon-Ton Stores and 2 percent at Stein Mart. 
 At Macy's, sales ticked up 1 percent. Terry J. Lundgren, the president and chief executive, said in a statement that sales at both Macy's and Bloomingdale's were better than in 2008, and that Bloomingdale's had a particularly good December, with strong sales in gifts and designer brands. 
 Analysts at Thomson Reuters have noted that consumers were still holding fast to their discretionary dollars, and they cited as an example the weak numbers posted by stores that cater to teenagers. That sector fared the worst in December, posting a 2.5 percent same-store sales decline, according to Thomson Reuters.
 Same-store sales fell at Abercrombie & Fitch (down 19 percent), Hot Topic (down 10.9 percent), American Apparel (down 5 percent), Wet Seal (down 4.6 percent) and Limited Brands, which owns chains like Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works (down 2 percent). 
 The declines did not extend across the entire teenage clothing category, though. Sales increased at Aeropostale (up 10 percent), American Eagle Outfitters (up 7 percent), Buckle (up 6.6 percent), Urban Outfitters (up 5 percent), Gap (up 2 percent thanks largely to its value-priced Old Navy division) and Zumiez (up 0.3 percent). Sales at Children's Place increased 4 percent.
 Analysts expect retailers to have healthier profit margins this year. What remains to be seen is whether, against a backdrop of high unemployment and tight credit, consumers will go back into hiding again now that Hanukkah and Christmas are over. 
 With no major holiday to spur shoppers and little inventory in stores, the International Council of Shopping Centers is predicting that in January same-store sales will be at best up 1 percent. 
 Mr. Dreher of Deutsche Bank Securities said caution might prevail in the coming weeks, as credit card statements for the Christmas spending arrived in mailboxes.

HEADLINE: Further Slide Seen in Commercial Real Estate

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
There are 920 football fields of available office space in Manhattan. More than 180 major buildings totaling $12.5 billion in value -- from Columbus Tower at 1775 Broadway to the office tower 400 Madison Avenue -- are in trouble, meaning in many cases they face foreclosure or bankruptcy, or have had problems making mortgage payments. Rents for commercial office space fell faster over the past two years than in any such period in the last half century.
 ''I have been in the business for 12 years. I have never seen it this bad,'' Peter Von Der Ahe, vice president of investments for the brokerage Marcus & Millichap, said of New York City's commercial real estate market. According to more veteran colleagues, he said, things have not been so dire since at least the early 1990s. 
 And that is not the most sobering assessment.
 ''It hasn't hit bottom,'' Mr. Von Der Ahe added.
 He is not alone. More than half a dozen experts on commercial real estate in New York City said that despite some flickering signs of economic recovery here and elsewhere in the country, the universe of big buildings and giant apartment complexes has further to tumble.
 Rents, they say, will go lower. Vacancy rates are likely to rise, too. Owners of troubled properties will face a final day of reckoning and in some cases lose their properties.
 ''We're projecting the biggest value losses in the nation,'' said Aaron Jodka, a senior real estate economist at Property and Portfolio Research, a Boston-based independent real estate research and advisory firm. He predicts that by 2011, the value of New York metropolitan area office buildings will decline by 58 percent from its late 2007 peak. It is already down 40 percent.
 Some experts point to the bright sides of a down market -- for example, the opportunity to snap up some great bargains. They say that investors who already have been shopping in London for skyscraper deals may set their sights on Manhattan later this year to find deals, and that may fuel some growth in overall sales. Some New Yorkers, especially businesses who have found the market too costly, also may find some deals.
 ''A correction might give opportunities,'' said Jonathan Bowles, director of the Center for an Urban Future, an independent research group. ''I think it's healthy for the city's real estate market to have a down cycle.''
 But most members of the real estate industry are lockstep in their pessimism, and the reasons are multiple: Jobs must recover first to fill offices with workers, and job growth in New York City has been all but invisible. Many buildings are also tied up in complex financial arrangements that could take years to unravel.
 Robert Bach, chief economist at the real estate brokerage Grubb & Ellis, compares recovery of the commercial market -- which includes everything from office towers to rental apartment buildings to retail space -- to turning a big ship around.
 Taxes on commercial buildings also make up a sizable share of the revenue base for the city. Residential and commercial development generated $307.7 million in tax revenues, not including property taxes, from 2000 to 2007, according to the Real Estate Board of New York. In fact, the industry had a $12.4 billion effect -- including construction costs like salaries and purchases made by workers -- on the local economy during that period. 
 ''The tax base is enormous,'' said Michael Slattery, the board's senior vice president of research. ''It helps fund many of the basic services that make our city operate.''
 Richard Persichetti, director of New York research for Grubb & Ellis, said that when the economy started to slide, office rents fell faster than in any period recorded in at least 50 years. The city has become stuck with more available office space than any other central business district in the nation except Chicago, Washington and Boston. Mr. Persichetti predicts it will take until 2014 to make a major turnaround.
 ''Rents probably won't start to recover until job growth is created and some of that available space is absorbed,'' he said.
 Some foreign investors may swoop in this year and buy up some of the city's most desirable and stable skyscrapers, said Robert White, president of the research company Real Capital Analytics which tracks the city's troubled properties. Then the city will be left with properties in financial difficulties that are half empty and in less coveted locations. Recovery for those buildings, Mr. White said, ''is going to take a little bit longer. It's not going to be in a rush.''
 No prospective deals on these buildings are apt to be helped by the fact that they are tied up in complicated mortgage structures that grew popular in the boom years. Joseph Harbert, chief operating officer for the New York City region of the commercial brokerage Cushman & Wakefield, says that working out ownership disputes for these buildings will take much longer than in past real estate meltdowns.
 ''In the '90s, when you had the real estate workouts, you had a lot of single-lender properties. There are more parties and interests in every deal,'' said Mr. Harbert.
 Regardless of these complications, Mr. Harbert, who remains generally optimistic that parts of the real estate economy could recover this spring, says that lenders, skyscraper buyers and renters will not feel comfortable moving forward until they really see that jobs are being created.
 ''They're kind of waiting for positive signs in the economy,'' he said. ''When jobs are going to recover, that's the signal of when people are going to lease and buy.''
