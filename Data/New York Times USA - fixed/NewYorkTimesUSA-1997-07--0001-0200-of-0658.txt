HEADLINE: As the Wolf Turns: A Saga of Yellowstone

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

DATELINE: YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo.

 BODY:
EARLY on a crystalline June morning, as sunlight began to brighten the peaks, forests and green meadows of the Northern Rockies, the wolves known as Yellowstone's pack from hell were already at work.
Confidently, almost nonchalantly, five of the six adult members of what is formally called the Druid Peak pack patrolled their territory, sniffing the ground and depositing urine scent marks along an open hillside studded with patches of Douglas fir, spruce and aspen. Only 300 yards from a well-traveled road, a big gray female headed the single file, with the dominant pack member strolling along third in line -- a 122-pound gray wolf, his outstretched, rigid tail advertising his status as alpha male.
He is no ordinary animal. Barrel-chested, powerful and aggressive even for a wolf (one scientist likened him to a linebacker), he ripped the bars out of an aluminum cage in which Federal scientists transported him from Canada last year. "Right away we knew he was different," said Dr. Douglas W. Smith, a wolf biologist for the National Park Service who directs the re-introduction project. 
 Thirty-eight, as this formidable creature is named, is part of what is widely hailed as a spectacularly successful effort to re-establish wolves in Yellowstone National Park. He solidified his reputation soon after arriving here by leading the Druids in a territorial raid on a longer-established wolf family, the Crystal Creek pack. The Druids killed the opposing alpha male and all his young offspring, banished the bleeding adult survivors to another part of the park and took over their den. They sealed the takeover with a group howl. Since then the pack has killed two more adult wolves, earning it nicknames like the Pack from Hell and the Dreadful Druids. "They are a bunch of hoodlums," Dr. Smith said.
But that is only one part of the continuing story of the Yellowstone wolves, a tale of family loyalty, clan warfare and over-all population expansion whose twists and turns will largely determine the future of this most charismatic of all endangered species in America.
In an enterprise that has restored the only missing piece to Yellowstone's renowned array of big mammal species, 41 wolves have been transplanted to the park from western Canada and northern Montana since January 1995, and they and their offspring have produced an estimated 60 to 70 pups. (The exact number will not be known until early winter, when this year's pups are nearly grown and a better count can be made.)
Since the program started, 10 pups and 10 adults have died from various causes.
Here, on an open and easily accessible stage, the day-to-day struggles that determine long-term evolutionary dominance are on unusually clear display. And in this arena it turns out that for all their aggression, the Druids have so far been eclipsed by another group, the Rose Creek pack, and especially by its central figure. She is an aging, long-suffering, charcoal-colored alpha female,called Rosie by some, Mom or Big Mama by others, but simply Nine (the number assigned to her when she was transported from Canada in 1995) by most.
Nine is the undisputed matriarch of Yellowstone wolfdom. With seven adult members, her pack is the largest of nine in and around the park. Only 30 months after the first wolves were transplanted here, there may be as many as 100 ranging freely hereabouts. If things keep going this way, Federal officials say, it may be possible to take the wolves off the Federal endangered list by 2001, ahead of the projected schedule. More than any other Yellowstone wolf, Nine is responsible for this success: Almost half the wolves here are her children or grandchildren.
This year alone, in a highly unusual feat of reproduction, her pack produced three litters of pups. An older daughter has formed a pack of her own, the first naturally formed such family grouping here since wolves were exterminated from Yellowstone by the Government in 1926. And as Nine's other descendants mature and form still more packs, her genetic legacy will spread further.
Nine attracted widespread attention two years ago when her original Yellowstone mate, Ten, was shot and killed, leaving her to fend for herself and eight pups, the first born of the restoration experiment. Now she not only has the upper hand in terms of reproductive and genetic dominance; she and her group have also shown their strength in battle, aggressively driving off the invading Druids. But there was a price. One of her yearling sons -- "feeling his oats," Dr. Smith said -- apparently pursued the fleeing Druids alone. They turned and killed him. And just a few weeks ago, the Druids caught one of Nine's daughters alone and killed her, too. The daughter's pups, one of this year's three Rose Creek litters, died.
Now there seems to be a standoff in this evolutionary numbers game, albeit a tenuous one since the Rose Creek and Druid Peak territories abut each other. Nine has surmounted all this and more to emerge grayer, distinguished looking and a near-legend. If anyone ever erects a statue of a wolf in Yellowstone, says Dr. Smith, "it should be her."
In all, an estimated 85 to 95 wolves now live here, and Dr. Smith says that given normal reproduction rates there could well turn out to be 100 when the count is complete. Officials of the Northern Rockies wolf recovery program say that no more introductions are necessary to meet the goal of removing the wolf from the endangered list. Natural reproduction, they say, should do the rest.
"We could de-list by Dec. 31, 2000," said Ed Bangs, a biologist with the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service, based in Helena, Mont., who heads the Northern Rockies recovery program. For that to happen, there must be at least 100 wolves and 10 breeding packs three years running in each of three areas: Yellowstone, central Idaho (where another population has been successfully introduced) and northwestern Montana (which has been naturally recolonized from neighboring Canada). There is a "50-50 chance" that the three-year countdown to de-listing will begin next year, Mr. Bangs said.
The eventual hope is that as the three wolf populations expand, they will begin interbreeding with each other, creating a single, large Northern Rockies population with a large, healthy gene pool. Other imperiled American gray wolf populations, chiefly in the Great Lakes region and the Southwest, are being treated separately for de-listing purposes. Wolves are plentiful and in no danger in Canada and Alaska.
The big surprise in Yellowstone this year has been the birth of multiple litters of pups to three packs: the three litters of Nine's group and two each in the Druid Peak pack and a group called the Chief Joseph pack. Partly, some experts say, this may be an artifact of wolf re-introduction. Usually, members of a pack would all be part of the same biological family, with only the alpha pair breeding, and inbreeding would not be a regular occurrence. But here, most packs have been constituted by throwing together unrelated wolves. The upshot is that since the alpha male is not related to the pack's females, he can mate with them all without causing social disruption.
But the primary factor in producing multiple litters, many biologists believe, is simply that Yellowstone abounds with prey, especially elk. The wolves are "living on a high plane of nutrition," said Mike Phillips, a wolf biologist who recently left the re-introduction project after directing it from the start. Dr. L. David Mech, another Federal biologist and wolf expert, said that "you don't have to be a rocket scientist or even a wolf biologist to predict that with that amount of prey, once they get settled into the area, it's a matter of converting all that prey to new wolves, which they do well."
So rich are the pickings that the Druid Peak pack, for instance, last fall killed 21 elk in a month, 18 of them calves. Nor do the wolves have to search very far to find a meal. Most of the packs' territories are consequently small. The first naturally formed pack in the park, called the Leopold pack after the great conservationist Aldo Leopold, has what scientists believe may be the smallest and best wolf territory in North America: a relatively tiny turf about six miles by eight, just a short distance from park headquarters at Mammoth Hot Springs.
The easy availability of natural prey is also cited as a possible reason why there have been so few cases of Yellowstone wolves' killing livestock. In 30 months, only four instances of livestock depredation by the wolves have been reported, all involving sheep. The owners were compensated for their losses, a total of $2,186, from a special fund maintained by the Defenders of Wildlife.
But one group of wolves, the Soda Butte pack, was recaptured and transferred out of its territory on private land just north of the park where, Dr. Smith said, "they lived among cows and sheep and didn't touch a one." They were moved farther south into the park nevertheless, after threats were made on their lives. Tourists have also sometimes interfered with the wolves. In at least two cases, Dr. Smith said, overenthusiastic visitors have in effect chased wolves away from a kill by getting too close, an illegal act in Yellowstone. Wolves are afraid of humans and flee them.
For the most part, however, the wolves seem to be securely established and thriving, and Dr. Dr. Smith said that a second, more scientific phase of the project was now beginning in which their behavior was to be studied over the long term. A platoon of volunteers is staking out the packs in relays, tracking their movements with radio direction finders every half-hour for 48 hours at a stretch (several wolves in each pack wear radio collars) and trying to monitor their behavior through binoculars and telescopes.
It is in the area of wolf-to-wolf relationships, both within packs and between them, that some of the most revealing observations have been made.
The life of Nine, for example, reads like a soap opera. When she arrived here with a daughter from Canada in January 1995, she had been separated from her mate by trappers who captured her for a reward. A previous mate may have been killed. Here, she immediately mated with a big gray male, designated Ten. He was about as strapping as Thirty-Eight, and together he and Nine produced eight pups. The Canadian daughter went off on her own and began foraging as a lone wolf. About the time Nine's first Yellowstone pups were born on bare ground near Red Lodge, Mont., outside the park, Ten was shot by an unemployed carpenter. The shooter was later convicted of killing a member of an endangered species, assessed a $10,000 fine and sentenced to six months in jail.
Biologists rescued Nine and her pups and nurtured them in a pen until the pups were old enough to leave. Some of the pups escaped from the pen but stayed close, and a yearling male from the Crystal Creek pack, Eight by name, began hanging around and brought food to them. On her release from the pen, Nine immediately took up with Eight, making him alpha male.
"Yearlings don't get promoted to alpha male all that often," Mr. Phillips said. "If she hadn't found his presence acceptable, she'd have run him out of there; but "here's a young guy who knows the area, and she's got eight mouths to feed, and he seemed to like the pups."
Nine's daughter from Canada also mated with a Crystal Creek yearling to form the Leopold pack, making her mother her sister-in-law as well. "This is truly a family affair," Mr. Phillips said.
Within the Rose Creek pack, a characteristic picture of autocracy moderated by cooperation has emerged. Observers say that one of Nine's pups from 1995 appears to have emerged as the beneficent uncle; this year's pups overwhelm him with affection. He and Eight, the alpha male, tirelessly carried food to the mothers and pups of the pack's multiple litters this spring.
Once, in a common display of the brutal nature of life in the wolf world, Eight sniffed out and killed an elk calf. One of last year's litter of pups distracted the mother elk while Eight began to feed. But a wolf pack is not a democracy: Eight bared his fangs at the yearling and would not allow him at the table. In a wolf pack, subordinates must mind their manners and bide their time until they can go off and form their own packs.
The next chapter of the story depends not least on how the simmering confrontation between the Rose Creekers and the Druids turns out. Wolf warfare is simple, Dr. Smith said: "Whoever's got more wolves wins." When the Druids savaged the Crystal Creek pack, they had a 5-to-3 advantage in fighting adults. The Rose Creekers had an 8-to-5 edge when they repulsed the Druids.
When the Druids "add their bevy of pups to their war machine," Dr. Smith said, "they're going to be a pack to contend with."

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Plays the Role of a Drama-Filled City;
Wayne Wang Films a Tale of Love and Loss Set Amid Real-Life Uncertainties

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, June 30

 BODY:
Filming a street scene in this hustling and bustling city has never been easy, what with all the local gangs of organized criminals who demand protection money virtually every time a camera sets up.
On top of these obstacles, Wayne Wang is directing sections of his new movie, "Chinese Box," smack in the middle of the chaos and hoopla surrounding Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule. 
 This week, he and his crew are filming several critical scenes in public places while historic events like the handover ceremony and the sailing away of the last British Governor unfold in the background.
In "Chinese Box," which stars Jeremy Irons as a dying British journalist and Gong Li as a reformed bar girl, Mr. Wang is trying to weave a story of imperfect love and disjointed relationships at a dramatic moment in history. The climax of the film comes for the fictional characters, as for the real city, in the last days of June.
Mr. Wang said he liked to mix the structure of a scripted event with the unpredictability of the moment. But there is so much daily uncertainty in filming "Chinese Box," he said, that he often wonders if the stress and anxiety are going to unhinge him.
"Every day I get up and ask my wife, 'Why am I doing this?' " Mr. Wang said during a break from filming. "And she says, 'You want it this way.' "
"You have to try to use the chaos," he continued, leaning to the positive side for a moment. "Hong Kong people work best on the fly. If you try to plan, it's never as good. But if you ask them, 'Can you do this right away?,' they give you their best work. I guess I'm like that, too."
The result, as one might expect, is that things are not quite going as expected. When he arrived to start filming this year, anticipating a widespread sense of impending calamity, Mr. Wang said, he was surprised to find that events were proceeding more smoothly and peacefully than he had expected.
Mr. Wang was born and reared here before moving to the United States in 1967, and despite frequent visits, he said, the immense changes here make him feel somewhat out of touch. "There aren't any police cracking heads of protesters," said Mr. Wang, who wrote the screenplay for "Chinese Box" with Jean-Claude Carriere ("Belle du Jour," "The Unbearable Lightness of Being"). "But that's O.K. It's more subtle, and I think that works better for the film."
A gentle man with rimless glasses and a dusting of gray in his close-cropped hair, Mr. Wang, who is 48, examined the subtleties of human relations in several of his earlier films, which include "The Joy Luck Club" and "Smoke."
After returning here this year, he said, he began to see the significance of the transfer of rule less in the arrival of Chinese troops and more in the potential for economic change and the danger of losing freedom over the long run. In "Chinese Box," he looks at how that affects human relations.
"I realized how much change has already been going on over the past 10 years," he said. "We tried to bring that into the film."
With the political background calmer than expected, Mr. Wang has found his biggest challenges to be more basic: shooting street scenes with actors as well known here as Gong Li, whose films include "Temptress Moon," "Farewell My Concubine" and "Raise the Red Lantern," and Maggie Cheung, a star of Hong Kong action movies. The filming is constantly interrupted by turning heads, stares and autograph seekers.
"We have to put actors right in the middle of things," said Mr. Wang. "It's very hard to control exactly what happens."
Tonight Mr. Irons shot a scene in Hong Kong's convention center, where many of the 8,000 journalists who came to cover the events are stationed. Since he did not hire them as extras, Mr. Wang asked the journalists to act naturally and not to look at the camera.
But as it turned out, Mr. Wang's biggest problem arose from outsiders' misconceptions about the level of danger in Hong Kong. Lawyers for another film Mr. Irons is shooting in Paris suddenly objected to the plan for the actor to return here for two days of shooting, demanding "political insurance" in case Mr. Irons was injured in a crackdown by China.
With that about as likely as a earthquake swallowing Mr. Irons in Paris, Mr. Wang was outraged.
"They want us to pay $400,000 to insure him for two days," fumed Mr. Wang. "We don't have that kind of money. The whole idea is ridiculous." (Mr. Irons came without the insurance.)
There have been other obstacles, too, that have nothing to do with political events, namely local organized crime gangs, known here as "triads." During one day of shooting in Kowloon City, a crowded section of town, the crew hung sheets of light-diffusing white silk outside a building where they were filming. The chauffeur of a triad leader died unexpectedly that day, and since white is considered the color of death, the triads blamed Mr. Wang and his crew.
"The next day we had to leave," said Mr. Wang. "There was nothing we could do. No amount of money would fix it. We had to find a new location and reshoot the entire scene."
With his background, Mr. Wang has a special perspective on Hong Kong. His parents escaped here from mainland China just 10 days before he was born -- "My anxiety must come from my mother's traumatic pregnancy," he said -- and he was educated in a school run by Irish Jesuits until his parents sent him to the United States.
After studying painting and film in California, Mr. Wang worked as a social worker in Chinatown in San Francisco. In 1982 he made his first movie, "Chan Is Missing," a humorous story based on people he had gotten to know there.
That marked the beginning of what Mr. Wang described as a conscious effort to tell stories about Chinese-Americans: "Dim Sum," "Eat a Bowl of Tea" and "The Joy Luck Club," based on Amy Tan's 1989 best seller.
"I will go off and do something that has nothing to do with China, like 'Smoke,' but I think will always come back to it," said Mr. Wang.
Mr. Wang said he began conceiving a film about Hong Kong in 1997 when he came here to make a quick low-budget movie in 1989 called "Life is Cheap, but Toilet Paper Is Expensive."
"That movie ends with the main character asking 'What's going to happen?' " he said. "That whetted my appetite about the whole issue."
The title "Chinese Box" implies the unknowable nature of China. "Like one of those Russian dolls, you can open layer after layer, but you still never know what's going to be inside," Mr. Wang said. "It's complex, it's secretive."
"Most people aren't going to shed a tear about the British leaving, and they're not so thrilled about the Chinese coming," he said. "But what they appreciate most is the freedom they've always had here. This sense of freedom, of having personal choices, will change. Or at least it remains unclear."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Surges Against Mark As a Weak Euro Is Foreseen

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar surged to its highest level against the German mark in more than three years yesterday, buoyed by concerns about European monetary union.
Over the weekend, the president of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, Hans Tietmeyer, said sustainable budgetary discipline was a more important goal than meeting the strict fiscal guidelines designed to insure a strong single currency, the euro. 
 Yesterday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany played down a rift with his party's ruling coalition partners over monetary union and said his Government was fully united in its drive to start the single currency on time. The euro is scheduled to begin in 1999.
The remarks convinced the market of Germany's resolve to push ahead with the single currency regardless of its ability to meet the economic requirements for its introduction, weighing on the mark and pushing the dollar higher.
"The feeling is that we're going to have a broad and weak euro," said Bob Savage, chief foreign exchange dealer at Lehman Brothers.
The dollar rose as high as 1.7465 marks before settling in late New York trading at 1.7443 marks, up from 1.7387 marks on Friday, its highest close since February 1994. The dollar also rose to 114.59 yen from 114.55 yen.
The dollar benefited from several strong United States economic reports that suggested that growth could be picking up again after several months of slowing.
Sales of new homes showed robust growth in May, while both Chicago and New York manufacturing indexes posted strong gains for the month of June.
While Federal Reserve policy makers are not expected to raise interest rates when they meet this week, traders said yesterday's data pointed to an August increase.
In other currency trading, the British pound surged against the mark and gained against the dollar.
The Bank of England yesterday reported a strong gain in British consumer credit in May, increasing the odds for higher interest rates.
The pound rose as high as 2.9072 marks, its highest since July 1992. In New York, the pound advanced to $1.6647, from $1.6639 on Friday.

HEADLINE: THE SECOND QUARTER: THE CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Bond Prices Drop, but Brighter Days Are Expected

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Unlike the robust stock market, which led Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, to caution against irrational exuberance, the bond market has been a study in understatement in the second quarter and first half of this year. But there are growing expectations that in the months ahead that could change and bonds could make a move of their own.
Still, the idea of long bonds yielding 6 percent, let alone 5 percent, continues to be a tough sell to many fixed-income investors. They are less believing than their stock market counterparts that the economy is in a new era in which technology drives productivity and permits strong growth and low unemployment without setting off inflation. 
The chief question keeping bonds under a tight rein has been whether the economy is too strong and unemployment too low for inflation to remain at bay for long. Bears see these conditions as temporary, while bulls view them as long lasting.
Yesterday the price of the 30-year bond fell 21/32, to 98; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.78 percent from 6.74 percent on Friday. The yield is still lower than the 7.09 percent at the end of the first quarter, but higher than 6.64 percent at the end of 1996.
"It's pretty obvious that the first half of the year has been a roller coaster ride for the bond market," said Patrick R. Ledford, senior fixed-income portfolio manager at Citibank Global Asset Management. One reason, he said, is that growth slowed because some of the first- quarter activity was borrowed from the second quarter. For example, because of unseasonably warm weather retail sales and home building that would normally have taken place in the second quarter were accelerated into the first quarter.
"So now we finish up the second quarter, which is looking weaker than it should have been," Mr. Ledford said. "I don't think there is anything structurally or fundamentally weak about the economy, and I do expect growth will strengthen again in the second half of the year." He predicted this growth would lead the Federal Reserve to push up interest rates by a quarter to a half of a percentage point "over the next three to six months."
The central bank raised the Federal funds target rate by 25 basis points, or a quarter of a percentage point, in March and left it unchanged in May at 5.50 percent.
Mr. Ledford said inflation would not necessarily be a problem in the second half of the year for two reasons: "Global competition is forcing U.S. manufacturers to keep prices down, and productivity will keep profit margins high." Growth will not be so rapid as in the first quarter, he added, "but it will be above trend nonetheless, which will force the Fed to adjust monetary policy."
Today and tomorrow the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets. Most market participants are not expecting the Fed to take any rate action this time, but the August meeting might be another matter entirely.
Thomas E. Donne, vice president and senior portfolio manager at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said the general perception in the market was that the trend for yield volatility was currently lower, and that it would stabilize below historic levels.
Discussing the quarterly performances of the Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers indexes and their components over the last 10 years, he said: "About half the time they have been negative in the first quarter and you don't see that exhibited in any of the other quarters in the bond market. So you can extrapolate from that that you can expect things to run better the rest of the year.
"When you look at 10-year notes as an example," he continued, "yield levels are close to the beginning of the year, but if you look at where we've been for the year as a whole, rates have generally been higher as whole, and that kind of fits with my earlier observation, which is since mid-April rates have been trending lower, consistent with the notion that the second quarter would be a good-performing quarter for bonds."
According to the Lehman Brothers index, through last week and the year to date, Mr. Donne added, only one category has had a negative return -- the new notes introduced by the Treasury this year as a hedge against inflation. Investors "have not poured money into these inflation indexed notes," he said, and that "shows that inflation is not viewed as problematic."
Judicious Fed policy has been one source of the economy's success, he said. Also, people have not spent a lot, but there has been significant capital investment in the economy, which explains recent good productivity numbers. "I see the last half of the year as more like the second quarter," Mr. Donne said.
Yesterday, the market slumped badly after strong housing and manufacturing reports raised concern that the Fed might indeed make a pre-emptive strike much as it did in March.
The Commerce Department said new single-family home sales jumped 7.1 percent in May after declining in April, while the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago's June index of business activity surged to 61.5, from 56.8 the month before. A reading of 50 or higher usually indicates that more respondents than not see improving business conditions. It also serves as a precursor to the National Association of Purchasing Management's monthly index due today.
Markets analysts said yesterday's weekly bill auction was generally in line with expectations, with interest rates up moderately. The three-month bill rose 18 basis points, to 5.12 percent, and the six-month bill increased 9 basis points, to 5.14 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's weekly auction of new three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Distributors Of Foods Plan Merger Worth $689 Million

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
JP Foodservice Inc. said yesterday that it had agreed to buy Rykoff-Sexton Inc. for about $689 million in stock.
The companies, two of the biggest in the food service industry, said the merged operations would have annual sales of $5.2 billion. The combined company would have more than 130,000 customers among restaurants, hotels and institutional buyers. 
 The purchase will extend JP Foodservice's reach into the Western United States and into manufacturing.
It also enables JP Foodservice to compete more directly with the Sysco Corporation, which has dominated the fragmented $135 billion food distribution industry during the last decade.
Sysco, based in Houston, had 1996 sales of $13.4 billion.
Under the terms of the agreement, Rykoff-Sexton's shareholders will exchange each of their shares for 0.84 share of JP Foodservice. Based on JP Foodservice's closing price Friday, that values each Rykoff-Sexton share at $25.3125, nearly 29 percent above the company's stock price on Friday. Shareholders of both companies will hold almost equal stakes in the combined company.
But shares of JP Foodservice fell $1.4375 yesterday, to $28.6875, on the New York Stock Exchange, giving the deal a value of $689 million. Shares of Rykoff-Sexton rose $3.6875, to $23.3125.
JP Foodservice, based in Columbia, Md., will also assume about $700 million in the debt of Rykoff-Sexton, whose headquarters are in Wilkes-Barre, Pa.
The sale, while still subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals, has already received the consent of about 36 percent of Rykoff-Sexton's shareholders, the companies said.
 The combined companies will continue under JP Foodservice's name.
The purchase, while leaving the company far behind Sysco, enables JP Foodservice to accelerate the growth it has pursued since gaining independence from the Sara Lee Corporation in 1989.
"We view this as the opportunity to leap ahead of the industry, in a No. 2 position," said James Miller, JP Foodservice's chairman and chief executive. "We now have the critical mass."
The food service industry has been consolidating quickly in the last few years as companies hustle to keep old accounts and gain new ones by creating larger economies of scale.
JP Foodservice bought $350 million in companies last year alone, Mr. Miller said, and Rykoff last year completed the acquisition of US Foodservice Inc. for $614 million.

HEADLINE: It's Lonely Being a Deficit Hawk

BYLINE: By Tom Campbell; Tom Campbell, a Republican, is a United States Representative from California.

DATELINE: CAMPBELL, Calif.

 BODY:
I know it's hard for anyone in public office to vote against a tax cut. Nevertheless I was surprised last week when I was the only Republican to vote against the House tax plan.
Indeed, I am against all the tax plans proposed by the House, Senate and President Clinton, because they place more emphasis on cutting taxes than cutting the deficit. 
 For a Congress that said it was committed to balancing the budget, and a President who could have been the first in 30 years to achieve one, this change in emphasis is alarming.
The tax bills that passed the House and Senate last week would increase the deficit by $85 billion over five years. Over 10 years, each would increase the deficit by more than $200 billion. Each plan proposed that the Government increase its debt limit by $500 billion.
Yet conservatives in each house voted for the plan.
President Clinton's proposal isn't much better. In the package he unveiled yesterday, the deficit would also be increased by $85 billion.
The most expensive part of each plan is a $500-per-child tax credit. The House and Senate versions would add $71 billion to the deficit over the next five years. The President wants to extend the child tax credit even more, to low-income families that may qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit. Conservatives object, arguing that such a cut would constitute a form of welfare. For some reason, however, lowering taxes for groups they wish to favor would not.
There is no difference, in fairness or economics, between lowering taxes on a favored group and spending money on a favored group. The favored group for Republicans is composed of lower-middle-income people with children. A powerful voting bloc, they were promised a tax cut in the Contract With America. The President, on the other hand, wants to favor poor families, a powerful voting bloc for his party.
That's welfare politics -- practiced by Republicans as readily as Democrats.
This is not to say that all tax cuts are simply welfare for one group or another. Some tax reductions spur economic activity. Taxing investment curbs economic growth. The capital gains reduction part of the House tax package would generate $2.7 billion over the first five years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
A tax cut directed to children, however, does not generate revenue. No one can argue that it would pay for itself. No one argues that it would result in more children or even that more children would be desirable. This tax cut is simply a transfer of money to groups that Congress and the President want to favor.
This supposedly "family friendly" plan actually postpones the day when we stop borrowing from our children. As long as we are running a deficit, tax cuts that cost revenue are welfare for this generation paid for by the next. What a remarkable moral lesson to our children: we'll cut your parents' taxes and make you pay for it later.
But for these tax cuts, a balanced budget could have been achieved in the next two years. That would be an immense psychological and political achievement. Every subsequent President, especially Republican Presidents, would be pressed to hit a zero deficit -- after all, a Democrat did it.
Of course, I recognize tax money comes from people. The Government does not "own" tax money. And when it allows workers to keep more of what they earn, it does not "give it away." But before the baby boomers begin to retire, we must balance the budget. If we fail to do so in excellent economic times, when will we?
Earlier this year, the President and Congress appeared to be in agreement that it was time to balance the budget. We were willing to sacrifice the immediate gain for the long-term good. Now we have returned to the more traditional approach -- immediate gain for important constituencies. I was sorry to see the President revert; I was sorry and surprised to see my Republican colleagues in Congress emulate him.

HEADLINE: Albany Budget Endgame

 BODY:
With New York State rolling in tax revenues, Gov. George Pataki and the State Legislature are rushing to reach agreement on a budget that will probably include something to please every constituency. The danger is that in doling out tax breaks and spending increases, the parties will approve a budget that worsens the state's financial stability and preserves the same basic inequities that have long damaged New York City's interests. The priorities in the final weeks of the legislative session should be to insure adequate financing for health and education and to avoid tax cuts that the state still cannot afford.
Thanks to the boom on Wall Street, these are good times for New York. Since Mr. Pataki introduced his own $66 billion budget in January, tax revenues have surged ahead of expectations and some expenses like Medicaid are coming in under what was projected. Last week, the Governor and legislative leaders reportedly agreed that they had an additional $2.6 billion to play with, enough to avoid the need for some of Mr. Pataki's proposed cuts. There was little chance that the Legislature was ever going to go along, in any case, with Mr. Pataki's initial call for cuts in welfare grant levels, Medicaid payments to hospitals and nursing homes and state funding for higher education. The other spending priorities ought to be the restoration of proposed cuts in mental health programs and of cuts enacted in previous years for services to children from troubled families. 
 The most contentious issue is certain to be the desire of New York City to get an increase in state school aid and at least a down payment on nearly $1 billion in prior claims for education aid. The state has not paid claims dating back to 1989, contending that the city has lagged in submitting the claims and that the money has never been appropriated by the Legislature. Surprisingly, the Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, is said to be sympathetic to the city's demands, but there is a catch. In return, Mr. Bruno wants legislative approval of Republican-backed tax cuts that would heavily favor businesses and homeowners in the suburbs.
The main tax cut that Mr. Bruno and Mr. Pataki want is a huge $1.7 billion property tax giveaway, only 12 percent of which would go to taxpayers in New York City. Mr. Giuliani and his main legislative ally in this fight, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, need to drive a hard bargain. There is no point in bringing about more equity in school aid for New York City if city taxpayers are dealt an unfair hand on tax relief. It is far from clear, in any case, that the state can afford the tax cut. As is typical in Albany, it would explode in size in the years ahead, opening up gaping budget deficits that will have to be closed by more program cuts.
In flush times, the state ought to be able to abandon its usual fiscal gimmicks. Albany is nonetheless filled with talk of more borrowing schemes and use of more one-time-only revenues to pay for recurring expenses, the kind of shenanigans that have given New York the worst credit rating in the country. In the past, governors and legislatures have argued that economic downturns necessitated the use of such gimmicks. But there is no excuse this year for reckless budgeting that will weaken the state's fiscal foundation.

HEADLINE: THE SECOND QUARTER: THE UNDERWRITERS;
Stock and Bond Issues Picked Up Speed as Quarter Progressed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
A heavy flow of business in June more than made up for what had been a diffident start to the second quarter for stock and bond underwriters.
In the second three months of the year, the volume of stock and bond underwriting rose 15.6 percent from the comparable period a year ago, to $285.08 billion, according to the Securities Data Company. And for the first six months of the year, total stock and bond underwritings reached a record $571.9 billion. 
 As in the first quarter, however, the sale of bonds and other debt was responsible for most of the increase. Equity underwriting, which is far more lucrative for Wall Street firms, rebounded a bit from first-quarter levels, but was well short of those a year earlier. And the pickup in underwriting activity from the first quarter, when $273.3 billion worth of domestic debt and equities were sold, was a modest 4.3 percent.
Still, the performance was better than might have been predicted in late March or April, when concern about rising interest rates and strong economic growth cast something of a pall on financial markets.
"All things considered, this was not a bad quarter for underwriting," said Sallie L. Krawcheck, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. "And the big story is June, when there was a big turnaround."
Worries that there would be tightening moves by the Federal Reserve dissipated as data released during the quarter showed that inflation remained remarkably low and economic growth had slowed considerably from its torrid first-quarter pace.
Those developments, in turn, restored confidence to the stock and bond markets, especially last month.
"June was perhaps the most memorable month of the first half of the year and a significant improvement from April," said Scott Sipprelle, head of United States equity capital markets at Morgan Stanley.
"There was a much better sense of the business and a rosier glow from portfolio managers at the end of the quarter than when it started."
A sharp rebound in the volume of initial public offerings reflected the stock market's better mood.
Initial offerings raised $10.36 billion in the second quarter, up sharply from the $5.9 billion underwritten in the first quarter.
"By a mile, June was the best I.P.O. month of the year," said James Hanbury, an analyst with Schroder Wertheim.
Still, the recovery fell far short of the second quarter in 1996, when initial offerings came to $18.9 billion.
Over all, sales of common stock in the United States totaled $23.7 billion, down steeply from the $41.3 billion in stock that was underwritten in last year's second quarter. But it is an improvement from the first quarter of this year, when equity underwritings totaled $21.3 billion.
Maintaining the leadership position it has held since 1988, Merrill Lynch remained Wall Street's top debt and equity underwriter. During the quarter, it underwrote 337 deals that raised just over $47 billion.
The others in the top five underwent something of a shake-up.
Lehman Brothers, which placed fifth in the first quarter, was the quarter's second most active underwriter. Goldman, Sachs, which had been second, fell to third, followed by Morgan Stanley and J. P. Morgan.
The decline in new equity offerings continued to crimp the money that Wall Street firms make from underwritings.
Disclosed fees collected by all underwriting firms totaled $1.72 billion, down 4.5 percent from the first quarter and more than 42 percent from the second quarter of 1996.
For the first half of the year, disclosed fees were $3.6 billion, almost 30 percent less than for the first six months of 1996, according to Securities Data.
Once again, the five biggest firms collected the majority of the fees. Collectively, they accounted for just over 54 percent of all underwriting fees.
On the fixed-income side, a relatively benign interest-rate environment encouraged issuers to price just over $119 billion worth of new securities in the quarter, a 59 percent increase from the comparable period a year ago.
"The quarter was a volatile one," said John Massad, head of debt syndication at J. P. Morgan Securities. "April, the month after the Fed raised interest rates, was a very difficult month. But by the beginning of May, people had decided there would not be a series of tightenings, and the market got much stronger."
Concern about rising interest rates slowed the issuance of new high-yield bonds. Just 29 new underwritings, totaling $5.89 billion, were offered during the quarter, down sharply from 54 issues that raised $10.2 billion in the second quarter of 1996.
In large measure, the negative comparisons with 1996 are misleading, since that was a record-breaking year. Analysts said they still expected to see healthy earnings figures when most Wall Street firms report their second-quarter results later this month.
"The year-over-year comparable figures are probably going to be down for most people," Mr. Hanbury said. "Whether it is as good as last year remains to be seen, but it will be a good quarter."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Remarks By Clinton on Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's remarks today about his plans for a tax cut, as recorded by the Federal News Service, a private transcription service:
America's families deserve a tax cut, and they deserve one that reflects their values. It is, after all, the energy and dedication of the American people that has produced our present prosperity, that has made it possible for us to balance the budget. 
 The American people should receive a dividend from this prosperity because they have produced the strength that has enabled us to achieve it. The dividend should be reflected in policies that help them to strengthen their families and educate their children.
Two different tax cut bills have passed the House and the Senate. The bills contain many good elements, but I do not believe they represent the best way to cut taxes, nor are they consistent with the balanced-budget agreement. They are not close to the roughly $35 billion the agreement explicitly provides to help people provide for higher education costs. They do an inadequate job of opening the doors to college, therefore. They direct far too little relief to the middle class. They include time-bomb tax cuts that threaten to explode the deficit. They do not do enough to keep our economy going. . . .
My plan reflects America's values, helping families pay for college, raise their children, buy or sell a home, pay for health care. It honors the budget agreement. It is the right plan for America.
This reflects the approach of Democratic alternatives that were offered in Congress, but it also reflects the priorities of the Republicans, as well.
The $85 billion tax cut, I submit, has five central elements. First, the tax cut plan will focus on education, our nation's highest priority, with $35 billion in targeted tax cuts. To offer opportunity in the new and rapidly changing economy, we must make the 13th and 14th years of education, the first two years of college, as universal as a high-school diploma is today.
To that end, my proposal will give young people a Hope Scholarship tax credit worth up to $1,500 for the first two years of college. It gives further tax cuts to help pay for four years of college. It provides tax relief to pay for training and learning throughout a lifetime. It will allow parents to save in a tax-free I.R.A. for their children's education, and it will use tax incentives to help communities rebuild and modernize their schools. . . .
Second, my plan gives families a $500 tax credit for every child under 17. This plan, unlike the tax cut proposals put forth by the Congressional majority, would give working people who earn lower salaries the child tax credit as well. A rookie police officer or a starting teacher, a firefighter or a nurse who earns $22,000 deserves a child tax credit. They are some of our hardest-pressed working people. They are paying taxes now, and I will fight to give them the same tax relief that other Americans would receive.
Third, to honor our commitment to bipartisanship, the plan allows taxpayers to exclude 30 percent of their capital gains from taxation. It also gives a capital gains tax cut for buying and selling a home. The capital gains cut is targeted more prudent and less likely to explode the deficit in the years to come than the plan of the Congressional majority.
Fourth, my plan provides estate tax relief to help parents who want to pass small businesses and family farms on to their children.
Fifth, the plan provides tax incentives to encourage businesses to hire people off welfare. It will also provide tax cuts to businesses that clean up urban toxic waste sites, known as brownfields, and convert these sites to productive use. It will create 20 more empowerment zones to attract businesses into disadvantaged neighborhoods, and it includes tax incentives to revive our nation's capital. . . .
In addition, the Senate, by bipartisan agreement, departed from the budget agreement to support a 20-cents-per-pack tax on cigarettes. I will support this change. Unlike the Senate version, however, I believe these revenues should be used entirely in ways that focus on the needs of children and health care.
This tax cut plan that I have just outlined embodies the best ideas offered by Democrats. It reflects many of the priorities of the Republicans, such as the capital gains cut. It is balanced; it is fair to the middle class; it will foster economic growth without hurting our vulnerable citizens. And it is consistent with the budget agreement. It is the right plan for America, and I will do my best and fight hard for it in the weeks to come.

HEADLINE: Office Depot And Staples Merger Halted

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
Executives of the office supply giants Staples Inc. and Office Depot Inc. said today that their proposed merger was almost certainly dead after a Federal judge issued an order temporarily blocking the $4 billion combination.
Company officials said they were stunned and disappointed by the decision of Judge Thomas F. Hogan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, who ruled that the proposed merger would drastically reduce competition in the office products business. 
 The judge accepted the Government's contention that office supply superstores constitute a unique market segment and that allowing two of the three major competitors in the field to combine would permit the new company, with more than 1,100 stores and $11 billion in annual sales, to raise prices with impunity.
The judge's order came after the stock market had closed for the day. Staples ended at $23.25, down 25 cents; Office Depot finished at $19.4375, down 12.5 cents. But in after-hours trading, shares of Office Depot tumbled, falling to $14.50. Shares of Staples were little changed.
The decision was a major victory for Federal Trade Commission antitrust lawyers, who brought the case this spring despite sharp conflict within the agency over the wisdom of challenging the merger. The Government's assertion that the Staples-Office Depot combination would give the company near-monopoly pricing power was controversial in antitrust circles because the company would control only 6 percent to 8 percent of the overall office products market.
William J. Baer, director of the F.T.C.'s Bureau of Competition, said he was delighted and relieved at the outcome.
"The judge accepted our market definition and found our pricing studies persuasive," Mr. Baer said in an interview. "The bottom line is that we knew this would be a very difficult case to litigate but we were concerned that if the merger went through consumers would be at risk."
Thomas G. Stemberg, chairman of Staples, said that the merger was now highly unlikely in light of Judge Hogan's ruling. In a telephone conference call with reporters, Mr. Stemberg said that his company, which is based in Westborough, Mass., had spent more than $20 million and "countless hours" putting together the deal with Office Depot and defending.
Mr. Stemberg said that the boards of the two companies would meet in the next few days to consider their course, but indicated it was virtually certain that board members would accept management's recommendation to end the deal.
"We've spent about 10 months of our organization's time and resources pursuing this matter," he said, speaking from a farmhouse in Ireland where he is vacationing. "It has been a tremendous distraction and a tremendous expense. To pursue it for many more months would be a further distraction and a further expense without any certainty of success."
David I. Fuente, Office Depot chairman, made similar comments in a statement issued by company headquarters in Delray Beach, Fla.
"Office Depot has been engaged in a long and frustrating attempt to merge with Staples. We still believe that the decision to merge our two companies was sound, based on the strategic advantages that would have resulted, but today's decision by Judge Hogan means the merger is now unlikely," Mr. Fuente said.
In his opinion, Judge Hogan said that the companies had not sufficiently proved their claims of billions of dollars in savings from the merger. He said that it was possible that office products prices would have fallen after the merger because of reductions in overhead costs. But he noted that the two companies have competed aggressively on price for years and the likelihood of lower prices was greater if the companies remained independent.
The judge said that the F.T.C. had demonstrated through comparative pricing studies and economic models that the merger would "substantially impair competition."
"In light of the undeniable benefits that Staples and Office Depot have brought to consumers, it is with regret that the court reaches the decision that it must in this case," Judge Hogan wrote in his 55-page opinion.
"This decision will most likely kill the merger. The court feels, to some extent, that the defendants are being punished for their own successes and for the benefits that they have brought to consumers. In effect, they have been hoisted with their own petards."
Consumer advocates cheered the decision. Jamie Love, an economist at the Center for the Study of Responsive Law, said that he had expected the merger to be approved even though he believed it would mean higher prices for consumers.
"It was really important test," Mr. Love said. "It shows the F.T.C. can stop a merger when it wants to, even when there is a spirited defense as there was in this case. And it sends signal for others in retail."
Mr. Stemberg, however, said that consumers were the big losers.
"This is a sad day for small businesses and consumers who would have reaped the greatest benefit of all," he said.

HEADLINE: Fed Expected To Hold Line On Rates, at Least for Now

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve is likely to hold interest rates steady at its two-day meeting this week, but reports issued today suggest that the economy remains sufficiently strong that the central bank could feel compelled to tighten monetary policy later in the year, economists and investors say.
After growing at 5.9 percent in the first quarter, the economy slowed substantially, probably to about 2 percent, in the three-month period ended today, economists said. 
 But today's reports on new-home sales, manufacturing activity in the Midwest and personal consumption and income led some analysts and investors to conclude that the economy retained an unexpected vigor as it headed into the second half. With unemployment at 4.8 percent already well below the level at which inflation has historically tended to pick up during periods of strong growth, analysts said the likelihood was increasing that the Fed would decide to raise rates at one of its next two meetings, in mid-August and late September.
"We agree with pretty well everyone that the Fed is not going to move this week," said James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at J. P. Morgan. "But we do think they'll be tightening before long."
The Commerce Department reported that sales of new single-family homes rose 7.1 percent in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 825,000. The increase, the biggest in six months, was higher than most analysts had expected. Some analysts said the drop in long-term interest rates over the last month could keep the housing market strong this summer.
In a sign that manufacturing activity might be picking up, the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago reported that its business outlook index rose to 61.5 in June from 56.8 in May. The index often provides an early look at the trend in nationwide manufacturing activity. A similar index for the New York region also increased sharply, to 64.9 in June from 50.8 in May.
The Commerce Department reported that personal consumption and income both increased three-tenths of 1 percent in May, half their pace in the first quarter but strong enough to indicate that a recent slowdown in consumer spending might be bottoming out.
"Other than the consumer spending numbers, there's very little in the way of weakness," Mr. O'Sullivan said.
The flurry of reports sent bond prices lower on concerns that the Fed would feel compelled to push interest rates higher later this year. The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was down 21/32 , to 98, to yield 6.78 percent. Bonds' drop hurt the stock market, which bounced up and down during the day. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 14.93 at 7,672.79.
Today's economic reports were unlikely to have much effect on the deliberations of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee during its two-day meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, analysts said.
Over the last several weeks Fed officials have said they are encouraged with the economy's slower growth during the second quarter after the extremely strong first quarter, and that they see no big warning signs of a pick up in inflation.
The Fed last raised rates in March, when it nudged its Federal funds target rate up to 5.5 percent from 5.25 percent. That was the first time it had tightened policy in more than two years, and the move was widely seen as preventive to insure that inflation did not infect the economy. The Fed left rates unchanged at a subsequent meeting in May.
With the economy showing almost no signs of consumer price inflation or of its precursor, wage inflation, most analysts believe the Fed is now content to sit tight for another month or two to determine whether the slower growth pace will insure that price pressures remain contained.
Traditional economic theory holds that low unemployment combined with strong growth will generate inflation, because employers will bid up wages to attract the workers they need and then pass the costs along to consumers. But that pattern has broken down during this economic cycle, with unemployment well below what analysts long considered the danger mark and growth well above what Fed officials consider the economy's "speed limit" of 2.25 percent.
Still, many Fed officials and most economists believe that the old relationship between growth and unemployment will ultimately reassert itself. They said that if growth in the second half of the year ran close to 3 percent or more, as now seems possible, and unemployment remains steady or even falls, which is another strong possibility, the forces that had restrained wage and price increases would begin to buckle.
"You have to conclude that we are probably still in an excess-growth year, and we're starting from a point at which economists would have to be looking for inflation heating up 6 to 12 months down the road," said David C. Munro, an economist at High Frequency Economics, an economic consulting firm.
Economists are struggling to determine whether the slowdown in consumer spending will continue through the summer, and whether industrial production will slow after a period in which retailers restocked their inventories after the robust first quarter. On both counts, the outlook is far from clear, and it is complicated by other uncertainties, including whether foreign economies will rebound sharply enough to stimulate demand for American goods.
"We're going to have a period of extreme confusion over the summer," said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at HSBC Markets.
More generally, policy makers within the Fed, like economists generally, are still trying to decide whether the economy has changed so fundamentally that it has altered the relationships among growth, unemployment and price increases. Laurence H. Meyer, an economic forecaster who was named a Fed governor by President Clinton last year, has argued that nothing has really changed, and that strong growth coupled with low unemployment will eventually send inflation up again.
But Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman and still the most influential voice on monetary policy, appears to have adopted a more pragmatic approach, scouring the economy for the ramifications of the complex interplay among the business world's drive for more efficiency, the willingness of workers to accept limited pay increases and the overall economy's growth.

HEADLINE: Benchmarks of Justice

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
It was a Supreme Court term that defied labels and made history.
Perhaps the single most important fact about the term that ended last Friday after a weeklong torrent of landmark opinions is how important it was. 
 In case after case, whether venturing into new areas or revisiting old disputes, the Justices established new reference points, frameworks within which not only law but, to no small degree, social and political arrangements will now evolve.
In rejecting Congress's effort to regulate speech on the Internet, the Court delivered, with essential unanimity, a broadly forward-looking charter for free speech in the world's newest medium of communication; in terms of immediate practical consequence, this may have been the term's most significant decision.
In ruling that there is no general constitutional right to doctor-assisted suicide, the Court held the door open to future legislative developments and even, somewhat surprisingly, to future legal claims on behalf of a right of terminally ill people to control the timing and the manner of their death.
In overturning a part of the Brady gun-control law on the basis of a forcefully expressed, if narrowly supported, vision of state sovereignty, the Court served notice that long-settled assumptions about the primacy of the national government within the Federal system may no longer be valid.
All this from a Court that preached judicial restraint even as it overturned four Federal laws, including the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a statute that passed Congress by near acclamation but that intruded, according to the Justices, on the power of the Supreme Court to define not only the minimal boundaries of constitutional rights but the outer limits as well. (In addition to the Brady law, the Communications Decency Act and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the fourth law the Court invalidated was the Indian Land Consolidation Act of 1984, which took small parcels of land from individual Indians and transferred them to tribal ownership.)
It was a term about boundaries: between the Federal Government and the states, in the Brady Act case; between the judiciary and Congress, in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act case as well as in a decision rejecting an effort by Congressional plaintiffs to obtain review of the Line-Item Veto Act; between courts and legislatures, in the Justices' conclusion in the assisted-suicide case that courts should step back and let legislators proceed; between the Presidency and the courts, in the unanimous rejection of President Clinton's effort to delay proceedings in a private lawsuit against him, and between church and state, in the reversal of a precedent that had kept public-school teachers out of parochial-school classrooms.
"The Supreme Court is redesigning the basic institutional architecture of our public lives," said Prof. Paul Gewirtz of Yale Law School. Even in those decisions that appear to have a rather abstract quality, Professor Gewirtz said, "the Court's insistence on certain structures of power has enormous consequences" for the allocation of power in the country.
The sweep of the term's decisions did more than underscore the Supreme Court's essential authority "to say what the law is," in the words of Marbury v. Madison, the 1803 decision that established this authority and that Justice Anthony M. Kennedy referred to throughout his decision on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. It was also a reminder of the Court's ability to galvanize a national conversation, sometimes merely by selecting a case for decision. While the Court scarcely created the debate over doctor-assisted suicide, for example, it was only once the Justices undertook to decide the issue that a big segment of the public tuned in for the first time.
In the coming term, the role of lightning-rod case is very likely to be assumed by an affirmative action dispute the Court accepted for decision on the final day of the term. That case is an appeal by a school board in Piscataway, N.J., from a ruling that the dismissal of a white teacher in order to protect a black teacher's job violated Federal civil rights law. It raises the question of whether diversity alone is ever an acceptable rationale for race-conscious employment decisions.
The Court's decision to hear the Piscataway case was a setback for the Clinton Administration, which had tried to persuade the Justices not to take the case and which must now take a stand on a concrete and politically uninviting dispute just when Mr. Clinton is trying to initiate a nationwide discussion of race.
This was not a happy Supreme Court term for the Administration. The Justices not only ruled against Mr. Clinton in the Paula Jones case but also refused to hear an appeal on whether White House lawyers' notes were protected by attorney-client privilege against compelled disclosure to the Whitewater independent counsel.
The Court's 80 opinions ranged over many corners of the law, sometimes reflecting a surprising degree of unanimity. Nearly half the cases, 38, were decided by 9-to-0 votes, unanimous in result if not always in reasoning. Among these were the Internet and assisted-suicide cases. For the first time in years of scrutinizing government drug-testing programs, the Justices finally met one they did not like, striking down a Georgia program as unconstitutional, with only Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist dissenting.
Seventeen cases were decided by 5-to-4 votes. The largest number of these, eight cases, were decided by the same majority bloc: the three most conservative Justices, Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Chief Justice Rehnquist, joined by the two Justices in the middle of the Court, Justice Kennedy and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. The cases included a few of the term's most important, among them the Brady law ruling, the decision overturning the precedent on parochial schools, a redistricting case from Georgia and a ruling permitting states to commit violent sex offenders to mental hospitals when their prison terms have expired.
The Court's liberal bloc, consisting of Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, needed an ally if they were to accomplish anything. Justice O'Connor joined this group in a 5-to-4 decision rejecting immunity for private prison guards. The liberal group splintered among themselves fairly often this term.
Liberal, in fact, is a relative word with respect to the current Court. The term was a powerful reminder of the extent to which the Court's center of gravity has shifted to the right in recent years.
For example, in the case on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, not a single Justice argued for a position that for years was a liberal article of faith: that when it came to protecting constitutional rights, the Court could build the floor but Congress had the power to raise the ceiling. Conservatives derided this theory as the "one-way ratchet" in constitutional law. In any event, the point is now moot.
In similar fashion, in the 5-to-4 decision on extended confinement for sex offenders, no one on the Court really disputed that the Constitution gave Kansas room to accomplish its goal; the debate was a much narrower one of procedure rather than of substance.
And in the assisted-suicide case, the claim that all Justices rejected -- that the Constitution's due process guarantee is expansive enough to include a right of terminally ill people to have a doctor's assistance in dying -- was hardly fanciful. The appeals court whose decision the Supreme Court overturned had accepted that argument by a vote of 8 to 3.
In other words, there is a range of constitutional discourse that is not being heard on the Court today. Arguments that not so many years ago would have flowed comfortably, even if not successfully, from the mainstream of legal thought now appear as little more than liberal delusions. By the same token, it would have been inconceivable to many people only a few years ago that the states' rights attack on the Brady Act could have won five votes at the Supreme Court.
This term, which began on Oct. 7 and ended on June 27, was many things. It was, as Robert H. Bork once famously described his view of life on the Court, an intellectual feast. In the crowding of so many important decisions into the final few days, the Justices basically delivered a whole term in a single week, in a kind of Supreme Court version of Tom Stoppard's 12-minute "Hamlet." It was a term that mattered.
Following are summaries of the term's most important decisions:
 
Presidential Power
The Court voted 9 to 0 to reject President Clinton's request for a delay, until he leaves office, in proceedings of a sexual harassment suit brought against him by a former Arkansas state employee, Paula Corbin Jones. The decision, Clinton v. Jones, No. 95-1853, was the first in which the Court had considered whether an incumbent President could be sued for actions outside the scope of his official duties. Justice Stevens wrote the Court's opinion, and Justice Breyer concurred separately.
 
Constitutional Structure
A major focus of the Court's attention, this category encompasses cases relating both to federalism -- the relationship between the state and national governments -- and to the separation of powers among the three branches of the Federal Government. In two rulings overturning two major Federal laws, the Court read the Constitution as limiting the authority that Congress had assumed it possessed.
In the first case, City of Boerne v. Flores, No. 95-2074, the Court by 6 to 3 declared unconstitutional the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a law intended to guarantee religious observance a higher level of statutory protection than the Court, ruling in a previous case, had thought constitutionally necessary.
In his majority opinion, Justice Kennedy said that while Congress had the power under the 14th Amendment to remedy or prevent civil rights violations, it lacked authority to make a substantive change in the meaning of the Constitution.
Justices O'Connor, Souter and Breyer dissented. Significantly, however, they did not dispute the proposition that Congress cannot expand constitutional rights.
The Court's second blow to Congressional authority came in striking down a part of the Brady gun control law that required local law-enforcement officials to perform background checks on prospective handgun purchasers.
Justice Scalia's opinion for a 5-to-4 majority in Printz v. United States, No. 95-1478, said the provision violated "the very principle of separate state sovereignty," which he called "one of the Constitution's structural protections of liberty." Congress may not require states to help administer Federal programs, the Court said. Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Thomas, O'Connor and Kennedy joined the opinion.
The Court avoided, but probably only deferred, ruling on the constitutionality of the Line-Item Veto Act, which gives the President new authority to cancel parts of appropriations bills he signs into law. By a vote of 7 to 2, the Court said in an opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist that the half-dozen members of Congress who had challenged the new law as a diminution of their legislative power lacked sufficient concrete injury to give them legal standing to bring the suit. Justices Stevens and Breyer dissented in Raines v. Byrd, No. 96-1671.
The Court ruled 5 to 4 that states offering favorable tax treatment to charities cannot draw distinctions based on whether a charity serves primarily in-state or out-of-state clients. The decision, Camps Newfound/ Owatonna v. Harrison, No. 94-1988, struck down a Maine law that withheld tax-exempt status from organizations not serving a predominantly local population, in this case a religious camp with mostly out-of-state campers. Justice Stevens wrote the opinion, joined by Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter and Breyer.
 
Religion
The Court overruled a 1985 precedent that prohibited public-school teachers from teaching special federally financed remedial classes on the premises of parochial schools. Justice O'Connor's opinion in Agostini v. Felton, No. 96-552, was joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Kennedy, Scalia and Thomas; all five had been vocal critics of the earlier ruling, Aguilar v. Felton. The degree to which the latest decision opens the door to further government aid to parochial schools is subject to debate.
 
Free Speech
In an essentially unanimous opinion, the Court wrote a charter for free speech in cyberspace by declaring unconstitutional the Communications Decency Act, a 1996 Federal law that made it a crime to display "indecent" material on line in a manner that might make it available to minors. Justice Stevens wrote the opinion in Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, No. 96-511. Justice O'Connor and Chief Justice Rehnquist dissented in part.
Voting 5 to 4, the Court awarded a major victory to the broadcast television industry by upholding a Federal law that requires cable television systems to carry the signals of local over-the-air broadcast stations. The cable industry had challenged the 1992 law as requiring unconstitutional government-compelled speech. Justice Kennedy wrote the opinion, Turner Broadcasting v. Federal Communications Commission, No. 95-992, with the concurrence of Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Stevens, Souter and Breyer.
The Court voted 6 to 3 to uphold a lower court's order keeping demonstrators at least 15 feet from the doorways and driveways of several upstate New York abortion clinics. An anti-abortion group had challenged the injunction as an infringement on free speech. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the opinion, Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network, No. 95-1065. Justices Scalia, Kennedy and Thomas dissented. A separate part of the decision overturned, over Justice Breyer's solitary dissent, an order requiring demonstrators to stay 15 feet from people entering or leaving the clinics.
In a political-speech case, the Court ruled 6 to 3 that states were not constitutionally required to permit candidates to appear on more than one party's ballot line. The decision, Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, No. 95-1608, was a blow to minor parties, which are barred by nearly all states -- one notable exception being New York -- from gaining leverage by cross-endorsing other parties' candidates. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the opinion. Justices Stevens, Ginsburg and Souter dissented.
The Court narrowly upheld a New Deal-era Federal marketing law under which growers of various commodities, in this case certain California fruits, are required to contribute to generic advertising campaigns. Justice Stevens's majority opinion in Glickman v. Wileman Bros., No. 95-1184, said the law was an unexceptional form of economic regulation, rather than compelled speech as some growers had argued and a lower court found. Justices Kennedy, O'Connor, Ginsburg and Breyer joined the opinion.
 
Civil Rights
The Court voted 5 to 4 to uphold a court-ordered redistricting plan that shrank the number of majority-black Congressional districts in Georgia from three to one. Justice Kennedy's opinion in Abrams v. Johnson, No. 95-1425, said that to create any additional districts with black majorities would demonstrate an impermissible consciousness of race. Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices O'Connor, Scalia and Thomas joined the opinion, a forceful reiteration of the majority's rejection of race-based districting.
 
Due Process
In perhaps the most closely watched case of the year, the Court ruled 9 to 0, with a majority opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, that there is no general right to doctor-assisted suicide under the constitutional guarantee of due process. But in separate opinions, five Justices suggested that in a future case, they may find that terminally ill people in intractable pain have a more narrowly framed right to a doctor's assistance in ending their suffering by hastening death.
The decision, Washington v. Glucksberg, No. 96-110, upheld Washington's prohibition on assisted suicide. In a companion ruling, Vacco v. Quill, No. 95-1858, dealing with New York's law, the Court rejected by the same vote a challenge that was based on the constitutional guarantee of equal protection.
A 5-to-4 decision upheld a Kansas law, the Sexually Violent Predator Act, which permits the state to confine certain violent sex offenders in mental hospitals after they have served their criminal sentences. The Kansas Supreme Court had found the law to violate the Constitution's due process guarantee. That ruling was overturned in Kansas v. Hendricks, No. 95-1649. Justice Thomas wrote the decision and was joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices O'Connor, Kennedy and Scalia.
The Court ruled 6 to 3 that states cannot erect financial barriers that keep poor people from appealing judicial decisions terminating their legal relationship with their children. The decision, M.L.B. v. S.L.J., No. 95-853, overturned a ruling by the Mississippi Supreme Court that refused to allow an appeal by a mother who could not pay $2,000 for an official trial transcript. Justice Ginsburg wrote the decision. Justice Thomas, Justice Scalia and Chief Justice Rehnquist dissented.
 
Criminal Law
While numerous, criminal cases did not occupy a particularly prominent place on the Court's docket. In two decisions, the Court upheld the police in encounters with people in cars.
The Court ruled unanimously that once the police have stopped a car for a traffic infraction, they may go on to request the driver's permission to search for drugs without first informing him that he is, in fact, free to decline the search and go on his way. The Ohio Supreme Court had required the police to provide that information. The case was Ohio v. Robinette, No. 95-891.
And the Court ruled 7 to 2 that the police may routinely order passengers out of a car when the driver has been pulled over for an ordinary traffic violation. The police need not suspect that the passenger has committed a crime or presents a danger, Chief Justice Rehnquist said in Maryland v. Wilson, No. 95-1268. Justices Stevens and Kennedy dissented.
Striking down a government drug-testing program for the first time, the Court ruled 8 to 1 that a Georgia law requiring candidates for public office to be tested and certified drug-free violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches. Justice Ginsburg wrote the opinion, Chandler v. Miller, No. 96-126, and Chief Justice Rehnquist dissented.
The Court ruled 5 to 4 that Congress did not intend a 1996 Federal law, which makes it much harder for state prison inmates to file habeas corpus petitions in Federal court, to apply retroactively to inmates who already had petitions pending. Justice Souter wrote the opinion, Lindh v. Murphy, No. 96-6298, joined by Justices O'Connor, Stevens, Ginsburg and Breyer.
The Court ruled unanimously in Richards v. Wisconsin, No. 96-5955, that states may not carve out a blanket exception for drug searches from the general Fourth Amendment rule that requires the police to knock and announce their presence before executing a search warrant.
Voting 5 to 4, the Court upheld a Virginia man's death sentence while acknowledging that the 1988 sentencing proceeding was unconstitutional under a later Supreme Court decision in a separate case. Jurors in Joseph R. O'Dell's case never learned that if they rejected the state's request for the death penalty, Mr. O'Dell would never be released but would instead serve life in prison without parole. Justice Thomas wrote the majority opinion in O'Dell v. Netherland, No. 96-6867. Justice Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer dissented.
 
Liability
The Justices set aside a landmark $1.3 billion class-action settlement of current and future claims against former asbestos manufacturers, ruling 6 to 2 that the agreement did not meet Federal requirements for protecting the legal interests of the diverse group of plaintiffs. Justice Ginsburg wrote the opinion in Amchem Products v. Windsor, No. 96-270. Justices Breyer and Stevens dissented, and Justice O'Connor did not participate.
The Court ruled that railroad workers who had been exposed to asbestos on the job but showed no signs of illness were not entitled to damages under a Federal liability law. Justice Breyer wrote the opinion, Metro-North v. Buckley, No. 96-320. Justices Ginsburg and Stevens dissented from a part of the ruling.
The Court ruled 5 to 4 that employees of private companies that run prisons under contract to state and local governments are not entitled to the partial immunity from prisoner lawsuits that shields publicly employed prison guards. Justice Breyer wrote the opinion in Richardson v. McKnight, No. 96-318, joined by Justices O'Connor, Stevens, Souter and Ginsburg.
 
Environment
The Court unanimously interpreted the Endangered Species Act to permit lawsuits not only by people who think the Government is doing too little to protect endangered species but also by those who think that Federal regulation has gone too far. The decision, Bennett v. Spear, No. 95-813, opens the door to suits against Federal regulators by business interests and affected property owners.
The Court backed the Federal Government in a long-running boundary dispute with Alaska. The 6-to-3 ruling, United States v. Alaska, No. 84 Original, had the effect of extending Federal environmental protection to coastal areas, deemed under the decision to be Federal territory, where Alaska had intended to drill for oil and natural gas. Justice O'Connor wrote the opinion. Justice Thomas, Justice Scalia and Chief Justice Rehnquist dissented.
 
Securities Law
In the most important securities law ruling in years, the Court gave a major victory to the Securities and Exchange Commission in upholding its expansive view of insider trading. Under the 6-to-3 decision, United States v. O'Hagan, No. 96-842, a person can be guilty of insider trading even in the absence of a formal connection to the company whose stock he is buying. Justice Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion. Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Thomas and Scalia dissented.

HEADLINE: New York and New Jersey Battle Anew Over Business

BYLINE: By ROY FURCHGOTT 

 BODY:
Shortly after Gov. Christine Todd Whitman took office in 1994, she and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani agreed to end the economic border war that has always plagued their two governments. New York promised not to steal companies away from New Jersey, and New Jersey said it would keep its hands off New York.
All was relatively quiet until this spring, when New Yorkers woke up to ads promoting the Garden State. 
 Bristling at the New Jersey ad campaign, which city officials claim enticed companies to relocate across the Hudson, New York retaliated with ads of its own, threatening to ignite the economic tug of war that the two sides had hoped to avoid.
New Jersey officials said that they were confounded by New York's response. They said that their ads were part of a national campaign and were not aimed at their neighbor, even though the ads often appeared in the New York market programs like "Good Morning America" and "Today."
"Is this poaching? Not in the least," said Peter McDonough, a spokesman for Governor Whitman. "We are just extolling the virtues of New Jersey."
But New York sees the ads as an act of bad faith.
"We view this as a violation of our no-poaching agreement," said Russell A. Harding, executive vice president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation. "We could not let this go without a response."
The $1 million New Jersey campaign, which was scheduled to end yesterday, aired on New York and Philadelphia radio and television stations. The television ads showed scenic shots of the state while an announcer said, "New Jersey has always been about growth. And not just on our million acres of farmland. New Jersey's growth is also evident by the thriving businesses that call the Garden State home. So if you're looking to relocate or expand your business, find out how New Jersey provides the ideal business climate."
The New Jersey ads infuriated New York officials. In April, when Charles Millard, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, heard that New Jersey was planning the campaign, he confronted Governor Whitman at a business breakfast where she was the guest speaker. Governor Whitman, after all, had seemed upbeat about the no-poaching agreement when it was reached in 1994. "It's in the best interests of my state and New York to work together," she said then.
So at the breakfast, Mr. Millard said he asked her if New Jersey was moving ahead with its ad campaign and, if so, was that not a violation of their agreement. Mr. Millard said the Governor told him that the ads would run nationally and were not aimed at New York.
Mr. Millard had his doubts. The city was already wary of New Jersey because of letters the state had sent New York businesses offering tax breaks.
When the Economic Development Corporation confirmed that the New Jersey ads would run in New York, Mr. Millard said he gave the go-ahead to begin the city campaign, which also cost about $1 million.
The city's ads, narrated by the actor Tony Roberts, were produced in less than six weeks by Partners & Shevack, a Manhattan advertising agency. The ads highlight the advantages of doing business in New York and ran on essentially the same shows as the New Jersey ads.
New Jersey officials said that it was all a misunderstanding, starting with what Governor Whitman said at that breakfast. Mr. McDonough said the Governor had actually told Mr. Millard that the ads would run outside of the New York metro area, not that it was a national campaign.
"Philadelphia qualifies as outside the New York metro area," Mr. McDonough said.
And he said that the state could not help that the ads ran in New York. Job retention was also an aim of the campaign, but because New Jersey receives network broadcasts primarily from New York and Philadelphia stations, Mr. McDonough said the ads had to be placed in both markets in order to reach New Jersey business owners.
Mr. McDonough also said the letters to businesses that New York finds threatening are part of a business expansion program that gives a tax rebate to companies that create or bring new jobs to the state. He said New York was not targeted with letters but that some city businesses contacted New Jersey, requesting information about the program.
New Jersey says it has no plans to run the ad campaign again, and officials say they feel the 1994 agreement is still in place.
New York, however, is not so sure. Mr. Millard said that he would wait to see what New Jersey does next. "New York will do what it has to do to protect jobs."
Randy M. Mastro, a Deputy Mayor of New York, would not say if the city considered the no-poaching agreement dead. Then he said, "In the final analysis, New Jersey is still New Jersey and New York is the business capital of the world."

HEADLINE: The Crown's Last Jewel

 BODY:
Not just a colony ceased to exist as Hong Kong reverted to China early today. An entire imperial epoch all but came to an end, fittingly and with Britain's sure sense of ceremony. The Prince of Wales spoke the right words and saluted as the Union Jack was lowered. The colony's last governor took the prescribed final rides around Government House. Defying drenching rain, bagpipes skirled and Gurkha officers barked their commands for parting precision drill.
The eclipse of empire inherent in the ceremony was foreseen with uncanny intuition a hundred years ago in a poem of hypnotic cadences by the 32-year-old Rudyard Kipling. The poem was "Recessional," written for a very different occasion, Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, and published in The Times of London on July 17, 1897. Unlike all the other celebratory words, Kipling's lines were steeped in pessimism and sternly warned against the "frantic boast and foolish word." 
 Britain in 1897 was the world's sole superpower, mistress of an enormous empire extending "over palm and pine." This was the age of New Imperialism, when most Europeans, and indeed most Americans as well, were gripped by the half-examined belief that the West had the right and duty to rule the rest. Hence the shock when Kipling, the bard of Empire, gazed beyond the Jubilee to a time when the captains and kings would depart:
Far called, our navies melt away;
On dune and headland sinks the fire:
Lo, all our pomp of yesterday
Is one with Nineveh and Tyre!
For Kipling, a romantic, the British Empire was not just about profits or splotches of red on the map. The rulers were bound by honor to serve those they ruled, and they were beholden to the Lord of Hosts and Judge of Nations. By today's standards his vision may be wrongheaded, condescending and foolish, but it was not hypocritical. In fair measure Britain did nurture overseas belief in rules, fair play and free speech.
Hong Kong's Chinese rulers will understandably dwell on the evils of colonialism. But a decent respect for truth requires an acknowledgment that Britain's legacy also includes Hong Kong's yearning for democracy and its material prosperity. As of early today, as Kipling foresaw, the empire now lives mainly in history.

HEADLINE: HONG KONG, CHINA: THE OUTLOOK;
Year of the Trojan Horse

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Tuesday, July 1

 BODY:
As dawn rises for the first time over red Chinese flags officially fluttering here in a capitalist breeze, the most fascinating question is not how China will change Hong Kong but how Hong Kong will change China -- and the world beyond.
At stake is not just the fate of the 6.3 million people who live here but, more important, the 1.2 billion neighbors next door in China, plus the 20 million who live in Taiwan and the hundreds of millions more who live elsewhere in the region. 
 To an enormous extent, many of the critical issues of the 21st century will depend in part on how events unfold in this peculiar crossroads of scones and dim sum.
Whether the United States and China are headed for partnership or for conflict, whether Taiwan will eventually become independent or return to China's embrace, whether China will grow strong and democratic or collapse in chaos -- all these will be determined in part by what happens in Hong Kong.
The central question is whether Hong Kong amounts to a colossal Trojan horse: a prize so glorious that China's Communists cannot leave it outside the gates but which, once inside, will destroy those in power.
Indeed, looking at the way Hong Kong and China have influenced each other in the last dozen years, one could easily conclude that the hand-wringing over Hong Kong's future is misplaced. No one has ever made money betting against Hong Kong, though many have tried, and perhaps it is the Chinese Communist Party leaders who should tremble about whether their style of life and leadership can long survive.
"I think the democratic struggle of people here in Hong Kong for freedom and human rights will influence China," mused Han Dongfang, a Chinese labor leader who was imprisoned for trying to organize an independent union during the 1989 Tiananmen democracy movement and is now in exile in Hong Kong. "The Hong Kong handover will push the system in China and make the change go forward faster."
Mr. Han and others suggest that many mainland Chinese will be frustrated that their fellow Chinese citizens in Hong Kong have the right to criticize the Communist Party, to demonstrate, to form independent unions, while they themselves have none of these rights. For his part, Mr. Han thinks this gap will sow discontent throughout China.
"Chinese workers will think that 'one country, two systems' means 'one country, two classes of citizens,' " Mr. Han said. "I think this will have a big impact."
The notion that tiny Hong Kong could reshape China is conceivable only because Hong Kong arguably has always been more important as an idea than as a place. For decades it has served as an example of prosperity and a model of economic and political laissez-faire, a catalyst for troubling reflections.
"How was it that foreigners, the Englishmen, could do so much as they had done with the barren rock of Hong Kong within 70 or 80 years, while in 4,000 years China had no place like Hong Kong," Sun Yat-sen, one of the founders of modern China, asked in a commencement speech in Hong Kong in 1923.
Hong Kong's influence over China has never been greater than in the last 20 years. In many ways it was the example of Hong Kong's success that helped inspire China to launch its "second revolution," which since 1978 has transformed the most populous nation on earth.
Tiny Hong Kong furnishes 58 percent of the foreign investment in China. But, more important, by its very existence and success it undermined the legitimacy of China's old economic system and ideology. In a nation that under Maoism was a moral monolith, Hong Kong suddenly emerged as a separate wellspring of legitimacy and an alternative arbiter of fashion and relevancy.
The image of the Communist Party is of earnest old men sitting in Mao jackets holding self-criticism sessions. The image of Hong Kong is of young people in silk and linen, speaking on cellular phones as they drive off to dates. It is no wonder that the Communist Party is in trouble.
Now many people expect that Hong Kong will continue to reshape China, but from within.
"A China with us in its belly is not the same as a China without us," wrote Nury Vittachi, a columnist for The South China Morning Post. "The best analogy I can think of is that Hong Kong is a bran tablet. These things are small and inoffensive when you take them, but they kind of invisibly expand in your stomach when they are in there, and have a beneficial effect."
Yet while the impact of Hong Kong, and of time, may well be corrosive to traditional Communist Party ideology and dictatorship, it could help stimulate a revitalization of the party and of China itself.
"It is quite possible that out of this process will emerge not a weaker Chinese state but a stronger Chinese state, a state that is strengthened by having a greater sense of legitimacy, led by people who are more cosmopolitan and more responsive to the yearnings of their people," said Michel Oksenberg, an Asia expert at Stanford University.
"The Communist Party is an institution that in my opinion does need revitalization," he said. "But in a curious way, the absorption of Hong Kong could help revitalize it. It could also prompt its decay."
Still, not everyone thinks that Hong Kong will have much impact on China's political system, in part because the Chinese leadership is so adamant about stopping the buds of political pluralism before they even sprout.
"Hong Kong will change China," said Robin Munro, the head of the Hong Kong office of Human Rights Watch. "I'm sure we'll see more venality and appetite for money-making. But I doubt that this means more democracy and liberalism. My biggest anxiety is that I believe that China will probably change some of the assumptions of political science in the West." The theory that economic liberalization leads to political pluralism may be valid in much of the world, Mr. Munro said, but perhaps not in Asia.
Most analysts predict that China in 20 years' time will look more like Hong Kong today than Hong Kong will look like China today -- economically, politically or socially -- but some point to history as a warning of a more unsettling possibility.
With its gray, dilapidated buildings, the eastern Chinese port of Weihai today looks just like any other Chinese city, and that is precisely why it is a nightmare for people in Hong Kong.
Britain acquired the port, then known as Weihaiwei, in 1898 at the same time that it gained the biggest chunk of Hong Kong, the New Territories. For the next few decades, it was a flourishing British enclave, a modest version of Hong Kong.
Then in 1930, Britain returned Weihai to China, after getting guarantees that China would give the enclave special status and autonomy. Those guarantees proved worthless, and Chinese officials soon canceled Weihai's status as a free port and raised taxes. Investors fled, and it was quickly swallowed up by the immensity of China without leaving even a ripple behind.
The handover of Hong Kong will also reverberate across the Taiwan Strait, with far-reaching implications for all of East Asia.
Some Chinese officials have said that as the country recovers Hong Kong this year and the nearby Portuguese enclave of Macao in 1999, it must now focus on the final act of national reunification: the merger with Taiwan.
So some experts fear that Beijing will become more impatient with Taiwan, perhaps eventually using military force to settle the issue once and for all. If Hong Kong thrives, China's leaders will undoubtedly argue that they are the reasonable ones and that it is Taiwan's rulers who are being petty and paranoid, perhaps leading Western countries to put pressure on Taiwan to discuss a return to Beijing's rule.
"That's the nightmare scenario for the Taiwanese," said Steven M. Goldstein, a China scholar at Smith College.
Concerned about that possibility, Taiwan officials go out of their way to emphasize that they are not ready to follow Hong Kong down the aisle.
"Hong Kong is no precedent for Taiwan, even if 'one country, two systems' can work, and that's a big if," said Parris Chang, a member of Taiwan's legislature.
Mr. Chang added that while success in Hong Kong would not lead to reunification any time soon, failure would have historic implications. "If Hong Kong goes badly," he said, "any chance that China may have of appealing to Taiwan for peaceful reunification will be gone forever."
Developments in Hong Kong will also shape relations between China and the West, particularly with the United States and Britain. Human rights in Hong Kong are already emerging as another focal point for United States-China relations, and any crackdown there could trigger a serious downward spiral in relations between Washington and Beijing.
In the United States, the public and Congress already react angrily to suppression of freedoms in Tibet or Beijing, and the recriminations are sure to be incomparably greater if the people dragged off to prison are not unknown workers but the likes of Martin C. M. Lee, the distinguished Hong Kong lawyer and democracy campaigner who has held discussions with President Clinton at the White House.
Yet for all the exploration of worst-case scenarios that is common these days, another possibility is that Beijing will keep its hands off Hong Kong and that the territory will thrive as a Chinese city. That would soothe Chinese-American relations and make it easier for Washington and Beijing to cooperate in addressing fundamental challenges of the next century.
"Hong Kong can project to the world a very different kind of China," Professor Goldstein said, "a China that is willing to tolerate different groups of Chinese, a China that is willing to keep its word, a China that is willing to allow the people of Hong Kong, within limits, to carve out their own lives. If a vibrant, pluralist kind of society begins to emerge, I think that that's going to change people's views of what China is."

HEADLINE: Clinton Outlines Tax Cut Plan, Putting Emphasis on Education

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
President Clinton laid out his plan today for divvying up $135 billion in tax cuts over the next five years, bending to Republican demands for a broad reduction in taxes on investment gains but shifting money away from the wealthiest families and toward his cherished higher education programs.
Arriving as Congress prepares to grapple with precisely how to substantially cut Federal taxes for the first time in 16 years, the plan was less a line in the sand than a formal statement of the President's bargaining position. After this week's recess, House and Senate negotiators are to hammer out a joint version of the tax cut plans that each passed last week, trying to arrive at a bill that Mr. Clinton will sign. 
 The President sharply criticized the Congressional tax cut plans today. "They do an inadequate job of opening the doors to college," he said at the White House this morning, before departing on a political fund-raising trip to Boston and New York. "They direct far too little relief to the middle class. They include time-bomb tax cuts that threaten to explode the deficit."
Unlike the Congressional plans, Mr. Clinton's proposal would mean a tiny reduction or even an increase in capital gains taxes for the richest taxpayers, while people with capital gains and incomes under $100,000 would see significant savings. [Page A17.]
Mr. Clinton also accused Republicans of backing away from commitments in the budget agreement to provide tax incentives to revive inner cities.
But he joined in the bipartisan optimism about an eventual deal, declining to say what proposals he would rule out. "I don't want to get into veto now," he said.
Although some Congressional Republicans suggested that he was acting a bit late, party members generally strove today for a magnanimous tone, congratulating Mr. Clinton for adopting what they called their ideas.
"Putting some differences aside, the President deserves credit and praise for joining with Republicans in endorsing our approach to tax relief," said Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
Mr. Clinton and Republican Congressional leaders came to terms on a broad tax and spending package in May, but they are now getting down to filling in the details.
On tax cuts, wide gaps still separate the White House and Congressional plans. For example, Mr. Clinton said that he would support a broad reduction in the tax on capital gains, for years a Republican grail. But while the Senate, and particularly the House, have called for deep reductions in such rates for all investors, Mr. Clinton is offering smaller cuts, structured so that less-wealthy investors receive more of the benefits.
Under Mr. Clinton's plan, investors in the highest tax bracket would see their capital gains tax rates drop to only 27.7 percent from 28 percent, while taxpayers in lower brackets would receive far bigger cuts. It may be tricky for the Republicans to argue that the President is giving too little relief to the wealthiest Americans.
Still, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin indicated today that he would prefer not to cut capital gains rates at all, saying the predominant view among academics was that such a move was "unlikely to produce much economic benefit."
But, Mr. Rubin said, the Administration wanted to develop a plan that "recognizes the views of others."
In scheduling the announcement of the tax cut plan today, Mr. Clinton's aides settled on a week when Congress was out of town, so the President could dominate the news and be seen as taking the initiative.
Further, by adopting some Republican ideas, Mr. Clinton seems above the partisan fray, one senior Administration official said.
In his plan, Mr. Clinton embraced the Congressional proposal to offer a $500 credit to families for each child who is up to 17 years old. He had previously said he did not support extending such credits when the children were older than 13.
But the President would phase out the credit for families making $60,000 to $70,000 a year until 2000, and after that for families making $80,000 to $90,000 a year. Both the House and Senate plans would phase out the credit for couples making more than $110,000.
With the money denied wealthier taxpayers, Mr. Clinton would make the credit partially "refundable." That is, he would permit low-income workers who have no Federal tax liability to claim part or all of the credit. They would be able to use the credit to offset the amount of money deducted from their paychecks for their portion -- but not for their employers' share -- of Social Security and Medicare taxes.
The provision regarding payroll taxes amounted to a strategic retreat from Mr. Clinton's earlier position, which was that the credit should be fully refundable, regardless of a worker's Social Security taxes. Republicans had attacked that as a form of welfare, providing tax relief to people who paid none.
The new approach "should kill any notion that these are welfare payments," one senior Administration official said.
In an illustration of how topsy-turvy budget politics can be, Mr. Clinton seized today on a proposal in the Senate bill to raise taxes on cigarettes, partly to pay for children's health care. He said that he supported devoting to children's health all the proceeds of the additional 20-cent tax on a pack of cigarettes, to 44 cents. But in May, Mr. Clinton helped kill a bill to institute such a tax for the same purpose, fearing that Republicans would insist that it violated the budget agreement.
At first blush, Mr. Clinton's plan appears less likely to drive up the budget deficit, said Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research institute whose statistical studies are generally respected here.
"It looks like, at first glance, this package doesn't suffer from the explosive growth after 2007 that the House and Senate plans do," he said.
Mr. Greenstein pointed out that, according to the Administration's numbers, the wealthiest 20 percent of taxpayers would receive almost as much of Mr. Clinton's tax cut as the bottom 60 percent. That is "an unusual pattern for a tax cut plan proposed by a Democratic President," he said. But, he added, the Congressional plans were far more heavily weighted to the wealthiest fifth of the population.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "AT A GLANCE: How the President Proposes to Reduce Taxes"
Following are the major provisions of the tax cut plan proposed yesterday by President Clinton:
 
* CHILD CREDIT: A per-child credit, starting at $400 in 1998 and rising to $500 the next year. It would cover children under age 17 through 2002 and children under 19 after 2002. It would be phased out for families making $60,000 to $75,000 a year until 2000, when the income limit would rise to $80,000 to $100,000 a year. The credit would offset the family's Federal income tax liability plus the employee's portion of Social Security and other payroll taxes.
Eligible taxpayers would be able to contribute the credit plus up to an additional $500 a year to a new educational savings account. The money would accumulate interest tax free and could be withdrawn tax free if used for the child's education, a first-time home purchase or retirement.
The plan would benefit fewer middle- to upper-income families than the Congressional versions, which have higher income limits, but it would be more generous to lower-income families. Its savings feature is similar to one in the Senate bill.
Cost: $70.2 billion over 5 years, $176.1 billion over 10 years.
 
 * COLLEGE TUITION: A credit of up to $1,500 a year for the first two years of college, starting in 1998. Students could receive a 100 percent credit for the first $1,000 in tuition and book expenses, and then a 50 percent credit for up to another $1,000. Eligibility would be phased out for families with incomes starting at $80,000. The credit could be taken for expenses after accounting for Federal tuition grants. After 2002, the credit would increase to a maximum of $2,000.
The plan also includes a credit of up to $1,000 a year for the third and fourth years of undergraduate expenses, plus graduate school and courses taken by working people. The credit would increase to $2,000 after 2000.
The plan is more generous to students than the House and Senate versions.
Cost: $34.5 billion over 5 years, $94.1 billion over 10 years.
 
 * CAPITAL GAINS: Taxpayers could exclude 30 percent of their long-term gains from taxation. The proposal would reduce the top rate on capital gains, currently 28 percent, only fractionally, to 27.7 percent, for taxpayers in the highest income bracket. The plan would include an exemption on gains from the sale of a primary home up to $500,000 for joint filers and special provisions for investment in small businesses.
By limiting the reduction for top-rate taxpayers, the Clinton plan would cost the Treasury less in later years than the House and Senate versions, which would reduce the top rate to 20 percent for all income groups. The House version would allow investors to subtract the effects of inflation in calculating their gains.
Cost: $7.1 billion over 5 years, $15.6 billion over 10.
 
 * INHERITANCE TAXES: Would create an exclusion from Federal estate taxes of $900,000 for family owned businesses or farms, in addition to the current $600,000 exemption for a single filer on all estates.
The House version would raise the overall exemption to $1 million from $600,000. The Senate version would do the same and would provide an additional $1 million exemption for family owned businesses and farms.
Cost: $2.3 billion over 5 years, $7.2 billion over 10. (pg. A16)

HEADLINE: HONG KONG, CHINA: IN NEW YORK;
Chinese-Americans Rejoice, Dropping Politics for a Party

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
In June 1989, Chris Chan was one of thousands of Chinese to hit the streets of New York, protesting Beijing's crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. Yesterday, Mr. Chan returned to the streets to march for a different reason: to celebrate the return of Hong Kong to China.
"This is above the politics," said Mr. Chan, who was holding a red-and-yellow banner representing the Chinese Progressive Association, a social services organization in Manhattan. "I will still fight for democracy in China, but today we are all proud to be Chinese." 
 Mr. Chan could well have been speaking for the thousands of other overseas Chinese in New York and other urban pockets around the country who hoisted flags, sang songs and chanted slogans to celebrate the transfer of Hong Kong from British colonial to Chinese Communist rule.
As the clock struck midnight in Hong Kong, many Chinese around the world seemed to be sharing the same reaction: Blood is thicker than ideology.
For Chinese celebrating in New York, it did not matter that the actual event was happening 12 time zones away. It did not matter that the transfer would probably have no immediate social or economic impact on their own Americanized lives. What mattered, at least for a day, was a chance to swell with pride and identify with the land from which they sprang.
"We've been waiting 156 years for this," said C.H. Hua, a Taiwanese-American who was a part of the Committee to Celebrate the Return of Hong Kong, which organized the Manhattan event. "No matter if they live in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, or wherever in the world, Chinese culture is inclusive."
There were some exceptions, including plans for pro-democracy protests outside Chinese diplomatic stations in Vancouver and Toronto. And in New York, there was a brief shoving match between parade-goers and one pro-Taiwan resident who made several sarcastic remarks about China's track record.
There were also some who deliberately stayed away. "I don't trust the Chinese Government," said Amy Lee, a 30-year-old assistant manager of a photo studio in Flushing. "The Communists don't keep their word."
But for the most part, the celebrations went smoothly, even quietly. In San Francisco, there were speeches at a hotel breakfast for executives. In Boston, about 1,000 people signed up for a banquet in Chinatown. In Los Angeles, there were plans for a series of breakfasts, luncheons and dinners to commemorate the occasion.
In New York, a crowd of more than 4,000 people arrived early yesterday morning to watch folk dancing and pick up any one of three flags readily available: China, Hong Kong and the United States. No Taiwan flags, however, were on display.
At 11:30, the Hong Kong flag -- red, with a pinwheel-like swirl of five white leaves pierced by small red stars -- was raised in front of the statue of Confucius in Confucian Plaza. At 11:45 the marchers started on the Bowery, curled up Canal, then waited for the noon hour before turning left onto Mott Street, the heart of Chinatown.
Behind the police barricades, a mostly Chinese crowd clapped their hands, shouted "Long live the Chinese people!" and snapped pictures with their automatic cameras. Above, groups of people jammed fire escapes or poked their heads out of second-story offices and factories.
On the street, the marchers banged cymbals and drums. One float featured a picture of I.M. Pei's Bank of China building in downtown Hong Kong; another had a picture of the late Deng Xiaoping, the man who was the architect of the 1984 deal that secured Hong Kong's fate.
In some ways, Mr. Deng almost seemed omnipresent yesterday. When asked about Hong Kong's future, parade participants repeated key phrases from the Chinese-British accord such as "a high degree of autonomy" and "one country, two systems."
Sharon Poon, who immigrated from Guangzhou, China, nine years ago, was typical of the crowd. She was wearing a T-shirt that said, in both English and Chinese: "147 Years Dictatorship + 3 Years Democracy = 150 Years H.K. Colonial History."
"It's more natural to see Hong Kong go back to the Motherland," she said. "Something belonged to us. It was taken away. Now we get it back."

HEADLINE: THE STOCK MARKETS;
For Stocks, Quarter Was One of the Most Bullish

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Three months ago, investors were worried about the Big One.
The stock market was sinking fast, headed toward its worst setback since 1990. And bearish strategists, many of whom had long forecast an end to one of the greatest bull markets in history, were gloating. 
 Then the market stormed back, and in the quarter that ended yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 16.5 percent, its largest second-quarter gain since 1938, and the fifth-largest gain for any quarter since the end of World War II.
Indeed, at the closing bell yesterday, the Dow stood at 7,672.79, about 1,200 points ahead of where it began the year. For the day, the Dow fell 14.93 points, but by registering a gain in the quarter just ended, it has now risen in 10 consecutive quarters for the first time since the early 1950's.
"It's astonishing," said Byron R. Wien, the United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley. "At the beginning of the year, many were apprehensive because we'd had two good years in a row, and almost invariably the third year was down. But the fact is we're having a great year."
Few Wall Street analysts, however, expect the pace to continue. Indeed, many think that the Dow will close the year less than where it is now, which is considerably higher than it was when Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, first suggested in December that the market may have been infected with "irrational exuberance."
Still, Wall Street and Main Street are exhilarated at the kind of year unfolding. What makes the run impressive is that it has come at a time when many strategists would have been pleased with a 10 percent gain at year's end. But for the last six months, investors and strategists alike have been dazzled by a stock market that has done nothing less than rewrite the history books.
All the major stock indexes have set records this year. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks closed at 885.14 points yesterday, down 2.16 for the day but just 13 points off its closing high. And, while they trail the blue-chip averages, the Nasdaq composite and Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks have also set records.
And the Dow -- the most widely followed market indicator -- has already set 28 new closing highs. In all of last year, it reached a new high 44 times on its way to a 26 percent gain. So far this year, the Dow is up 19 percent.
Of course, this year's gains have not come without volatility or a steep downturn: The Dow has had 18 closings with moves of more than 100 points and the sharpest decline in more than six years -- a four-week drop of 9.8 percent -- ended on April 11.
But many investors continue to see stocks as the best investment vehicle available, and keep pouring billions of dollars into mutual funds.
Indeed, mutual fund managers are talking these days about investors who say they are holding off buying a dream house to invest in the market, and others who expect nothing less than a 15 percent annual return.
"There's a quantum leap in expectations occurring here," said Robert Farrell, a market analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company. "Usually when you get a market so convincing, the people who are not in find a way to buy into a market that's already up a lot. They find reasons why it's going to go up a lot more."
And even while some on Wall Street warn about the dangers of expecting such outsized returns, a cadre of bullish strategists now speak of a Dow at 8,250 by year-end, a Dow at 10,000 by the year 2000 -- even a Dow at 15,000.
Such euphoria has been fueled this year by what many consider an ideal economic environment, one characterized by stronger-than-expected growth, lower-than-expected inflationary pressure and high profit margins.
Interest rates are also stable, and the price of gold -- traditionally seen as a key indicator of coming inflation -- has hit a four-year low.
That bodes well for one of the greatest bull markets in history, one whose longevity and explosive returns continue to astound even seasoned observers.
In three years, for instance, the Dow has more than doubled, soaring 112 percent -- an annual rate of better than 37 percent, or three times faster than its historical average.
This year, a third of the Dow's 30 component stocks are up 28 percent or better, led by Wal-Mart Stores, a Dow newcomer this year, which is up 49 percent, and Caterpillar, an old-timer, up 43 percent.
Technology companies -- a growing segment of the marketplace -- trail the broader market this year, but three standouts are noteworthy.
Microsoft is now the fourth-richest stock in terms of market capitalization. Shares of Microsoft are selling at $126 each, up 53 percent this year. That puts the company's worth at $151 billion -- more than Disney, McDonald's and Gillette, combined.
Dell Computer is also having a spectacular run, up 121 percent this year. And Lucent Technology, the AT&T spinoff, is up 56 percent.
AT&T, though, has struggled. Bitten by fierce competition and, in recent days, failed merger talks with SBC Communications, AT&T continues to be the worst-performing Dow stock, down 15 percent this year.
The best-performing segments have been health care, drug and financial stocks. Warner-Lambert, the drug maker, is up 66 percent; Merrill Lynch 46 percent. Among the worst sectors: gambling and utilities.
Among all Big Board stocks, NS Group, a holding company for steel-product makers, was the best-performing issue of the quarter, up 6 1/4, to 11 3/8, a gain of 122 percent. Chesapeake Energy, an Oklahoma-based oil and natural gas producer, was the worst performer, down 11 3/4, to 9 1/8 -- a drop of 56.3 percent.
The market's outlook for the rest of the year is much the same. Inflation jitters have subsided; the economy remains robust and corporate profits are expected to be strong, according to Charles Hill, director of research at First Call Inc. in Boston.
Yet, in spite of the bullish sentiment, longtime analysts worry about the sustainability of this year's gains. Some warn that profit margins could shrink, others that interest rates could rise, and still others that the Federal Reserve may disrupt the parade on Wall Street.
Even among the optimists, few expect the Dow to have a blockbuster second half. Abby Joseph Cohen, the bullish strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, has moderated her position, arguing that while the fundamentals are fantastic, more modest returns are in store.
"We used to be exuberantly bullish and now we're just bullish," she said yesterday. "I've tempered my enthusiasm. The returns going forward are going to be modest; for the time being, low-double-digit returns."
There are few obstacles to the current bull trend, but high valuations mean the market is no longer undervalued, she said -- and that translates into solid returns, not great returns.
Mr. Farrell at Merrill Lynch, however, went further, suggesting that serious trouble may lie ahead. Like the "parabolic markets" of 1929 and 1987, he warned, the current stock craze may be setting itself up for a steep fall.
"Those were the markets that went up in a persistent, consistent and insistent basis," he said. "You don't know how high they will go, but they don't go sideways when they end."

HEADLINE: Professors Must Now Make the Most of Life Without Tenure

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"The End of Tenure?" (Editorial Notebook, June 29), by Brent Staples, outlines the trend toward using more part-time and non-tenure-track faculty. This change presents two challenges. 
 First, can an increasingly temporary work force somehow become a purposeful and productive team -- and not just a less expensive one? I am optimistic because many who teach part time are experienced professionals and because enlightened institutions have created conditions under which they teach well.
Also, will tenured faculty and the American Association of University Professors recognize that we must initiate a dialogue on how to protect academic freedom while renegotiating the terms on which job security is based? Or will we be content to stand by while tenure and academic freedom are eroded by legislation, default and steady economic strangulation?

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL;
Ewing Negotiations Not Sure to Be Smooth

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
Patrick Ewing says he wants to stay. The team that drafted him 12 years ago is prepared to do what it can to keep him. All signs point to a quick and painless negotiation, ending with Ewing, the Knicks' franchise center, staying put until he retires.
But Dave Checketts, the president and chief executive officer of Madison Square Garden, has been in this predicament before. And when the subject of free agents getting exorbitant amounts of money arises, nothing is easy. 
 "I'm not going to worry about David Falk until he spits his mouthpiece out," Checketts said yesterday of Ewing's agent. "David Falk is a tough guy. He represents his clients well. Anyone that goes away thinking this is going to be easy, that would be a mistake."
Today is the first day of the National Basketball Association's free-agent signing period. For the moment, Ewing and the Bulls' Michael Jordan are already spoken for; their teams will try to pay them enough to re-sign. They are the two big names amid a lackluster crop of hired guns.
While Jordan will reportedly sign a one-year deal worth more than $35 million with the Chicago Bulls, Ewing, who will turn 35 in August, wants long-term security. He would like to sign a four- or five-year deal worth $15 million a season.
Falk, through a representative at his Washington-based office, said he did not plan to comment on negotiations until they have been completed. Legal maneuvering over the next few days could delay a settlement.
"I don't think Ernie feels like it's going to be easy," Checketts said of the Knicks' general manager, Ernie Grunfeld. "I don't think I feel that way. On the other hand, we're prepared to come to the table on July 1 with something I think Patrick will find very easy to take.
"I'm sure he will have other alternatives, but I think had we not made the changes we made the last year and brought in the players we brought in, he might feel differently at this point. I truly think he wants to come back here. And I think if we make it economic for him, we'll sign him."
The Knicks could offer Ewing a four-year, $60 million deal that would not hamper them in the future in terms of their salary cap. But a three-year deal might be more in line with Ewing's age and ability.
"We have looked at other players who have played that long," Checketts said. Referring to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, he said: "Kareem won a championship at that age and played beyond that. Moses Malone played a season beyond those kind of years. I think Patrick -- first of all, he takes great care of himself. My sense is he's going to be a very good player for a while."
But he added, "I think there are other teams out there that are just waiting for some breach of faith along the way."
While Ewing has the leverage, few teams can come up with a deal to pay the Knicks' center anywhere close to what he could make in New York. Detroit and Cleveland have salary-cap room and several other teams could rid themselves of several players via trades. But Ewing, who recently completed a six-year deal that paid him $36 million, is hours away from seeing the Knicks offer him an incredible sum.
"We know we're going to have to come to the table with something that's fair and probably on the aggressive side, too," Checketts said. He also added that the Garden's recent change of ownership, from ITT/ Cablevision to Cablevision exclusively, will not stand in the way of a deal.
 
REBOUNDS
 Knicks Coach JEFF VAN GUNDY's contract extension has been delayed for the moment. Van Gundy, who is close to securing a three-year deal with the club, is on jury duty and is scheduled to go on vacation Thursday. . . . Knicks guard SCOTT BROOKS is considering offers from teams in Italy, Spain and Greece. Brooks, a nine-year veteran, is not in New York's plans for next season.

Large Soybean Plantings Follow Changes in Rules

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
Freed from many Government restrictions, farmers are seeking to take advantage of a strong soybean market by planting the largest crop since 1982, the Agriculture Department reported today.
The 70.9 million acres of soybeans planted this spring is 10 percent larger than last year's acreage and the third largest on record. Twenty-eight of the 29 soybean-producing states have more acres planted than in 1996; only Ohio's soybean plantings remain the same. 
 Keith Collins, chief economist at the Agriculture Department, attributed the increase in part to a farm law passed last year by Congress that removed many requirements on what farmers could plant.
The legislation, the Freedom to Farm Act, allows farmers to respond to the marketplace, and soybeans are in strong demand worldwide. The crop has a wide variety of uses, from cooking oil to printer's ink.

HEADLINE: More Than 20 Years After Viking, Craft Is to Land, and Bounce, on Mars

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

DATELINE: PASADENA, Calif., June 30

 BODY:
Flat, desolate and dry as red dust, the flood plain of Ares Vallis hardly seems an inviting place to visit on Mars, but scientists think it may well be a reservoir of the planet's early history. So the American robot spacecraft Mars Pathfinder is headed there for a landing on Friday, the Fourth of July.
The spacecraft, launched last December, would be the first to reach the surface of Mars since the two Viking landings in the summer of 1976. Its success would somewhat compensate for the dismal record of several unsuccessful American and Russian attempts to explore Mars in the intervening years. 
 The new mission carries the added burden and promise of being the first to investigate the planet since the announcement last August of evidence in a meteorite suggesting that life may have existed on Mars sometime in its first billion years. Though inconclusive and much debated, the findings kindled public and scientific excitement over existing plans for a 10-year program of systematic Mars exploration, beginning with Mars Pathfinder and its companion, Mars Global Surveyor, scheduled to orbit the planet in September.
Neither spacecraft was designed -- or is expected -- to answer life-on-Mars questions. But the two could produce critical geochemical, climatic and mapping information on where to look for answers on future missions. Definitive evidence will probably come only with the return of Mars rock samples. The first such mission is planned for 2005.
So far, the landing prospects for Pathfinder look good. Its flight has been virtually trouble-free, and now the one-ton craft is within one million miles of the planet, closing in at 12,000 miles an hour. After a minor course correction last week, its aim appears to be true.
"Mars Pathfinder is very, very healthy," said Brian Muirhead, deputy project manager at the mission control center here at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "From launch on, she's done everything we've asked her to do."
Over the last week or so, ground controllers completed final checks on the condition of the spacecraft and its main cargo, a 22-pound, six-wheel roving vehicle the size of a microwave oven. After touchdown, the rover, named Sojourner, is to roll out and begin at least a week of remotely controlled excursions to take close-up pictures of rocks and analyze their chemical composition.
It will be the first time a roving vehicle has explored the surface of another planet. In the first days, the rover will probably not wander more than 30 or 40 feet from the lander, picking its way carefully at a rate of two feet a minute. Later, it may be sent off on excursions several hundred feet from the lander.
"All systems looked fine," Mr. Muirhead said after the tests. "We turned on the rover and asked, 'How are you?' and the rover told us, 'I'm fine. Can't wait to get down to the surface of Mars.' "
While Sojourner is crawling about, the landing craft is to snap color stereo photographs of the landscape and gather data on wind speeds and directions; the pressure, temperature and density of the thin atmosphere, which is mainly carbon dioxide, and other weather conditions. Engineers expect the rover to operate for at least a week and the lander for a month, though they are hoping for much longer performances.
But first, Pathfinder must land, and that involves a technique never before tried by American engineers. Instead of going into orbit around Mars and then descending to the surface, Pathfinder is to plunge directly toward the landing site, speeding in at about twice the velocity of the Viking landers. With little time to make adjustments, navigation must be especially precise.
The craft's descent will be slowed first by atmospheric drag, then by parachute and finally by retrorocket firings. The craft will not so much touch down as bounce and roll to a stop.
Pathfinder will be enclosed in a giant cocoon of air bags, inflated seconds before landing to cushion the impact of hitting the surface at about 55 miles an hour. Pity there are no Martians to witness the spectacle of a kind of 15-foot beach ball suddenly falling out of the sky and bouncing all about. On the first couple of bounces, the craft could spring as high as 100 feet, skipping forward with each succeeding and lesser bounce before all impact energy dissipates and it comes to rest.
Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration decided on the direct descent and landing to simplify the spacecraft design, reduce its weight and lower costs. More fuel and duplicate systems would have been required to maneuver into orbit first, then release a smaller craft for landing.
Controlling costs, project officials said, has been a rule strictly enforced in producing the Pathfinder spacecraft. They were under orders to develop and build the craft for no more than $150 million, in 1992 dollars, and get the mission off the ground in three years. In a time of austere budgets, NASA has all but abandoned expensive, multipurpose science missions in favor of similar low-cost, rapidly developed and highly focused flights.
Mr. Muirhead said the Pathfinder spacecraft was produced within budget, at $171 million, when the amount is adjusted for inflation. With the added cost of the launching rocket and operating expenses, the entire mission is estimated to cost $266 million. By comparison, the cost of the more ambitious and complex Viking missions to Mars exceeded $1 billion at the time, or $3 billion in today's dollars.
When the Pathfinder project was started in 1993, its main objective was to test new technologies for delivering small spacecraft and rovers to the Martian surface. But scientists, wanting to make the most of the opportunity, chose a landing site that promised scientific dividends. The site on Ares Vallis is a rocky plain at the mouth of a wide channel cutting through ancient highlands. It lies 525 miles southeast of the place where Viking 1 landed in the plain known as Chryse Planitia.
After two years of studying Viking photographs and maps, scientists settled on the Ares Vallis site last year as meeting the criteria of engineers seeking a relatively safe place to land and planetary geologists wanting to examine a wide variety of rock samples.
Engineers insisted that the site's elevation be low, said Anthony Spear, the project manager, so the parachute has sufficient time to open and slow the craft's descent. Also, the area should be clear of huge boulders, steep slopes, deep gullies or other hazards; to allow for uncertainties in navigation, the smooth area should extend over an ellipse about 120 miles by 60 miles. Finally, the site should be fairly near the Mars Equator to insure maximum sunshine at this time of the Martian year for generating electricity to run the spacecraft and rover.
Scientists considered and rejected several sites that did not pass engineering standards. "If you don't land safely, you don't get any science," said Dr. Matthew Golombek, a planetary geologist and the project's chief scientist. "We're fairly confident that 99 percent of the area is safe."
What scientists like about the Ares Vallis area, Dr. Golombek said, is that it is a "grab-bag site." From their analysis of pictures, scientists think rampaging flood waters carved out the Ares Vallis channel in a matter of weeks.
"Imagine taking all the water in the Great Lakes and flushing it out to the Gulf of Mexico in a two-week period," Dr. Golombek said. "That is the kind of catastrophe that must have swept over Mars perhaps 1 billion to 2.5 billion years ago."
At Ares Vallis, the torrent washed tons of rock from the highlands down to the mouth of the channel, littering the basin with samples of rock from a time and place where water once existed in abundance. Now, of course, Mars is dry as a bone, except for some permafrost and polar ice.
Since the highlands appear to be extremely old, rocks from there could attest to environmental conditions on the planet 3.5 billion to 4.5 billion years ago, back almost to its beginning. Of special interest, the rocks could be the same age and from the same type of terrain as the Martian meteorite ALH84001, which is suspected of carrying mineral and possibly microfossil traces of former Martian microbial life.
The alpha proton X-ray spectrometer on the rover was designed by scientists at the University of Chicago to press against rock outcroppings and quickly provide the first-ever chemical analysis of what Mars is made of. The two Viking landers concentrated on biology, scooping soil and testing it for signs of life; the test results were negative.
"Down the line we want to be able to find out if life on Mars developed along the same lines as life on Earth," said Dr. Thanasis Economou, a designer of the spectrometer at the University of Chicago. "Before that can happen, we have to learn as much as we can about Mars and figure out what kinds of samples we should bring back."
Although the evidence for a warmer and wetter Mars in the past is substantial, some scientists still question the assumption that the many dry channels were eroded by tremendous water floods. The terrain, they suggest, could have been shaped by volcanoes.
Dr. Raymond Arvidson, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, said the mission geologists were convinced that the spacecraft would be landing on a plain where there once was water. "The onus is on the team to prove that idea as opposed to others -- for example, that the site is really an ancient volcanic deposit," he said. "Either way, the data to come back will be invaluable."

After the Pathfinder enters the Martian atmosphere a parachute deploys, the heat shield falls off, and the lander descends to the end of a Kevlar tether. When radar picks up the surface, airbags inflate. At the last minute rockets in a shell above the lander ignite to stop the descent. The tether is cut, separating the parachute and shell from the lander, which drops to the surface.

HEADLINE: Benchmarks of Justice

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
It was a Supreme Court term that defied labels and made history.
Perhaps the single most important fact about the term that ended last Friday after a weeklong torrent of landmark opinions is how important it was. 
 In case after case, whether venturing into new areas or revisiting old disputes, the Justices established new reference points, frameworks within which not only law but, to no small degree, social and political arrangements will now evolve.
In rejecting Congress's effort to regulate speech on the Internet, the Court delivered, with essential unanimity, a broadly forward-looking charter for free speech in the world's newest medium of communication; in terms of immediate practical consequence, this may have been the term's most significant decision.
In ruling that there is no general constitutional right to doctor-assisted suicide, the Court held the door open to future legislative developments and even, somewhat surprisingly, to future legal claims on behalf of a right of terminally ill people to control the timing and the manner of their death.
In overturning a part of the Brady gun-control law on the basis of a forcefully expressed, if narrowly supported, vision of state sovereignty, the Court served notice that long-settled assumptions about the primacy of the national government within the Federal system may no longer be valid.
All this from a Court that preached judicial restraint even as it overturned four Federal laws, including the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a statute that passed Congress by near acclamation but that intruded, according to the Justices, on the power of the Supreme Court to define not only the minimal boundaries of constitutional rights but the outer limits as well. (In addition to the Brady law, the Communications Decency Act and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the fourth law the Court invalidated was the Indian Land Consolidation Act of 1984, which took small parcels of land from individual Indians and transferred them to tribal ownership.)
It was a term about boundaries: between the Federal Government and the states, in the Brady Act case; between the judiciary and Congress, in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act case as well as in a decision rejecting an effort by Congressional plaintiffs to obtain review of the Line-Item Veto Act; between courts and legislatures, in the Justices' conclusion in the assisted-suicide case that courts should step back and let legislators proceed; between the Presidency and the courts, in the unanimous rejection of President Clinton's effort to delay proceedings in a private lawsuit against him, and between church and state, in the reversal of a precedent that had kept public-school teachers out of parochial-school classrooms.
"The Supreme Court is redesigning the basic institutional architecture of our public lives," said Prof. Paul Gewirtz of Yale Law School. Even in those decisions that appear to have a rather abstract quality, Professor Gewirtz said, "the Court's insistence on certain structures of power has enormous consequences" for the allocation of power in the country.
The sweep of the term's decisions did more than underscore the Supreme Court's essential authority "to say what the law is," in the words of Marbury v. Madison, the 1803 decision that established this authority and that Justice Anthony M. Kennedy referred to throughout his decision on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. It was also a reminder of the Court's ability to galvanize a national conversation, sometimes merely by selecting a case for decision. While the Court scarcely created the debate over doctor-assisted suicide, for example, it was only once the Justices undertook to decide the issue that a big segment of the public tuned in for the first time.
In the coming term, the role of lightning-rod case is very likely to be assumed by an affirmative action dispute the Court accepted for decision on the final day of the term. That case is an appeal by a school board in Piscataway, N.J., from a ruling that the dismissal of a white teacher in order to protect a black teacher's job violated Federal civil rights law. It raises the question of whether diversity alone is ever an acceptable rationale for race-conscious employment decisions.
The Court's decision to hear the Piscataway case was a setback for the Clinton Administration, which had tried to persuade the Justices not to take the case and which must now take a stand on a concrete and politically uninviting dispute just when Mr. Clinton is trying to initiate a nationwide discussion of race.
This was not a happy Supreme Court term for the Administration. The Justices not only ruled against Mr. Clinton in the Paula Jones case but also refused to hear an appeal on whether White House lawyers' notes were protected by attorney-client privilege against compelled disclosure to the Whitewater independent counsel.
The Court's 80 opinions ranged over many corners of the law, sometimes reflecting a surprising degree of unanimity. Nearly half the cases, 38, were decided by 9-to-0 votes, unanimous in result if not always in reasoning. Among these were the Internet and assisted-suicide cases. For the first time in years of scrutinizing government drug-testing programs, the Justices finally met one they did not like, striking down a Georgia program as unconstitutional, with only Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist dissenting.
Seventeen cases were decided by 5-to-4 votes. The largest number of these, eight cases, were decided by the same majority bloc: the three most conservative Justices, Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Chief Justice Rehnquist, joined by the two Justices in the middle of the Court, Justice Kennedy and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. The cases included a few of the term's most important, among them the Brady law ruling, the decision overturning the precedent on parochial schools, a redistricting case from Georgia and a ruling permitting states to commit violent sex offenders to mental hospitals when their prison terms have expired.
The Court's liberal bloc, consisting of Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, needed an ally if they were to accomplish anything. Justice O'Connor joined this group in a 5-to-4 decision rejecting immunity for private prison guards. The liberal group splintered among themselves fairly often this term.
Liberal, in fact, is a relative word with respect to the current Court. The term was a powerful reminder of the extent to which the Court's center of gravity has shifted to the right in recent years.
For example, in the case on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, not a single Justice argued for a position that for years was a liberal article of faith: that when it came to protecting constitutional rights, the Court could build the floor but Congress had the power to raise the ceiling. Conservatives derided this theory as the "one-way ratchet" in constitutional law. In any event, the point is now moot.
In similar fashion, in the 5-to-4 decision on extended confinement for sex offenders, no one on the Court really disputed that the Constitution gave Kansas room to accomplish its goal; the debate was a much narrower one of procedure rather than of substance.
And in the assisted-suicide case, the claim that all Justices rejected -- that the Constitution's due process guarantee is expansive enough to include a right of terminally ill people to have a doctor's assistance in dying -- was hardly fanciful. The appeals court whose decision the Supreme Court overturned had accepted that argument by a vote of 8 to 3.
In other words, there is a range of constitutional discourse that is not being heard on the Court today. Arguments that not so many years ago would have flowed comfortably, even if not successfully, from the mainstream of legal thought now appear as little more than liberal delusions. By the same token, it would have been inconceivable to many people only a few years ago that the states' rights attack on the Brady Act could have won five votes at the Supreme Court.
This term, which began on Oct. 7 and ended on June 27, was many things. It was, as Robert H. Bork once famously described his view of life on the Court, an intellectual feast. In the crowding of so many important decisions into the final few days, the Justices basically delivered a whole term in a single week, in a kind of Supreme Court version of Tom Stoppard's 12-minute "Hamlet." It was a term that mattered.
Following are summaries of the term's most important decisions:
 
Presidential Power
The Court voted 9 to 0 to reject President Clinton's request for a delay, until he leaves office, in proceedings of a sexual harassment suit brought against him by a former Arkansas state employee, Paula Corbin Jones. The decision, Clinton v. Jones, No. 95-1853, was the first in which the Court had considered whether an incumbent President could be sued for actions outside the scope of his official duties. Justice Stevens wrote the Court's opinion, and Justice Breyer concurred separately.
 
Constitutional Structure
A major focus of the Court's attention, this category encompasses cases relating both to federalism -- the relationship between the state and national governments -- and to the separation of powers among the three branches of the Federal Government. In two rulings overturning two major Federal laws, the Court read the Constitution as limiting the authority that Congress had assumed it possessed.
In the first case, City of Boerne v. Flores, No. 95-2074, the Court by 6 to 3 declared unconstitutional the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a law intended to guarantee religious observance a higher level of statutory protection than the Court, ruling in a previous case, had thought constitutionally necessary.
In his majority opinion, Justice Kennedy said that while Congress had the power under the 14th Amendment to remedy or prevent civil rights violations, it lacked authority to make a substantive change in the meaning of the Constitution.
Justices O'Connor, Souter and Breyer dissented. Significantly, however, they did not dispute the proposition that Congress cannot expand constitutional rights.
The Court's second blow to Congressional authority came in striking down a part of the Brady gun control law that required local law-enforcement officials to perform background checks on prospective handgun purchasers.
Justice Scalia's opinion for a 5-to-4 majority in Printz v. United States, No. 95-1478, said the provision violated "the very principle of separate state sovereignty," which he called "one of the Constitution's structural protections of liberty." Congress may not require states to help administer Federal programs, the Court said. Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Thomas, O'Connor and Kennedy joined the opinion.
The Court avoided, but probably only deferred, ruling on the constitutionality of the Line-Item Veto Act, which gives the President new authority to cancel parts of appropriations bills he signs into law. By a vote of 7 to 2, the Court said in an opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist that the half-dozen members of Congress who had challenged the new law as a diminution of their legislative power lacked sufficient concrete injury to give them legal standing to bring the suit. Justices Stevens and Breyer dissented in Raines v. Byrd, No. 96-1671.
The Court ruled 5 to 4 that states offering favorable tax treatment to charities cannot draw distinctions based on whether a charity serves primarily in-state or out-of-state clients. The decision, Camps Newfound/ Owatonna v. Harrison, No. 94-1988, struck down a Maine law that withheld tax-exempt status from organizations not serving a predominantly local population, in this case a religious camp with mostly out-of-state campers. Justice Stevens wrote the opinion, joined by Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter and Breyer.
 
Religion
The Court overruled a 1985 precedent that prohibited public-school teachers from teaching special federally financed remedial classes on the premises of parochial schools. Justice O'Connor's opinion in Agostini v. Felton, No. 96-552, was joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Kennedy, Scalia and Thomas; all five had been vocal critics of the earlier ruling, Aguilar v. Felton. The degree to which the latest decision opens the door to further government aid to parochial schools is subject to debate.
 
Free Speech
In an essentially unanimous opinion, the Court wrote a charter for free speech in cyberspace by declaring unconstitutional the Communications Decency Act, a 1996 Federal law that made it a crime to display "indecent" material on line in a manner that might make it available to minors. Justice Stevens wrote the opinion in Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, No. 96-511. Justice O'Connor and Chief Justice Rehnquist dissented in part.
Voting 5 to 4, the Court awarded a major victory to the broadcast television industry by upholding a Federal law that requires cable television systems to carry the signals of local over-the-air broadcast stations. The cable industry had challenged the 1992 law as requiring unconstitutional government-compelled speech. Justice Kennedy wrote the opinion, Turner Broadcasting v. Federal Communications Commission, No. 95-992, with the concurrence of Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Stevens, Souter and Breyer.
The Court voted 6 to 3 to uphold a lower court's order keeping demonstrators at least 15 feet from the doorways and driveways of several upstate New York abortion clinics. An anti-abortion group had challenged the injunction as an infringement on free speech. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the opinion, Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network, No. 95-1065. Justices Scalia, Kennedy and Thomas dissented. A separate part of the decision overturned, over Justice Breyer's solitary dissent, an order requiring demonstrators to stay 15 feet from people entering or leaving the clinics.
In a political-speech case, the Court ruled 6 to 3 that states were not constitutionally required to permit candidates to appear on more than one party's ballot line. The decision, Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, No. 95-1608, was a blow to minor parties, which are barred by nearly all states -- one notable exception being New York -- from gaining leverage by cross-endorsing other parties' candidates. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the opinion. Justices Stevens, Ginsburg and Souter dissented.
The Court narrowly upheld a New Deal-era Federal marketing law under which growers of various commodities, in this case certain California fruits, are required to contribute to generic advertising campaigns. Justice Stevens's majority opinion in Glickman v. Wileman Bros., No. 95-1184, said the law was an unexceptional form of economic regulation, rather than compelled speech as some growers had argued and a lower court found. Justices Kennedy, O'Connor, Ginsburg and Breyer joined the opinion.
 
Civil Rights
The Court voted 5 to 4 to uphold a court-ordered redistricting plan that shrank the number of majority-black Congressional districts in Georgia from three to one. Justice Kennedy's opinion in Abrams v. Johnson, No. 95-1425, said that to create any additional districts with black majorities would demonstrate an impermissible consciousness of race. Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices O'Connor, Scalia and Thomas joined the opinion, a forceful reiteration of the majority's rejection of race-based districting.
 
Due Process
In perhaps the most closely watched case of the year, the Court ruled 9 to 0, with a majority opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, that there is no general right to doctor-assisted suicide under the constitutional guarantee of due process. But in separate opinions, five Justices suggested that in a future case, they may find that terminally ill people in intractable pain have a more narrowly framed right to a doctor's assistance in ending their suffering by hastening death.
The decision, Washington v. Glucksberg, No. 96-110, upheld Washington's prohibition on assisted suicide. In a companion ruling, Vacco v. Quill, No. 95-1858, dealing with New York's law, the Court rejected by the same vote a challenge that was based on the constitutional guarantee of equal protection.
A 5-to-4 decision upheld a Kansas law, the Sexually Violent Predator Act, which permits the state to confine certain violent sex offenders in mental hospitals after they have served their criminal sentences. The Kansas Supreme Court had found the law to violate the Constitution's due process guarantee. That ruling was overturned in Kansas v. Hendricks, No. 95-1649. Justice Thomas wrote the decision and was joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices O'Connor, Kennedy and Scalia.
The Court ruled 6 to 3 that states cannot erect financial barriers that keep poor people from appealing judicial decisions terminating their legal relationship with their children. The decision, M.L.B. v. S.L.J., No. 95-853, overturned a ruling by the Mississippi Supreme Court that refused to allow an appeal by a mother who could not pay $2,000 for an official trial transcript. Justice Ginsburg wrote the decision. Justice Thomas, Justice Scalia and Chief Justice Rehnquist dissented.
 
Criminal Law
While numerous, criminal cases did not occupy a particularly prominent place on the Court's docket. In two decisions, the Court upheld the police in encounters with people in cars.
The Court ruled unanimously that once the police have stopped a car for a traffic infraction, they may go on to request the driver's permission to search for drugs without first informing him that he is, in fact, free to decline the search and go on his way. The Ohio Supreme Court had required the police to provide that information. The case was Ohio v. Robinette, No. 95-891.
And the Court ruled 7 to 2 that the police may routinely order passengers out of a car when the driver has been pulled over for an ordinary traffic violation. The police need not suspect that the passenger has committed a crime or presents a danger, Chief Justice Rehnquist said in Maryland v. Wilson, No. 95-1268. Justices Stevens and Kennedy dissented.
Striking down a government drug-testing program for the first time, the Court ruled 8 to 1 that a Georgia law requiring candidates for public office to be tested and certified drug-free violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches. Justice Ginsburg wrote the opinion, Chandler v. Miller, No. 96-126, and Chief Justice Rehnquist dissented.
The Court ruled 5 to 4 that Congress did not intend a 1996 Federal law, which makes it much harder for state prison inmates to file habeas corpus petitions in Federal court, to apply retroactively to inmates who already had petitions pending. Justice Souter wrote the opinion, Lindh v. Murphy, No. 96-6298, joined by Justices O'Connor, Stevens, Ginsburg and Breyer.
The Court ruled unanimously in Richards v. Wisconsin, No. 96-5955, that states may not carve out a blanket exception for drug searches from the general Fourth Amendment rule that requires the police to knock and announce their presence before executing a search warrant.
Voting 5 to 4, the Court upheld a Virginia man's death sentence while acknowledging that the 1988 sentencing proceeding was unconstitutional under a later Supreme Court decision in a separate case. Jurors in Joseph R. O'Dell's case never learned that if they rejected the state's request for the death penalty, Mr. O'Dell would never be released but would instead serve life in prison without parole. Justice Thomas wrote the majority opinion in O'Dell v. Netherland, No. 96-6867. Justice Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer dissented.
 
Liability
The Justices set aside a landmark $1.3 billion class-action settlement of current and future claims against former asbestos manufacturers, ruling 6 to 2 that the agreement did not meet Federal requirements for protecting the legal interests of the diverse group of plaintiffs. Justice Ginsburg wrote the opinion in Amchem Products v. Windsor, No. 96-270. Justices Breyer and Stevens dissented, and Justice O'Connor did not participate.
The Court ruled that railroad workers who had been exposed to asbestos on the job but showed no signs of illness were not entitled to damages under a Federal liability law. Justice Breyer wrote the opinion, Metro-North v. Buckley, No. 96-320. Justices Ginsburg and Stevens dissented from a part of the ruling.
The Court ruled 5 to 4 that employees of private companies that run prisons under contract to state and local governments are not entitled to the partial immunity from prisoner lawsuits that shields publicly employed prison guards. Justice Breyer wrote the opinion in Richardson v. McKnight, No. 96-318, joined by Justices O'Connor, Stevens, Souter and Ginsburg.
 
Environment
The Court unanimously interpreted the Endangered Species Act to permit lawsuits not only by people who think the Government is doing too little to protect endangered species but also by those who think that Federal regulation has gone too far. The decision, Bennett v. Spear, No. 95-813, opens the door to suits against Federal regulators by business interests and affected property owners.
The Court backed the Federal Government in a long-running boundary dispute with Alaska. The 6-to-3 ruling, United States v. Alaska, No. 84 Original, had the effect of extending Federal environmental protection to coastal areas, deemed under the decision to be Federal territory, where Alaska had intended to drill for oil and natural gas. Justice O'Connor wrote the opinion. Justice Thomas, Justice Scalia and Chief Justice Rehnquist dissented.
 
Securities Law
In the most important securities law ruling in years, the Court gave a major victory to the Securities and Exchange Commission in upholding its expansive view of insider trading. Under the 6-to-3 decision, United States v. O'Hagan, No. 96-842, a person can be guilty of insider trading even in the absence of a formal connection to the company whose stock he is buying. Justice Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion. Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Thomas and Scalia dissented.

HEADLINE: Clinton Capital Gains Cuts Would Bypass Rich

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
It is the wealthy who earn most capital gains, and it is normally the wealthy who benefit from cutting tax rates on such gains. But President Clinton yesterday came up with an unusual capital gains proposal, one that would cut capital gains taxes significantly for everyone but the richest taxpayers. It might even raise taxes on some relatively wealthy people.
Under current law, the maximum rate on capital gains -- profits from the sale of stocks and other assets held more than a year -- is 28 percent. Under the President's proposal, the maximum rate would fall only a tiny amount to 27.72 percent. By contrast, the House and Senate bills call for a maximum rate of just 20 percent. 
 Moreover, the White House proposal might mean higher tax bills for some people who take a lot of deductions and report large capital gains.
The Administration proposal comes at a late point in the tax-writing process, after both the House and Senate have passed tax bills that include the more generous capital gains provisions. It is unclear what, if any, impact the Administration proposal will have as a final bill is negotiated.
But the proposal Mr. Clinton offered is a classic example of how the complexity of the tax code can mean that a proposal that sounds like it lowers capital gains taxes can actually raise taxes for some. And while Mr. Clinton's proposal offers bigger savings than the Congressional plan for most taxpayers with incomes under $100,000 who report capital gains, it offers little for high-income taxpayers.
Current law provides that long-term capital gains are taxed at no more than 28 percent. For taxpayers in the 15 percent or 28 percent bracket, that means capital gains are taxed at the same rate as their other income. But for high-income taxpayers, who face ordinary income tax rates from 31 percent to as high as 39.6 percent, there is some relief. Married couples filing jointly fall into this group if they have taxable incomes of more than $99,600. The top rate kicks in on income of over $271,050.
The proposals adopted in both the House and Senate would cut the capital gains rate to 10 percent for those in the 15 percent ordinary bracket, a group that has few if any capital gains to report. For all others, the rate would be 20 percent. In addition, under the House bill, assets acquired in 2001 or later, and then held for at least three years, would be subject to capital gains taxes only to the extent that the gain exceeded inflation, a provision known as indexation.
The Administration proposals, announced yesterday, take a different approach. They provide that 30 percent of long-term capital gains would be excluded from taxes. For most taxpayers, that means that they would pay an effective rate of 70 percent of their ordinary tax rate -- 19.6 percent for taxpayers in the 28 percent bracket and 27.72 percent for taxpayers in the 39.6 percent bracket.
For high-income taxpayers -- and that would include anyone with a very large capital gain -- the savings will be small. An investor in the top bracket who has a $100,000 capital gain would save $280 in capital gains taxes compared with those in the current law. By comparison, he would save $8,000 under the Congressional proposals.
A further catch under Mr. Clinton's plan comes from the way the tax is computed. A taxpayer with a large capital gain would report the entire gain, then deduct 30 percent of it and pay the full tax rate on the remainder. The White House proposals, however, require that 30 percent to be added back in to taxable income when calculating it under what is called the alternative minimum tax.
Unknown to most taxpayers, but crucial to a comparative handful -- fewer than a million -- the alternative minimum tax operates as a second tax code. It was designed to prevent certain people from largely escaping income taxes. It taxes income at no more than 28 percent but includes as income many things that most people can deduct.
Among the things that are added back into income are deductions for state and local income taxes and for property taxes. The catch-all category of miscellaneous itemized deductions is also added back in to taxable income, as are some deductions for medical expenses. Then that -- much higher -- income total is subjected to tax, less a $45,000 deduction for married taxpayers filing jointly. The taxpayer pays either the tax under ordinary tax laws or under the alternative minimum tax, whichever is higher.
A taxpayer already subject to the alternative minimum tax would not benefit from the Clinton proposal on capital gains but also would not suffer. And a taxpayer in the top 39.6 percent bracket who was forced into the alternative minimum tax would probably not suffer compared with current law.
But some taxpayers with somewhat lower incomes, most likely those in the 31 percent and 36 percent brackets, but also including some in the 28 percent bracket, might be moved into the alternative minimum tax and wind up owing more taxes than they would have paid if the capital gains tax had not been cut. 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 4, 1997, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about President Clinton's capital gains tax proposal misstated the potential impact it would have on some wealthy taxpayers. Some taxpayers could receive no cut at all in capital gains taxes, but it would not cause anyone to pay more taxes.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
THE end of a special era in the American wine trade drew ever closer last month with the death of Alexander C. McNally. Mr. McNally, who was 62, had been living quietly in retirement in Hartford, largely unknown to a younger generation of wine drinkers and collectors. From 1969 to 1984, however, he was one of the most visible figures in the American wine trade. It was during those years that he ran the annual Heublein Premiere National Auction of Rare Wines.
At a time when most Americans considered wine exotic and vaguely suspect, Mr. McNally, who was known as Sandy, employed his considerable knowledge and flair for showmanship to break down their reserve -- and to part more than a few of them from their cash. 
Then as now, Heublein Inc. owned Beaulieu Vineyard, a prominent California winery, and was a major importer of fine wines. Heublein is now a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan P.L.C., the British congolmerate. The auctions moved from city to city each year, in classic show-business style. They were held in hotel ballrooms and similar venues and cleverly promoted by advance tastings in other cities around the country, usually with Mr. McNally presiding.
This way, each auction, meant to promote Heublein and move some of its wine, garnered weeks of national and local news coverage.
Mr. McNally was a Princeton University man born in Indiana. Like his fellow Midwesterners F. Scott Fitzgerald, another Princetonian, and Cole Porter, who went to Yale University, Mr. NcNally adopted East Coast sensibilities and an accent and demeanor that hinted of old money, a bit of which he had, and a Continental background, which he did not have. Not entirely, anyway.
He did spend five years in Bordeaux, working for the Russian-born Alexis Lichine. It was an apprenticeship in wine and worldliness second to none. Most of Mr. Lichine's postulants lasted less than a year, mentally and physically drained by his czarist temperament; Mr. McNally luckily arrived with plenty of hubris of his own. He had founded a wine club at Princeton before he was old enough to drink and loved to recall how he had bluffed a Princeton, N.J., wine shop into opening an account for him, an unknown and under-age student, by striding in and demanding, "Tell me, my good man, what do you have in a decent Pommard?"
America has had knowledgeable wine collectors since the days of Washington and Jefferson. Prohibition rendered all alcohol, even fine wine, slightly louche. The Heublein auctions helped make wine respectable again and, at the same time, democratized it. People with money discovered that buying an old Lafite not only was fun and a good investment, but also got you on television.
Mr. McNally orchestrated his tastings with the flair of a Diaghilev. To wield the gavel, he brought J. Michael Broadbent, the most prominent of all wine auctioneers, from Christie's in London. To hold each bottle aloft, as Mr. Broadbent extolled its virtues, he hired Roy Sheppard, an actor, and dressed him in powdered wig, monocle, satin knee breeches and buckled shoes.
Mr. McNally shared the podium with Mr. Broadbent and the colorful major-domo Mr. Sheppard, but he was always ready to talk to reporters and hold up a bottle or frown into a glass for the photographers.
Today, a wine auction held by Christie's or Sotheby's would be judged a failure if it generated less than $1 million in sales. Heublein's first six years took in a total of less than $1.3 million. But with no precedent in this country, the sales were considered quite successful.
Even with inflation, the wines involved and the prices they brought would bring a contemporary collector to tears.
The earlier auctions offered exceptionally rare wines. In 1971, for example, the sale included case lots of Inglenook Vineyards cabernet sauvignon from 1887, 1892, 1897 and 1933 through 1936. The 1887 fetched $5,000, but the 1935 and 1936 cases sold for $710 each. In 1972, the 1904 Chateau Calon-Segur, a Bordeaux chateau, sold for $380, and the 1929 Chateau Cheval-Blanc for $350.
At the 1974 auction, a jeroboam of 1864 Chateau Lafite -- the Rothschilds hadn't bought the place yet -- sold for $9,000. A jeroboam is the equivalent of six regular 750-milliliter bottles of wine, or a half case. A 50-gallon barrel, or 19 cases, of 1973 Georges de Latour Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon from Beaulieu Vineyard sold for $4,000. The entire 5,000-bottle cellar of Claude Philippe, a former food and wine director at the Waldorf-Astoria, sold for $80,000.
As the Heublein auctions moved into the 1980's, retailers became worried. Auctions, they concluded, could siphon off a sizable chunk of their business, even when laws required that the auction sales be cleared, for a fee, through local retailers.
Faced with mounting legislative opposition, except in Illinois and California, the Heublein auctions ended in 1984. Wine auctions returned to New York in 1992, but only in collaborations between retailers and auctioneers. The contemporary auctions have tense moments when prices climb to unthinkable levels. But the truly rare old wines are mostly gone, and so is the McNally touch.
Collectors often prefer to sell their wines anonymously. But insiders smiled when they spotted a rare bottle in the Heublein catalogue described as being "from the cellar of a Scottish gentlemen." To themselves, they added, "From Indiana."
 
TASTINGS
Livingston Vineyards Stanley's Selection Cabernet Sauvignon 1994.
Napa Valley, Calif. About $20.
 
Livingston Vineyards, on the western edge of a part of the Napa Valley called the Rutherford Bench, has been making highly rated cabernets from its own grapes since 1984. Five years later, the first version of this wine made from purchased grapes was released. John Livingston, who owns the business with his wife, Diane, says most of the outside vineyards are top quality but too small to interest larger wineries. They are chosen, he said, to provide "an optimum combination of stony hillside soils, eastern exposures and Napa mid-valley microclimates." This wine contains grapes from six vineyards. The result is a classic, rich, intense Napa cabernet with a long, delicious finish. Given the price of grapes in the Napa Valley -- more than $2,000 a ton, in some cases -- the Livingston-Stanley is a reasonable buy. Stanley? Just a family name.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Is Broadly Higher, Aided by Comments on Mark

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar again rose against the German mark yesterday, after top American and German officials expressed confidence in the strength of the United States currency.
Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers, speaking in Frankfurt, said he believed that the dollar was "in a very strong position." And Hans Tietmeyer, president of Germany's central bank, said, also in Frankfurt, that he preferred to think of the dollar as strong rather than the mark as weak. 
 These comments reassured traders that officials were not worried about the dollar's recent strength against the mark, and gave the dollar a lift in the late afternoon.
It reached an intraday high of 1.7490 marks yesterday, the strongest since February 1992, before settling in New York at 1.7467 marks, up from 1.7443 late Monday. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar settled at 114.88, up from 114.59 yen on Monday.
Its improvement against the yen was stimulated in part by a big drop overnight in Japanese stocks. The benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues ended down 429.44 points, or 2.08 percent. "The Nikkei tumbled a bit and that sparked some interest to sell the yen," said John McCarthy, senior vice president at ING Barings Capital Markets.
But trading in the dollar was subdued for much of the day, and dealers cited caution in anticipation of the release of United States employment data on Thursday and the outcome of a meeting of Federal Reserve interest-rate policy makers, which is to end today.
A more active currency was the British pound, which rose to a five-year peak against the German mark before tumbling late in the day. Jitters before the introduction of the Labor Government's first budget today contributed to a decline in sterling's exchange rates. Against the dollar, the pound fell, ending at $1.6581, down from $1.6647 on Monday.
"The biggest move today was sterling to the downside, although it seems to have stabilized," said John Nelson, foreign-exchange trading manager at ABN-Amro Bank.
Despite yesterday's move, dealers said that the expectation of higher interest rates in Britain should keep the pound well supported.

HEADLINE: Treasuries Up on Signs of Slower Economy

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices rose yesterday, buoyed by a survey of purchasing managers that provided further evidence of a slowing economy.
The report came as Federal Reserve policy makers began a two-day meeting to determine monetary policy and was expected to bolster the case for the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 18/32, to 98 18/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.74 percent, from 6.78 percent on Monday.
Bond prices rose after the National Association of Purchasing Management said its index for June fell to 55.7, compared with a reading of 57.1 in May. Analysts had expected a reading of 56.4.
The report helped ease concerns that that economic growth might be accelerating following several strong regional manufacturing surveys, in particular Monday's report from the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago. The association's June index of business activity surged to 61.5 from 56.8 in May.
"Given the sizable increases in all these regional indices during the month of June, it's no wonder that bond market investors received the nearly 1.5-point decline in the overall index with open arms," said Anthony Chan, chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation of Columbus, Ohio.
A report on May construction spending also lent support to bond prices. Spending fell 1.8 percent, although analysts had expected a gain of six-tenths of 1 percent. It was the biggest drop since January 1994.
The market shrugged off a report from the Conference Board showing that its index of leading indicators rose three-tenths of 1 percent in May.
Many market participants did not expect a change by the Fed in its monetary policy at the conclusion of the meeting today.
"Based on all the information out in the market, I see no reason for the Fed to tighten," said Jack Ablin, executive vice president and head of fixed income for Barnett Capital Advisers Inc. in Jacksonville, Fla.
Based on past announcements, the market should get its answer around 2:15 P.M. today. The central bank last raised its target for the Federal funds rate, which banks charge one another for overnight loans, in March, when it raised the rate by 25 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.50 percent.

HEADLINE: A Minority Market With Major Sales;
Stores Redo the Merchandise Mix And the Hispanic Dollars Flow

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
It did not take Larry Vines long to figure out why things were not working out at the Sears, Roebuck store in Boyle Heights, a mostly Hispanic neighborhood just east of downtown.
Advertisements for the store prominently featured tractors, although it had been a good 100 years since residents of downtown Los Angeles toiled on the land. Not a single black bra was to be found in the store, though that is what immigrant customers were used to wearing. Men's bathing suits looked like "something your grandfather would wear," said Mr. Vines, who took on Los Angeles in 1994 as a district general manager for Sears. 
 The store, which opened in 1927, was set to be closed. But Mr. Vines was convinced that he could turn around one of the oldest of Sears stores, if only he could fill the shelves with goods that the area's residents actually wanted.
"We are the department store for this part of the world," Mr. Vines said. "But what I found was an inability to serve the market here."
His merchandising team got to work. Out went the dowdy bathing suits. Soccer shirts with "USA" emblazoned on the front were replaced by jerseys featuring teams from Latin America. Chain saws took the place of tractors in ads. Joseph Diaz, the store's general manager, was given carte blanche to hire Spanish-speaking sales help.
"We wanted the customer to say, 'This store was built for me,' " Mr. Vines said.
The message got across. Sales rose to $50 million last year, double the $25 million of 1992, and profits increased 30 percent between 1995 and the end of last year. The aging East Los Angeles outlet is now one of the most profitable Sears stores in the region, even though its customer base of fairly recent immigrants from Mexico and Central America is relatively poor.
That triumph, however, required a fundamental rethinking of how Sears operates -- one that many American retailers, each in its own way, have emulated in learning to cater to the immense diversity of the nation's fastest-growing ethnic group, the 30 million Americans of Hispanic origin.
In 1994, stores that catered to regional ethnic tastes were unheard of at Sears, as at many American retailers. Stocking by region was considered costly and hard to manage: How, for example, do you get economies of scale when you are buying a certain kitchen item or dress style for just one store? Department store companies by and large had built their empires on the cookie-cutter model. Buying was centralized, on the conviction that most Americans, even those foreign born, wanted basically the same things.
Now, though, micro-merchandising has extended to a variety of groups and regional tastes. Sears stores in Asian neighborhoods are stocked with smaller sizes and rice cookers; outlets in Houston load up on western wear every February for Rodeo Week.
But it is Hispanic customers, retail experts say, who get the most attention, because there are so many of them, linked by language, if not a homogenous culture.
The movement started with grocery stores, which easily identified food trends among ethnic groups, and it has slowly spread to retail stores. Sears has 148 stores that concentrate on Hispanic shoppers in eight states, and J. C. Penney has 120. Nordstrom Inc., which lets each of its stores tinker with the merchandise mix, has staged special events about Hispanic issues. And Circuit City arranges for goods purchased at its American stores to be picked up by friends and relatives at affiliated stores in Mexico.
"My perception is that retailers' efforts to reach the Hispanic markets have gotten a lot stronger in the last year and a half," said Felipe Korzenny, the president of Hispanic and Asian Marketing Communication Research, a research company in Belmont, Calif. "It is because Sears was very aggressive and has made a lot of waves. The other retailers saw that and said, 'There must be something there.' "
At Sears, getting the right mix of dresses, bras and kitchen aids on the shelves rests on the shoulders of buyers, who often are of Hispanic descent themselves. District merchandising teams work with corporate headquarters to buy for individual markets, typically groupings of 10 to 12 stores. All the orders come from headquarters, so vendors are not forced to deal with a dozen different buyers, and Sears is able to maintain its buying leverage.
To the uninitiated eye, the East Los Angeles Sears looks a lot like other stores in the giant retailer's portfolio, with the exception of some signs in Spanish and the faint sounds of salsa in the background. But a tour found subtle differences in almost every department.
The first line of attack in clothing departments was sizing. The women's department needed a bigger stock of smaller sizes, and men's jeans had to be offered in tinier waists and shorter inseams.
Then there were questions of style and taste. For women, the colors became a bit brighter, the skirts a bit shorter. Patterned underwear, a slow seller, was supplanted by black and white bras. "We can't get enough thongs to sell," Mr. Vines said. "Those are for private moments."
Women's swimsuits, however, are a more staid matter. "I scaled down on two-pieces, which Anglos wear," said Irma Ibarra, manager of the women's department. "It is a cultural thing." Mr. Diaz said that he would not permit his 14-year-old daughter to traipse around the pool in a bikini.
Even in housewares there were adjustments. Custom-made drapes were given the boot, and more sewing machines came in their stead, because the East Los Angeles customer prefers to make her own drapes, said Paul Watson, a district manager. Juicers, which the store had none of five years ago, were added, because homemade juice is popular with these shoppers.
Houseware and home electronics retailers often miss out with Hispanic customers, for lack of understanding their needs, said Mr. Korzenny, the market researcher.
"In the U.S.," he said, "65 percent of all Hispanics come from Mexico, and a very large number of them come from rural areas. They were coming from a country where they didn't have much access to consumer goods, and they have just started learning about things they can do in their homes."
To these customers, "an electric can opener is not that important; a dishwasher is not that important," Mr. Korzenny said.
"Hispanic consumers," he said, "say to me over and over again, 'Why do I need a dishwasher, if I have to wash the dishes twice?' They don't need a coffee maker, because many of these consumers use instant coffee, because they learned to drink it like that in Latin America."
The new mix seems to please the target customers of the Sears store. Sonia Palacios, who lives in the neighborhood but had always avoided Sears, said she had become a lot happier with the store in the last year. "Before it was a big problem, because no one here spoke Spanish," said Ms. Palacios, 35, who works as a cook and does not speak English. "But I like the things and the prices here, so these changes are a really great thing."
Sears has found, however, that marketing messages cannot simply be translated directly from English to Spanish. Signs in the East Los Angeles store do not say "50 percent off," for example. "You lose something in the translation," Mr. Diaz said. Customers "want to see, 'Was $40 is now $20.' They don't want to have to calculate the price difference."
(Stores catering to Asian customers in Southern California offered further lessons. "We had signs in Cambodian and no one who worked in the store knew what they were selling," Mr. Vines recalled. "In many Asian cultures, to offer something cheaply is considered an affront. So our signs are much more about having a happy new year or thanking them for shopping.")
Advertising, too, needed to reflect cultural differences, including a certain warmth in the family dynamic that might be missing from a general-market campaign. "In our Spanish ads," Mr. Diaz said, "there tends to be a lot more hugging and kissing." Sears has "significantly increased" its marketing budget aimed at Hispanic customers in the last four years, said Robert L. Metler, the company's vice president of merchandising, though he declined to give figures.
Sears is happy with the performance of the stores in the Los Angeles area that have been restocked to appeal to Mexican and Mexican-American shoppers. But what Sears and other retailers must guard against is stocking each Hispanic-oriented store in exactly the same way. A middle-class Cuban shopper in Miami, for example, is looking for quite a different Saturday night dress than is a Los Angeles immigrant from a small farm town in Mexico, or a student of Puerto Rican background who has lived in New York all her life.
Indeed, in an effort to perfect the art, many retail executives are trying to tweak each such store, region by region -- a sort of micro-micro assortment. "Southern Californian Mexican-American is very different from a San Antonio Mexican-American," said Beverly Anderson, a merchandise manager at J. C. Penney. "It becomes very complex."
For example, she said: "I walked into our Houston market, and one of the things that everyone said is, 'Red is a color we need to have in sportswear.' Then, I went to Los Angeles, which is very Mexican-American, and they stressed, 'Don't send red.' "
Ms. Anderson thinks she understands the difference. "People have always associated bright colors with Hispanic customers, but in Southern California, the tendency is to assimilate," she said. In Houston and San Antonio, though, "the culture there is tejano, and there is a lot of preservation of that culture; you just can't stereotype."

A sign at Sears tells customers that the "men's department is at the back, on the left, on this floor." (Photographs by Edward Carreon for The New York Times)(pg. D1); Big retailers are relearning a basic lesson: Give the customers what they want. A Sears ad offers "Everything for today's woman," including brighter colors and smaller sizes to appeal to Hispanic shoppers. (pg. D3)

HEADLINE: New Data Add To Evidence of Slower Growth

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1

 BODY:
Further evidence emerged today that the economy was slowing from the rapid pace of the early part of the year. Corporate buyers of everything from twine to trucks reported a decline in factory activity, and the Government said construction suffered its biggest drop in more than three years.
The figures were reported as Federal Reserve officials from around the country gathered here for a meeting of their monetary policy committee. The reports added to expectations that the central bank would keep interest rates steady because of few indications of an immediate risk that inflation would be revived as a result of the recent strength of the economy. 
 "The remote possibility that the Fed could tighten went out the window," said William C. Dudley, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs.
Securities markets rallied on today's reports, reversing losses posted on Monday, when unexpected vigor in sales of new homes and among purchasing managers in the Chicago area fanned skittishness about higher rates.
The Commerce Department's report on construction spending showed a 1.8 percent decline in May, mainly reflecting lower public-sector construction on things like highways and schools.
But private construction was also down, including a six-tenths of 1 percent decline in residential building, after an unchanged reading for April. "Housing activity is starting to flatten out," said Cheryl R. Katz, senior economist at Merrill Lynch.
The National Association of Purchasing Management reported today that the manufacturing sector was still expanding in June, although at a slightly slower pace. The group's index of manufacturing activity fell to 55.7 points in June from 57.1 in May; a reading over 50 indicates growth.
In issuing the association's report, Norbert J. Ore, head of the survey committee, described the June picture as one of "continued growth in manufacturing," as indicated by higher production and growth in new and backlogged orders. And prices receded, with only 3 of 20 industries reporting paying more for goods.
That would conform to the recent pattern of the economy's overall performance. The nation's output, which reached a 5.9 percent annual growth rate during the first quarter, subsided to perhaps 2 percent in the second quarter, which ended yesterday, analysts estimate. But most expect the growth rate to pick up again in the second half. Some analysts said they expected the Fed to raise interest rates at that time.
"The economy continues to do very well," said Gary R. Thayer, senior economist at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis, predicting that the Federal Reserve was likely "not done" lifting rates. Mr. Thayer predicts that the economy will expand at a 3.5 percent pace in the July-September period.
In another report today, the Conference Board calculated that its index of leading indicators, which is intended to predict economic activity several months in the future, climbed three-tenths of 1 percent in May. This followed a small April decline, which was the first lower reading in 15 months.
Of the six components of the index that contributed to the increase in May, the most significant by far was the surge in stock prices as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
Lower first-time claims for unemployment insurance and slower supplier deliveries, indicating trouble keeping up with demand, also pushed the index up. The biggest drags came from a shorter average workweek and a narrower spread between overnight and 10-year interest rates, which is said to be a negative indicator.
The Conference Board, a business-backed research organization, reported that two other indexes, of coincident and lagging indicators, each advanced two-tenths of 1 percent in May.
The purchasing managers reported several companion figures to their main index. The widely watched supplier-delivery gauge, an indicator of how well orders are being met, moved six-tenths of a point lower, to 54.6, a reading that means orders still take considerable time to be filled.
The price index, falling for the third consecutive month, edged down three-tenths of a point, to 48.1. More than 75 percent of purchasing managers reported paying the same prices they did in May while 13 percent paid higher prices and 11 percent paid less.

HEADLINE: VOTERS IN MEXICO VENTING OUTRAGE AT RULING PARTY

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 1

 BODY:
The governing party, which has been at the center of Mexican politics for seven decades, is facing the most competitive elections in its history on Sunday, and polls indicate that its power will be dramatically reduced.
Since the 1920's, Mexico has been governed by a single party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which unified the country and created a stable political system after a violent revolution. But in recent years, Mexicans have grown increasingly frustrated with the arbitrary and corrupt rule and recurring economic crises under the party. 
 Opposition political parties on both the left and right have gained popularity and appear poised to score significant advances in both national and local contests in the July 6 vote. Even officials of the governing party acknowledge that Mexico's political landscape is being reshaped.
"We used to be the system," said Miguel Gonzalez Compean, the official in charge of training young activists for the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI. "Now we have to become a party."
A multi-party system is emerging in Mexico, one in which the PRI is likely to be pre-eminant, but without its former authoritarian control.
A leftist opposition candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, is set to become mayor of the huge capital city by a wide margin. The governing party is behind in races for a key statehouse in the industrial north and for congressional seats across the country.
The Institutional Revolutionary Party could even lose its absolute majority in the lower house of the national congress, an event thatwould effectively bring an end to the single-party system. If that were to happen, for the first time the enormously powerful Mexican President would be forced to negotiate with the legislature, just as President Clinton has to in the United States.
Since the PRI was founded in 1929, every president has come from its ranks, the most important politics have passed through the party structure and the party has also been the means for carrying out Government business at the village level.
But growing discontent with the PRI's monopoly forced President Ernesto Zedillo to adopt electoral reform laws that cut off the party from the generous, if clandestine, access to public coffers it relied upon for decades to finance its activities. A new, independent elections council has made it difficult for the party to win by the fraud that its members had raised to a science.
Furthermore, the stringent fiscal policies adopted by Mr. Zedillo to pull Mexico out of a recession have left the party, the prime conduit for patronage, with nothing to dole out.
Many rank-and-file members object to Mr. Zedillo's market-oriented policies and distrust his technocratic persona. His policies build on economic reforms initiated by former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who has fallen into deep public disgrace, becoming a heavy millstone for the party.
Mr. Zedillo has vacillated, keeping his distance from his party in his first two years in power, then embracing it awkwardly as this year's campaigns began to heat up.
The PRI is revolutionary in name only. Since it rarely had to defend its positions in elections, it no longer has a defining platform of ideas to offer.
"This is a party with a very profound identity crisis," said Delal Baer, an expert on Mexican politics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
The tensions have pitted a minority of leaders who want to modernize the party, aligned with Mr. Zedillo, against a larger faction defending the party machine. The modernizers want to maintain recent trade and diplomatic openings with the United States, continue dismantling the state-run economy and turn away from tainted political methods.
But many members, from ward heelers to the prominent bosses often called "dinosaurs," would like to return to the days when the Government drove the economy and the party had the Government to itself.
The Institutional Revolutionary Party remains the only party whose organization reaches to every corner of Mexico. Its strength is intact in rural areas and it remains strong among Mexicans who are accustomed to dealing with one party and who fear change.
Since the late 1960's, Mexican presidents have neglected their party's structure, calling on it only in times of elections. As a result, the nationwide honeycomb of block-level party cells, the party's foundation, has eroded, longstanding party members said, with thousands of cells closed down completely.
To reverse the losses, Mr. Zedillo appointed a new party chief, Humberto Roque Villanueva, late last year. The combative Mr. Roque broke with the party's traditionally moderate public tone and went on the attack against the opposition.
"Some people think we have to treat the opposition with reverence and not offend them with so much as a rose petal," Mr. Roque said in an interview. "I think in a competitive democracy we have to confront the opposition with all its defects."
Mr. Roque lambasted the conservative opposition, calling it "fascist and authoritarian." He accused Mr. Cardenas of betraying his nation by leaving the governing party a decade ago to join the leftist opposition.
"Some of our members think Mr. Cardenas is a traitor to his country, and to his own father," Mr. Roque said. Mr. Cardenas is the son of the man who perhaps was the most popular Mexican President in modern times, Gen. Lazaro Cardenas.
Mr. Roque chose a new editor for the party newspaper, who changed it into a tabloid that makes lurid assaults on the opposition. In April, the newspaper published a full-page photo montage showing the head of a conservative opposition leader on a body wearing a Nazi uniform, placed next to a photograph of Hitler.
The federal elections council ruled that the montage was a violation of campaign fairness laws and fined the party $1,300.
Mr. Roque shrugged off the council's censure."Everybody wants to see our paper because of that fine," Mr. Roque said. "It was free advertising for us."
Some of the party's most severe problems are financial. Under intense pressure from his party, Mr. Zedillo pushed through laws last year that provide generous public financing for elections. Parties are allotted money based on their showing in the previous election, but no party is allowed to spend more than $48 million. The PRI was allotted $64 million above this limit based on its past vote tallies, but it cannot spend this money on campaigning, party officials said.
"We have terrible money problems," said a high-level party official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Our operations are nearly paralyzed by the new laws."
Rosario Guerra, a reformist congresswoman appointed by PRI leaders to clean up the party's finances and to send a message through the ranks that the old days are over, said, "It is very difficult for our candidates, since we are still the majority party, to accept these limits on our campaigns and advertising."
In mid-campaign the elections council, for the first time, slapped a major fine, about $683,000, on the governing party for accounting lapses. The commission stopped short of accusing the party of corruption, but said it failed to account for $2.5 million it spent in 1996.
Party leaders reacted with personal attacks on several council members.
"The PRI still hasn't learned to subject itself to an authority it doesn't control," said Emilio Zebadua, an elections council member who came under fire by the party.
So far, a few instances have been reported in which party loyalists have given in to old temptations, although such cases have been surprisingly rare. In the state of Campeche, reporters caught the party's gubernatorial candidate handing out medicine taken from federal medical clinics. In the northern state of Nuevo Leon, 92 party members were arrested for forging voter credentials to swing the results of a local mayoral race.
President Zedillo decided early this year to abandon the past practice of Mexican presidents and began to campaign openly for candidates of his party. Regarded by many Mexicans as honest and hard-working, Mr. Zedillo enjoys a 52 percent favorable rating in recent polls, about 20 points higher than his party. He has tried to lend some of his prestige to his party without having its reputation for corruption rub off on him.
Mr. Zedillo used his prerogatives to commandeer television prime time to stump for the party's candidates. His Government also has announced an array of job-creating initiatives, most recently a special $1 billion highway building program to aid the ailing construction industry.
But these initiatives are not helping the party's candidates in urban areas, who are on the defensive.
The PRI candidate for Mexico City mayor came recently to Iztapalapa, a gritty working-class neighborhood in the capital that had been a party stronghold for decades. The candidate, Alfredo Del Mazo, campaigned briskly, but learned that his party's support had dwindled.
A band of youths from Mr. Cardenas's leftist party surrounded and heckled Mr. Del Mazo's wife, saying that the PRI's policies had cost them their jobs. As soon as the candidate's convoy sped away, the indifferent crowd dispersed and the musicians he had hired for a street dance played on alone.
Practically everywhere Mr. Del Mazo stopped in Iztapalapa, a sprawling Mexico City borough that is home to 1.2 million voters, there was some social club or day care center built in past years with party help. Yet his crowds were thin. Many residents blamed the party for the unemployment in the area.
The following for Mr. Cardenashas grown here, creating explosive tensions. A well-known community leader who supported the governing party, Martha Hernandez Trujillo, was stabbed to death in early June, and many party members suspect that her killing was politically motivated.
Followers of Mr. Cardenas and PRI loyalists nearly came to blows at the closing of Mr. Del Mazo's rally.
"We've had it," shouted Fausto Sanchez, 43, a food market inspector. "The PRI stole everything the Government was supposed to give to the people! They don't want to lose because then they won't be able to steal anymore."
But the leader of a local cell, Jesus Barrera Ramirez, brandished his fists at Mr. Sanchez and responded: "We're the PRI! We're the Government! We gave this neighborhood everything it has. Those people are just jealous because they didn't get government jobs."
A brawl was averted when the opposition group backed off.
The party is divided on whether to cooperate with officials elected from opposition parties or to use its influence with labor unions and other entrenched interests to try to subvert them, especially in Mexico City.
Moderates like Mr. Del Mazo also worry about what will happen to them if the party does badly in Sunday's election.
"Those of us who promoted change will be under attack inside the party," predicted one supporter of modernizing the party, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The hard-liners will say, 'Let's get rid of those little brats.' "

HEADLINE: Crybaby Boomers

BYLINE: By Walter Kirn; Walter Kirn is the author of "She Needed Me," a novel.

DATELINE: LIVINGSTON, Mont.

 BODY:
What spoiled children today's grown-ups are. When I was a child, back around 1970, they were on the evening news burning bras and flipping out on acid, barricading themselves in college presidents' offices and calling for the downfall of the Government. I used to lie in bed and pray for everything to be O.K., for the Maoists and the Manson girls to go away.
Now those same rebels are middle-aged and running the world, having traded manifestoes for mutual funds and tie-dyed jeans for Italian silk ties. They have gone from not trusting anyone over 30 to not trusting anyone under 30. 
 That, at least, appears to be the finding of a survey released last week by Public Agenda, a research group, on American attitudes toward the younger generation. "Americans are convinced that today's adolescents face a crisis -- not in their economic or physical well-being but in their values and morals," the study reported. Six in 10 of the adults polled said young people were failing to learn moral values. Just 37 percent said they believed today's youths will grow up to make the world a better place.
Excuse me, but I see a pattern here. First the members of the 60's generation hated their parents. Now they hate their kids. The generation that gave us instant divorce, pot, speed and insider trading is worried about the moral failings of the young? Please. If I were 15 now and thus charged with moral corruption, I'd take a long, hard look at my prosecutors, beginning with, but not limited to, their Role-Model-in-Chief. Bill Clinton's America may be prosperous, but morally exemplary it's not.
Twentysomethings, meanwhile, have gotten a bad rap from their elders, who like to call them "slackers." But despite being burdened by student loan debt and lavished with unsolicited credit cards virtually since birth, plenty of them are saving for retirement at an age when their parents were still splurging on grams of coke and denouncing materialism. Some of these young people are marrying early, right out of college, apparently eager to avoid the biological waste dump left behind by the previous generation's sexual experiments. As for social activism, there's reportedly growing interest among college students in joining the Peace Corps.
So who should be lecturing whom? I came of age in the late 70's, when it wasn't uncommon to visit a friend's house and find his twice-divorced father in the living room passed out next to the stereo with a hash pipe. In the 80's, when I went to college, one of the most popular clubs on campus was Alanon, where earnest young people struggled with their parents' addictions. Now I hear 50-year-olds excuse a daily barrage of government dirt as business as usual, nothing to be concerned about. This from the same people who scourged my tender youth with threats of violent revolution if the scoundrel Richard M. Nixon didn't step down.
At the risk of sounding a bit self-righteous myself, I call these grown-ups the Blame Generation. In the survey, two-thirds of them branded today's youth "wild," "rude" and "irresponsible" -- the same words applied to them back when they were young. If I were a teen-ager, I wouldn't worry about it. These folks who are doing the name-calling now were a pretty frightening bunch themselves. Not a few of them still are.

HEADLINE: World Bank, at U.S. Urging, Postpones Vote on Loan to Croatia

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1

 BODY:
Under pressure from the United States, the World Bank took the unusual step today of postponing indefinitely a vote on a $30 million loan to Croatia that the country hoped to use to shore up its banking systems and stimulate private investment.
For the last week the Clinton Administration lobbied vigorously to block the loan as a way to express its displeasure with Croatia's President, Franjo Tudjman, for failing to comply with the 1995 peace accords negotiated in Dayton, Ohio, to end the war in Bosnia. 
 At a meeting here today, the World Bank's executive directors were sharply divided over the loan and, rather than voting on its approval, simply agreed to remove it from consideration for an unspecified amount of time, according to two Administration officials familiar with the discussions.
The United States was joined by its major allies in Europe, as well as Canada and Japan, the officials said. But directors representing other countries accused the United States of using the loan to make a political statement.
Jan Piercy, director for the United States, said after the meeting that it was necessary to postpone consideration of the loan for legal and economic reasons. She argued that Croatia's failure to abide by the Dayton peace agreement raised questions about its commitment to international accords and the stability of its economy.
"In this instance, the economic and political factors are so intertwined as to be indivisible," Ms. Piercy said.
The Administration's success in blocking the loan was a significant rebuff to Mr. Tudjman. In May Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright announced that the United States would redouble its efforts to force Croatia, Serbia and the Muslims in Bosnia to make peace.
The United States routinely votes against or abstains from loans to certain countries, like those regarded as supporting terrorism, but in most cases those loans go ahead anyway. What made today's step unusual was Washington's ability to rally enough support to at least postpone, if not reject, a vote.
A State Department spokesman, John R. Dinger, said the United States opposed the loan because of Mr. Tudjman's "insufficient compliance" with the promises he made in the Dayton accords. In particular, he cited an unwillingness to allow Serbian refugees to return to their homes in Croatia and a failure to cooperate in efforts to bring those indicted for war crimes to trial by the International Tribunal in The Hague.
The action was welcomed in Congress, where there is a growing sentiment that the Administration should condition its support of loans and other assistance to the Balkans on cooperation with Dayton, particularly on the issue of war criminals.
"We have some economic leverage and we should use it," said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont.
While the loan can come up for consideration at any time, officials doubted it would soon. Other international loans for Croatia, however, are scheduled for consideration, including a $40 million loan from the International Monetary Fund next week.
The Administration officials said the United States would continue to oppose loans until Mr. Tudjman demonstrated a willingness to abide by the peace accords.

HEADLINE: Stocks Advance, With the Dow Rising 49.54

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market rose yesterday, bolstered by new evidence that the economy is moderating and that inflation is under control.
A report from the National Association of Purchasing Managers showed that factory activity had eased last month, another indication that the economy is slowing after getting off to a feverish start this year. 
 That touched off a rally in the bond market yesterday, which was carried over into stocks.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 49.54 points to close at 7,722.33, leaving it about 70 points below its all-time high.
Broader market measures also gained. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.89 points, to 891.03, and the New York Stock Exchange Composite index rose 3.57 points, to 466.01.
Because of recent signs that the economy is moderating, Wall Street analysts doubt that Federal Reserve policy makers will raise interest rates today, when their two-day meeting concludes.
"The feeling on the Street is that the Fed won't do anything," said Hildegard Zagorski, a market analyst with Prudential Securities. "As long as the economy is in a slow-growth path, there's really no reason for the Fed to raise rates."
Indeed, many on Wall Street are talking about a resplendent American economy, ideally balanced and efficient -- ingredients that have helped lift all the major stock indexes to record highs.
"This is like a mantra on Wall Street: strong growth, low inflation, positive earnings surprises and tremendous liquidity," said Elizabeth J. Mackay, an investment strategist at Bear, Stearns. "You just have a lot of things going extremely well."
That scenario helped to raise drug and financial stocks yesterday, which were among the year's best performers.
For instance, the S.& P. financials index rose 1.6 percent yesterday, as many banks and financial institutions surged on the news that economy may be moderating.
Citicorp rose 2 3/4, to 123 5/16; Chase Manhattan gained 2 1/2, to 99 9/16, and Fannie Mae soared 1 5/16 to 44 5/16.
Wall Street investment banks also got a lift. Shares of Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company rose 1 7/8, to 44 5/16, and shares of Merrill Lynch & Company rose 1 3/16, to 60 13/16.
Among drug stocks, Warner-Lambert soared 7 9/16, to 60 13/16, a 52-week high. For the year, Warner-Lambert, which produces products like Listerine mouth wash and Shick razors, is up 75 percent.
Among Dow stocks, J. P. Morgan rose 3 1/8, to 107 1/2 and Exxon rose 1 3/4, to 63 1/4. In all 21 of the Dow's 30 component stocks gained.
Caterpillar, however, one of the year's best performers, fell 2 3/16.
On the Big Board, winners edged losers, 1,704 to 1,150, on heavy volume of 544.38 million shares.
But technology stocks were weak yesterday, partly because on recent warnings of slower earnings growth.
Shares of Microsoft fell 1 7/16, to 124 15/16, after The New York Post reported yesterday that the company was considering acquiring the CBS broadcasting unit from the the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Microsoft and Westinghouse both denied the report. Shares of Westinghouse rose 11/16, to 23 13/16.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 3.82, to 1,438.25, and the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization issues fell 2.24, to 394.13.
Yesterday's weakness in technology issues, however, is not unlike some of the weakness that has been felt in the broader market.
In the last seven sessions, stock prices have been volatile. Some analysts attributed the wild price swings to end-of-the-quarter reshuffling, but others said the market was tired.
"At some point the market just has to succumb to an overbought position," said Philip J. Roth, a technical analyst with Morgan Stanley. "The market has had an unusual run-up and few setbacks since the April run-up."
That run-up took the Dow from 6,391 on April 11 to 7,722 at yesterday's close -- a 21 percent gain. That kind of sprint is bound to give way to weakness, analysts said.
Even though the last six sessions of June were volatile, analysts said that the market held together well.
The Dow rose 4.6 percent in June, and the Russell 2000 gained 4.1 percent.

HEADLINE: HONG KONG, CHINA: DIPLOMACY;
Uncle Sam's New Role: Hong Kong's Advocate

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, July 1

 BODY:
The symbol of British sovereignty, Prince Charles, sailed away from Hong Kong early this morning on a tide of nostalgia tinged with dread, leaving the United States as the most credible and influential judge of Beijing's behavior in Hong Kong.
The Britain that seized, built and nurtured Hong Kong is no longer an Asian power. These days London is more preoccupied with how far it wants to tie its fate to the European Union. 
 But the United States, with its self-confidence, global reach, economic might, military power and vocal push for democracy and human rights, is a different matter. It remains the most important Pacific power, a source of enormous investment, trade and needed technology. And it is one of the few countries that commands Beijing's respect.
Consequently it is the United States to which Hong Kong will inevitably look as arbiter and protector in its relations with Beijing. And if the Administration falters, Congress has already shown itself eager to push for a tougher line.
"We're not seeking to replace Britain as the guardian of Hong Kong," a senior Clinton Administration official said. "But it's a role we cannot avoid. Since we are who we are, and we have so much business here, we will end up by being the first to cry foul."
America has been down this road before, notably in the Middle East and in the Caribbean. In both places Americans have by and large picked up the burden that the British laid down, even if at times they were not quick to understand why it was left to them.
In the case of Hong Kong, China needs decent relations with the United States, and Hong Kong is vital to that larger relationship. The people who hold power in Washington and Beijing understand this.
Meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright on Monday as the British rulers were packing their bags, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said Beijing was "quite sincere" in its commitments about Hong Kong. American officials say he also stated what has become obvious: that China's "most important relationship in Asia and around the world" is with the United States.
China's President, Jiang Zemin, is eager to go to Washington for a long-delayed state visit this autumn, probably in October. The visit should help seal his pre-eminence among the Chinese leadership after the death of Deng Xiaoping, who invented the formula of "one country, two systems" and promised Hong Kong a "high degree of autonomy."
For political reasons alone, President Clinton needs a summit meeting that produces concrete agreements and not just champagne toasts with Mr. Jiang, senior American officials say.
In her meetings here with Mr. Qian, Ms. Albright pressed for the release of the prominent dissident Wei Jingshen and others, for a resumption of the American-Chinese dialogue on human rights and for prison visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Officials said she had also urged restraint on Chinese sales to Pakistan and Iran of nuclear, chemical and military technology and parts, and products that can have military as well as civilian uses. In particular, she warned Mr. Qian that continued sales of cruise missiles to Iran could trigger sanctions under existing American law.
She also pressed him to take steps soon to make a serious and commercially acceptable offer to join the World Trade Organization.
While the American relationship with China involves a long list of issues, Ms. Albright said, "Hong Kong is very high on that list."
The dozen or so American legislators who came along can be expected to do their utmost to insure that it stays there, aided by the 1992 United States-Hong Kong Policy Act, which requires the President to make reports about whether China is keeping its commitments here.
Beyond politics, the reasons for American engagement are compelling. Hong Kong is the economic gateway to the unrivaled potential of the Chinese market. Already 40,000 Americans live here, and more than 1,000 American companies employ about 10 percent of Hong Kong's work force. With 6.5 million people, Hong Kong is the world's eighth-largest trading economy and America's 11th-largest export market.
China has agreed to let the United States Consulate here be a quasi-embassy, retaining a military attache and staff as well as a large contingent of agents monitoring international crime, drug dealing, copyright violations, money laundering and all the rest.
For all these reasons, Ms. Albright emphasized that what happens here must be judged as it unfolds.
In the Administration's agreed one-liner, uttered by Ms. Albright and by Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, the handover of Hong Kong is "a movie, not a snapshot."
Still, as the hours eroded Britain's hold on its last imperial outpost in Asia, one could chart the increasing vigor and clarity of American statements.
Washington let Britain take the lead on reaction to Beijing's preliminary steps here. Those included the effective appointment of Tung Chee-hwa, a shipping magnate, as Governor, and the appointment of a Provisional Council, sworn in early this morning, that replaced one elected under British rule.
Even before the handover, the new council, meeting in China, passed measures that threw out significant, if belated and hesitant, democratic reforms that the British had made here.
The British refused to call the scrapping of the elected council a violation of the 1984 Joint Declaration between China and Britain that is meant to preserve Hong Kong's way of life and a "high degree of autonomy" from Beijing. The American Administration went along, annoying Congress.
But now, Ms. Albright has stated explicitly that Washington expects "free and fair elections," as promised within a year, for a new elected legislature. She said that the acts of the Provisional Council would lack legitimacy and that "the United States is and will remain a friend to democracy in Hong Kong."
Even a few days ago, when China announced that 4,000 troops would march into Hong Kong this morning, Ms. Albright was hesitant to condemn it or even to characterize the message, though she implied that it was unfortunate and said that "the signals and messages that go out" matter as much as China's specific actions in Hong Kong.
It was only after her arrival here, and after the British criticized the move, that she said, "I do not think this is the best way to start off, and I think we have to watch this very carefully."
In part, her initial hesitation came because China has every right to put troops here, so long as they engage only in national defense and not internal security.
If in the future there is a specific breach of the Joint Declaration, then it is for the British to complain, one official said. But there will invariably be questions about the spirit of the agreement, the official said, and Washington "should not hesitate to comment."
"We will be watching to see that the Hong Kong of tomorrow is like the Hong Kong of today," Ms. Albright said. Officials said this meant at least that there could be no rollback of the semi-democracy introduced by the British.
But with Congress pushing, President Clinton will be in the familiar but very difficult quandary of how to credibly balance America's larger interests with legitimate concerns about democracy and human rights here.

Saudis Send Envoy to Iran
Saudi Arabia sent an envoy on a rare visit to Iran, in what diplomats said was a new sign of a thaw in relations. Ties have been tense since Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979, and were aggravated by the bombing of a military housing complex in Saudi Arabia that killed 19 American servicemen in June 1996. Iran denies any involvement in that attack, and has repeatedly said that it wants to rebuild trust with the Saudis. (Reuters)

Report Says Many Children Will Lack Health Insurance
Estimates by the Congressional Budget Office suggest that health care bills passed last week by the House and the Senate will fall far short of the goal of guaranteeing coverage for half of the nation's 10 million uninsured children. Lawmakers of both parties said they were surprised and dismayed by the estimates, which indicate that fewer than 1.5 million uninsured children would gain coverage. The lawmakers insist that more children will benefit from the legislation. A1
 
The G.O.P.'s Green Politics
Many Republicans who have been vilified by environmental groups are now declaring themselves champions of the environment. The shift is particularly stark because Democrats themselves seem unsure about how much to press for environmental causes they have long supported. The Republicans' gentler approach seems driven by electoral politics: A variety of polls show that the perception among voters that Republicans do not care about the environment cost the party dearly in the 1996 elections.

HEADLINE: HEALTH CARE BILLS DON'T MEET GOALS, BUDGET AIDES SAY

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1

 BODY:
Estimates by the Congressional Budget Office suggest that health care bills passed last week by the House and the Senate would fall far short of the goal of guaranteeing coverage for half of the nation's 10 million uninsured children.
Lawmakers of both parties said they were surprised and dismayed by the preliminary estimates, which indicated that fewer than 1.5 million uninsured children would gain coverage. The lawmakers insisted that more children would benefit from the legislation. 
 The House voted to spend $16 billion on a new health program for children in the next five years. The Senate set aside $24 billion, including $8 billion from an increase in tobacco taxes. In talks starting next week, negotiators from the two chambers will try to work out their differences and guarantee coverage for as many children as possible.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said that large numbers of children expected to receive aid under the two bills -- perhaps 40 percent -- would already have insurance coverage from other sources, including private employers. So, it said, the net increase in children with insurance would be smaller than the members of Congress had assumed.
The budget office said that the House bill, in particular, would give states so much discretion that they could substitute Federal money for state money already being spent on health programs. Governors insist they will use the money as Congress intended, to insure more children.
Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican who has been leading efforts to expand health insurance for children, said the estimates of additional coverage were "coming in very meager."
Referring to experts at the Congressional Budget Office, Mr. Hatch said, "I am not sure why, but they have been consistently scoring the major children's health proposals as helping very few children."
In their efforts to get more money for children's health care, lawmakers and advocates for children have not always paid close attention to questions about how the new program should be designed.
Thus, the budget office said, some of the new Federal money might be used to provide health insurance for children who would otherwise have received it from private employers or from state-financed health programs. House and Senate leaders said they wanted to avoid such a substitution but neither bill would flatly prohibit it.
The Congressional Budget Office said the House bill would provide Medicaid or other health insurance coverage to 865,000 children a year. But it said, "Forty percent of these children would have had health insurance coverage even without the enactment of a national child health assistance program." So the net increase in the number of insured children, it said, would be 520,000.
Governors prefer the House bill, which would give them more discretion than the Senate bill in deciding how to spend Federal money.
Jennifer E. Baxendell, a health policy analyst for the National Governors' Association, said: "We can't understand the reasoning of the Congressional Budget Office. It seems to assume a worst-case scenario, giving the governors no credit for good intentions or for trying to do the right thing with this Federal money."
Ms. Baxendell predicted that millions of children would gain coverage under the House bill. House Republicans share this view, but House Democrats disagree.
Stan Dorn, director of the health division at the Children's Defense Fund, described the choice this way: "Will the money be used for health insurance, or is it a slush fund? The stakes are huge. This could be a tremendous step forward for uninsured children. Or a historic opportunity could be wasted."
Under the House bill, states could use Federal money to expand Medicaid, enroll children in private insurance plans or purchase health care services through direct payments to doctors, hospitals and clinics. States would have the leeway to decide which children were eligible and what benefits they would receive.
Under the Senate bill, the states could not use Federal money to buy health care services directly but would have to use it for health insurance, with a package of benefits specified by the Federal Government. Governors say they should be free to make such decisions to meet local needs.
The budget agreement negotiated in May by President Clinton and Congressional leaders earmarked $16 billion to "be used in the most cost-effective manner possible to expand coverage and services for low-income and uninsured children, with a goal of up to five million currently uninsured children being served."
House Republicans say that some states will want to use their share of the money for services provided by community health centers, rural clinics or children's hospitals.
But the Congressional Budget Office said that some of the Federal money provided under the House bill would probably be used for "existing state activities." In addition, it said, some of the money might be used to offset cuts in Federal Medicaid payments to hospitals serving large numbers of low-income patients.
Representative Lucille Roybal-- Allard, Democrat of California, said the $16 billion in the House bill could become a general revenue-sharing program, like the one that existed from 1972 to 1986. "The money does not have to be used to cover uninsured children," she said.
Representative Major R. Owens, Democrat of Brooklyn, said, "While $16 billion is better than nothing, it is estimated that the plan is far short of reaching one-half of the 10 million children who are without health coverage."
Mr. Dorn, of the Children's Defense Fund, described the House bill as "an invitation to states to divert money to purposes unrelated to children's health care."
The Senate bill, like the House bill, would initially have set aside $16 billion for a child health program in the next five years. The Congressional Budget Office said that this version of the Senate bill would have provided coverage for 1.3 million children, including 800,000 who were previously uninsured.
The bill was changed on the Senate floor in several ways. Now it would guarantee specific benefits. In addition, the Senate version of the tax bill would provide $8 billion of additional money for children's health insurance initiatives, making a total of $24 billion. So it seems plausible to estimate that the net increase in the number of children with insurance would be about 50 percent higher than the initial estimate -- that is, in the range of 1.2 million children. But the budget office is still working on the calculations.
Liberal Democrats said it was essential for Congress to specify the health benefits provided to children under any program subsidized by the Federal Government. The Senate bill stipulates that such benefits must be at least equivalent to those offered to the children of Federal employees and must include hearing and vision services. It would also require coverage for mental illnesses to be comparable to that for physical illnesses, in most cases.
But Ms. Baxendell, the health policy analyst at the National Governors' Association, said: "Hundreds of thousands of additional children could be covered if states were given flexibility in designing the benefits. The more expensive you make the package for one kid, the fewer kids you can cover over all."

HEADLINE: Postage Rates Likely to Rise For First Class

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1

 BODY:
Sending a birthday card could cost a penny more next spring, but Americans would get a break on the cost of paying bills under new rates proposed by the United States Postal Service today.
The basic first-class stamp would go up 1 cent, to 33 cents. But, in a rare price cut, bills paid using preprinted envelopes would drop to 30 cents. The current 32-cent letter rate took effect on Jan. 1, 1995. 
 The unusual plan to lower the price of paying a bill is expected to meet some of the competition from electronic bill paying, which has become increasingly popular.
It will not mean a special new stamp, though. Instead, businesses like utility companies would offer customers the option of buying prepaid reply envelopes, charging an annual $3.60 fee for the 12 envelopes with 30 cents postage already imprinted. The lower rate reflects the fact that the preprinted envelopes are cheaper to handle because they can be read and sorted by machine.
The overall rate increases drew prompt criticism from John F. Robinson of the Coalition to Make Our First-Class Mail First Class, who complained that postal officials "should not be trusted with any more of our money."
The rate proposal will be sent to the independent Postal Rate Commission next week, but because of the complex legal process required to get changes approved, the new rates will not take effect until at least May 1998.
Besides first-class mail, increases are also proposed for other classes of mail, including magazines and catalogues, parcels and junk mail.
The proposed increases for all types of mail are expected to raise the Postal Service's income $2.5 billion a year. While the agency made record profits in the last two years, it faces declining revenue and rising costs in coming years.
The penny rise in first-class mail represents a 3.1 percent increase in prices, less that one-third of the inflation rate since the current price took effect, Postmaster General Marvin Runyon said.
Millions of stamps with the letter "H" instead of a price have already been printed for use until stamps showing the new rate can be prepared. Stamps without prices that are used when a new rate takes effect carry letters of the alphabet. The last one was "G."

Cooking Scholarships for 9

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
Nine New York City high school students have received scholarships totaling more than $115,000 to some of the country's culinary schools based on their performances at a recent cooking competition.
The scholarships were awarded last month by a nonprofit organization in Manhattan called the Careers Through Culinary Arts Program, which teaches students the basics in sanitation, safety and food preparation. Of the 2,000 home economics students in 30 New York high schools that the program reached this year, 14 students were chosen to compete in a cooking competition at the New York Restaurant School. 
 With a two-hour time limit, the students prepared poached guinea hen with chive sauce, and crepes with chocolate and cream sauce -- from memory. Nine won scholarships, and five received gifts and awards worth about $8,000.
The top three winners were Stephanie Grajales of John Dewey High School in Brooklyn, who received a four-year, $40,000 scholarship to Johnson & Wales University; Milton Gotay of Park West High School in Manhattan, who received a $22,760 scholarship to the Culinary Institute of America, and Deana Giordano, of Tottenville High School in Staten Island, who received a $20,000 scholarship to the French Culinary Institute.

A few big winners are seen in front-office software stocks.

BYLINE: By Lawrence M. Fisher

 BODY:
WHAT is the fastest-growing segment of the software industry? Many analysts say that would be so-called front-office applications, like sales force automation and customer support programs. Though the field is crowded, and the stocks expensive, some analysts say investors can still share in this growth if they pick carefully among the contenders.
Companies like Siebel Systems Inc., the Vantive Corporation, Scopus Technology Inc., Clarify Inc. and the Remedy Corporation are hardly household words, but that does not mean they are undiscovered. Shares in Siebel, a Wall Street favorite, are trading at an astonishing 136 times projected 1997 earnings. It almost makes the Microsoft Corporation, at more than 40 times, or the Oracle Corporation, at a similar multiple, look cheap. 
 Analysts say investors are not paying for earnings with these companies, however, but for growth. They cite studies by the Gartner Group and International Data Group projecting that the market for front-office applications will grow to $3 billion by 2000 from about $600 million this year. With the inevitable consolidation, the 40 or 50 public and private companies in this field will be winnowed down to two or three dominant suppliers that will grow at extraordinary rates, these analysts say.
The big appeal of these companies' products is that in contrast to traditional back-office applications like accounting packages, they aim not to reduce costs but to increase revenues. The products achieve such gains by increasing and improving the kind of information available to salespeople in the field so that they can complete bigger and more complex sales more quickly or by improving interaction with existing customers, resulting in more repeat business.
"All of these products really focus on the customer, which is very different from the past, where applications all focused on transaction processing and financial accounting," Eric Upin, an analyst at Robertson, Stephens & Company, said. "Sales and marketing are the biggest operating expense for most companies, 35 to 40 percent of revenues, and they are also the least automated."
"We believe we're at the very beginning of a very large market opportunity," he said.
Mr. Upin estimates that there are more than 20 million potential users of front-office programs in the United States, and that the top five front-office companies have fewer than 2,000 customers among them, representing at most only 200,000 users. So the growth potential is real; what is more difficult is identifying likely winners.
To find them, Mr. Upin said he would look first at management skill, next at the customer base, then at the company's sales and marketing and ability to install the programs, which are large and complex, and only last at the technology.
Applying these criteria, he currently recommends Siebel Systems, which is managed by a group of early Oracle executives and counts Charles Schwab, Compaq Computer and American President Lines among its reference customers. Siebel started in sales force automation and has lately been moving into customer support and internal help desk software, which is used to answer employees' questions about company operations.
Mr. Upin also recommends Vantive, which started in help desk and is moving toward sales force programs with its own cadre of talent that came from Oracle; it has a roster of prominent customers similar to that of Siebel.
"This is a multibillion-dollar opportunity and both companies have the potential to be dominant players," Mr. Upin said. Both companies were also brought public by his firm, Robertson, Stephens.
Edgar P. Bierdeman, research director at Dakin Securities, applies a similar set of criteria, but adds, "You really want to invest in companies that have identifiable and defensible market niches."
Mr. Bierdeman, too, likes Siebel and Vantive, but he also favors Remedy, which focuses on the internal help desk market, and has the fledgling industry's highest operating profit margins, at 28 percent. "This is an excellent case study in defining a market niche, developing a well-formulated strategy and sticking to it until the company achieves market dominance," he said.
"You don't value these companies on earnings," he added. "They're too young for that. They're expensive, but they're like an Oracle. You need to buy them judiciously."

Gold Price Sinks as the Fed Stands Pat on Interest Rates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Gold fell to its lowest price on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange in more than four years yesterday after Federal Reserve policy makers left United States interest rates unchanged.
In other markets, rice and cocoa fell. 
 For some traders, the Fed's vote signaled that policy makers and the chairman, Alan Greenspan, were content that the American economy was not growing too fast and that inflation was under control. That diminished demand for gold, an asset traditionally viewed as a hedge against a surge in inflation.
"When the Fed doesn't raise rates, people interpret that to mean there is no specter of inflation looming ahead," said Leonard Kaplan, a chief bullion trader at the Monex Deposit Company in Newport Beach, Calif. "That deters people from investing in gold."
Gold for August delivery fell $2.80, to $332.30 an ounce, in New York, its lowest since March 1993.
Expectations that European central banks may sell gold reserves to reduce budget deficits to qualify for the European single currency, or euro, also shadows the market.
Rice futures fell after Thailand, the world's largest rice exporter, devalued its currency, making its grain cheaper on the world market and increasing competition for world buyers.
Rice for September delivery fell 0.25 cent, to 9.135 cents a pound, on the Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest price since February 1996.
Cocoa fell as rains soaked West African crops, raising expectations that this year's harvests would yield adequate supplies.
Last month, cocoa prices rose to a nine-year high amid concern that several countries' crops would be smaller than expected because of dry growing conditions. Now, soil moisture is up for crops in the Ivory Coast and good conditions exist in the Pacific Rim and parts of Brazil, according to the Weather Services Corporation of Lexington, Mass.
Cocoa for September delivery fell $71, to $1,614 a metric ton (1.2 tons), on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York.
Last year's Ivory Coast crop produced 1.2 million metric tons of cocoa. Forecasters have put this year's crop at 750,000 to 1.1 million tons.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Surges Against Mark But Plunges in Pound Trading

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar again surged against the German mark yesterday, but fell sharply against the pound after Britain's Labor Government released its first budget.
The pound initially stumbled when the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, began his budget speech by saying that he shared British industry's concern about the strength of the pound. 
 But as the details of the budget emerged, the pound began a sharp climb, rising almost 3 cents against the dollar and as much as 5 pfennigs at its peak against the mark.
Currency traders said the budget did not appear to have gone far enough in curbing strong consumer-led growth in Britain, leaving the door open for an increase soon in interest rates that would benefit the pound.
"Brown's initial remarks took sterling down to the lows, but the rest of his comments were well received and we saw heavy buying of sterling," said Cynthia Johnson, managing director of foreign exchange at CIBC Wood Gundy.
"I think people perceived the budget as leaving the door open for higher interest rates."
The pound rose as high as $1.6785 before settling in New York at $1.6731, up from $1.6581 on Tuesday and its highest level since Jan. 16. The pound also surged to a new five-year peak above 2.94 marks. The weakness in the mark bolstered the dollar against the German currency.
The dollar reached an intraday high of 1.7550 marks, its fourth consecutive three-and-a-half-year high against the mark, before settling at 1.7536 marks, up from 1.7467 marks on Tuesday.
Also helping the dollar against the mark was a report showing that German industrial production had fallen by a surprising two-tenths of 1 percent in May.
The dollar ended weaker against the Japanese yen, which rose during Asian trading hours after the Bank of Thailand announced it was dropping its pegged exchange rate system and letting its currency float freely. The yen often acts as a safe haven currency in times of turbulence in other Asian markets.
In late trading in New York, the dollar settled at 114.49 yen, down from 114.88 yen on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
German Effort On Digital TV Moves Ahead

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, July 2

 BODY:
Germany's troubled efforts to introduce digital television received an important boost today, as the nation's dominant cable provider and the two biggest German entertainment companies agreed to end years of feuding and support a common system.
The agreement calls for Deutsche Telekom to make its network available for digital television programming offered by Kirch Group and by Bertelsmann A.G., the publishing and broadcasting conglomerate. 
 The agreement appears to end the long stalemate among three powerful companies, each of which controlled essential building blocks for a successful business in advanced television but which feuded in a struggle to control the new industry.
Today's agreement comes a week after a related collaboration announced by Kirch and Bertelsmann. If the two agreements hold up -- and analysts warned that Europe is littered with scrapped media alliances -- they could pave the way to a big expansion in advanced pay-per-view and multimedia services in what is by far Europe's biggest economy.
Under the agreement, Deutsche Telekom announced that it would adopt Kirch's technology for set-top decoders and customer verification and that it would provide capacity over its modernized cable network to carry some 50 channels envisioned by Kirch and Bertelsmann.
Telekom's role is crucial, because the company provides cable service to more than 16 million households and Kirch has thus far had to transmit its fledgling digital service, called DF-1, over satellite.
Digital television services here are similar to what satellite direct television provides in the United States, offering many channels of regular programming as well as pay-for-view movies and sporting events.
Bertelsmann and Kirch, meanwhile, agreed to merge their dueling pay-television ventures. Premiere, which offers one analog channel of pay-per-view movies and has 1.4 million subscribers, will be united with DF-1, which has about 29 channels but only 40,000 subscribers.
Premiere has been owned jointly by Bertelsmann, Kirch and Canal Plus, a major pay-television company in France. (Canal Plus announced today that its board had approved the sale of its 37.5 percent stake in Premiere to Kirch in exchange for Kirch's 45 percent stake in Telepiu, the Italian pay-TV broadcaster.)
Each partner in Premiere has a veto on all important decisions, and Bertelsmann has thus far refused to let Premiere and its customers be absorbed into DF-1.
But Kirch Group, which has spent billions of dollars buying up rights to movies and television from Hollywood studios, controls vast quantities of programming that are crucial to the long-run success of pay-per-view television.
Today's agreement appears to put the pieces of this puzzle -- the network, the customer base and the movies -- back together. "This opens up the prospects for digital television, which up until now had been questionable," said Helmuth Runde, a spokesman for Bertelsmann.
But Ivor Jones, a media analyst with Salomon Brothers in London, warned that the future of digital television, along with more exotic new services like high-speed Internet access and interactive television, was still cloudy because German customers already had nearly 30 channels of television available at low cost.
The deeper problem is Kirch's financial health. Privately controlled by the entrepreneur Leo Kirch, the company has spent more than $1 billion to start DF-1 and has yet to generate anything close to significant revenue. The company had been hoping to sign up 200,000 customers in its first year, but has yet to get much past 40,000. And industry executives say the company needs at least one million subscribers to break even, two million customers to be solidly profitable.
Kirch executives have acknowledged in recent weeks that they are looking for new sources of financing, and that they have been talking to potential strategic partners. But the company displayed surprising confidence last month by announcing that it had paid another $500 million for yet another batch of movie rights from Hollywood.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The air standards are set, but how clean is clean enough?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
SEEMINGLY trapped between environmental groups, which view the Administration's proposed pollution standards as a make-it-or-break-it test of the White House's commitment to virtue, and business lobbies, which see the standards for ozone and ultrafine soot particles as a colossal waste of money, President Clinton found some room to wiggle.
The final rules, issued last week by the Environmental Protection Agency, were not softened. But they will be applied in what the E.P.A. terms "flexible and affordable ways," with oceans of time to adjust. "It will be 2009 -- after President Gore's second term is completed -- before the regulations really bite," predicted Paul R. Portney, the head of Resources for the Future, a Washington-based research group. 
 The mix of tough standards and long lags in enforcement certainly makes political sense, repairing the Administration's frayed ties with environmentalists while making it easier to dismiss business alarms and give moderate Republicans an excuse to look the other way. But it does nothing to resolve the difficult question of how clean is clean enough. And it put in place regulations that many economists argue should not be enforced. "Anybody who thinks the new ozone standard is cost effective must be smoking something," said Robert Crandall at the Brookings Institution.
Most important, perhaps, it would greatly expand regulators' effective power. "Since the ozone standard cannot be met in some cities," Robert Hahn of the American Enterprise Institute said, "the E.P.A. will end up with broad discretion on where and when to enforce the law."
The clean air act requires the E.P.A. to set pollutant standards that would eliminate risks to health, and then periodically update them to reflect the latest science. So earlier this year the agency proposed to tighten the screws on ozone, a component of urban summer smog, and to create a standard for tiny soot particles.
Not surprisingly, the oil and auto industries protested. More striking, the E.P.A.'s independent panel of scientists was badly split on the value of the new standards. And both the Treasury and the President's economic advisers argued vociferously that the costs would exceed the benefits.
Vice President Al Gore, who has done most of the heavy lifting on environmental policy, was apparently caught unprepared by the vigor of the opposition. Indeed, until last week he distanced himself from the rules, leaving it to the E.P.A. to defend the proposal. But with pressure mounting from environmental groups, the White House finally adopted the cause as its own.
The two pollutants in question present very different challenges. Little is known about the consequences of exposure to very small particles of soot because they are typically present in high concentrations only when other pollutants are also plentiful. What's more, the authors of a key study on which the E.P.A. apparently relied have yet to disclose their data to skeptics.
Still, Lester B. Lave, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University, thinks the evidence is strong enough to begin the long process of measuring the presence of small particulates and limiting human exposure. "You want to do some technology-forcing early on," he suggests, before industry commits to plants that may eventually require costly modification.
By contrast, it is widely conceded that ozone affects health in concentrations well below the old standard of 120 parts per billion. There are two catches, though. The number of people who could be helped is not large: the new standard would reduce hospitalizations for asthma by just 1 or 2 percent. And the costs could be astronomical: The President's Council of Economic Advisers estimated that the annual cost of cutting ozone to 80 parts per billion would be $11 billion to $60 billion.
The tighter standard would add an element of farce to enforcement in cities including Los Angeles, Houston and New York, where even radical limits on emissions would not suffice. "We just don't know how to get from here to there," Mr. Portney said.
But most of the players in this game will probably not be around to face the political music. "States and counties participating in the regional pollution control strategy will have at least until the year 2004 to meet the need standard," an E.P.A. news release said.
The hiatus with soot is even longer. Washington is allowing five years to collect data, three years more for the states to plan controls and 18 months for the E.P.A. to review the plans. Even then, the E.P.A. noted, "it will be several more years before many areas will actually have to comply."
With Congressional Republicans loath to be tarred as pro-pollution, these delays should put the issue to rest for a while. But Robert N. Stavins, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, suggests that the "generic" problem isn't about to evaporate. "It was easy when you couldn't see the car ahead of you on the freeway," he argued; "in a relatively clean environment, it will become ever more difficult to justify further economic sacrifice."
And then there is a question of governance. Since many localities cannot possibly meet the new standard, the need for E.P.A. waivers will mushroom -- as will the temptation to use them to reward political friends and punish enemies. "Enforcement shouldn't depend on whether Al Gore or Dan Quayle is President," Mr. Hahn said.
"One way or another, costs always slip into the deliberation," said Richard L. Schmalensee an economist at M.I.T. who was a key player on environmental issues in the Bush Administration. Demanding that agencies weigh costs against benefits "would push the question into the realm of open discourse," he added.

HEADLINE: G.M. June Sales Off 13.3% Amid Industrywide Decline

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 2

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation said today that its sales fell 13.3 percent last month, leaving the auto industry as a whole on track to end the second quarter with a whimper, following a stellar first quarter.
The weak G.M. sales reflect lackluster demand for new cars and trucks industrywide, Wall Street analysts said. Sales of the company's pickup trucks, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles fell 7.7 percent, while car sales plummeted 16.7 percent in June, compared with a year earlier. 
 The auto industry's slow sales puzzle analysts because they come at a time when economic factors seem so favorable: interest rates are low and stable, unemployment levels are at record lows, and measurements show strong consumer confidence and high personal income levels. Despite it all, "car sales stink," David B. Healy, an auto analyst with Burnham Securities, said.
Other analysts said the weak June auto sales were an indication that the Federal Reserve was correct in deciding today not to raise interest rates to slow the economy. "The Fed was on the mark," David M. Garrity, an analyst at Smith Barney, said.
Smaller auto makers reported sales gains today. Mazda Motor of America said its sales rose 28.2 percent in June. BMW of North America Inc. said its sales rose just one-tenth of 1 percent. The Mercedes-Benz unit of Daimler-Benz A.G., reported a 14.6 percent increase in sales.
Final results for the industry are expected on Thursday, when the Ford Motor Company and a few other manufacturers release their June sales figures. Analysts predict Ford's sales will be down slightly.
Other auto makers announced their June sales results today, and together registered a decline. The Chrysler Corporation said its sales fell 4.0 percent, the Toyota Motor Company said its sales dropped 2.3 percent, the Honda Motor Company said its sales rose 8.9 percent and the Nissan Motor Company said its sales rose 2.4 percent.
Analysts said G.M.'s results were partly hampered by a lengthy strike at a Pontiac, Mich., truck factory, where the company builds its popular Chevrolet C/K pickup. Still, "any way you slice it, they are poor numbers," Mr. Healy said.
General Motors' results varied widely by division. For instance, Chevrolet sales fell 20.5 percent last month, with only the Chevrolet Express van and two new models -- the Malibu sedan and Venture mini-van -- registering gains from a year ago.
Others fared better despite the weak market. Cadillac sales rose 9.3 percent. Buick sales fell just 2.1 percent even though the division dropped the Roadmaster, a model it sold last year. Sales of four of the six other models rose, partly because of a promotion that ended Monday and offered rebates and other discounts on Buicks, analysts said.
G.M. this year has introduced 15 new models during the current model year, and many have sold briskly, compared with the models they replaced. The company is relying on their sales steadily improving to win back market share lost to other auto makers in past years.
Pontiac sales rose 4.8 percent in June, mainly because the sporty Grand Prix sedan has proved so popular since its 1997-model redesign. Sales of the Grand Prix, which sells for $20,000 to $24,000, have more than doubled since last year.
Michael Coy, the general manager of a Pontiac dealership in a suburb of Portland, Ore., said that he had not only sold every Grand Prix shipped to him by the Kansas City factory but had even reached sale agreements for all 12 of the 1997 Grand Prixs that he had been promised by the end of the model year in September.
"People want the Grand Prix because it has the new styling," Mr. Coy said. "The car kind of stands out in a crowd; it looks more expensive than it is."
G.M. recently acknowledged that despite some market share gains earlier this year, it would not meet its target of increasing its share of the auto market to 33 percent. G.M. has said that is because strikes so far this year cost it 96,000 units of production in the second quarter.
The lost production, G.M. said, would also result in charge of $490 million, or 67 cents a share, after taxes against second-quarter earnings. The company is scheduled to report its second-quarter results on July 16.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Hang Seng Salvation

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: HONG KONG

 BODY:
As they lowered the Union Jack here, marking the end of 156 years of British rule, and the band played "God Save the Queen," the thought occurred to me that while God may save the Queen, who will save Hong Kong? The answer is two of the most basic human emotions -- greed and ego. The greed of the supermarkets and the ego of the last Communists. God save them both.
Let me explain. At Sunday night's pre-handover dinner, the head table was stacked with politicians and statesmen from around the globe. Now all of these were powerful people, but alone they won't exercise the decisive influence over China's handling of Hong Kong. If the Hong Kong government had really wanted to intimidate the Chinese it would have invited the heads of the Moody's and Standard & Poor's credit rating agencies, Fidelity and Vanguard mutual funds, Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Salomon Brothers, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and Mitsubishi. 
 That is to say, there is great concern that China live up to its obligations to preserve Hong Kong's unique capitalism and democratic freedoms. But there is only so much that foreign governments can do to influence events in Hong Kong. The U.S. can punish you by dropping bombs, but there is nothing to bomb here. Moody's, though, can punish you by dropping your credit rating, and there will be plenty of opportunities for that if things go wrong here.
In that sense, Hong Kong will be a largely self-sanctioning diplomatic problem. Because if the Chinese start to mess with Hong Kong -- either by fiddling in its stock market or seriously restricting the free flow of information -- then China will be punished by that most brutal, efficient and immediate of diplomatic tools: the A.T.M. machine.
There is more than $100 billion in foreign investment here, most of it in highly liquid funds, and long before foreign governments respond to any downward spiral here, the Hong Kong economic elite will move their money out by electronic transfer. And the Chinese know it. Lu Ping, China's top official in Hong Kong, bluntly warned his own countrymen Tuesday that China will not allow regional "warlords" (amazing that he used that term to apply to renegade Chinese provincial governors and business conglomerates) to come into Hong Kong and "mess things up."
Hong Kong is the ultimate post industrial diplomatic challenge, because Hong Kong today is really the capital of a huge cyber-community: "Maritime China." This community includes families, coastal trading houses, business alliances between merchants and officials (including intelligence and army officials), as well as some underworld groups. It stretches from Hong Kong to China to Macao to Taiwan to all of the ethnic Chinese communities of South Asia.
It is not a single network or conspiracy. Rather it is a source of great economic vibrancy in Asia, with many competing alliances. The real long-term threat to Hong Kong is less from the iron fist of Imperial China and more from the dark side of Maritime China -- the alliances between Chinese warlords, military chiefs, triads and business that involve everything from smuggling to shady, sweetheart stock deals. It's not that governments are powerless to deal with such a cyber-community, but the supermarkets will probably be a much more efficient disciplining force.
Ego comes in because China's leaders are desperate to prove that now that they have recovered Hong Kong they can run it every bit as well as the British did. Moreover, to complete the total reunification of China, they want to demonstrate to Taiwan, as China's Prime Minister, Li Peng, said Monday, that "one country, two systems" can work for Hong Kong, and therefore "it can also work for Taiwan." China's leaders are keenly aware that they are taking over Hong Kong at a time when property prices and the Hang Seng stock index are soaring. A top Hong Kong official told me the Beijing team is already concerned that they will be blamed (and hurt economically) if the bubble here bursts. That alone is a huge incentive for China to keep Hong Kong in good working order.
It is a fitting irony that the reputation of China's leaders is now linked to the Hang Seng index. It may not be pretty, but it could be Hong Kong's salvation. God save Mao's legacy and Merrill Lynch.

HEADLINE: Asia's Hope for Hong Kong: More Business as Usual

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 2

 BODY:
For some Asian countries that were once British colonies themselves, the end of Britain's 156-year rule over Hong Kong was a proud moment. And in South Korea, which faces hostile North Korea across a heavily armed border, there was a tinge of envy that China and Hong Kong could be reunited so peacefully.
But as Asian neighbors observed the fireworks in Hong Kong on Monday night, their thoughts were far from the issue that has preoccupied the United States -- whether Communist China will crack down on civil liberties in Hong Kong. 
 "That is not our priority," said Chang Chul Kyoon, deputy director general for Asia-Pacific affairs in South Korea's Foreign Ministry. "As far as Hong Kong is concerned, economics is the No. 1 issue for the Korean Government."
South Korea, which became democratic only in the last decade, knows what it feels like to be pressed by Washington on human rights. And many other Asian nations still have authoritarian governments.
The difference in the attitude toward the human-rights issue reflects philosophical differences over economic development. While the United States and Western Europe tend to believe that political freedom goes hand in hand with capitalism, many governments in Asia, as exemplified most by Singapore, believe that free-wheeling personal liberty is not necessary for economic development and might even be inimical to it.
The Straits Times, a Singapore newspaper, practically gloated over the fact that Hong Kong had not already collapsed in the years leading up to this week's return to Chinese rule.
"The British nation's surrogate mourners -- the Western media, human rights lobbyists and crusading politicians in Washington and parts of the European Union -- had intimated what they wished to see happen to Hong Kong in the run-up to July 1, 1997," the newspaper said in an editorial on Tuesday. "An exodus of talent, the stock and property sectors on their knees, civil unrest, hostile noises from Beijing."
But, the newspaper said, the Hong Kong stock market is at a record high, property prices are soaring, and emigres are returning to a vibrant Hong Kong from "sleepwalking" places like Australia and Canada. "And China will no doubt again thwart the ill-wish of its detractors in the months and years ahead," it said.
If there is concern in Asia about Hong Kong's future, it does not seem to be so much about whether the press will remain free but about whether Hong Kong and China will be a harder place in which to do business.
Optimists say they expect Hong Kong to remain a capitalist bastion and to influence China to adopt more economic reforms.
"People say that Hong Kong might be China-ized, but on the contrary, we expect that China will be Hong Kong-ized," said Takeshi Kondo, general manager of the office of political and economic research at Itochu Corporation, a huge Japanese trading company with many investments in Hong Kong and China.
Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, the Japanese consumer electronics giant known for its Panasonic brand, plans to expand its Hong Kong operations to help manage the more than two dozen factories it has built in China over the last decade, said Yukio Shotoku, a manager in charge of China.
But many Japanese business executives apparently believe that Chinese rule will make it more difficult to do business in Hong Kong, replacing the rule of law established by the British with China's more arbitrary Government decision-making.
In a poll of companies with Hong Kong operations taken by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading financial newspaper, 31 percent of the Japanese companies thought Hong Kong's business environment would be worse in five years than it is now, while 16 percent said it would be better and 52 percent predicted it would be unchanged. That made the Japanese companies as a whole more pessimistic than the American and European companies, only 18 percent of which thought the business environment would worsen.
China has attracted huge outside investments because its 1.2 billion people make it potentially the world's largest market. But it is no fun to do business there, what with corruption, the emphasis on connections, restrictions and tariffs, and the pressure to transfer one's technology to a Chinese company in return for being allowed to set up shop.
Japanese automobile manufacturers, which raced into Southeast Asia and now control nearly 90 percent of some markets in the region, have been so wary about moving into China that they have fallen behind European and American rivals there. And some companies that invested heavily in China are having second thoughts as profits have proved elusive.
Direct investment in China from Japan fell 35 percent in the last fiscal year, according to Japan's Ministry of Finance. Investment in Hong Kong continued to rise, but that, too, could change, said C. H. Kwan, an Asian economy specialist at the Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo.
"The recent trend is that many companies are losing interest in China," Dr. Kwan said. "If you lose interest in China, the importance of Hong Kong declines."

Treasury Securities Rise in Price

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher yesterday, as the Federal Reserve opted to keep monetary policy unchanged and more economic data pointed to a slowing economy, with low inflation.
The 30-year bond rose 13/32, to a price of 98 31/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.71 percent, from 6.74 percent on Tuesday. 
 While the market was relieved by the decision of the Fed's Open Market Committee not to raise interest rates, analysts said investors were equally interested in scrutinizing today's report on the labor market for signs of inflation, which erodes the value of bonds.
But adding to the picture of a slowing economy, the Government reported yesterday that factory orders in May fell seven-tenths of 1 percent, more than the two-tenths of 1 percent decline that was expected. The April factory orders were revised upward to 1.4 percent, from 1.2 percent, and served only to underscore the decline in May.
"While the economy's apparent sluggishness in the second quarter, coupled with a still decelerating rate of inflation, kept the Fed at bay, there are still a number of developments in the economic picture that suggest caution in the months ahead regarding another round of Fed tightening and a potential backup in bond yields," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management.
"Most notable is the obvious dichotomy between the buoyant measures of consumer psychology on one hand and the recent three successive monthly declines in retail sales on the other."
Indexes of consumer confidence compiled by the Conference Board, a business research group, and by the University of Michigan, have been at extremely high levels, he noted, indicating that the weakness at retailers, which has also been evident in sluggish automotive sales, may be broken.
While another rate increase by the Fed cannot be taken for granted, it is probably best for investors to lean toward such a move in their expectations, Mr. Fine said. And some market participants said they believed that politics might have played a role in yesterday's decision. Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, noted that Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, has testimony scheduled for July 22 before the House Banking Committee. A rate increase yesterday could have meant a lot of criticism from lawmakers concerned that higher rates could choke off economic growth.
While investors' attention is always riveted on a meeting of the Open Market Committee, today's labor report will also be instructive in gauging the direction of the economy, and of the bond market. Mr. Fine said the consensus expectation is for a gain of 225,000 jobs to payrolls in June, which is virtually identical to the average monthly increase for the year so far, and would imply no change in trend of strong growth in employment.
The unemployment rate, at 4.8 percent in May, was at its lowest point in nearly a quarter of a century, and while the consensus forecasts calls for it to remain unchanged, a further decline would not be all that surprising, Mr. Fine said.
As the markets gear down for the long Fourth of July weekend, the Treasury market will close at 3 P.M. today and will be closed all day tomorrow. PSA-the Bond Market Trade Association has also recommended the early closing time today and a full close tomorrow for trading of municipal bonds and secondary money market trading.

Wrongly Jailed And Released? Now Pay Price

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
AFTER more than 11 years in prison for a rape he didn't commit, David Shephard landed a job at City Hall. He starts work at 7 A.M. and spends the day moving furniture, changing light bulbs, keeping the grounds of Newark's gold-domed building ready for company. It's honest work, and he is grateful for it.
"I usually spend my lunch hour right here, on the steps," he said, all dimples, as he stood outside City Hall in his Dallas Cowboys cap and a blue uniform with "Shep" embroidered on the shirt pocket. He looked like a man without a care. 
 But looks, as Mr. Shephard learned the hard way, are tricky little devils. At 33 years old, two years into this job, he earns almost $10,000 less than the $26,000 he was earning guiding planes on the runways at Newark Airport when he was arrested at age 20. Moreover, for about eight months, his paycheck has been docked $150 every two weeks by Essex County. The county says Mr. Shephard owes $18,000 in child support payments he didn't make to his fiancee for their son while he was in prison.
"It wouldn't be so bad if my girlfriend were getting the money," he said. "But this is reimbursement for welfare." He chuckled. "I thought everything would be all right when I got out. You'd think I'd have known better."
MR. SHEPHARD has the burly build of a bouncer and laughs this big man's laugh every time he tells this story. But he is not really amused. This year, his Federal income-tax refund was $1,878, enough for a security deposit and first month's rent on an apartment. But the county took the check. He will have to wait months and months, at least, before he has enough money saved to move out of his rented room and into his own place with his girlfriend, their now-13-year-old son and their 1-year-old daughter.
On the other hand, things could change soon if the Governor signs a bill that would allow persons wrongly convicted and imprisoned to collect up to $20,000 a year for each year of incarceration (or double their annual salary, whichever is more). Mr. Shephard, who inspired the bill, would be entitled to about $227,000.
His lawyer, Paul Casteleiro of Hoboken, says the bill "looks solid." But Mr. Shephard is not counting any chickens. Luck, it seems, has always been in short supply.
He had just landed his job at the airport, his son was five months old and he had big plans to save money for a place for his young family when the police arrested him. Never in trouble before, he was accused of being one of two men who kidnapped a woman from the Woodbridge Mall and drove her to Hillside, where they beat, raped and robbed her.
Based on the victim's identification (there were no other witnesses, no other suspects), Mr. Shephard was convicted and sentenced to a youth prison for up to 30 years, with a minimum of 12. He was a prison leader, football coach and researcher in the law library, almost eligible for parole, when DNA testing, done after his repeated requests, exonerated him.
WHEN Mr. Shephard started working at City Hall, three weeks after he was released, he and his fiancee planned to take up where they left off. She was living with their son and her parents, he with his uncle. Mr. Shephard applied for a $2,500 loan to use as a security deposit for an apartment. He learned from PNC Bank that he owed money for child support.
Louis Miron of Westfield, a lawyer with whom Mr. Shephard collaborates on talks to schoolchildren about the justice system and prison life, then began making phone calls for him. "I felt like the buck was kind of being passed," Mr. Miron said.
Weeks later, Mr. Shephard's paycheck was garnished based on a court order he had signed when he was unemployed so that his girlfriend could collect welfare.
Mr. Miron argues that since Mr. Shephard had found a job that would have allowed him to support his child before he was wrongfully incarcerated, he should not be penalized for payments he couldn't make while in prison.
"Finally, we were able to negotiate a consent order with the Essex County Counsel stopping the garnishment until a court could hear the case," Mr. Miron said yesterday morning. "The order was supposed to be signed and delivered last week, but as of today, I'm still waiting."
Yesterday afternoon, after a call from a reporter, the Essex County Counsel's office faxed a consent order to Mr. Miron. Nicholas Grosch, an assistant counsel, said that Mr. Shephard will now have to wait for the Probation Department to change his file.

HEADLINE: TALKING BUSINESS: With Gerald T. McQueen;
Javits Center, Cleaned Up, Considers Expanding to 42d Street

 BODY:
As a veteran police executive and specialist in organized crime, Gerald T. McQueen finds himself in a different role as president of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. Instead of routing out corrupt union practices at the center, as he was hired to do in 1995 as its inspector general, he is now presiding over a campaign to expand the center.
 Mr. McQueen was named chief executive of the Manhattan exhibition hall in January, succeeding Robert E. Boyle, who became head of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The management change came at a time of rapid growth for the convention business in other cities, a surge in business travel and tourism in New York and abundant evidence that a bigger convention center in Manhattan could be filled. 

 The evidence includes a report by Coopers & Lybrand that suggests that the size of the Javits Center, which is owned by New York State, should be almost doubled. Already, the center provides the core of a convention industry that generates $1.3 billion a year in spending by delegates in Manhattan.
 Mr. McQueen, 60 years old, whose career has included such posts as commanding officer of a Manhattan detective unit and chief investigator for the Ethics Committee of the House of Representatives, discussed his plans for the center with Thomas J. Lueck.

Q. The Javits Center is only 11 years old, so why the urgent need to expand?
 
A. We are operating at capacity and there are a lot of shows that we have to turn down. And we have fallen far behind other cities. The Javits Center is currently the 12th largest major exhibition hall in the country. And our research shows that if we do not expand, we will drop to 16th. That is based on the expansion that is already taking place in other cities, not just being talked about.
 
Q. Why has the city fallen so far behind places like Cleveland and Louisville, Ky.?
 
A. I doubt that expansion was part of the thinking here, because the Javits Center had other problems to deal with. The priority was to clean up what we had and better accommodate the business that came in. When I arrived in 1995, there were people sleeping on the loading docks, and you couldn't get any service unless you gave somebody a $100 bill. Then, the Governor stepped in and said clean it up or he'd close it. We interviewed over 2,000 people, brought in new employees and the change has been like night and day.
 
Q. The improvement was reflected in an audit last year by the state's Comptroller, Carl McCall, but has the message gotten through to the people who book conventions and trade shows?
 
A. Very much so. For one thing, we are getting letters galore from people praising our work force. For another, our bookings are up 19 percent for our fiscal year that began in March. That's the first increase in four years. We've got nine new shows, and we have had to turn others away.
 
Q. Some of the spillover has been going to the New York Coliseum and Manhattan's two passenger ship terminals. Can that continue?
 
A. No. The Coliseum and the terminals will close this year. And to make matters worse, many of the hotels that used to book small trade shows are doing away with that part of their business because there are so many demands on their meeting rooms. So the city is really strapped.
 
Q. How much expansion do you propose, where would it go and what would it cost?
 
A. We now have 760,000 square feet of exhibition space, and the most reasonable plan would be to go to 1.3 million square feet. We are looking at different ways to go about it, but this would probably mean acquiring three blocks, from 39th Street to 42d Street, between 11th and 12th Avenues, and expanding in that direction. That would give us the opportunity to be part of the revitalization of 42d Street. Our best estimate is that it would cost $700 million to $750 million. Now, that's a lot of money, but you have to consider the benefits when New York becomes the top place to go. There have been offers of private financing for the expansion, but we are not leaning that way. It would be some form of public financing by the state.
 
Q. Won't people in the State Legislature object, saying the center has been such a hornet's nest of corruption that no more public financing should be approved?
 
A. I hope we will be able to get our ducks in a row and people will see the improvements that have taken place. It should become obvious that the competition is not on the horizon, it is there. And when you think about the economic impact that an expanded Javits Center would have as a mecca for the city and state, you realize that every week or month that you don't build you are losing a lot of money. This project will take four to five years to complete, so I would expect to have a final proposal before the Governor and the Legislature within a year, if not sooner.
 
Q. Even if you expand the Javits Center, don't you still have the problem of access to the building on public transportation? And wouldn't conventioneers still have to deal with a shortage of hotel rooms because the center does not have a hotel of its own and rooms are hard to find nearby?
 
A. It is true that almost every other convention center has a hotel that joins its property. And we think our expansion plan would solve that problem. We've already talked to two or three companies that I'm not prepared to name that have said, essentially, they will be ready to start work on a hotel the same day we announce that the expansion has been approved. As for public access, we are looking at several possibilities. One would be a rail link -- a monorail -- that would move people from the center to Penn Station. But we are leaving our transportation options open, trying to take one step at a time.

HEADLINE: Cars, Loaded With Incentives, Are Most Affordable in Years

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 2

 BODY:
Car shoppers might not notice it without looking closely at the ads, but the auto industry is in the thick of a price war, with more rebates, cut-rate loans, cheap lease deals and other discounts than ever. And with family incomes rising at a hefty clip, these discounts have made new cars more affordable than they have been in nearly a generation.
For the first time since early 1981, the average car costs less than half a year's pretax income for the average American family, according to Comerica, the biggest Michigan bank. As recently as 1994, the average family paid the equivalent of 30 weeks' income for a new car. 
 But in the three-month period ending June 30, it took just 25.4 weeks of gross income to buy a new set of wheels. That, of course, is still well above the 18 weeks it took in early 1974 when cars were most affordable; incomes had risen briskly through the 1950's and 1960's while Government emission controls and safety regulations had not yet added much to the price of cars.
Yet the current figures are still a big improvement. The calculations do not include sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickups, which have also been getting more affordable lately, although not as quickly as cars, and carried record discounts in June.
Darcy Norris, a 41-year-old administrative assistant in Houston, just took a low-rate lease on a Jeep Cherokee after doubling her salary when she left her old job as a dermatologist's receptionist. "I see a lot of people able to buy homes, buy cars, things that were not in their reach two or three years ago," Ms. Norris said. "It has just been wonderful."
Darrel L. Resleff, 56, an insurance agent in Vancouver, Wash., bought a bright red Pontiac Trans Am two weeks ago because his insurance agency is prospering and Pontiac offered a five-year loan at just 3.9 percent. "I live in a high-growth area and things are going well for us," Mr. Resleff said. The low-rate loan "allowed me to buy a nicer car for my dollar than I could have otherwise."
To be sure, new cars are still not cheap. With an average price approaching $20,000, a midsize sedan remains beyond the reach of millions of middle-class American families. And many sport utility vehicles, at $25,000 to $35,000, are distinctly luxury items. But most models are getting more affordable -- partly because low used-car prices provide stiff competition, partly because there is a glut of practically everything but the biggest sport utility vehicles.
Some of the most generous deals are on the most expensive models. Lexus and Acura are offering dealers rebates of up to $1,000 on most of their sedans, Chrysler has a $1,500 customer rebate on its premium LHS sedan, Oldsmobile is giving dealers a $2,000 rebate on the top-of-the-line Aurora sedan and the Bravada sport utility vehicle, and Lincoln is offering $3,000 customer rebates on its Continentals and Town Cars in some regions. Low-rate loans are available on most cars and a few popular sport utility vehicles, like the Jeep Grand Cherokee, while Cadillac is now leasing its Catera sedan for only $399 a month, down from $520 last winter.
Less expensive models also carry discounts. The Toyota Corolla has a $700 rebate, while the Ford Taurus and the Dodge Grand Caravan and Plymouth Grand Voyager mini-vans all carry $1,000 rebates.
But while this is good news for car buyers, for the auto industry the myriad discounts are nothing to celebrate, representing forgone profits at a time when a vigorous economy should be producing strong earnings.
Comerica calculates that the average discounts on new vehicles have never been larger -- nearly $1,500 apiece for cars and a little less for mini-vans and other light trucks. That does not mean buyers will find unusually large discounts on particular models; the striking thing is that so many cars -- mini-vans, medium-size sport utility vehicles and compact pickups -- carry at least some discount.
While Detroit's Big Three have on occasion offered more generous deals, never before have Asian and American manufacturers alike offered such a wide range of discounts at the same time, said Suzanne B. Kinsler, an auto incentives expert at Coopers & Lybrand, the consulting firm. With the beginning of the 1998 model year approaching on Oct. 1, auto makers may offer even more generous deals on 1997 cars.
"This summer they're going to set some more records" on the level of incentives, Ms. Kinsler predicted. According to Coopers & Lybrand, discounts in six of the last seven months set records for those months. The level of discounts in June was the second highest ever, according to Coopers & Lybrand figures released today, only slightly trailing a peak last December. But the June incentives were more remarkable because they came during the late spring selling season, when most of the previous model year's cars have usually already been sold and big summer clearance specials have not yet begun.
According to Comerica, the incentives this spring have been even higher than at the end of last year.
A separate measure of affordability calculated by the American Automobile Manufacturers Association shows that the number of weeks of work to buy a car is the lowest since 1982, but that measure is narrower than Comerica's because it excludes the effects of low-rate loans.
After years of rising considerably faster than inflation, new-vehicle prices -- not sticker prices, but what people actually pay after discounts -- are up just six-tenths of 1 percent over the 12 months through May, according to the Consumer Price Index. Per-capita disposable personal income has climbed 4.3 percent over the same period.
David L. Littmann, a senior economist at Comerica, said that rising incomes explained less than half the improvement in car affordability. The time an average family has to work to buy an average car has dropped by two weeks so far this year, and only six days of that reflect rising incomes, he said. Rebates, low-rate loans and leases account for the other eight days.
Auto executives offer several reasons for the flood of discounts:
*A growing number of reliable, late-model cars are coming off lease, pushing used-car prices down and presenting millions of Americans with an alternative to new cars.
*Foreign manufacturers continue to build factories in the United States, while domestic manufacturers are keeping factories open, producing a glut of new vehicles.
*More customers are buying the largest sport utility vehicles and full-size pickups, which are in short supply, instead of buying cars, which the bulk of the industry's factories are still set up to manufacture, forcing auto makers to discount cars to sell them all.
*Most auto makers are aggressively cutting production costs, and are being forced by the competition to pass along part or all of those savings to customers.
*The strong dollar has allowed Asian and European auto makers to ship cars and car parts more cheaply to the United States, allowing these companies to be particularly aggressive in setting prices.
*Industry sales have slowed from the torrid pace in January, February and March, at least partly because many affluent households have already bought a new car or two in the last year and do not need another.
The seeds of the current discount war were sown last fall, when Japanese auto makers introduced new models that were less expensive to produce and when the dollar was appreciating sharply against the yen.
Reluctant at first to cut suggested retail prices, Japanese auto makers began offering temporary rebates, low-rate loans and subsidized leases on a scale they had never tried before. Some Nissan dealers, using a variety of discounts, began offering leases on small pickups as low as $99 a month. One exception to the sales incentives has been the Toyota Camry, for which the suggested retail price dropped $900 and which soon became America's best-selling sedan.
Detroit's Big Three initially ignored all these deals, then grew alarmed as their market shares began to erode. Over the last several months they have offered a succession of generous deals, like the $1,500 rebates on the 1997 Buick Park Avenue, Ford Mustang convertible and Eagle Vision TSi. The discounting is all the more remarkable because spring is normally the industry's selling season, when millions of Americans are preparing for summer vacations and are more willing to pay full price.
"It's reflective of an increasingly competitive environment which is aided by a still-undervalued yen," said W. Van Bussmann, the Chrysler Corporation's top economist.
James E. Press, a senior vice president at Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc., played down the yen's importance. With so many factories turning out cars, "there's more capacity chasing the customers that are out there," he said, while adding that "the late-model used cars are competing with the new cars."
Only European auto makers, benefiting from already high sales, have remained largely aloof from the fray, although Volvo has offered a few discounts.
So cutthroat has the competition become that when the General Motors Corporation came out with a new line of mini-vans early this year, Chrysler, which has dominated this market for more than a decade, immediately cut prices on its own mini-vans to keep G.M. from getting a bigger foothold.
Some Wall Street analysts have already reduced their estimates of industry earnings this year, but auto executives contend that this is premature. The spending on rebates and other discounts coincides with a variety of cost-cutting moves and with a general reduction in discounts offered to fleet buyers, like rental car companies, said Lloyd E. Hansen, Ford's controller for marketing and sales.
"We don't see the money we're spending really having much impact on our financial results," Mr. Hansen said. Ford's marketing costs, including retail and fleet incentives, have inched up to 8.5 percent of revenues this year from 8 percent last year, and have been higher in the past.
One reason the record discounts are nearly invisible is that auto makers emphasize them less in advertising these days, having concluded that loud talk of rock-bottom prices only cheapens a brand. The discounts have also become so widely and continuously available that some customers take them for granted.
Fred Peavy, a 38-year-old software consultant in Houston, questioned whether incentives encouraged people to run out and buy cars. "I don't think it makes a difference any more," he said.

After considering evidence that growth is slowing from its torrid pace early in the year, the Federal Reserve decided today to leave interest rates unchanged, betting that the economy could continue to enjoy low unemployment without inflation.
The decision had been widely expected among economists and investors, who argued that there was no justification for raising rates when the economy was cooling and there were no signs of substantial price increases. 
 As is its custom when it leaves rates unchanged, the central bank's policy-making committee gave no explanation for its decision after completing its two-day meeting this afternoon. It last raised rates in March, near the end of a quarter in which the economy grew 5.9 percent, when the Fed raised its target for the Federal funds rate, which banks charge one another for overnight loans, to 5.5 percent from 5.25 percent.
But Fed officials undoubtedly debated the conundrum of the day: Why the economy, now in its seventh year of expansion, is no longer following the old rule that mixing strong growth and low unemployment inevitably leads employers to push up wages and then pass along the costs in the form of higher prices to consumers.
"I don't think they understand -- and I certainly don't understand -- how we could have sustained growth for this long with no evidence of inflationary pressures," said Joseph Liro, an economist at CIBC Wood Gundy, an investment firm. "Whatever is happening, it's wonderful, and they understand that the Fed has no mandate to upset an apple cart that is moving along nicely and is stocked with very nice apples."
The Fed's decision to leave rates unchanged helped start a rally in the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 73.05 points to close at 7,795.38, with most of the increase coming after the Fed announcement. Bond prices also edged higher for the day, although most of the gain came before the Fed statement.
The Fed is next scheduled to meet on Aug. 19, and some analysts say that any signs that growth is speeding up again or that unemployment is dipping below its current 4.8 percent rate may lead the Fed to raise rates by a notch then, even if there are no concrete signs of rising inflation.
Today's decision was announced after the Commerce Department reported that orders placed with factories declined somewhat more than expected in May, the latest sign that growth was moderating to a more sustainable pace.
Orders fell by seven-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted level of $323.3 billion, after rising 1.4 percent in April. The April figure was revised upward from 1.2 percent.
The department said shipments fell 1 percent in May and that the level of unfulfilled orders was unchanged.
The first major indicator of the economy's strength in June will be issued on Thursday, when the Labor Department will report the month's unemployment rate and the number of jobs created.
To some degree, the economy's deceleration was helped by a rise in the long-term interest rates set in the bond market this spring after the Fed raised short-term rates. But long-term rates have dropped in the last month, and it is unclear whether they will continue to act as a brake on growth, especially with consumers reporting high levels of confidence about their economic prospects.
Since the beginning of last year, growth has averaged 3.7 percent, far above the 2.25 percent range that most Fed officials consider the economy's "speed limit." At the same time, unemployment has fallen steadily, and at its current level it is well below the point at which wage pressures have historically tended to accelerate.
But while increases in wages are picking up somewhat, most measures of inflation have shown absolutely no increase in inflation at the consumer or producer level, and business executives say they are continuing to offset wage increases by cutting other costs rather than by raising prices.
The cost-conscious business environment plus other factors like a squeeze on health care costs, productivity improvements from investments in technology and a temporary surge in the growth of the labor force have convinced some economists that the economy is capable of sustaining growth rates of well above 2.25 percent without igniting inflation.
"Since we believe the U.S. economy's noninflationary growth potential to be at least 3 percent a year, we don't see any pickup in inflation," Bruce Steinberg, Merrill Lynch's chief economist, said in a report today that predicted growth in the second half of 2.5 percent or slightly higher.
"But with the unemployment rate at 4.8 percent, the Fed will be hyper-sensitive to any signs of labor market excess, so every monthly employment report risks provoking a response from the Fed," Mr. Steinberg said.

HEADLINE: Fakes Blot A Nation's Good Names;
In Italy's Piracy Culture, Black Market Is Thriving

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: ROME, July 2

 BODY:
In February, the Italian police raided leather workshops in Milan, Florence and parts of Tuscany, confiscating thousands of bags with brand names like Chanel, Prada and Dior marked for export to Spain, Switzerland and countries as far afield as Japan.
The bags were not cheap rip-offs. Many were indistinguishable from the genuine article. And for good reason: The same craftsmen who lovingly stitched together the originals for the luxury market were in many cases churning out bootleg copies on the side for the black market. 
 For decades, Italian luxury-goods makers have had to fight a flood of counterfeits made in Asian factories -- a nuisance, but not a real threat because the shoddy quality of the bogus handbags, shoes, shirts and scarves gave them away to discerning eyes. Increasingly, though, industrial piracy is taking root at home, with the unnerving result that one of the most skilled sectors of the Italian economy is now competing against itself on world markets.
That is because most Italian luxury-goods companies farm out production to small, specialist workshops scattered throughout the countryside. And the temptation for some of these outfits to cheat on their corporate partners can be overwhelming. "I make a thousand bags and put them on the books," said Nicola Cerrato, the chief anti-piracy prosecutor in Milan, mocking their attitude, "and another thousand, no."
Actually, Italy's leather-making artisans are only joining a national pastime -- skirting bothersome laws to make a fast, tax-free buck. In Italy itself, an enormous market for pirated goods of all kinds has sprung up, rivaling those in East Asian countries like Taiwan and Thailand. This underground bazaar offers up everything from fake Gucci bags and belts to illegal copies of American software, music recordings and books. Experts estimate the size of the illegal commerce at $6 billion a year and growing. "The revenues in this business are becoming enormous," Mr. Cerrato said.
Much of the pressure to crack down on the counterfeiting is coming from the United States. Software companies, mainly American, lose an estimated $350 million a year in Italy because of piracy: the music industry, also heavily American, says it loses $100 million.
The office of the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, keeps Italy on its watch list -- a formal notification of Washington's displeasure that can lead to economic sanctions if trade offenses are not addressed.
In a report published in April, Ms. Barshefsky praised the Italians for stepping up efforts against piracy in the last year but urged a stiffening of penalties, which she said were "among the lowest in Europe." The maximum punishment, three years in prison and a $4,000 fine, compares with five years and an unlimited fine in Germany and six years and $77,000 in Spain.
The counterfeit trade thrives in a culture that winks at breaking rules and regulations. Lorenzo Mazza, the head of the Federation Against Musical Piracy, a trade organization in Milan, said that most Italians do not think twice about infringing some faraway corporation's trademark, patent or copyright.
"People copy software; people copy books; they don't pay television fees," Mr. Mazza said. "It's a society of shrewdies. If you can get something without paying for it, you do."
The dynamics of Italian business also make counterfeiting an easy game, according to Salvatore Casillo, a professor of industrial sociology at the University of Salerno. More than most European countries, Italy remains a nation of entrepreneurs, giving counterfeiters a vast potential supply of nimble and imaginative partners in crime.
The professor, who heads the Institute for the Study of Fakes at the university, said that pirate manufacturers were often "not true companies," but shifting alliances of investors and manufacturers. "There may be three or four people, and each puts in 50 million lire," or about $30,000, he said. "They purchase the raw materials, and contact willing craftsmen."
"They invented just-in-time" inventory, he added with a laugh. "They have no warehouses, and maybe 20 points of sale."
Counterfeiting has become so widespread that it anchors some local economies. According to Professor Casillo, its prevalence helps explain why some areas with high official unemployment, like Naples, have escaped social unrest: Many jobs exist that are not on anybody's books.
Francesco Zerilli, a police officer who oversees anti-piracy raids in Rome, offers the example of a criminal ring there, cracked earlier this year, that made black market watches bearing brand names like Bulgari, Rolex and Cartier. A circle of financiers commissioned the manufacture of cheaper, imitation parts, often from trained jewelers. The timepieces were then assembled in abandoned villas on the edge of Rome, delivered to legitimate jewelry shops for a fraction of the cost of "la cosa genuina" -- the real thing -- and sold to unwitting customers at supposedly bargain prices.
Mr. Zerilli said that in just the four months it operated, the ring pulled in between $3.5 million and $4.5 million. And the jewelry shops, which paid $300 or so for watches that retail for $2,500 or more, made a lot of money even after selling them at huge "discounts" from the prices for legitimate goods.
Similar manufacturing networks exist for shoes, handbags or luggage, he added. In Milan, workshops even use cheap Chinese labor to assemble the final products.
In Rome, pirated leather goods, sunglasses and other accessories are hawked openly. The peddlers, usually illegal immigrants from Africa, line up along the entrance to the subway station at Piazza di Spagna or along the bridge that leads across the Tiber to the huge Castel Sant'Angelo, the papal fortress. Occasionally, the arrival of a pair of patrolmen sets them flying in all directions, like pigeons shooed by cats.
Designer houses are loath to discuss the problem for fear of tarnishing their products' image and damaging the bonds of trust they have established with the craftsmen they rely on.
A Gucci Group executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity for those reasons, acknowledged that the "most problematic aspect" of piracy today is the emergence of black markets for Italian-made luxury goods in East Asia, Japan and the United States. The counterfeits, the official said with a note of exasperation, "are identical products, not of low quality."
Still, some legitimate businesses are starting to fight back. Raids like the one in February are increasing, and fashion houses are working closely with customs officials around the world to seize unauthorized shipments. In 1993, the Government in Rome established teams of specialized anti-piracy prosecutors in major cities like Milan, Florence, Rome and Naples. At the same time, legislation was enacted by which Italy put into effect European Union norms against intellectual piracy. Now fresh legislation is being debated in Parliament to stiffen criminal penalties.
Giuseppe Corasaniti, the chief anti-piracy prosecutor in Rome, said that recent law enforcement efforts have scared away many traditional investors in black-market ventures, with the perverse effect that organized crime is getting into the act.
"Through extortion and drugs, new capital is flowing, and they're investing in new technologies," he said. "Three years ago, we never found computers in Mafia hideouts. Now we find laptops."
Yet the software business illustrates how legislation can make a difference. In the early 1990's, according to estimates, more than 90 percent of the software used in Italy was pirated. Large corporations like the Montedison chemicals group, major banks, and even Government agencies like the national highway authority failed to pay license fees. But lobbying by software producers forced Rome to put into effect a 1992 intellectual property ruling from the European Union. Today, the threat of fines and even jail has brought the theft rate down to 55 percent.
While that is more than double the rate in America, the progress is real. "The market is understanding the legal risks and the technological risks, like viruses, lack of guarantees, damage to your image," said Nuria Vea, a former Microsoft executive and the president of the Italian branch of the Business Software Alliance, an industry group.
Mr. Mazza's organization, the Federation Against Musical Piracy, was set up last year by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry in London. In April, to emphasize the seriousness of the problem in Italy, the member companies held three days of talks in Rome, highlighted by a rally at which 150,000 pirated tapes and compact disks were destroyed.
Dump trucks heaped the contraband on a piazza atop Rome's Pincian Hill and then, in a carnival atmosphere, Italian rock singers danced on the pile, some whacking at it with hammers. Later, a small steamroller climbed the mound and began crushing the recordings, but skidded and got stuck in the slippery plastic. In the end, the recordings were swept up and carted away.
Despite such efforts, pirated recordings accounted last year for 21.5 percent of the Italian music market. That was down from 33 percent in 1995, but still represented losses to the industry of about $100 million.
Many loopholes exist. San Marino, the tiny republic in central Italy, belongs neither to the European Union nor to the World Trade Organization, so the absence of anti-piracy laws has made it a musical pirates' cove. Earlier this year, when a grand jury in Florida indicted 13 members of a ring accused of smuggling bootleg compact disks into the United States, the trail led through San Marino. One of the accused was Italian, and two were citizens of San Marino.
Some law enforcement officials say they are up against an unsympathetic public, which tends to view counterfeiters as modern-day Robin Hoods pitted against deep-pocketed corporations like the Walt Disney Company or Gianfranco Ferre, the Italian luxury fashion designer. "People say, 'Why are you protecting Disney and Ferre, and antagonizing kids who are just playing games?' " said Mr. Corasaniti, the Rome prosecutor.
What they don't realize, he said, is how badly piracy burns the consumer. Each year, Mr. Corasaniti noted as an example, the cloning of cellular phone chips alone costs consumers of the phone chips that were duplicated at least $18 million, and the practice is spreading. He warned it would be an uphill fight.
"It's like emptying the sea with a cognac glass," he said.

HEADLINE: Blair Gains Tax Cut for Business, But the Rest of Britain Must Wait

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM

DATELINE: LONDON, July 2

 BODY:
The new Government of Prime Minister Tony Blair gained passage of its first budget in Parliament today, giving top priority to a tax cut that will give British big business the lowest tax rate of any Western industrial country.
In that way, business was reassured by the governing Labor Party that it would remain the locomotive of an expanding economy, while the middle class waits for tax relief and the working class fares only a little better. Indeed, many people will find they are paying more in indirect taxes under the new budget and getting less in tax relief for things like mortagage payments. 
 It was the first budget drawn up by a Labor Government in 18 years, and it set Britain further apart from countries like Germany and France, which are still struggling with pugnacious unions, restrictive investment climates and expensive welfare benefits.
Echoing themes often heard in the United States and among adherents of a global economy, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown told Parliament that old jobs, old skills and old industries "have gone and will never return." Instead, he said, the road to a better future lies in fiscal discipline and strict control of inflation as the only means to achieving "stability, investment, work and opportunity for all."
The budget included a windfall tax on profits from privatized utilities, with the proceeds to go toward retraining workers displaced from their jobs during the Conservative Government that Labor defeated. This was one of Labor's central promises during the election campaign.
Still, the budget's overall emphasis was striking for how little it differed from that of former Prime Minister John Major and the Tories.
As Labor also promised in its campaign, Britain will keep its focus on spurring profits and investments by private business as the keys to global competitiveness, at the expense of new welfare and social spending.
Reaction in the City of London, Britain's financial center, was predictably triumphant.
"It strikes me as a very conservative budget on balance, with an accent on growth," said David Freud, a managing director with the investment firm of SBC Warburg, in an interview after the one-hour budget speech.
"This is very good news for the country because we have got fundamentally two parties now far more like the Democrats and the Republicans, instead of socialists and capitalists."
By far the biggest winners were large businesses, which received a further cut in the top tax rate charged on their profits from 33 percent to 31 percent. The comparable rate in the United States is 35 percent.
Small businesses will see their tax rates lowered from 23 percent to 21 percent. Capital allowances for buying equipment were doubled on plants and machinery in the first year of new businesses. The British film industry will get tax breaks amounting to nearly $50 million over the next three years.
And in a step meant to increase investments, the new budget immediately abolished an estimated $4.8 billion in tax credits previously allowed on dividends paid on pension funds. This is intended to force companies to plow the money back into their business activities, instead of paying them out as dividends.
The new budget included a variety of indirect taxes on gasoline, liquor and cigarettes and a cut in tax benefits on mortgages and private health plans. These will be shouldered largely by the middle class, which will have to await an even stronger economy before getting any tax breaks.
There were a few nods to the hard-pressed working class, in the form of more money for training the unemployed and for education in general, but they were coupled with a further tightening of welfare benefits. With nearly 300,000 people enrolled in largely ineffective training programs over the past few years, the move was seen as more symbolic than practical.
Labor set the tone for its business-oriented policies within days of taking office two months ago, when it freed the Bank of England to control inflation by raising interest rates without consulting the Government. Since then Mr. Brown has come to be popularly known as the Iron Chancellor, a man who delivers tough remedies wrapped in velvet words.
He displayed that style in his address today, with his mixed pro-business message and ackowledgment of Labor's traditional egalitarian values. "The central purpose of this budget is to insure that Britain is equipped to rise to the challenge of the new and fast-changing global economy," he said, adding that benefits should include "not just a few of us, but everyone".
The Chancellor, who ranks second in power to Mr. Blair, stressed that the Government's primary concern was to preserve the momentum created, in effect, by the Tories' policies of austerity and limited spending.
In fact, those policies fell hard on the poor and the working class, which bore the brunt of downsizing and cuts in welfare, even while they enabled Britain to achieve the lowest unemployment level in Europe.
On the Continent, average unemployment hovers between 10 percent and 16 percent of the work force and growth has slowed in the past few years. By contrast, Britain has a jobless level that hovers around 6.5 percent and the country is expected to reach a growth rate this year of 4 percent of gross domestic product. Inflation is about 2.5 percent.
Mr. Brown's message was that this situation is not good enough. Warning that consumer spending is galloping ahead of new investment and savings, he said the Government would raise some $9.1 billion in new taxes this year and about $7.6 billion next year to cool down the economy.
"I will not ignore the warning signs and I will not repeat past mistakes," Mr. Brown said, adding to Tory jeers in Parliament that "this and future budgets will be addressed to laying the foundations for tomorrow's wealth."
In the budget, Mr. Brown moved to slow down inflation in the housing market by slashing tax breaks allowed on mortgage interest payments from 15 percent to 10 percent and increasing fees paid on the purchase and sale of new houses from 1.5 percent to 2 percent. Tax benefits on private medical care for those 60 years of age and above were abolished because, Mr. Brown said, they had proved ineffective.
In addition, new taxes were imposed on liquor, tobacco, gasoline and diesel fuels; in general they raise prices by less than 10 percent.
To mitigate these measures, which represent a blow of sorts to the middle class and consumers in general, Mr. Brown said sales taxes, known here as VAT, or value added tax, would be lowered on fuel and power from 8 percent to 5 percent.
He also disclosed a tax on privatized utilities based on the vast profits they made by moving from the public sector to the private sector in the past four years. It will bring the Government a total of about $7.6 billion to be paid in two installments this year and next year.
The tax was a principal part of the Labor Party's election platform. The money will be used in a welfare reform program aimed primarily at strengthening retraining programs for hundreds of thousands of long-term unemployed -- victims of the significant revamping undergone by the British economy in the past decade, under Conservative leadership, when heavy industries collapsed and new service industries requiring different skills and paying lower salaries took their places.
Among other welfare reforms announced today was a reshuffle of benefits designed to subsidize firms that hire some of the unemployed. There was also increased financial support for single working parents and benefits designed to push youngsters to take jobs that become available instead of relying on unemployment benefits.
But under the new rules, benefits will be cut if those opportunities are spurned.
There is considerable doubt that such programs and appeals to corporations to live up to their civic duty by hiring the hard-core unemployed can work. The programs have existed for some time without significantly alleviating unemployment among the hardest-hit sectors of society, and appeals to corporate generosity in France and Germany have failed to alter the status of those left behind by globalization.

HEADLINE: James Stewart, the Hesitant Hero, Dies at 89

 BODY:
James Stewart, whose movie portrayals of decent, idealistic and naive small-town Americans made him a beloved national icon, died yesterday at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 89.
He died from a blood clot in his lung, The Associated Press reported. 
 Mr. Stewart's performances in some 80 movies earned him every major award bestowed for his craft, and consistent acclaim and popularity for more than half a century. He was the last of that rare breed of male stars whose careers certified the star system as it operated virtually from the beginning of the sound era. Actors like Mr. Stewart, Spencer Tracy, Gary Cooper, Clark Gable, Cary Grant, John Wayne and Henry Fonda were larger than life, and because the fusion of the performers' public and private personalities created something bigger than the sum of the two parts, something mythical.
The lanky actor with unruly hair and an ungainly stride had a boyish grin and an engaging manner. The Stewart way of speaking -- laconic, with a hesitant, nasal drawl -- is instantly recognizable by virtually every American. His early screen image, like his personal life, epitomized a Middle American ideal in a confusing, sophisticated world.
"America lost a national treasure today," President Clinton said yesterday. "Jimmy Stewart was a great actor, a gentleman and a patriot."
His archetypal role (and his own favorite) was that of George Bailey, the small-town banker in "It's a Wonderful Life," Frank Capra's moralistic fantasy in which the hero is rescued from suicide by a pixieish angel who shows him how much meaner life would have been in his hometown without him. The 1946 feature-length Christmas card was a failure among audiences, who dismissed it as overly sentimental, but in later decades it became one of the most popular movies ever made and a holiday staple on television.
After viewing "It's a Wonderful Life," President Harry S. Truman concluded, "If Bess and I had a son, we'd want him to be just like Jimmy Stewart."
But, as Mr. Stewart matured, the diffident innocents he played in the late 1930's and 40's gave way to more subtle and complicated roles -- troubled, querulous protagonists torn between firmness and vulnerability, roles in conflict with his accepted image.
Mr. Stewart's subtle and seemingly effortless work prompted the critic Vincent Canby of The New York Times to hail him in 1990 as a great behavioral actor who absorbed each role into his own physical frame, shaping the mannerisms, the voice and even the intelligence to coincide with those of his own persona. "This he does with such simplicity and ease that, for many years, the initial response was to say that what he does isn't acting, followed up by the damp, desperate criticism that he is always the same," Mr. Canby said.
The roles for which he was best remembered include a naively heroic young senator in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" (1939), a part that earned him major stardom; a forthright reporter redeeming a headstrong heiress (Katharine Hepburn) in "The Philadelphia Story" (1940) and a relentless defense attorney in "Anatomy of a Murder" (1959).
Also in the Stewart gallery of folk heroes were a gun-shy marshal who tamed a town -- and Marlene Dietrich -- in "Destry Rides Again" (1939); Monty Stratton, the Chicago White Sox pitcher who returned to the mound after losing a leg, in "The Stratton Story" (1949); a beloved big-band leader in "The Glenn Miller Story" (1954) and Charles A. Lindbergh, a boyhood hero, in his solitary 1927 trans-Atlantic flight in "The Spirit of St. Louis" (1957).
 
Ungainly, Self-Effacing And Somehow Debonair
Later in his career, a tougher, more worldly Stewart emerged in such Anthony Mann westerns as "Winchester '73," "The Far Country," "Bend of the River," "The Naked Spur" and "The Man From Laramie." Alfred Hitchcock used him against type in such films as "Rope" and "The Man Who Knew Too Much" and especially as a voyeur photographer in "Rear Window" and as a retired detective entranced by two forms of a mythic Kim Novak in "Vertigo."
When interviewed about his techniques, the self-effacing actor replied characteristically, "I don't act, I react," and described himself as an "inarticulate man who tries," without having "all the answers, but for some reason, somehow, I make it." He offered his criterion for success: "If you can do a part and not have the acting show."
His modest appraisal was challenged by Donna Reed, his co-star in "It's a Wonderful Life." "He's so natural, so realistic, that I never knew whether he was talking to me or doing the scene" she observed. "He's the most demanding actor I've ever worked with."
Joan Crawford, another co-star, praised Mr. Stewart as an "endearing perfectionist" with "a droll sense of humor and a shy way of watching you to see if you react to that humor."
Weighing Mr. Stewart's work opposite such matchless actresses as Margaret Sullavan in Ernst Lubitsch's "Shop Around the Corner," Jean Arthur in Capra's "Mr. Smith," Ms. Hepburn in George Cukor's "Philadelphia Story," Marlene Dietrich in George Marshall's "Destry Rides Again" and Grace Kelly in "Rear Window," Mr. Canby said: he "reveals a quality that at first seems out of sync with the shy, stammering personality favored by nightclub imitators. He is debonair. He has the same humor and lightness of touch that Fred Astaire expresses only through dance. Mr. Stewart is debonair when dousing Miss Dietrich and Una Merkel with a bucketful of water ('Destry Rides Again') or confined to a wheelchair with one leg in a plaster cast ('Rear Window'). He is debonair even when wrestling with terrible guilt and a sense of loss in 'Vertigo.' Also like Astaire when he dances, Mr. Stewart is best seen on the screen in full figure, with all of the lean 6-foot-3 1/2-inch man captured in a single frame. He acts with his whole body. The slight stoop and the way his wrinkled jacket hangs from his shoulders are as integral to his performance in 'Harvey' as any of playwright Mary Chase's lines."
 
As Best Friend To an Invisible Rabbit
One of the actor's most admired performances was that of the gently eccentric tippler Elwood P. Dowd in "Harvey," whose companion was the title character, a giant, invisible rabbit. The actor played the film role in 1950 after appearing in the whimsical comedy on Broadway in 1947, then played the role again in a triumphant 1970 revival in New York and London that co-starred Helen Hayes.
Mr. Stewart appeared in half a dozen Broadway plays and in occasional television dramas. Also on television, he starred in two of his own series in the early 1970's, first as a family patriarch and college professor in "The Jimmy Stewart Show," a bucolic sitcom, and then as "Hawkins," a shrewd country lawyer.
Mr. Stewart received the American Film Institute's eighth life-achievement award in 1980, a Kennedy Center Honor in 1983 for lifetime contributions to the performing arts, a special 1984 Academy Award for "50 years of meaningful performances, for his high ideals, both on and off the screen," a 1985 Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is the nation's highest civilian honor, and the 1990 annual tribute by the Film Society of Lincoln Center.
In receiving the honorary Oscar to a standing ovation, Mr. Stewart singled out for special thanks Capra and other directors "who so generously and brilliantly guided me through the no man's land of my own good intentions." He had also won an Academy Award for the best performance by an actor in 1940 for "The Philadelphia Story" and four other Oscar nominations, for "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," "It's a Wonderful Life," "Harvey" and "Anatomy of a Murder." Among many other honors were film festival and critics' citations, a Tony Award and the 1968 Screen Actors Guild Award for "fostering the finest ideals of the acting profession."
Young performers, he believed, should start on the stage and get as much theater experience as they can in stock companies and road shows. Adapting to a live audience, he advised, is an actor's toughest hurdle.
After getting his professional start on Broadway, he honed his craft in Hollywood's big-studio era of the 1930's and 40's, whose leaders he credited with great judgment, the courage to take chances and deep affection for movie-making. The studio system, he said, was "a wonderful training ground for actors and actresses."
"I came out here as a contract player at MGM, and I went to work every day," he said. "It might be a big part in a little picture, or a little part in a big picture. You learned your craft by working at it. You crawled before you walked."
Early on, Jimmy Stewart became a symbol of patriotism as the first top Hollywood actor to enter the service in World War II. Determined to become a combat pilot, he first logged 300 hours of flying because at the age of 33 he was too old to be an aviation cadet. He put on 10 pounds to meet the Army's minimum weight requirement for his tall, thin frame.
Mr. Stewart was inducted in March 1941, nine months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the United States' entry into the war. He qualified quickly as a pilot. Assigned to the Second Combat Wing of the Eighth Air Force in England, he was successively the operations officer, chief of staff and squadron commander.
He eventually led 20 bombing missions over Germany, hitting targets in Bremen, Frankfurt and Berlin. He won a cascade of decorations, including the Distinguished Flying Cross twice, one of them for piloting the lead plane in a spectacular raid on key aircraft factories in Brunswick, Germany. He also received the Air Medal, a succession of oak leaf clusters, six battle stars and the Croix de Guerre with Palm.
When the war ended he was mustered out a colonel but remained in the Air Force Reserve and, in 1959, the Senate approved his promotion to brigadier general, making him the highest-ranking entertainer in the American military. He retired from the Reserve in 1968.
After a long tenure as Hollywood's most eligible bachelor, Mr. Stewart was married in 1949, at the age of 41, to Gloria Hatrick McLean, a former model. They lived for decades in a Tudor-style house in Beverly Hills, at first with two boys, Ronald and Michael, from Mrs. Stewart's previous marriage, and then with their own twin girls, who were born in 1951. First Lieut. Ronald W. McLean was killed in Vietnam in 1969. Mrs. Stewart died in 1994. Mr. Stewart is survived by his other stepson, Michael, of Phoenix, and his daughters, Judy Merrill of San Francisco and Kelly Harcourt of Davis, Calif.
The actor was born James Maitland Stewart on May 20, 1908, in the western Pennsylvania town of Indiana, to Alexander Stewart and the former Elizabeth Ruth Jackson, who were of Scotch-Irish descent. The Stewart family had owned and managed a prosperous hardware store for half a century, and his father served in both the Spanish-American War and World War I.
Jimmy and his two younger sisters, Mary and Virginia, were taught the value of responsibility, prudence and frugality. When not doing chores, the spindly, spectacled youth wrote and staged plays and played the accordion.
At prep school, the Mercersburg Academy in south-central Pennsylvania, he went out for football, track, dramatics and music. During summer vacations he was a construction laborer. Then, at Princeton, he joined the Triangle Club, rising quickly from accordionist to leading roles in musicals. He graduated in 1932 with a bachelor's degree in architecture.
 
A Career Alternative To Architecture
The Depression era offered little demand for architects, so he tested his avocation, accepting an invitation from a college friend, Joshua Logan, to join the University Players at Falmouth, Mass., on Cape Cod. The summer stock company included Henry Fonda, who was to become a lifelong friend even though Mr. Stewart was a conservative Republican and Fonda a fervently liberal Democrat. The friendship endured, Mr. Stewart said in 1983, because "50 years ago we agreed not to discuss politics."
Mr. Stewart won his first major role on Broadway in 1934, as a gallant soldier-guinea pig in "Yellow Jack," Sidney Howard's drama about research on yellow fever, and then played a youth stunned by the adultery of his mother (Judith Anderson) in "Divided by Three." Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times acclaimed the neophyte's performance as "a minor masterpiece."
In 1935 he won a contract with MGM, where he made his feature debut as a cub reporter in "The Murder Man." The crime melodrama starred Spencer Tracy, who spotted the newcomer's tenseness, told him to "forget the camera is there," and later recalled how "that was all he needed; in his very first scene he showed he had all the good things."
Mr. Stewart's intelligent, deceptively casual acting in two dozen movies over the next five years earned him stardom. Among these early films, mostly comedies and romantic dramas, were "Wife vs. Secretary," "Born to Dance" (in which he struggled gamely to sing Cole Porter's "Easy to Love" to Eleanor Powell), "Vivacious Lady," "The Shopworn Angel," "You Can't Take It With You," "Made for Each Other" and "No Time for Comedy."
Returning from war in late 1945, Mr. Stewart insisted that his military exploits not be publicized. He avoided studio contracts and freelanced, earning increasingly high salaries and becoming a pioneer of the percentage deal, under which he reportedly received up to half the profits of his movies.
On screen, he shook off his country-boy manner and assumed a new persona, a complex, sometimes cryptic image that was shaped in collaborations in the 1950's and 60's with directors like Hitchcock, Mr. Mann and John Ford. The actor played a cold bounty hunter in Mr. Mann's "Naked Spur" (1953), a dedicated reporter in "Call Northside 777" (1948), a clown wanted for murder in "The Greatest Show on Earth" (1952), the photographer turned sleuth in Hitchcock's "Rear Window" (1954), the obsessive romantic in Hitchcock's "Vertigo" (1958) and a cynical marshal in Ford's "Two Rode Together" (1961).
 
Stumping for Reagan And Other Conservatives
Other later movies included "Broken Arrow," "The Far Country," "Strategic Air Command," "The F.B.I. Story," "How the West Was Won," "The Flight of the Phoenix" and "The Shootist," a 1976 valedictory to the career of a longtime friend, John Wayne.
Mr. Stewart shunned publicity, but was invariably good-humored with interviewers. In later years, he was a leading spokesman for conservative political and economic causes and a frequent campaigner for Republican political friends like Richard M. Nixon, and Ronald Reagan.
One of Hollywood's most astute businessmen, he became a multimillionaire, with diversified investments including real estate, oil wells, a charter-plane company and membership on major corporate boards.
On television he appeared in commercials for several years for Firestone tires under a contract said to be worth $1 million. Questioned about it, a spokesman said Mr. Stewart had "warm personal relations with the Firestone family" and admiration for their charitable gifts. In the late 1980's and early 90's, his grandfatherly inflections were heard on commercials for Campbell's Home Cookin' Soups.
In 1989, the actor broke into print with "Jimmy Stewart and His Poems," a 32-page book of verse that became a best seller. In later years Mr. Stewart became an advocate of protecting and preserving classic American movies against computerized coloring or re-editing for television. In 1988, he testified before Congress on behalf of a bill that later established a national panel to designate major films for conspicuous labeling to alert the public that they had been colored or otherwise altered.
His favorite movies were westerns, he said, "because they're told against the background of a very dramatic period in our history" and "give people a feeling of hope, an affirmative statement of living."
As he approached his 80th birthday, he was asked how he wanted to be remembered. As someone, he said, who "believed in hard work and love of country, love of family and love of community."
 
Mr. Smith Went To Hollywood
James Stewart made more than 80 films, ranging from frothy comedies to westerns and dramas of suspense. These are among the most memorable.

Stock Rally Pushes Some Indexes to Records
The stock market surged as the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates steady helped lift some secondary indexes into record territory but left the Dow Jones industrial average just short of a new high.
The Dow ended up 73.05 points, at 7,795.38, which was just below its record close of 7,796.51 on June 20. [Page D7.] 

G.M. Sales Are Down Sharply
General Motors said that its sales fell 13.3 percent last month, leaving the auto industry on track to end the second quarter with a whimper, after a stellar first quarter. [D6.]
 
Warnings on an H.I.V. Test
In the months before a Johnson & Johnson unit removed a home H.I.V. test from the market, Federal regulators issued stern directives to the company to clean up its quality control procedures, Government records show. [D4.]
 
Air Rules Leave Residue of Confusion
The new limits on smog and on emissions of fine particles of soot that were announced by the Clinton Administration appear to be generating more anxiety than anger in American industry. Few companies say they have the vaguest idea what the standards might mean for their operations. Still, it appears that utilities in the Midwest and South are likely to bear the brunt. [D2.]
 
Despite strong lobbying by business, the new rules were not softened from the proposals. But they will be applied in flexible ways, with oceans of time to adjust.
Peter Passell: Economic Scene. [D2.]
 
German Progress on Digital TV
Germany's troubled efforts to introduce digital television got a big lift as the main cable provider made peace with the two biggest entertainment companies. [D4.]
 
AT&T and Stet of Italy in Pact
AT&T and Stet, the Italian phone company, announced an agreement to cooperate in Latin America and Europe. [D3.]
 
Implant Negotiations Proceed
A judge has overturned a ruling in the Dow Corning bankruptcy case that had threatened to unravel months of negotiations by requiring the appointment of a new committee to negotiate on behalf of women claiming damages for injuries from the company's breast implants. [A16.]
 
Tax Cut for British Business
British big business will have the lowest tax ceiling of any Western industrial nation, after the new Labor Government gained passage in Parliament of its first budget. [A1.]
 
The pound rose against the dollar after details of the budget emerged. Traders said the budget did not appear to go far enough in curbing growth, leaving the door open for an increase in interest rates that would benefit the pound. [D5.]
 
'Safe' Smoke: Now More Likely?
Supporters of the proposed tobacco settlement say it could help bring about so-called safer cigarettes, long an objective of anti-smoking advocates and industry researchers, though not necessarily of tobacco executives. [A16.]
 
2 Retailers Name Ad Agencies
Activity on advertising accounts is accelerating again, with marketers like Barnes & Noble and Wal-Mart Stores among the latest to make decisions regarding their agencies. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D4.]
 
Companion Fare for Youngest Fliers
American Airlines said that it would offer a 50 percent discount on fares for children under 2, a move that was matched by other airlines and that offers a new choice for parents who must decide whether to buy an extra seat for their babies or hold them on their laps. [A16.]

Albanian Clings to Power
Sali Berisha refused to step down as Albania's President, ignoring his own promise to resign after his party lost elections. Nonetheless, he said he looked forward to being in the opposition. He also called for armed forces to encircle Tirana. Various armed groups prowled around the city, some of them temporarily surrounding the offices of Bashkim Fino, the Socialist Prime Minister. A8
 
Housing on Hong Kong Agenda
In his first press conference as Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa warned that rising property prices jeopardized the city's competitive edge as a regional business center. A poll published in a local newspaper found 78 percent of Hong Kong residents in favor of the Government taking steps to bring down real estate prices, which have jumped by 30 percent just since the beginning of this year.

Big Oil Spill in Tokyo Bay
A tanker ran aground in Tokyo Bay, causing a major oil spill. More than 130 ships were mobilized to clean up hundreds of thousands of gallons of crude oil. The ship, Diamond Grace, was refloated and arrived at its original destination, a refinery near Tokyo. The ship is registered in Panama but is owned by Japan's largest shipping company. Officials suspected that human error caused the accident, which happened in an area known for its shallow waters. A3

Military Officer Faces Trial For Marriage to Ex-Airman
Second Lieut. William R. Kite, according to the Air Force, made two mistakes as supervisor of military police for the 509th bomber wing on Whiteman Air Force Base: he fell in love with Rhonda Kutzer, now a civilian, when she was still in the Air Force, and he initially tried to hide the relationship from superiors. He faces a court-martial and a potential prison sentence of up to 14 years. A1
 
A Federal judge ruled for the second time that the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy violates the Constitution by discriminating against homosexuals for no other reason than to cater to the prejudices of heterosexuals. A18

Perils of Asthma Inhalers
A new study casts doubt on the safety of inhaled steroids as a mainstay of medical treatment for asthma, suggesting for the first time that they may cause cataracts.

Gov. George E. Pataki retreated from major parts of his plan for radical changes to the state's $4 billion welfare system, in an apparent concession that the provisions would not pass in the State Legislature. The plan includes a proposal to gradually cut cash benefits to millions of poor families by 45 percent over five years. Mr. Pataki also withdrew his demand to immediately abolish Home Relief, the state-financed cash assistance program that provides benefits for people who do not qualify for Federal assistance. A1

HEADLINE: Assisted Suicide Decision Looms in Florida

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

DATELINE: MIAMI, July 2

 BODY:
After the Supreme Court left it up to individual states to deal with the legal and ethical morass of whether to allow doctor-assisted suicide, few find the stakes higher, the debate richer or the question more immediate than Florida.
The Florida Supreme Court could rule as early as Thursday on the case of Dr. Cecil McIver and Charles E. Hall, a doctor and an AIDS patient who sued the state last year seeking to collaborate on Mr. Hall's death without the risk of criminal prosecution. Earlier this year a Palm Beach County Circuit Court judge sided with the plaintiffs and found that Florida's privacy rights laws outweighed the state's prohibition of "assisting self-murder," a second-degree felony. 
 The same ethical, religious and practical concerns that have made assisted suicide so divisive across the country have appeared in the legal briefs and arguments presented to Florida's highest court, the first such court to review an assisted suicide claim since the United States Supreme Court ruled last week that states may continue to ban the practice. But underlying the issue in Florida is also fear that in a retirement state where about 1 in 5 residents is 65 or older, the potential for abuse is tremendous, pitting countless terminally ill patients and others against the forces of ageism, economic coercion and depression.
"If you legalize assisted suicide in Florida, it'll spread like a wildfire to populations beyond the terminally ill," said H. James Towey, a former Florida health and rehabilitative services director who now heads the Commission on Aging with Dignity, a private group.
"You're talking about the depressed, the chronically ill, people with aches and pains who on any given month may have a bad month," Mr. Towey said. "In a state with a frail safety net for the elderly poor and with people thousands of miles away from family, it'd be a disaster."
Polls have shown strong support among the elderly and other age groups for the taking of life to end the suffering of the dying. But disagreement over physician-assisted suicide is sharp enough that the American Association of Retired Persons has refused to take a stance.
Drew Smith, a senior analyst for the Public Policy Institute at the retired people's association, said that beyond the moral questions, opinions among the elderly were split between empathy for those who want to be released from pain, and anxiety over the new mindset that assisted suicide would bring to the older patient's bedside if doctors, family members and the patients themselves accept a physician's role in hastening death rather than alleviating pain as one more option.
"There's fear of any kind of institutionalization of assisted suicide, that people might feel that somehow it becomes a duty to die," said Mr. Smith, who said that the retired persons' group had chosen to focus on improving the care of the dying.
People 65 and older have the highest rate of suicide among any age group in United States.
In Florida, Mr. Hall's legal arguments for assisted suicide hinge on a state constitutional amendment approved by voters in 1980 that asserts a stronger right of privacy than that offered in the United States Constitution. With few exceptions, the amendment says, "every natural person has the right to be let alone and free from governmental intrusion into his private life." The state Attorney General argues that the amendment never contemplated a privacy right for doctors who assist suicides.
Other states offer similarly broad privacy rights, and legal experts say state supreme courts are likely to become a popular target for constitution-based efforts to legalize assisted suicide.
While the Florida Supreme Court can limit its ruling to Mr. Hall's case, lawyers for the state say a finding for Mr. Hall would inevitably be seen as a precedent and would discourage prosecutions of doctors who aid in suicide. But even if the state court upholds Florida's ban on assisted suicide, both sides expect more litigation and debate.
"The question of the right to die with dignity is not going to die easily no matter what this court does," said Laurence H. Tribe, the Harvard professor of constitutional law who argued before the United States Supreme Court in favor of assisted suicide.
Mr. Hall, 35, a former restaurant owner who said he acquired H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, through a blood transfusion, is still mentally competent, his lawyers say, but he is deteriorating physically. Mr. Hall testified this year at his Palm Beach County trial that although he was not yet ready to die, he wanted Dr. McIver to give him a fatal dose of prescription drugs when he faced only extended suffering. He said that without a doctor's assistance, an attempt on his life could fail and might only worsen or prolong his suffering.
Dr. McIver, 74, a retired Jupiter doctor who is a member of the Hemlock Society, which paired him with Mr. Hall, is not willing to risk prosecution for manslaughter under the current law. But he defends assisted suicide for patients whose lives doctors cannot make tolerable.
"My responsibility to the patient is to do what's in his best interest," Dr. McIver said in an interview. "Usually his best interest is to live. But when it is to die, isn't it my responsibility to help him die?"
But the state Attorney General's office argues that it would be impossible to impose safeguards to limit assisted suicide to the patients for whom it was intended. The difficulties cited include determining mental competence and defining terminal illness, the role of depression in a patient's choice to die, coercion by relatives and fear that cost control factors could enter into the equation in the age of managed care.
The state considers elderly and disabled people the most vulnerable to abuse.
"Fifty percent of Medicare expenses is spent during the last six months of an elderly person's life," said Michael A. Gross, the Assistant Attorney General handling the appeal to the State Supreme Court.
Susan A. MacManus, a professor of political science at the University of South Florida, in Tampa, who is an expert on issues of the elderly, said older Americans might become less supportive of assisted suicide as they become increasingly concerned with cost controls in medical care.
"The growing disgruntlement among the elderly with H.M.O.'s is something that's going to enter into the Florida equation very fast," Ms. MacManus said.
But among about 40 friend-of-the-court briefs in Mr. Hall's case, the only senior citizen group to file one has sided with the patient. Members of the Florida Silver-Haired Legislature, a group that drafts mock bills dealing with concerns of the elderly and then promotes them among real legislators, call the purported danger for abuse "a red herring" for moral and religious arguments.
"It's like saying we shouldn't have money because somebody would steal it," said Monroe W. Treiman, 77, who is the head of the group.
"The elderly are abused for money and everything else," Mr. Treiman said. "But to say because that happens you're going to demand under law that they don't have a relief to get out of life when they want to is thwarting their rights. We say this is completely and absolutely wrong."

HEADLINE: Traffic Reports: Many From Few;
Most Radio News of Roads Comes From 2 Services

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

 BODY:
Let's say it is an early summer afternoon and you want to know why you are idling in comatose traffic near some commuter gantlet like the George Washington Bridge.
You turn on a popular 24-hour news radio station, WINS-AM (1010), and hear a traffic reporter, Matt Ward, tell you that a game at Yankee Stadium is clogging major arteries. Wanting an update minutes later, you change stations, and hear another reporter, Thom Rivers, give a similar report on a major New Jersey talk radio station, WKXW-FM (101.5). 
 Next you might listen to WQXR-FM (96.3), the classical musical station, where Melissa Sperling delivers road news. Spinning across the airwaves, you could hear Melissa Exelberth with a parallel report on a New York talk radio station or, if your Spanish is good enough, you might catch just plain Melissa issuing dire bridge warnings on a Spanish-language station.
To hear the torrent of traffic reports, you might think the metropolitan region is a veritable Tower of Traffic Babel, with competing reporters and helicopters thick as flies buzzing around summer fruit.
You would be wrong.
The vast majority of the area's traffic reports come from just two fiercely competitive sources, Metro Networks in a midtown Fifth Avenue building and Shadow Broadcast Services in an office park in Rutherford, N.J. Together, their 90-plus reporters provide traffic news 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to more than 100 area radio and television stations.
But to make it sound as if each station fields exclusive reports, the Shadow and Metro announcers often use two or three pseudonyms apiece. Some reporters keep their separate names taped next to their control switches for each radio station lest they forget. Mr. Ward said it was WKXW that came up with his pseudonym Thom Rivers, a play on the name of the New Jersey town, Toms River.
"Originally, they were going to have me use a different town's name each week," said Mr. Ward, an announcer at Shadow. "I was going to be Laurence Harbor one week and Bud Lake the next. I was afraid they were going to call me Elizabeth at some point."
The stations can also give the helicopters their own monikers: the same Metro helicopter is known as Chopper 95, Jet Copter 77 and the Island Chopper. The traffic reports have their own names, too.
"You can call it Fast Traffic, Slow Traffic or No Traffic, whatever you want to call it, we don't care," said Martin S. Quinn, who until recently was an operations manager at Shadow traffic.
Metro operates two helicopters; Shadow traffic shares its airborne reports with CBS News Radio 88, which has its own helicopter. Helicopters tend to fly only during rush hours because they cost $750 an hour to keep aloft. The rest of the traffic report is developed by reporters who monitor the flow from booths on the ground, using computerized data and remote cameras.
Traffic reporting resources have become so concentrated in part because the demand for up-to-the-minute information can only be met with the use of increasingly high-tech, expensive Big Brother-like tools. To maintain a constant vigil on major roads, both traffic services are investing heavily in remote cameras. Metro, for example, has a camera on top of the Empire State Building that can zoom in on three miles of roadway leading into the Queens-Midtown Tunnel.
With no space or financing for major new roads, science is deemed the best way to relieve the bumper-to-bumper blues. The city's Department of Transportation says the number of cars entering New York City rose to 1.035 million per day in 1995, the latest year available, from 971,000 in 1986. In the first three months of 1997 alone, some 850,000 more cars used the six crossings managed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey than in the same period in 1996. Officials ascribe the change to improved economic activity.
"If we can increase the level of information about specific incidents, then we can reduce the backups they cause," said Matthew Edelman, the general manager of Transcom, a traffic report clearinghouse run by the Port Authority.
But broadcasting more information generally does not include giving details about the gruesome accidents that snarl traffic. Instead, airborne reporters focus on giving hundreds of thousands of daily commuters a sense of how long any collision will take to clear.
They prefer to recall the wackier moments of traffic jams. Like the time a pack of wild dogs roved the Major Deegan Expressway in the Bronx, blocking traffic for hours.
Or the time a truck littered the Bruckner Expressway with five-gallon ice cream containers. Traffic reporters overhead declared the roadway cleared when sanitation trucks swept the containers onto the shoulder, but their bosses ordered them back to the scene because commuters were calling on their cellular phones to complain about delays. Other drivers, it turned out, were haphazardly parking their cars to grab the ice cream.
With or without the technology, there are certain immutable rules for traffic reporters.
The day before Thanksgiving is known as Armageddon. (The Fourth of July tends to be slightly better because departures are more staggered.)
Good weather often creates worse traffic than bad, especially on summer Sundays, with more cars and more careless drivers. "Any time I see a beautiful sunny morning I get nervous because we really get in trouble," said Pete Tauriello, a veteran Shadow reporter who pumps out roughly 20 reports per hour during the morning rush.
Commuters with cellular phones do report problems -- and both Metro and Shadow depend heavily on them -- but drivers call less often in the morning rush to work than they do in the evening, when they are eager to get home.
The metropolitan area is something like the Balkans of traffic control, with 14 autonomous agencies ruling some piece of the road network. Rather than trolling for road reports from the various agencies and the police, traffic reporters have come to rely on remote cameras in strategic locations over the last year.
Beyond cameras, the next addition to traffic reporting hinges on the expanding E-Z Pass electronic toll collection system. Transcom plans to install E-Z Pass monitors at fixed intervals along 100 miles of major arteries in all five boroughs within a year. The system will calibrate the time that a car, with an E-Z Pass tag and following the speed limit, should arrive at each monitor. If traffic is markedly slower, the monitor will transmit both the actual speed and a warning to Transcom and the pertinent agencies that something is amiss. (Transcom officials said the monitors will scramble the E-Z Pass numbers, so the monitors will not be used to ticket speeders.) The system will still likely require airborne reporters to assess bottlenecks.
Most New York and New Jersey stations demand that each traffic report cover the three Hudson River crossings in a minute, leaving scarcely enough time to squeeze in about three other areas.
Using the remote cameras, the reporters at headquarters can pick up the landmarks needed to predict crossing times. The Hilton Hotel in Fort Lee is the mark for a 15-minute delay crossing the George Washington Bridge, while Dickinson High School in Jersey City serves the same purpose for the Holland Tunnel. At the Lincoln, a backup to the top of the helix winding down to the tunnel is a 15-minute delay in the morning, when four lanes are pouring in, but 30 minutes in the afternoon when the number is halved.
"Traffic changes every minute, so it requires you to be like an omnipresent god looking at every single thing at every minute of the day," said Mr. Tauriello.
For Connecticut and Long Island radio stations, the Hudson River crossings might as well be in South Dakota, but traffic reporters said it would still take five minutes to report on every major roadway. Instead they highlight the bottlenecks that affect the most drivers.
Even with all the high technology, however, traffic-casting remains something of an art rather than a science. "To put a time on the crossing is pretty hazardous," said Neal Busch, a 30-year veteran of airborne reporting for CBS. He said even drivers who benefit from miscalculated times call to complain. "It is highly variable. If I say it is 25 minutes, some guy down on Route 1 and 9 will say, 'Oh yeah? It only took me 15 minutes."

Outlining Arguments for 'Rent' Trial
The battle lines are drawn in the "Rent" war. Late last week, lawyers submitted pretrial memorandums outlining their arguments in the lawsuit that pits Lynn M. Thomson, the dramaturge who worked on "Rent" when it was being developed at the New York Theater Workshop, against the family of the writer and composer Jonathan Larson. The trial, which begins in United States District Court in Manhattan on July 21, will determine whether Ms. Thomson should be named a co-author of the musical and receive the 16 percent of author's royalties earned by the show that she is demanding.
L. Peter Parcher of Parcher, Hayes & Liebman, a Manhattan firm, will argue that Mr. Larson, who died just before "Rent" opened at the workshop, is the sole author of the musical, and that Ms. Thomson's contributions to the work were covered by the $2,000 contract she signed with the workshop. Those contributions, he argues, fall within the normal range of services provided by dramaturges, who typically work with writers to iron out problems in their plays. 
 In building his case, Mr. Parcher leans heavily on the decision in a 1991 case, Childress v. Taylor, the most recent statement by the courts on artistic collaboration. In that case, Clarice Taylor, an actress, enlisted a playwright, Alice Childress, to develop a script she had written about Moms Mabley into a play. Ms. Taylor tried to produce the play without permission and without crediting Ms. Childress. The case wound up in court, with Ms. Taylor unsuccessfully claiming co-author status.
Mr. Parcher argues that the court's decision in that case requires Ms. Thomson to prove that she and Larson both intended her to be the co-author of "Rent" and that she contributed copyrightable material to the musical. "She cannot prove either," the memorandum reads, asserting that her contributions to "Rent" consisted of uncopyrightable "ideas and suggestions regarding character, structure and theme."
Mr. Parcher also argues that all versions of the play, and programs for the Off Broadway and Broadway productions of the show list Ms. Thomson as a dramaturge, not an author, and that her case essentially relies on remembered conversations with Larson in which she says he told her that he planned to reward her for her work.
Mr. Parcher will attempt to portray Ms. Thomson as an opportunist. "Failure to assert her baseless co-authorship claim until well after Larson's death is a telling indication that she is simply taking advantage of Larson's inability to speak for himself," the memorandum states.
Russell Alexander Smith, representing Ms. Thomson, argues that Ms. Thomson was in every sense of the word a collaborator on "Rent," that the term "dramaturge" does not exclude the activity of play-writing and that Childress v. Taylor does not require two collaborators to refer to each other as co-authors, to bill themselves as such or even to make equal contributions in order to be considered co-authors by the courts.
Mr. Smith, enumerating Ms. Thomson's contributions, says that of the 2,542 lines in the final script of "Rent," 1,212 were entirely rewritten or substantially altered by Ms. Thomson and Larson together, and that 48 percent of the final script is either totally new or substantially different.
Two ranks of expert witnesses have lined up to argue the function of the dramaturge and the nature of collaboration in the theater.
Robert Brustein, the artistic director of the American Repertory Theater, and Bernard Gersten, the executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater, have given depositions for the Larsons. Mr. Smith has enlisted a nine-member team including Anne Cattaneo, the dramaturge at Lincoln Center; Mark Bly, the chairman of the play-writing department at the Yale School of Drama, and the playwrights Craig Lucas and Tony Kushner.
 
Actor, Lawyer and Actor Again
 Think of it as a very long intermission. The last time Donald Grody stepped out on a Broadway stage, it was 1959 and the musical was "Bells Are Ringing," with Judy Holliday.
After a slight career detour, he has returned, in the role of Poole, Dr. Jekyll's manservant, in "Jekyll and Hyde." For theater insiders, the face should ring two bells, since Mr. Grody served as the executive secretary of Actors Equity from 1973 to 1980. As for landing the part of Poole, Mr. Grody said simply, "I auditioned like anybody else."
Back in the 1950's, Mr. Grody was doing well enough as an actor, appearing on Broadway in shows like "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" and "Wonderful Town." But with two children, he wanted to do better.
"One day, I thought, 'What's a nice Jewish kid from the Bronx doing in a business like this?' " he said. He entered law school, studying during the day and performing at night. When it came time to leave "Bells Are Ringing," Holliday arranged for him to be dismissed so he could collect unemployment benefits.
A long career as a labor lawyer and labor arbitrator followed. Besides negotiating contracts for Actors Equity, he served as an assistant to the executive director of the National Football League Players Association.
He also began writing a play about a black American actor of the 19th century, Ira Frederick Aldridge. "The more I worked on Ira, the more I was drawn back to the theater," he said.
In 1990, he eased back into acting, playing Escalus, a judge, in the Shakespeare Theater Company's production of "Measure for Measure" at Westbeth Theater Center. Then he landed the part of Arvide in the national tour of "Guys and Dolls."
"It had been 33 years since I was on a big stage, and that was a rush," he said. "This has really revived my life."
 
Footlights
 *Julie Andrews is not finished with "Victor/ Victoria." Tony Adams, a producer of the show, said the show's producers were in final negotiations for Ms. Andrews to step in again when the touring production travels to Houston and Seattle for six-week runs beginning in late August.
*Big bucks. The Theater Development Fund sold 1,658,251 tickets through its two half-price TKTS booths in the fiscal year that ended June 30. That total, the highest since 1982-83, translated into $53 million. The surprise is not so much the money as the fact that sales are made. The Web site for the Tony Awards (www.tonys.org) keeps a list of mangled requests from customers. A sampler: "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Farm," "Sex and Lodging," "Miserable Blob" and "Phantom of the Operator."
*Steve Ross, last seen as the manservant in "Present Laughter," returns to familiar cabaret terrain at Rainbow and Stars on Tuesday, followed by a cabaret newcomer, Davis Gaines, who opens on July 22.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
A Spaniard Who Has Carved a Niche Beyond Modern and Minimal

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
CRISTINA IGLESIAS, a sculptor from the Basque region of Spain, is making her New York City debut on a very big stage: the upper regions of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Perhaps this is as it should be. Although Ms. Iglesias has never had a solo show here, she has already had, at the age of 41, nearly 30 solo shows in Europe and elsewhere (including Greece, Canada and Seattle). Among those were exhibitions at important museums in Amsterdam, Dusseldorf, Germany, and Bordeaux, France, as well as in the Venice Biennale, where she represented Spain in 1993.
Nonetheless, this exhibition of works almost entirely from the last four years feels premature, as if it has more to do with the Guggenheim's new commitment in Bilbao, business capital of the Basque region, than the actual merits of Ms. Iglesias's work. On view are roughly a dozen slablike or gridded sculptures in materials ranging from cast aluminum or iron to concrete, glass, alabaster and wood, which are shown with seven big grainy photographs of related sculptural models. While these works introduce an intriguing and sizable artistic ambition, they don't as yet add up to a convincing performance. At this point in her career, Ms. Iglesias's art is seldom more than the sum of its many influences and precedents. 
 Ms. Iglesias might be called a post-modern post-Minimalist. Like many sculptors since the 1970's, she has taken Minimalism, the last major sculptural chapter of modernism, as her point of departure, but she has assiduously contradicted its pursuit of order and wholeness. In sculpture after sculpture, she has reduced the style to a series of idiosyncratic fragments that hover between architecture and sculpture while contrasting the industrial with the natural or the domestic, occasionally intimating the body and attempting, it seems, some form of social critique.
Several works involve thick vertical slabs of fiber cement that hug the wall, elements suggestive of a factory or a bunker in their material, and of a painting in their proportions and positions. The left-hand edges of these slabs curl outward as much as a few feet to reveal backing made of material from another time and place: a tapestry of a floral pattern or a hunting scene. Facing flat against the wall might be a third material: a sheet of clear glass or aluminum that provides a faint reflection of the tapestry.
Thus, these sculptures form partly opened sandwiches of materials and meanings that viewers encounter privately, one at a time, almost furtively. Transparency is opposed to ponderous opacity, the modern rubs up against the ancient regime and the decorative softness of woven textile, redolent of grand interiors, competes with austere, staunchly outdoor stuff.
While Ms. Iglesias's points are fun to juggle in the mind, they are also obvious and emanate from what are, in effect, little more than surface adjustments made to familiar sculptural configurations. One thinks of Richard Serra's hulking slabs, of Bruce Nauman's confining corridors, of Joseph Beuys's opulent stacks of felt and copper. It's never clear whether Ms. Iglesias is commenting on the works of her predecessors, adding a sense of history, economics and feminine intimacy to their efforts, or simply working in their shadows.
Several sculptures are just plain inert, particularly two installations in which bas-relief depictions of a bamboo forest and dense eucalyptus plants -- works that are, in essence, unusually tactile tapestries cast from life -- span the corners of small galleries. While the subject of these weighty, clearly expensive surfaces may be the modern world's destruction of nature's delicate fecundity, herewith rendered indestructible, the effect is corporate and anonymous, like some highfalutin form of lobby art.
A very few works indicate Ms. Iglesias's sculptural potential. One is a large, levitating ceiling in cast fiber cement that appears to replicate a shell- or lichen-covered surface; it can invert the gallery, making one feel like a deep-sea diver swimming toward the bottom of the ocean. Another is a four-part canopy of iron and translucent sheets of alabaster that casts the corner of the gallery in a lovely aqueous light, while suggesting a glamorous entrance that leads nowhere. Most impressive of all is "Untitled (Jealousy)," a giant cage of bronze-colored wood whose grid is so full of decorative variations that one cannot see into it. Playing on the Spanish and French words for louvered window ("celosia" and "jalousie," which also mean jealousy), the piece is a visual analogue for the emotional trap of jealous feelings and for the way they turn in upon themselves, multiplying and expanding beyond control.
Ms. Iglesias is also on firmer ground in photography, where she makes large, somewhat Romantic pictures of what appear to be small, hand-built models. These works add to the history of set-up photography, which includes Americans like James Casebere and Laurie Simmons, as well as European artists like Anselm Kiefer, who photographed toy destroyers floating in a bathtub. In photographs of thickly troweled monoliths, enclosures of shadowy grillwork similar to the gridded cage or a succession of post-and-lintel arches evocative of Mr. Kiefer's large architectural images, Ms. Iglesias evokes a flimsy monumentality that is mysterious and mock-heroic and that reduces the grand ambitions of sculptors and architects to child's play.
It interesting to think about Ms. Iglesias's own ambitions, where they might lead and what this exhibition might have looked like a few years down the road. In the meantime, it is at best an unwarranted survey of early work, blessed with a promising ending.
"Cristina Iglesias" remains at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, through Sept. 7. It will travel to the Renaissance Society in Chicago (November to January 1998).

HEADLINE: New York Skyscrapers As Ancient Temples

BYLINE: By MICHAEL FRANK; Michael Frank has written about architecture and design for Architectural Digest and Metropolis.

 BODY:
IMAGINE the death of Manhattan. It is far off, perhaps a millennium distant. The center of gravity has shifted away from this queer and querulous lozenge of real estate and settled in another part of the world, a cyberworld maybe, maybe a world still unimagined -- or unimaginable. Time and wind and water have ravaged the natural and the man-made alike, and the city's familiar face has eroded in some places to the skeleton underneath. Manhattan strikes the future observer the way ancient Athens or ancient Rome strikes us now -- as fragmentary, enigmatic, a memento mori at once powerful and poignant.
What does this future visitor see? Strange extrusions reaching gallantly toward the heavens, a veritable forest of them. Some, he concludes, were embellished, some plain. Some were brick, some limestone, others glass. Many have an unusual ziggurat shape, stepping back at mysterious intervals; others are slabs. Some are moderate, others taller, still others aspire to be the tallest of them all. Most are divided into floors of equal height, and these floors are further divided into cubicles of unequal size. Many people congregated in these buildings. Here they transacted business, here they sought shelter from the elements, here they lived and they died. 
 The visitor beholds, of course, a graveyard of skyscrapers. They are our temples, after all, our Parthenon and our Pantheon; only the god worshiped in them is Mammon. Ruined or whole, skyscrapers certainly say as much about the city and culture -- and sensibility -- of Manhattan as those venerable ancient edifices say about the civilizations that produced them.
Now imagine that, by some act of instantaneous, Pompeii-like preservation, two current exhibitions, one at the new Skyscraper Museum on Wall Street and the other at the Museum of the City of New York, were sealed up and saved for our future visitor. What would he learn from them about these magnificently complex structures? What do we?
The Skyscraper Museum's debut exhibition, "Downtown New York: The Architecture of Business/The Business of Buildings," approaches the skyscraper from the inside out. Carol Willis, the curator and founder of the museum, is the author of "Form Follows Finance" (Princeton Architectural Press), and both at the museum and in her book she emphasizes the machinery of the skyscraper -- its financial underpinnings, engineering feats and the program of its interiors -- over the facade. Her slant is fresh, rigorous and informative, although in its zeal to chart new ground it tends to diminish somewhat the role of design in the finished building.
The Skyscraper Museum fills a surprising gap in the city's inventory of museums. The history of New York begins downtown, of course, and after Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty, a visitor should, Ms. Willis says, experience Wall Street to understand how New York became the center of capitalism. "A tour of these downtown canyons is essential," she observed recently. "And so is understanding how they came about."
Ms. Willis has arranged the inaugural exhibition in a kind of canyon of its own, in a vacant banking hall at 44 Wall Street, a skyscraper completed in 1926. Two panoramic views of Broadway, from Bowling Green to Liberty Street, set the scene: one is from 1909, the other from 1996. They hang overhead, facing each other as if to constitute the actual street, while beneath them the space has been divided into separate rooms, each featuring a different aspect of the "business of buildings," among them rent, height, real estate cycles and the office. The installation tells its story with maps, models, period photographs and postcards, construction records and abundant edifying text.
A quote from Cass Gilbert, the architect of the 1913 Woolworth Building, provides the tone for much of the museum: "A skyscraper," he remarked in 1900, "is a machine that makes the land pay." And it pays more the closer it is to Wall Street -- or did in 1903, when land values were highest ($350 to $400 a square foot) at Broadway and Wall, while only two blocks away they fell precipitately (to $25 a square foot), as a vintage map documents. The importance of location, a real estate adage, is confirmed once again.
Yet even at a choice site, unchecked development is not always profitable: at some point, making a building taller becomes more expensive than it's worth; the money gained in rent does not cover the investors' costs. The exhibition explores this relationship, which Ms. Willis calls "economic height," while at the same time addressing the other kind of height -- engineering -- that makes skyscrapers feasible. Using evocative images of notable skyscrapers under construction, along with contractors' records and wall text, the exhibition charts the progress of skyscraper engineering.
We learn how the use of caissons made the excavation for early skyscrapers possible; how hot-driven rivets enabled them to rise higher; how the challenge of wind bracing was met in different generations, and how "building skyscrapers is the nearest peacetime equivalent of war." This remark is from William A. Starrett (Starrett Brothers & Eken were the contractors for the Empire State Building), one of Ms. Willis's "all-time heroes." Why such exalted stature?
"Because of the way the Starretts ran a truly armylike team of workmen, managed vast materials and worked with supreme efficiency," she replied. Indeed, the progress schedule of their work on 40 Wall Street, which is on display, is a formidably meticulous document, recording every step, from wrecking and excavation to masonry, finish carpentry and the installation of mail chutes.
 
Limits of Light and Air
 Two key factors in the evolution of the skyscraper were the zoning laws and the widespread application of fluorescent lighting and air-conditioning. Between 1889, when the development of steel-cage construction enabled the first skyscrapers to rise up and out of lower Manhattan, and 1916, when the first zoning law was passed, there were no rules: the speculator's borrowing ability (rather than the sky) was the limit.
Concerns about the loss of natural sunlight and air, both within buildings and on the streets below, along with worries about fire, produced the zoning laws of 1916. These regulated buildings by districts (commercial, residential and unrestricted) and limited the height and bulk of a skyscraper by requiring setbacks. (Height remained unchecked if the building occupied only 25 percent of its lot.) Zoning laws passed in 1961 made sheer towers permissible if set in a plaza or accompanied by other public amenities, and these rules helped bring on the hegemony of modernism with its severe glass-sheathed boxes.
Because of the way the museum insists on looking at its subject from the inside out, it's impossible not to think about how much the need for light and air determined the form of the early skyscrapers. In the first decades of this century, offices depended on sunlight for illumination, since incandescent bulbs generated considerable heat; the maximum depth from the building's exterior windows to its corridor wall remained fixed at 20 to 28 feet. When cool and abundant fluorescent light became available after 1940, the layout of offices and office buildings was much freed, although interestingly, the hierarchy of an office with a window (or better yet, a corner office) remains entrenched to this day.
Indeed, the Skyscraper Museum deftly, in some places downright nostalgically, depicts this hierarchy together with other characteristics of early office life. Skyscrapers feel like such quintessential inventions of the modern world that it's easy to forget how old they are by now and how much the work habits developed within them have evolved. We've come a long way from the roll-top desk (don't its cubbyholes now seem to anticipate computer files?), the Remington Noiseless Typewriter and even the I.B.M. Selectric II, whose rotating ball of type once seemed so futuristic. (Examples of all are at the museum.)
Similarly remote now is the tone of a magazine spread from Fortune in 1930, which depicts the offices of different executives and informs us that "particularly if a man be married, his office is more his castle than his home." An ad for Dictaphone from the same era appeals to "secretaries who leap like stricken deer at every blast of the buzzer," while one for Alcoa aluminum desk chairs is pitched differently to women than it is to men. Women, those delicate creatures, should buy aluminum because they worry about splinters and runs in their silk stockings; men, on the other hand, move around a lot in their chairs and need something "strong to stand up in the battle of big business."
Also evoking the past, though in a more sober way, is a fascinating architectural model of lower Manhattan, made as a planning tool by the preservationist Theodore Conrad in the late 1960's and early 70's. Cutting across SoHo is the once proposed but thankfully finally defeated Lower Manhattan Expressway, which would have ranked with the demolition of Penn Station as one of the great blights on the city's reputation. The model serves as a kind of loose coda for the whole museum: at once illuminating and cautionary, it compels the viewer, home-grown and tourist alike, to take a new look at Manhattan's primary component.
 
'Splendor and Lift'
Taking a different approach, another author and curator, John Tauranac, has helped mount "A Dream Well Planned: The Empire State Building," a modestly scaled but engaging exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York. Mr. Tauranac, whose book "The Empire State Building: The Making of a Landmark" (St. Martin's Griffin) has just been issued in paperback, is not so much interested in advancing a thesis as in celebrating what he calls the "splendor and lift" of what is unarguably the world's most famous skyscraper. As a result, the show is somewhat less provocative but more visual than its counterpart downtown.
The making of the Empire State Building is a classic New York story that can be told anew to every generation. It contains many of the themes seen as essential to the genre at the Skyscraper Museum -- finance, speculation, height and zoning -- as well as some that belong to it specifically, chiefly with regard to its totemic identity. This evolved, it seems, during construction. In a 1930 photograph, a sign at the site announces the erection of "An Office Building of Character" -- not yet the "World's Tallest," which was to come a few months later, out of a competitive struggle with the Chrysler Building for the distinction.
The site of the Empire State Building was a farm until the mid-1850's, when William Astor built a brownstone mansion at the southwest corner of Fifth Avenue and 34th Street. It was here that his wife, Caroline Schermerhorn Astor, held her famous balls in the art gallery: the room could hold 400 people, and they became the 400 of New York society, the milieu much anatomized by Edith Wharton in "The Age of Innocence" and other novels and stories.
 
Deadline of 18 Months
By the mid-1880's, the house had been replaced by the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel (represented here by a large and vivid 1896 watercolor, by Hughson Hawley, of a hotel piano and a spittoon). The site was bought during the boom years of the late 1920's, when its developers gave the architects, Shreve, Lamb & Harmon, and the contractors 18 months to complete the project, from the first drawings to opening day. This was strictly scheduled for May 1, 1931, because May 1 was the traditional date on which new leases were signed in 1930's New York.
Exquisite elevations from the architects' drafting table show the evolution of the building from its initial 65 stories to 80 and then 85. Finally, boldly and most impractically (except perhaps as a piece of public relations and an esthetic flourish), the dirigible mooring mast was added, pushing the building to 102 stories and a height of 1,250 feet. Lewis Wicks Heine's handsome photographs document the construction, as do the maquette of an eagle from one of the columns flanking the Fifth Avenue entrance, a much-chipped wooden model showing the building's massing and the Starrett Brothers' General Summary of Estimate (total: $26,069,000).
Also depicted, inevitably, is the difficulty of leasing space during the Depression, when the Empire State Building had the misfortune to open. Its initial occupancy stalled at 23 percent, earning it the nickname the Empty State Building. In 1935, lights were turned on in vacant offices to reduce the morguelike aura of a largely dark facade, as illustrated in a vintage image. But even during this difficult early period, the skyscraper attracted favorable attention. Other photographs capture Gov. Franklin D. Roosevelt surveying the observation deck and a moody and dapper King of Siam making a state visit with his entourage.
Despite its rocky financial beginning, the Empire State Building lodged deep in the city's collective imagination. It did this while it was still being built. How many other structures have been filmed as they rise, floor by floor, like a child learning to sit up, then crawl, then walk? This silent movie, an effective piece of early boosterism, plays continuously at the museum. Nearby, a case of souvenirs attests to the building's great and long popularity: postcards, models, china, King Kongiana, sculptures, lamps, salt and pepper shakers and the like.
Still, no tchotchke, elevation, photograph or reel of film can replace the experience of standing atop this august, shimmering structure, amid the swirl of clouds and wind and sunlight -- or moonlight or city light -- that opens up so infinitely and sparklingly from the observation deck. If only a single skyscraper remains intact when we're well into the next millennium, one has to hope that it will be the Empire State Building. There can be no finer vantage point from which to contemplate the city, whether ruined or vital, present or future. In many ways, the whole of Manhattan can be seen as a vast open-air skyscraper museum in which the Empire State Building will surely always be the most beloved, and telling, exhibit of all.

HEADLINE: Now About The Ones That Didn't Get Away

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN 

 BODY:
LORD BYRON had it right. "Man marks the earth with ruin," he wrote in "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage," but "his control stops at the shore."
The 32-foot work boat trembled away from the dock shortly after dawn, paused, rocking in the gentle sway of the channel off Freeport on Long Island, then groaned to life, picking up speed along the edge of East Bay and squeezing under the Loop Parkway. A few small craft hugged the rocky shore, overseen by kibbitzing gulls.
"Sit down on those cushions or on the cooler, anywhere you want; it'll take us about an hour to get out there," Mike Barnett, captain of the Codfather, shouted from the bridge. 
 It was an all-day deep-sea fishing charter: $500 plus a 15 to 20 percent tip for the mate; bait and tackle provided.
Mr. Barnett was rubbing sunblock on his face, listening to the crackle of the radio and staring toward the gently bouncing horizon. At a bait table affixed to the stern, Frank Cusma, the mate, was whacking a dozen mackerel into bloody chunks for chumming.
The rest of the charter was me, a photographer, an art critic and a magazine editor. To each his own, of course, but personally I would not attempt such an expedition without having an art critic along.
The cluttered smell of the land was lost first in a burst of marine fuel vapors, then in the clean churn of the water, agitated by the charter boat's passing. The windows of the waterfront houses caught the morning sun and burst into flame, one after another, as we passed near the looming water tower on Lookout Point, through the Jones Inlet and into the sea.
It was a clear, hot day in June, a little too early for shark season but perfect for bottom-fishing sea bass or, as we were doing, heading into the deep waters of the New York Bight to catch and release as many bluefish as we could manage.
I must admit, when I first called up Codfish Fishing Charters, I had visions of sharking off the continental shelf. "Look, I don't want to talk you out of anything, but this is what I tell all first-timers," Mr. Barnett had said when I booked the charter, the result of a string of word-of-mouth referrals that began with an ad in the back of a fishing magazine. "Shark fishermen, the guys who really love it, know that you can be out there all day and get only one decent hit. For first-timers, I recommend bluefish. This is definitely the way to go for people who just want to bend rods and have a good time."
So we found ourselves heading for 17 Fathoms, a fishing area about 12 miles off the New Jersey coast and 17 miles from the Jones Inlet, in the heart of the Bight, a kind of Levittown for bluefish.
Bluefish are nasty little specimens with sharp teeth and dense, oily flesh. In their favor, they are often almost eager to jump onto the hook, given modest encouragement, and once impaled they put up a good fight. "Bluefish are one of the best fighting fish out in this ocean, pound for pound," Mr. Cusma said. Small ones run 3 or 4 pounds; good-size ones 10 to 20 pounds; trophy sizes a bit bigger.
Here's how it started: someone had asked me what I really wanted to do this summer, if there was any activity that I'd fantasized about but had never got around to doing.
The answer spilled out: deep-sea fishing.
Who knows where ideas come from? My father, who was a steelworker all his life, kept a sacred box of South Pacific mementos in a loft out in the garage. These included a pith helmet bearing the carefully written name of every island he visited during World War II, a star indicating a battle. He once told me that if he hadn't married and started a family, he probably would have bought a small houseboat and wandered up and down the Great Lakes, a kind of handyman doing odd jobs. We actually owned a small boat once, a wreck with an outboard that we wrestled into Lake Michigan every so often, the steel mill's bleeder stacks licking at the smog-darkened sky. But we never went fishing, not once that I can recall.
When I pictured myself deep-sea fishing, as I did often when I got near the ocean, the scenes were Hemingway via Hollywood, Humphrey Bogart in "To Have and Have Not," George C. Scott in "Islands in the Stream," even Robert Shaw in "Jaws." It was a test of character, somehow; the sea sorted it all out.
If the result was less Ernest Hemingway than "Ernest Goes to Camp," the fault was not the sea's.
 
Bending Many Rods
We passed a few commercial fishing boats on the way out, but we were early enough to beat the first of the big party boats that come out of Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn and a half-dozen other marinas along the coast of Long Island. These are so-called head boats, because fishermen pay by the head, usually about $45. Many also charge extra for bait and tackle and other amenities. The boats are quite large and the owners pack on as many heads as they can, on weekends often resulting in something that looks like a floating porcupine.
"We call it animal fishing," Mr. Barnett said dismissively. "No one gets out of your way. It's frustrating. You catch a fish and try to follow it and they just stand there."
Of course, he's not exactly unbiased. His business, and that of all of the charter-boat skippers, depends on the qualitative difference between cramming onto a head boat and having your own vessel to go where you want and satisfy your whims.
Just about the time the jagged skyline of the Rockaways in Queens was receding into the murky horizon, the steep bluffs of the New Jersey Highlands rose up to the west. Where the two coastlines nearly meet, at the entrance to New York Harbor, a huge platform presides over the ocean like a preacher's pulpit. This is the Ambrose Light, the gatekeeper, guiding ship traffic into New York City.
Mr. Barnett slowed the engine and the Codfather began to bob with the swells. "Let's give it a try," he called. The bucket of mackerel was filling up. Mr. Cusma opened a cooler and pulled out a frozen chum bucket, a commercial preparation of frozen fish bits that he lowered over the side. Slowly, as the ice melted, a cloud of bloody speckles floated out behind the boat. He added a few chunks of mackerel to the stew.
"I think we'll try drifting for a while first," Mr. Barnett said. "See what happens. If that doesn't work, we'll anchor."
The sea is more crowded than you might think, even out at that distance. A couple of head boats were nearby; about a mile away in another direction some commercial draggers worked the bottom relentlessly, and almost everywhere there seemed to be grids of lobster pots, their black pennants dipping and swaying.
We slid a hunk of mackerel onto our hooks and lowered them into the ocean, where they sunk past the cloudy chum layer and disappeared into the dark green. Bit by bit, we pulled line from the open reel and let the force of the drift draw the bait farther out and down.
The photographer, who is also an avid saltwater fisherman, chatted amiably with the captain. "I troll a lot," one said. "I do a lot of bait, but I don't like to troll," the other answered. Then they started on engines.
Mr. Cusma sent out a couple of lines and periodically dropped more hunks of mackerel into the water. The captain parked himself near the wheel, chatting now and then on the radio with other charter captains ("Anything happening out your way?") and keeping an eye on the color scope, which displays the ocean at various depths and shows schools of fish as eruptions of red in a field of greens and blues.
The magazine editor, who does not eat fish, did not intend to touch any fish and was along mainly to feel the fishes' pain, parked herself on an upholstered bench beneath a blue sun umbrella and read a book about 18th-century European culture.
It gives me great pleasure to report that the art critic, who is the sort of infuriating character who can beat you at any game you name, did not catch the first fish. I did. Me. And I see no reason to mention his name, which is almost certain to cause him discomfort and embarrassment. Michael Kimmelman.
 
Suddenly, a Bite
My line was drifting in the general direction of a row of lobster pots, as were my thoughts. I wondered if any of that "Zen and the Art of Archery" stuff might work, if I should try to become the hook (Melville wrote in "Moby-Dick" that "meditation and water are wedded forever"), when my line suddenly veered in a different direction. I watched, frozen, as the line buzzed away.
Mr. Cusma looked at me with something close to pity. "I believe you have a fish," he said.
I sprang into manly action. "What do I do?" I pleaded. Everyone on the boat began to shout instructions: "Follow it around!" "Keep the line taut!" "Let it run!" "Reel it in!" "Go under his line!" "Don't let it go under the boat!"
The fish fought back with amazing force, the rod bending nearly in half. I tucked the end of the rod under my left arm, gripped my left hand just above the reel and began winding furiously with my right hand, pulling back forcefully and then reeling as the rod moved back forward, just as I'd seen Robert Shaw do in "Jaws."
Gradually, the fish lost its fight. "You turned it around," Mr. Cusma informed me. A few minutes later, it broke the surface, flapping up a churn of foam. "Good-size one," he said, leaning forward with a net. "Just bring it over a little closer to me."
The bluefish landed with a thud on the deck, spilling out of the net, flapping a couple of times, then gasping in the air while the hook was removed. "Don't put your fingers too close," Mr. Barnett warned. "That baby will jump up on you. Look at its teeth." They were impressive.
 
Of Fish and Men
A nautical chart showing the fishing grounds in the New York Bight is a fascinating document, speckled with shipwrecks and an exotic array of names for the fishing areas: Chicken Canyon, the Mud Hole, Fifty-Nine Pounder, Cholera Bank, the Tin Can Grounds.
We spent the rest of the day in and around 17 Fathoms. There were strange lulls when nothing happened and the current disappeared and we baked in the open sun. Then, just as mysteriously, the sea would shift and the bluefish would start hitting again. "Hey, if we knew everything there was to know about it, it wouldn't be any fun," Mr. Barnett said.
We got three dozen or so fish on the hook, ended up landing about 10 of them, the smallest about 3 pounds, the biggest about 12 pounds. I got the largest one (maybe I caught 6); my friend Michael had the one with the most fight; the magazine editor peered up from her book now and then to say, "Hurry, put it back in the water."
On the way back in, as the New Jersey Highlands receded and the water tower at Lookout Point grew on the northern horizon, Mr. Barnett talked about the path that led him to the sea. He worked for 17 years in Manhattan, and then his company suffered an economic crunch and he grabbed a buyout and escaped. "I thought, hey, I might as well take a risk and try to do what I always wanted to do," he said. Mr. Cusma had come to the sea along a similar path; his company had shut down his department a year ago.
I wondered whether my father, if he had been downsized out of the steel mill, might have done the same, at long last living out that Travis McGee fantasy on the Great Lakes.
The inlet was crowded now, fishermen clogging all the tight passages, a couple of jet skis whizzing across the intersecting wakes. Slap, slap, slap. The gulls were still kibbitzing over the rocks near Jones Beach.
"Anybody who goes into the charter business for the money is crazy," Mr. Barnett said. "But you know what? I worked for 17 years, going in on the L.I.E. or the Long Island Rail Road, and it was just disgusting.
"And now, I don't need an alarm clock to wake up at 5 o'clock in the morning. I can't wait to get out on the boat."
 
Going for the Catch of the Day
Charter boats for deep-sea fishing can run from $300 to $600 for a day trip to more than $1,000 for two-day excursions. Party boats generally charge $20 to $45 a person for a day trip.
In New York City, boats leave daily from the New York Skyports Marina, at East 23d Street and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive in Manhattan; Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn; 160th Avenue and Cross Bay Boulevard in Howard Beach, Queens, and City Island in the Bronx.
On Long Island, charter and party boats sail from Freeport, Point Lookout, Captree State Park, Moriches Bay, Shinnecock Bay, Montauk, Greenport, Orient Point, Mattituck Inlet, Port Jefferson and Huntington Harbor. The Long Island Recreational Fishing Guide, a free 50-page booklet published for the first time this spring by the New York Fishing Tackle and Trade Association, offers a comprehensive list of party and charter boats: for a copy, write to the association at 265 West Main Street, Patchogue, N.Y. 11772.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Laughing In Beijing

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
How delightful it must be these days to be a member of the Chinese Communist Politburo! Every time they get together they must laugh and laugh and laugh.
Every day they hear the highest American officials, members of Congress, the press, intellectuals, the lot of them, mesmerize themselves speculating on whether China will remodel Hong Kong or Hong Kong will remodel China. 
 The men of the Politburo know all these heavy-duty thinkers still have not grasped the new historic reality that Beijing has brought about: China is remodeling America.
Beijing has changed the thinking and behavior of America's President, political parties, top business executives, journalistic and academic seers, even of the guardians of its security.
Most delicious to the Communists, China has reshaped and diminished the value America places on itself -- its democratic and religious values, even its military security values.
Let's dispense with the question of whether the Communist rulers will dominate China's future or kindly allow one of its cities, the least trusted, to take over.
Why on earth should they? China and other dictatorships have shown throughout modern history that they can expand economically without expanding liberty -- as long as the democracies are so submissively ready to transfer their capital and technology to them.
About Hong Kong's own liberties -- China made its intentions clear before its flag went up. Beijing wiped out the elected legislature, bullied the local press into self-censorship and announced that 4,000 troops would be arriving, for starters. Foreign and Hong Kong investors danced and feasted. America mewed.
The chatter that investors will want China to be more "liberal" about human freedoms, and that this will bring some kind of contest between them, comes from a mixture of guilt at deserting dissenters and the muddy-minded assumption that investors in China care about anything except profits.
So back to reality -- the remodeling of America. (Our allies needed no reshaping to put money uber alles.)
Beijing could not remodel America by itself. It got American cooperation.
China did what America would not. It made human rights a tough part of its policy -- but the Communist way. Knowing its rule increasingly depended on total control, Beijing deepened repression. Then it added real international pressure: if Western companies said a critical word, or failed to urge appeasement on their governments, they would lose trade and contracts.
In America, the China trade lobby was Beijing's instrument of pressure, persuading Mr. Clinton to kill human rights as a part of U.S. policy. From that, all else flowed.
As an appeaser of China, the U.S. could not expect its allies to oppose repression elsewhere. America's sanctions against small dictatorships like Cuba and Burma became a mockery.
American politicians reshaped their thinking about foreign interference. Official and business life in China revolves around favoritism, bribes, payoffs. So it was natural for China to infiltrate American politics with money -- and for remodeled American politicians to accept.
The new U.S. Government and business thinking instructs us that a $50 billion trade deficit is good for workers; be happy. Remodeling also helps business sacrifice jobs in the future. China demanded and got from American businesses the technology and equipment to produce their products itself. After all, we couldn't make deals with them if we only looked out for American workers, right?
The new Clinton line was that if the U.S. was more understanding about Beijing, China would be less disruptive internationally.
The New York Times headline, July 3: "China Is Top Supplier to Nations Seeking Powerful, Banned Arms." The authority is the Central Intelligence Agency, the nations include Iran, Syria and Pakistan, the "supplies" are technology and materials, and the weapons are ballistic, nuclear and chemical.
The Administration knew about these deals but courteously accepted Chinese statements that it knew nothing about them and would not do it again.
America's new-think is dangerous to its ideals and security. But at least it is good for laughs in Beijing.

HEADLINE: A 15,000-Worker Presence in the Region

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The name Grumman, because of its long and deep role in the New York region's economy, still has a mystique -- especially on Long Island, where the company was founded. Lockheed Martin, while quieter and more dispersed, now has a comparable presence.
While both Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin have shed thousands of jobs over the last few years, the companies said that on the whole, they did not expect the merger to result in a loss of jobs. 
 "They really do not anticipate any significant effects," said James Taft, a spokesman for Northrop Grumman.
Between them, the two companies still employ more than 15,000 people in places ranging from Bethpage, N.Y., to Yonkers, Syracuse, Owego, N.Y., and Moorestown, N.J.
Lockheed Martin alone has about 10,000 employees in New York State -- mostly upstate -- and 3,300 in New Jersey. Northrop Grumman has 3,500 employees and 500 contract workers, all on Long Island.
Officials of the two companies said they expected the most immediate effect of the merger to be felt in Los Angeles, where Northrop's headquarters will be closed. Lockheed is based in Bethesda, Md.
Northrop's work on Long Island is mostly concentrated on design and support functions for two lines of military aircraft. Lockheed does systems integration work for ballistic missiles programs and optical and infrared navigation and guidance work on Long Island. Its New Jersey operation works on the Aegis air defense systems for Navy surface ships.
But while those programs have survived, both companies have been cutting jobs rapidly as the end of the cold war has reduced the military contracting pie. For Northrop Grumman, many of the cuts have been concentrated on Long Island. The old Grumman Aircraft, founded by Leroy R. Grumman in a Baldwin, N.Y., garage in 1930, was Long Island's largest private employer for many years before its purchase in 1994 by Northrop. Its work force, which peaked at 25,000 workers in the mid-1980's, is expected to fall to 2,700 by 1999. Lockheed Martin's operations in Lake Success, on Long Island, have receded on a similar scale, from 6,000 employees in the early 1980's to 630 today, heading toward about 500 by early next year.
Lockheed has about 480 workers in Yonkers and another 3,300 at in Moorestown, near Philadelphia. The bulk of its work force in New York is upstate, especially in Owego, where it has 2,600 workers, and in Syracuse, where it employs 2,100.

HEADLINE: Peso Crisis Bites Into Mexico's Long-Ruling Party

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: CUERNAVACA, Mexico

 BODY:
Teresa Lasso, who owns a beauty parlor and is married to a veterinarian, intends to vote for a leftist candidate when Mexico elects a new Congress on July 6. To explain why, she grabs a pencil to scribble the disturbing arithmetic of their $79,000 bank loan.
When Mrs. Lasso and her husband, Guillermo, took out their variable-rate loan in pesos six years ago to build a house, they and Mexico were prospering, and for four years they made monthly payments, in pesos, that were equivalent to about $660. But after President Ernesto Zedillo's Government devalued the peso in 1994, interest rates soared and Mr. Lasso's veterinary practice collapsed. 
 "People were just letting their dogs and cats die," Mr. Lasso said. Their loan payments completely overwhelmed their monthly income. Today their combined earnings are the equivalent of about $1,250 a month, but the payments on their loan -- if they were making them -- would amount to more than $2,125. They owe the bank $113,000.
"We think the economy is in crisis," Mrs. Lasso said, setting down her pencil. "President Zedillo says no, but nobody can pay their debts."
Like the Lassos, millions of Mexicans are preparing to vote against the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, perhaps more than at any time since the party was formed in 1929. They cite many motives, among them a simple desire for new leadership after decades of single-party rule. But the biggest reason is that they continue to nurse wounds from an economic crisis the Government insists has long since passed.
Before the crisis began two and a half years ago, the Mexican peso was worth about 29 American cents. In the course of a year, the peso's value eroded to about 13 cents -- and with it the savings of millions of Mexican families. Prices on basic items like electricity, gasoline and even tortillas surged. About a million Mexicans lost their jobs, bringing the number officially out of work to about two million; unofficial estimates put the figure at three times that. The economy contracted by 6.2 percent in 1995.
Partly with the help of a $12.5 billion American bailout loan, the Zedillo Government has succeeded in nursing the economy's figures back into recovery, and today, the PRI is in trouble despite an economy that looks robust -- on paper. Last year it grew by 5.1 percent, official unemployment and inflation are dropping and the stock market is booming. The problem is that many Mexicans don't yet feel the recovery.
"Our challenge is to convince the people that the economy is as good as the numbers say," said a senior adviser to Mr. Zedillo.
Up for election on July 6 are all 500 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, 32 Senate seats, six state governorships, and for the first time, Mexico City's Mayor, who has previously been appointed by the President. Support for the PRI has eroded more completely in Mexico City than anywhere else, so the dominance of the mayoral race by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, of the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, or P.R.D., was not totally unexpected.
But the PRI has run into trouble in many parts of Mexico where it has previously faced little competition, including Cuernavaca. A city of 320,000 residents an hour's drive south of Mexico City, Cuernavaca has never in modern times elected an opposition congressman. But this year voters have grown ornery, and the candidates from the P.R.D. and from the conservative National Action Party, or P.A.N., both have a chance to wrest Cuernavaca's congressional seat from the PRI.
Under Mexico's seat-allotment system for the Chamber, 300 deputies are elected directly from districts while 200 others are distributed to parties according to their percentage of the national vote. A party must win at least 167 seats directly and earn more than 42 percent of the vote to gain a majority; polls suggest that no party will.
In a national survey published on Friday by the newspaper Reforma, 37 percent of those polled preferred the PRI, 30 percent preferred the P.A.N. and 26 percent the P.R.D.
"Life in Mexico will change dramatically if the PRI loses its congressional majority," said Scott Morgenstern, a political scientist studying the Mexican Congress.
Lacking the votes to impose their will, the PRI and President Zedillo would have to negotiate the national budget, and opposition lawmakers for the first time could set up committees with the power to investigate corruption.
The governing party's support has eroded partly because Mr. Zedillo's economists have stabilized Mexico's economy but have failed to raise real wages, which according to a recent report by HSBC James Capel, a securities company, continue a 30-month decline. Mexico's minimum daily wage is worth about $3, and the number of workers earning less than that is growing.
The Lassos' gripe is that the Government works to bail out the bankers, while seeming to do little to help small-time debtors, and thousands of other Mexicans agree. A debtor's group that has joined forces with the P.R.D. asserts it has 600,000 members and estimates that some 12 million other Mexicans are up to their ears in debt.
If the Lassos plan to vote for the left, many others in financial trouble are turning to the conservatives.
Consuelo Martinez Gonzalez, 77 years old, and her daughter, Hilda, 46, have pasted a campaign poster for the P.A.N. into the window of their cement-floor home here, where Hilda earns a meager living by selling little black clay figurines of flowers and animals.
Both women were once PRI voters. But they turned against the party when Hilda's ceramics business all but collapsed in 1995, in the weeks after former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari left office, the peso devalued, and Mr. Salinas's older brother was charged with corruption and murder.
"Salinas did a job on all of us," Hilda said, slapping her cheek to demonstrate how the crisis felt to her.
"We went hungry, and the PRI showed us no mercy," her mother said.
The two women like the conservatives' image of honesty and efficiency, and in municipal elections in March, they voted for the P.A.N. candidate who became Cuernavaca's first non-PRI mayor, and they have become enthusiastic volunteers for the P.A.N.'s congressional candidate.
Some PRI stalwarts remain, like Alfredo Castaneda, the governing party's representative in Tetela del Monte, a working class Cuernavaca community that sprawls across a rocky hillside.
"Whatever you think of the PRI Government, its certainly helped us," he said. "We had nothing, but now Tetela has sewer lines, paved streets, running water. Its all come from the PRI Government."
Mr. Castaneda's role has been to channel public works to Tetela, and to deliver neighbors' votes to the PRI in exchange for the right to hand out patronage jobs. But since the PRI lost Cuernavaca's City Hall to the opposition in March, he no longer has jobs to give.
So prospects for the July 6 balloting are uncertain, he said.
"Before, we could tell people who to vote for," Mr. Castaneda said. "But now people vote for whomever they want."

HEADLINE: Angling for Foreign Tourists;
Some U.S. Cities Team Up to Attract Overseas Dollars

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
With its many cultural institutions, fine dining, elegant 19th-century architecture and daily nonstop flights to five European cities, Cincinnati would seem to have much of what it takes to become a prime destination for international tourists -- a record 46.3 million of whom visited the United States last year.
But it isn't, of course. What traveler would mention this Ohio River town in the same breath with Yellowstone or the Everglades or the Lincoln Memorial? Not that Cincinnati is totally lacking in foreign tourists -- it gets at least 200,000 a year. But that is dwarfed, for example, by the roughly 500,000 foreigners who trek each year to Pigeon Forge, Tenn., a hamlet of just 3,600 or so residents that has cashed in handsomely from its six outlet malls; Dolly Parton's theme park, Dollywood, and its proximity to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. 
 The Queen City, as Cincinnati is known, is trying mightily to put itself on the tourist map. But it is well aware that it cannot do it alone -- and that it will never be one of the first destinations of a foreign traveler. So in May it joined forces with two cities with the same goal -- Louisville, Ky., 100 miles to the southwest, and Indianapolis, 100 miles to the northwest.
On the theory that the whole can be greater than the sum of its parts, this triangle of cities is marketing itself as a package to foreign tourists -- initially from Britain, France and Germany but perhaps later from Japan and other increasingly affluent Asian locations. The campaign aims to convince foreign tourists that these cities would make ideal stops on a second or third trip after a traveler has seen the Golden Gate Bridge and the lights of Broadway.
Foreign tourist dollars are increasingly coveted across the nation, even by places that would seem unlikely tourist destinations. With many midsized cities establishing themselves as centers for business services and entertainment for the surrounding region, the international tourist trade offers an ideal way to add a dollop of frosting -- especially since these are outside dollars, not just local dollars recycled through local businesses.
Consider: The 46.3 million international travelers who visited the United States last year, according to the Commerce Department's Tourism Industries Office, spent $84 billion and supported about a million full-time jobs.
Domestic travel expenditures by United States residents grew a respectable 77 percent in the decade from 1986 to 1996 to $383 billion, according to the Travel Industry of America. But in that same period, foreign tourists' total travel expenditures in the United States more than tripled.
Wherever those tourist billions land, they create jobs, help pay for schools and libraries, and help keep taxes on local residents down. Cincinnati, with 3.5 million to 4 million total tourists annually, calculates that visitors spent $2.1 billion last year, accounting for the equivalent of 73,000 full-time jobs.
But like most cities with pride in what they have to offer, Cincinnati wants even more tourists -- and the more free-spending visitors from abroad, the better. Despite the recent strength of the dollar, the United States remains a veritable bargain basement for tourists from Europe and Asia.
"We're saying to foreign visitors, 'You've already seen New York, Disneyland and San Francisco,' " said Dan M. Lincoln, vice president for tourism at the Greater Cincinnati Convention and Visitors Bureau. "Now spend at least two or three days in Cincinnati, another few days in Louisville, a Southern city, seeing horse farms and other attractions, and a few days in Indianapolis, a Midwestern city, the motor car racing capital of the U.S."
Joining forces to lure tourists is nothing new. There are almost a dozen regional trade and tourism alliances in the United States -- from Travel South, involving 11 Southern states, to Mississippi River Country USA, made up of 10 states from Minnesota to Louisiana.
But the Cincinnati-Louisville-Indianapolis experiment is the first long-term three-city, three-state partnership aimed solely at foreign tourists.
Even cities whose popularity is not in doubt are forming alliances. On July 1, Phoenix, San Diego, and Las Vegas, Nev., kicked off a three-year marketing plan aimed at enticing foreign visitors to sample desert, beach and gambling casinos in one visit. The alliance partners will focus on Europe the first year, on Japan and other Asian nations the second year, then perhaps Latin America.
"There are not many stand-alone tourist destinations," said Robert M. Lander, vice president for marketing at the Phoenix and Valley of the Sun Convention and Visitors Bureau. "Not too many tourists will travel long distances to visit one destination or one or two sites. That's why you're going to see more and more of these strategic alliances."
Las Vegas already attracts 29.6 million visitors a year, including 5.3 million from abroad, but it is looking for even more foreigners to fill its casinos, restaurants and hotels.
It is not just a matter of luring visitors, of course. Travel industry officials say foreigners could quickly sour on visits to cities or sites that are ill prepared to receive them, whether because they lack currency exchanges or guidebooks in their languages. But with English gradually becoming the language of international tourism as well as of commerce, others say, the problem is becoming ever more manageable.
Industry officials also say it is not cost effective for widely separated cities to forge partnerships aimed at domestic travelers. Weekend travel accounts for 52 percent of all domestic travel, according to the Travel Data Center of the Commerce Department, up 10 percentage points from 1986, so Americans rarely have time to visit more than a single city on one trip.
Still, all the alliance cities welcome domestic tour groups, especially escorted bus tours, whose one- to three-week itineraries make multicity visits possible. While such tourists are not as ready to part with money as foreign visitors are, the American Bus Association estimates that passengers on a fully loaded bus (about 46 passengers) spend $5,000 to $7,000 during the typical overnight stay. Altogether, the direct economic impact of the group tour business in 1996 exceeded $11.6 billion.
Memphis recently concluded two unusual marketing alliances. Together with New Orleans and St. Louis, it is promoting the 700-mile stretch along Interstate 55 ("America's Music Corridor"), inviting foreigners to visit the cities that gave birth to the blues, ragtime, jazz and rock 'n' roll. And after KLM Royal Dutch Airlines -- in a code-sharing agreement with Northwest Airlines -- inaugurated a daily Memphis-Amsterdam nonstop flight two years ago, Memphis proposed an alliance with the Mississippi State Department of Tourism to promote "America's Blues Alley."
"We felt it was time to open the Mississippi Delta to international marketing," said Kevin Kane, president of the Memphis Convention and Visitors Bureau. "We know Memphis isn't a five-night, four-day tourist destination. But we're a good three-night, two-day destination."
Memphis and Mississippi are promoting to European travelers historic Memphis attractions like Beale Street, the house of W. C. Handy, and Graceland, Elvis Presley's home for 20 years. But it is also pushing Mississippi attractions like the house of the blues singer Muddy Waters, the ranch of the rock legend Jerry Lee Lewis and Gulf Coast beaches.
"Foreign visitors, especially Europeans," Mr. Kane said, "are also interested in antebellum houses, cotton plantations, and Civil War battle sites in Mississippi, as well as the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, on the site of the Lorraine Motel, where Martin Luther King Jr. was murdered."
Memphis gets 8 million to 10 million tourists a year, Mr. Kane said, 14 percent of whom are foreigners. "We'd like even more," he said, "but in 1988 that figure was only about 8 percent, and most of our growth has come in the past couple of years."
Most city alliances are marketed through foreign tour operators or wholesalers, who bundle tours and itineraries into packages that are sold to individual vacationers or groups through travel agents and airlines. Like Americans who buy tour packages to England or France, say, foreign tourists can elect to travel alone, with companions or as part of a group.
By marketing directly to tour operators and wholesalers, cities that belong to such partnerships keep costs low. Mr. Lander of Phoenix said the partnership with Las Vegas and San Diego would cost the cites not much more than $100,000 each the first year. The biggest expense is usually the cost of a representative in one or several foreign cities. The Cincinnati-Louisville-Indianapolis group has a sales representative in London, while Memphis-Mississippi has a marketing representative in both Paris and Frankfurt, as well as a public relations representative in London.
The cost of familiarization trips, on which foreign travel writers are invited to sample local sights, is often underwritten by airlines, local hotels, restaurants and attractions. To call attention to its $11 million Splendors of Versailles exhibit, starting next April at the Mississippi Arts Pavilion, Jackson, Miss., will sponsor two media tours to Versailles, France, in September.
While Jackson is not usually thought of as a major tourist city, a strong Mississippi economy and tax revenue from the state's riverboat casinos have helped push it into the bigger leagues. The city's Palaces of St. Petersburg: Russian Imperial Style exhibit last year, also at the Arts Pavilion and also costing $11 million, drew 553,894 tourists, many from overseas, netted the state more than $4 million in sales tax revenue, and brought in $68 million over all.
"It raised the profile of Mississippi as a state with cultural enrichment," said Jack Kyle, executive director of the Mississippi Commission for International Cultural Exchange.
It also resulted in eight other cities affiliating with Jackson for next year's exhibit, including New Orleans and Baton Rouge, La.
"It's a wonderful way for cities to cross-promote," said Beverly Gianna, a spokeswoman for the New Orleans Metropolitan Convention and Visitors Bureau. "We're planning exhibits and lectures tied to our French heritage, and we're arranging to have historic houses opened that have never been open before. The exhibit's almost a year away, but this is already shaping up as the most exciting promotion I've worked on in 23 years."

While many midsized cities continue to grow as regional centers for business services and entertainment, they are increasingly looking for ways to appeal to the 46.3 million international tourists who spent $84 billion in the United States last year. Cincinnati and Memphis, for example, have formed alliances with different neighboring cities in an attempt to alter the perception many travelers have of their cities.

HEADLINE: Unions at G.E. Approve 3-Year Contract

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: FAIRFIELD, Conn., July 3

 BODY:
Two unions representing about 27,000 workers at the General Electric Company have tentatively agreed on a three-year contract calling for raises totaling 8.75 percent, the company said today.
Under the agreement, the first raise -- 3.75 percent -- took effect Monday and will be followed by an increase of 2.5 percent in June 1998 and 2.5 percent in June 1999, General Electric said in a statement. 
 The unions' members will vote on the contracts next week.
The tentative agreements were reached on Sunday by negotiators representing G.E., the International Union of Electronic Workers and the United Electrical Workers of America after five weeks of bargaining, the company said.
The general pay increases, six cost-of-living adjustments and a wage structure increase for higher-wage employees are expected to raise the pay of the average employee by more than 13 percent over the contract period -- assuming 2.9 percent for annual inflation, G.E. said.
The contract mainly covers workers who build aircraft engines, locomotives, appliances and other products.
The contract also contains provisions for the two sides to negotiate over subcontracting and similar actions.

Gold Plunges as Central Bank In Australia Sells 167 Tons

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Gold prices plunged yesterday to an 11 1/2-year low on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange after Australia's central bank said it had sold 167 metric tons from its reserves.
The sale raised speculation that other central banks could cut their holdings as gold loses its allure as a haven from economic and political turmoil. 
 On other commodity markets, crude oil and cocoa dropped.
The sale by the Reserve Bank of Australia represented about $1.784 billion in gold, based on prices before the announcement. The move was the latest in a series of central bank gold sales. Belgium and the Netherlands both sold gold last year and Belgium, along with Switzerland, recently announced plans for more sales.
"People are going to be asking 'Who's next?' " said Jeffery Ralph, a trader with the Royal Bank in Toronto. "Other central banks that have large gold reserves are going to ask themselves why they have so much money tied up in an asset that is declining in value."
Gold for August delivery fell $7.10, to $325.20 an ounce, in New York, the lowest since December 1985.
Crude oil prices fell on expectations that Iraq would submit an aid distribution plan to the United Nations, leading to the resumption of oil sales, possibly within a month.
The United Nations has approved a distribution plan for northern Iraq and is waiting for the Iraqis to submit a plan for the rest of the country. The plans are aimed at reducing delays in aid distribution.
Iraq said last month that it would not resume oil shipments under a renewed accord with the United Nations allowing limited oil sales to pay for food and medicine until its complaints about delays in delivering the aid for its citizens were resolved.
Crude oil for August delivery fell 78 cents, to $19.56 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Cocoa sank for a second day as rain replenished dry crops in the Ivory Coast, the world's largest producer. Recent storms have fostered growth in the crops, easing concern that helped prices last month rally to a nine-year high. Cocoa for September delivery tumbled $52, to $1,562 a metric ton, on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Extends a Strong Move Against Mark Before Slipping

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar touched another three-and-a-half-year high against the German mark yesterday before retreating to end mostly lower on unexpected weakness in the United States jobs data. The British pound surged for the fourth consecutive session.
Traders said that the pound was likely to keep strengthening on widening expectations that interest rates in Britain must rise, perhaps as early as the Bank of England's policy-making meeting next Thursday, to thwart inflationary pressure in the country's vibrant economy. Rising rates tend to enhance a currency's value. 
 "Everybody's looking for higher rates in Britain," said Jan Alvarez, senior currency trader at Corestates Bank in Philadelphia. "Everybody thinks the pound is a heck of a buy."
Demand for pounds intensified on Wednesday after Britain's new Labor Government introduced a budget that was far less austere than expected. A strong rally in the London stock market yesterday further increased the appetite for pounds.
The pound rose as high as $1.6915, its highest since Jan. 10, before settling in New York at $1.6906, up from $1.6705 Wednesday and up nearly 3 cents for the week.
The dollar rose as high as 1.7567 marks, the strongest since February 1994. The dollar later retreated, settling in New York at 1.7535 marks, down from 1.7536 Wednesday.
The dollar also finished at less than 114 Japanese yen for the first time in a week, settling at 113.80 yen, down from 114.49 yen.
The main force driving the dollar lower was the Labor Department's report on June employment, which indicated that the jobless rate in the United States rose to 5 percent after falling to 24-year lows of 4.8 percent in May and 4.9 percent in April. Forecasters had expected no change.
The report, coming a day after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, provided new evidence that the economy has slowed, further diminishing prospects for rising rates.
Traders used the report as an opportunity to sell dollars and secure profits from the currency's latest flexing of strength against the mark. Many also wanted to reduce their bets on a higher dollar before the Fourth of July holiday, when United States markets are closed.

HEADLINE: Embattled Bosnian Serb Leader Orders Parliament Dissolved

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: PALE, Bosnia and Herzegovina, July 3

 BODY:
President Biljana Plavsic tried to dissolve the Bosnian Serb Parliament today "to protect the state from total disaster," but supporters of Radovan Karadzic, the former president who is wanted on war-crimes charges, immediately challenged the decision.
A television report that Dr. Karadzic and his wartime commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic, who is also charged with war crimes, were to be seized on sight fueled tensions as both sides vied for public support. 
 Dr. Karadzic accused Ms. Plavsic of treachery and of plotting his arrest by NATO peacekeeping troops. But both NATO and the United States denied any change in orders regarding the arrest of war crimes suspects.
In Washington, Nicholas Burns, the State Department spokesman, told reporters in a daily briefing that the report was "absolutely and unequivocally false."
He said the rule remained that if any of those troops "encounter people who they know to be indicted war criminals they are to detain them for transfer to civilian authority so they may be arrested and then turned over to The Hague for prosecution."
President Plavsic said the intention of the reports was to discredit her with the people, who get most of their news from the television which is controlled by hard-liners.
The hard-liners, who also control the police, were expected to go ahead with a Parliament session today to try to remove her from office.
Robert S. Gelbard, the United States special representative to the region, appealed for restraint by both camps.
The feud highlighted antagonism between hard-liners, who are based in the nationalist stronghold in Pale outside Sarajevo, and Ms. Plavsic's supporters in the northern town of Banja Luka who believe Western peacemaking cannot be defied indefinitely.
The document ordering the dissolution of Parliament said the police had organized smuggling with the Muslim-Croat Federation in Bosnia. It also condemned Prime Minister Gojko Klickovic's refusal to work with President Plavsic.
Both men are proteges of Dr. Karadzic who has continued to wield power despite being driven from office last year by the peace accord.
President Plavsic, saying the conflict "threatens the very survival of the Bosnian Serb republic," set new elections for Sept. 1 and began trying to form a national government.
Mr. Gelbard, who had talks with the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, earlier, met Momcilo Krajisnik, a Serb member of Bosnia's multiethnic presidency in Pale.
Ms. Plavsic accused Mr. Krajisnik and Dr. Karadzic, the two most powerful figures in the Bosnian Serb fight against Bosnian independence, of using their influence to enrich themselves through their control of the economy.
Mr. Gelbard said the activities of Dr. Karadzic, Mr. Krajisnik and the Bosnian Serb Interior Minister Dragan Kijac "have been extremely dangerous."

Unexpected Rise in Jobless Rate Spurs a Rally for Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
An unexpected jump in the unemployment rate sparked a rally in the Treasury market yesterday, as the jobs report eased concerns that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates any time soon.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond, rose 1 2/32 , to 100 1/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, slid to 6.62 percent, from 6.71 percent on Wednesday to the lowest level since 6.57 percent on Feb. 19. For bond investors, the day's gains amounted to more than $10 for every $1,000 invested. 
 The rally came in a shortened session ahead of the Fourth of July holiday. The market will be closed today and will reopen on Monday.
Bond prices rose after the Labor Department said that the unemployment rate rose to 5 percent in June from 4.8 percent in May, and also reported that the economy added 217,000 nonfarm jobs in June. Analysts had expected an unemployment rate of 4.8 percent and a gain of 230,000 jobs.
The data "indicate that despite the continued tightness in the labor market, wage pressures decelerated during the second quarter of the year," said Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities.
Coupled with the Fed's decision on Wednesday to leave interest rates unchanged, yesterday's employment and unemployment statistics raised the odds that the Fed policy-making panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, would keep rates steady when it next meets in August.
"We've been waiting for this to happen and it virtually guarantees that there will not be a rate hike at the next F.O.M.C. meeting in August and possibly in September," said Scott F. Grannis, director and chief economist at the Western Asset Management Company of Pasadena, Calif., which manages more than $18 billion in fixed-income assets. "It would take a dramatic change in the economy at this point to trigger a tightening in September."
"I think we're getting close to what was once unthinkable: the possiblity that the Fed could ease at some point," he added. "Inflation has declined considerably and the economy is softening. Meanwhile, the market is still pricing in a future tightening with no chance for an ease yet, but if these numbers continue to be soft over the course of months, the market will likely raise the chance of an easing."
Other analysts contended that the Fed could still raise rates again in August. Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber, said that while the jobs report was an important signpost to the Fed's direction, policy makers were also looking carefully at consumer spending and other signs of potential inflation.
"At some point, the Fed will see consumer demand spurt enough to again have strong demand as a publicly defensible reason to undertake the pre-emptive tightening that they probably want to undertake because of low unemployment -- a publicly indefensible reason for tightening," Mr. Harris said.
"However, at this point we do not foresee this happening until the first quarter of 1998," he added. "That's when we will again have the special purchasing power circumstances of year-end bonuses and tax refunds that fueled the sharp early '97 retail sales spurts that prompted the Fed to tighten at the end of March."
The next clue to Fed monetary policy could come on July 22, when the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, gives his semiannual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony about the state of the economy to Congress.
Elsewhere, the Government plans to sell $8 billion of its new Treasury inflation-protection securities on Wednesday; these notes will have a five-year maturity. In when-issued trading late yesterday, they were offered at a price to yield 3.53 percent.

HEADLINE: Indexing Capital Gains: Its Virtues, and Cost

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
While President Clinton is talking compromise on taxes, the White House has made no secret of its bitter opposition to a handful of provisions in the bills generated by the House and Senate. High on the Administration's 10-worst list is an item in the House version that would index capital gains after 2001 to offset the effects of inflation.
By encouraging taxpayers to make a one-time payment in 2002 to qualify for indexing, the provision would generate substantial revenue in 2002 -- and thus allow the House to lower other taxes even as it meets its legal obligation to produce a balanced budget. But indexing would lead to large and growing revenue losses thereafter unless more generous treatment of capital gains unleashed a frenzy of productive investment. "It's just a cynical budget gimmick," concluded Len Burman, an economist at the Urban Institute.
That is not quite the end of the story, however. While the battle over tax cuts is being fought with smoke and mirrors, many experts who are removed from the politics see merit in adjustments for inflation. "If you're going to tax income, you certainly ought to measure it properly," argued David Bradford, an economist at Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton.
The more difficult question is whether indexing one component of income without indexing others would increase the fairness and efficiency of the tax system as a whole. "In the imperfect world of taxation, those who start from first principles have an awfully hard time figuring what to do," said Joel Slemrod, an economist at the University of Michigan Business School.
Both the House and Senate tax bills would reduce the top effective tax rate on capital gains to 20 percent from 28 percent. But under the House tax bill, gains on the sale of assets bought after Jan. 1, 2001, would be taxed only on "real," inflation-adjusted appreciation.
Indexing plainly reduces future tax revenue unless it somehow induces far greater realizations of capital gains. How, then, was the House able to declare the indexing provision a revenue winner for the 1997-2002 budget years?
Under the proposed law, investors sitting on capital gains earned before 2001 would become eligible for future indexing if they chose, in that year, to pay the taxes accrued until then on the paper appreciation. Budget alchemists figure that this inducement to pay some taxes sooner in order to reduce taxes later would generate $6 billion extra in revenue in 2002. But the indexing provision is expensive in the long run, adding billions to the cost over the next decade. That explains President Clinton's preference for the Senate approach. However, it does not touch the question of whether indexing is good or bad for the economy.
Most economists would undoubtedly prefer a tax system in which inflation had no effect on how much taxes are paid or when. And in flush times, Congress apparently shares the sentiment: Legislation passed in 1981 indexed tax brackets to prevent inflation from pushing families into higher marginal rates.
Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy at the Cato Institute in Washington, sees a similar logic in indexing capital gains today. "It's just not fair to tax people on inflationary gains," he argued. What's more, he notes that indexing is a more progressive way to grant tax preferences to capital gains than simply cutting rates, because a relatively high proportion of the gains realized by middle-income Americans is linked to inflation. Indeed, a study by the Congressional Budget Office showed that the average taxpayer with total earnings below $50,000 who declared capital gains actually suffered a capital loss when the asset value was adjusted for inflation.
Other economists who glimpse virtue in capital gains indexing see it as a way to reduce investment risk. Under the current system no one knows what the effective rate of taxation on capital income will be because no one knows what the rate of inflation will be. Indexing would eliminate this risk -- and in the process probably make stock prices less vulnerable to the vagaries of changing inflation rates.
But Herbert Stein, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, wonders whether this would amount to overkill. He noted that with money pouring into the stock market, "we don't seem to be suffering from excessive aversion to risk."
Besides, indexing one part of the tax code without indexing the rest can produce some decidedly odd results. Under the House bill, investors would be able to claim full deductions against ordinary income for interest payments on loans used to buy assets, even though their tax liability on capital gains from the sale of these same assets would fall. In fact, if the inflation component of both interest and capital appreciation were high enough, said William G. Gale, an economist at the Brookings Institution, "you could end up with an effective capital gains rate of less than zero."
Then there is the question of complexity. "In the computer age," Mr. Moore said, adjusting capital gains for the effects of inflation should be "no big deal." But there would inevitably be ambiguities in sales of partnerships and other, less tangible assets; in these situations, what was actually owned and when would become key issues. And the House provision that gives investors an incentive to declare asset values without actually selling them could help many a tax accountant meet his mortgage payments.
Given the choice, Mr. Moore would start with indexing and then cut rates if it still fit the budget. Indeed, some economists would happily trade the whole mess of preferences now accorded to capital gains in return for inflation indexing. But tax intellectuals are not likely to play a key role in deciding the outcome of this latest skirmish over capital gains.
For supply-side ideologues, any reduction in the effective capital gains rate would bring the economy a step closer to nirvana. For opponents, including Mr. Gale of the Brookings Institution, any of the contemplated changes "would merely take an existing tax loophole and make it bigger."

HEADLINE: U.S. JOBLESS RATE INCREASES TO 5%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3

 BODY:
The nation's unemployment rate rose two-tenths of a percentage point in June, to 5 percent, easing the tightest labor market in a quarter century, Government figures showed today. A moderate 217,000 jobs were added to payrolls.
While the figures showed a blip up in the jobless rate after trending downward for many months and a slowdown in the recent rapid rate of job creation, they were just what the White House and Wall Street wanted. Financial markets reveled in the news because it suggested that the economy was still growing solidly but no longer at the breakneck pace of earlier in the year that threatened to fan fears of inflation. Interest rates tumbled by about one-eighth of a percentage point and stocks, as gauged by the Dow Jones industrial average, soared more than 100 points to another record in shortened pre-holiday trading. [Page D1.] 
 At the White House, the President's chief economic adviser, Janet L. Yellen, exulted in the latest set of figures, which represented a near-perfect combination of decent growth and stable prices.
"Unemployment hovers in a decades-low range, jobs are being created at a robust pace and there are still no signs of inflationary pressures," Ms. Yellen said in a statement.
The chief dark spot in the job picture was the fact that the ranks of the unemployed grew by 302,000, more than offsetting May's improvement. Despite the rise in the unemployment rate, though, the job market remains in healthy shape, analysts said. And after hitting a 24-year low of 4.8 percent in May, a modest rise in unemployment could provide some breathing room to let the economy, now in its seventh year of uninterrupted growth, expand for a longer period without a recession.
Today's Labor Department report was also seen as supporting the Federal Reserve in its judgment earlier this week that the economy was winding down enough from its first-quarter pace of 5.9 percent that no increase in interest rates was needed to hold down prices. Officials said that the central bank had only a fragment of today's figures during its deliberations on Tuesday and Wednesday, those covering the factory workweek.
Despite the enthusiasm of the markets, however, various economists predicted that the Fed would decide to raise rates later in the summer, when the economy is expected to pick up again and grow faster than the second quarter's estimated rate of 2 percent.
Official minutes published today showed that Fed officials agreed unanimously at their May 20 meeting to lean toward higher rates in the belief that "the risks were in the direction of a potential need for some tightening" of policy to counter rising inflation pressure. One member, J. Alfred Broaddus Jr., the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, wanted to raise short-term rates immediately.
Daniel Laufenberg, a senior analyst at American Express Financial Advisers in Minneapolis, described the economy's second-quarter slowdown as a brief "pause" that would soon give way to reacceleration, "if it hasn't already." The labor market, he declared, remains "very tight" and workers are getting decent, though not high, increases in pay.
"We're looking for consumers to come back," Mr. Laufenberg said, "with the wherewithal to spend."
Average hourly earnings rose 4 cents for the second consecutive month in June to put the 12-month increase at 3.5 percent, comfortably above the pace of consumer inflation. For the year through March, on the other hand, hourly earnings rose a markedly higher 4.1 percent, providing ammunition for those who see a risk that wage pressures will force the Fed to raise rates again.
Employer payrolls swelled by 217,000, somewhat less than most analysts had expected. But interpretation of the figure was clouded by a 78,000-job surge in local government, much of this related to the ending of the school year. The Bureau of Labor Statistics concedes that its efforts to adjust the figures for seasonality are highly inexact.
At the same time, May's job increase was revised upward by 28,000.
Factories added 14,000 jobs in June, continuing slow but steady gains since September. Retail trade rebounded to add 58,000 jobs, about half of these in restaurants and bars.
But construction and temporary help were little changed, and health services generated only 8,000 new jobs after averaging 21,000 during the first five months of the year. The financial sector added 11,000, lifting the 12-month increase to more than 100,000 jobs.
The index of aggregate weekly hours, a guide to industrial production for the month, climbed a modest four-tenths of 1 percent, to 140.7.
Today's report also suggested that people's confidence in their marketability had been tempered. The proportion of the unemployed who quit their latest job, typically in hopes of getting a better one, remained at 12.2 percent last month after a full-point jump in May.
Much of the rise in unemployment last month was concentrated among adult men, whose jobless rate bounced back to April's 4.2 percent from the 3.8 percent to which it had dropped in May.
In contrast to the expansion of employer payrolls, the department's survey of households tallied a 275,000-job decline, a divergence for which officials had no explanation other than normal statistical "noise."
This, combined with a small rise in the labor force, meant that the jobless rate moved back up to 5 percent, the first increase since January.
Regionally, the unemployment rate rose two-tenths of a percent in the West and one-tenth of a point elsewhere. The West now stands at 5.6 percent, with the Northeast at 5.7 percent, the South at 5.1 percentand the Midwest at an impressively low 3.8 percent.

Lockheed Martin to Buy Northrop for $8.3 Billion
Lockheed Martin, the maker of the F-16 fighter, plans to buy Northrop Grumman, which builds the MX missile, for $8.3 billion. It is expected to be the final chapter in the dizzyingly rapid consolidation of big American military contractors. 

 The deal would reinforce Lockheed Martin's position as the largest weapons supplier to the Pentagon -- ahead of Boeing and Raytheon -- and would create a company with annual revenue of about $35 billion and more than 230,000 employees. [Page A1.]
 
The merger, while further reducing competition, is unlikely to face a serious regulatory challenge, experts said, because of a Clinton Administration policy of explicitly supporting consolidation as the military contracting pie shrinks. [D2.]
 
Though both Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin have shrunk, they remain major presences in the New York area, and few further reductions were seen as an immediate consequence of the merger. [D2.]
 
Jobless Rate Rises to 5%
The unemployment rate climbed two-tenths of a percentage point in June, to 5 percent, after hitting a 24-year low in May. Financial markets liked the news, which indicates that the economy is still growing but not as quickly as it did earlier this year. Payrolls grew by a moderate 217,000 jobs. [A1.]
 
Treasury securities rallied on the unexpected jump in the unemployment rate. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond slid to 6.62 percent from 6.71. [D14.]
 
Mississippi Accord on Tobacco Cost
Four cigarette producers agreed to pay Mississippi $3.6 billion to resolve a suit over health care costs associated with smoking. The agreement, the first with any of the states seeking to recover Medicaid funds spent on smoking-related illnesses, could affect the proposed national tobacco settlement. [A1.]
 
$674 Million for Duty-Free Shops
BAA, the British airport operator, seeking to remain competitive in the growing market for duty-free retailing, plans to buy Duty Free International for $674 million. [D15.]
 
Ford Sales Increase in June
Incentives pushed auto sales at Ford Motor up 4.7 percent in June. The results contrasted with the weak trend at the other car makers; industrywide, sales fell 3.4 percent. [D3.]
Deal for Electronics Distributor
Veba of Germany agreed to buy Wyle Electronics of the United States for $609 million to increase its share of the worldwide electronics distribution market. [D2.]
 
Pepsico to Sell Pizza Chain
Pepsico has agreed to sell its California Pizza Kitchen restaurant chain to Bruckmann, Rosser, Sherrill, an investment fund, for a price that several industry executives estimated at nearly $100 million. [D16.]
 
Stocks of Cereal Makers Climb
Stock prices of cereal companies rose after General Mills announced that it would increase prices by an average of about 2.6 percent, or 10 cents a box. [D3.]
 
Batting 8,000
Batting averages and stock averages may have little in common, but since the start of the baseball season, the performances of the Dow industrials and the New York Mets have looked eerily similar, at least on graph paper. A scorecard. [D4.]

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Conducting A Search For Origins Of 'One Fare'

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
New York's two leading elected officials -- who know enough to stay away from trouble -- are never seen on the city's buses and overcrowded subways, but as city transit takes its biggest economic leap forward in 50 years this week, both of them have stepped forward to accept the public's gratitude for the long-anticipated introduction of free transfers.
Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani have spent public money on ads that link them to the free transfers between buses and subways that begin today. The Mayor, who is also running a commercial that claims credit for the plan he calls, "One City, One Fare," is scheduled to be outside of Manhattan to greet commuters for the first rush hour under the new system on Monday morning. 
 Hardened transit riders, amazed that a promise made at the dawn of the $1.50 fare was actually kept, may be shocked into accepting some of the claims being thrown around. Indeed, riders who don't suffer from short-term memory loss might find it hard to give credit to Mr. Pataki and Mr. Giuliani for one reason: when their re-election campaigns were further away both were cutting money from mass transit.
An examination of recent history shows that despite any claims to the contrary, it is difficult to draw a straight line between any elected official and the free transfers. The political origin of the Metrocard transfer is a foggy tale of shared responsibility, setbacks and large doses of hyperbole.
The dream of ending the much-hated two-fare zones had been planned long before either the Mayor or the Governor were elected. As far back as 1982, Richard Ravitch, then the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, began thinking about an automated turnstile system that would allow riders in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx and all of Staten Island to pay one fare for a ride to Manhattan.
By the end of the 1980's, the M.T.A. began planning in earnest for the Metrocard, a technical innovation that promised such other benefits as monthly passes and bulk discounts. In 1992, Peter E. Stangl, the next M.T.A. chairman, proposed what he called the "fare deal," which would have provided discounts and free transfers in exchange for a 25-cent fare hike.
Many transit advocates and even some officials at the M.T.A. believe the transfers plan could have gone into effect two or three years ago had not the Mayor and the Governor slashed their transit subsidies by hundreds of millions of dollars. At the time, years from their re-election campaigns, both were in full budget-cutting mode, with Mr. Giuliani in particular asserting that the agency could end two-fare zones simply by becoming more efficient.
The M.T.A. said it couldn't happen, and eventually won back a portion of the money that was cut. By 1995 it was ready to try again, and the current chairman, E. Virgil Conway, proposed a plan that included both the $1.50 fare and an end to two-fare zones. The plan passed, but the Mayor's four appointees to the board voted against the increase and the transfers.
Deputy Mayor Randy M. Mastro said Mr. Giuliani has long believed that two-fare zones are unfair to those who live outside Manhattan -- his core constituency -- and strongly advocated that the M.T.A. eliminate them after the fare went up. But considering that the M.T.A. was clearly inclined to do so already, Mr. Mastro's assertion that the two-fare zones could not have disappeared without Mr. Giuliani appears to be more of a boast. Former Deputy Mayor John S. Dyson, a Giuliani appointee to the M.T.A., acknowledged as much, saying that the administration's pressure probably made the transfers happen about a year earlier than planned (conveniently, a few months before the election).
"I'm not denying that from the Mayor's point of view it's better to do it now," Mr. Dyson said, "but it's also better from the citizens' point of view."
But all sides give credit to the Mayor for allowing free transfers from the private bus lines in Queens and Brooklyn and from the Staten Island Ferry. Those riders, from some of Mr. Giuliani's favorite neighborhoods, will be among the few in the city who know exactly whom to thank.

HEADLINE: Clinton Makes Firm Denial In Sexual Harassment Case

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., July 3

 BODY:
President Clinton today denied Paula Corbin Jones' accusation that he propositioned her in a hotel room in 1991 when he was Governor of Arkansas, contending in a motion to dismiss her lawsuit that her accusation was intended to harm him politically.
In his first formal response to the accusations in Ms. Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit in Federal District Court here, Mr. Clinton said he did not recall ever meeting her and denied every allegation in her complaint. 
 "At no time did the President make sexual advances toward the plaintiff or otherwise act improperly in her presence," said the response filed by Mr. Clinton's lawyers.
In a memorandum accompanying Mr. Clinton's motion for dismissal, the President's lawyers said that, for argument purposes only, even if the President had propositioned Ms. Jones, it should be considered "a single overture, one abandoned as soon as she stated it was unwelcome."
While categorically denying each of Ms. Jones' accusations, Mr. Clinton's lawyers argued that her assertions did not represent a violation of the law.
Ms. Jones seeks $700,000 in damages. She contends that Mr. Clinton summoned her to a hotel room in Little Rock in 1991, exposed himself to her and asked her to perform a sex act. She was a state employee at the time.
She said in her lawsuit that she could identify distinguishing characteristics in the President's "genital area." Mr. Clinton's response said that she could not but did not elaborate.
The memorandum said Ms. Jones had political and financial motives for filing her lawsuit, saying she had joined "with longtime political opponents of the President who sought to discredit him and his Presidency."
"This, we believe, was done to maximize plaintiff's potential to derive economic benefit and simultaneously to harm the President politically," it said.
The case could go to trial in 1998. Judge Susan Webber Wright, a former law student of Mr. Clinton's, said in May that she would schedule the case soon after receiving the President's response. The typical time for a case to come to trial is 10 to 12 months.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
645 Modular Houses Going Up in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Over the next three years, 645 homes for low- and moderate-income families will go up for 25 blocks west of Pennsylvania Avenue in East New York, Brooklyn. But instead of being constructed using traditional techniques, they are being manufactured in a factory five miles away and assembled at the construction site.
On-site assembly began in April, and 26 of the 1,320-square-foot, two-story homes are visible along Snediker Avenue between Dumont and Livonia Avenues. They will be sold at an average price of $73,000 to families earning between $22,000 and $58,000, depending on family size. 
 The homes are being manufactured by the Capsys Corporation, which opened its factory last February in an industrial building that is as long as a football field and has 50-foot-high ceilings at the Brooklyn Navy Yard industrial park.
The venture is the latest to test the concept of factory-built houses, also known as modular homes, in New York City. Though the concept is considered an effective way to produce affordable housing because costs can be held down, such factories have not survived the ups and downs of the housing cycle in the city.
Capsys is producing the 645 steel-frame homes for East Brooklyn Congregations, the sponsors of the Nehemiah housing plan, named for the biblical figure sent to rebuild Jerusalem. The plan pairs city subsidies with private capital to produce modest row houses on land donated by the city. From 1983 to 1991, 2,200 Nehemiah houses were built in East New York and Brownsville, helping to revive the area.
The new homes will rise on the blocks sandwiched between the earlier houses. A second phase of 500 more homes ultimately will be built in nearby Spring Creek. This is the first time East Brooklyn Congregations, a coalition of churches, is using factory-built homes.
Construction financing is coming from a $6 million interest-free-loan fund put together with contributions from the coalition and the Community Preservation Corporation, a private, nonprofit consortium of New York-based banks and insurance companies.
New York City is providing $20,000 in subsidies per home, keeping the purchase price down. Below-market rate mortgages will also be available through the State of New York Mortgage Agency and conventional lenders. Buyers must make a $5,000 down payment and pay $5,000 to $7,000 in closing costs.
For Capsys, the $70 million, 645-unit first phase of the project was large enough to shoulder the risk and the cost, about $1 million, of setting up the factory, said Alan Bell, a principal with Nicholas Lembo, William Fowler and Peter Hansen in the company. All the partners have backgrounds in residential development in New York City. Mr. Lembo is also president of Monadnock Construction, which is assembling the houses.
"With a project in so large an area where it is difficult to maintain a consistent level of quality, factory-built housing made the most sense," said Mr. Lembo. This way, he said, quality can be improved because the homes can be produced year-round and under closer supervision. The cost to produce them can be about 10 percent lower than traditional houses, largely because of greater operating efficiencies and lower labor costs, Mr. Lembo said.
That appealed to East Brooklyn Congregations. The three-bedroom homes are 20 percent larger than the earlier ones and are of a higher quality, said Michael Gecan. He is lead organizer for the group in the project and a member of the Industrial Areas Foundation, a national community organizing group in Chicago.
Last year, 2,200 modular homes were produced in New York State, about 400 of which were put up in New York City, said Fred Hallahan, a Baltimore-based consultant who works with the modular industry. That represents about 6 percent of the state's overall housing production, he said.
In New York City, modular housing has a legacy of disappointments because of, among other things, development constraints, conflicting regulatory controls and union resistance to out-of-city, nonunion manufacturers. While major projects have given rise to factories, none survived downturns in the market.
Capsys addressed those issues by entering into a contract with the industrial division of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners and having its houses meet both state manufactured-housing codes and the city building code.
The factory turns out half of a house a day, or 125 houses a year, a figure Mr. Lembo said he intended to double. The brick- and aluminum-faced homes will have a basement, driveway and front and rear yards.
Jerome and Wanda Hannah will close on their home this month. "There is not a house more economical to meet the poor working-class person's purse," Mr. Hannah said. The couple's monthly mortgage will be slightly higher than the $650 they pay in rent, he said, adding, "We have something we can call our own."

HEADLINE: Racial Politics Lets Flawed Candidate Find Allies

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 3

 BODY:
As President Clinton spoke at a rally at the Daley Plaza here, days before his re-election last November, a senior White House aide groused privately that the President had had no choice but to share the stage with Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, once the pride of the Democratic Party and now one of its bigger embarrassments.
Ms. Moseley-Braun was an electoral sensation in 1992 when she catapulted from obscurity as the Cook County Recorder of Deeds to became the first African-American woman elected to the Senate. But her tenure as Illinois' senior Senator has been marred by a rash of miscues and episodes of questionable judgment, including disclosures about her financial practices and her private life and her secret visit to Nigeria last summer to meet with the country's brutal dictator, drawing negative publicity just as her party was about to assemble for its national convention in this city. 
 Now, Ms. Moseley-Braun, a 49-year-old lawyer, is viewed as perhaps the most endangered Senator running for re-election next year; so much so that Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, summoned this state's popular Governor, Jim Edgar, to Washington last week to entice him to challenge her. Days earlier, The Chicago Tribune had published a poll that found that among people who usually vote in Illinois elections, only a third wanted Ms. Moseley-Braun re-elected. The survey said her support among white suburban women, who were crucial to her election, had hemorrhaged. And her favorable rating was a rock-bottom 37 percent, compared with 64 percent for Governor Edgar.
Yet for all of her vulnerability, Democrats from here to Washington have acted early to embrace Ms. Moseley-Braun and discourage Democrats from challenging her. In a crucial move that has scared off rivals, Mayor Richard M. Daley bestowed an early endorsement on Ms. Moseley-Braun. And Mr. Clinton, returning last week for a fund-raising event that helped her erase a four-year-old campaign debt, declared that "she deserves your support."
The turnabout among Democrats reflects the sensitive politics of race rather than the accomplishments of Ms. Moseley-Braun. Many Democrats said they would be wary of the backlash if they took her on, particularly since this state has no other highly visible black politicians. Several Democrats also said they had no appetite to reopen the racial tensions of a decade ago, when a black mayor, Harold Washington, was elected in Chicago over two white challengers and the politics of race upended the city's once-monolithic Democratic machine. Some said they were acting out of self-interest; if black voters were alienated, they might not turn out for other Democratic candidates.
The decision to close ranks around Ms. Moseley-Braun so early also reflects the Democratic Party's problems in recruiting appealing candidates; the Illinois Democratic Party has been little more than a shell since many of the state's most promising Democratic elected officials were wiped out in the 1994 elections. Moreover, several Democrats said that finding a more formidable candidate was not worth the upheaval it would cause the state party.
"There's this aura of having messed up," said Dawn Clark Netsch, an Illinois Democrat who unsuccessfully challenged Governor Edgar in 1994 and who once introduced Ms. Moseley-Braun in the 1992 campaign as "a national heroine."
"All of these distractions have clearly crippled her effectiveness. The way you hear it expressed most often is that 'She messes up her personal life' and 'If she'd just get her act together.' What substance she's been involved with she has a hard time getting out because the rest of it overwhelms."
Explaining that she would still vote for Ms. Moseley-Braun against a Republican, Ms. Netsch said, "What else can we do?"
In an interview here, Ms. Moseley-Braun was lively and composed, and dismissed her missteps with hearty laughter. "For every blessing you get," she said, "the devil's going to try to take it away."
Ms. Moseley-Braun (pronounced MO-se-lee-Brawn) acknowledged that she had had difficulty making the switch to a national stage, and she still appears surprised that United States senators are held to higher expectations than ordinary citizens. "One of the most wrenching parts of the transition to the Senate has been coming to grips with not having a private life," she said, largely attributing her misfortune to having "not been a very good self promoter."
She said her meeting with Gen. Sani Abacha, Nigeria's dictator, for which she was rebuked by the State Department and criticized by human-rights advocates for lending legitimacy to that regime, was a mistake only because she had not announced it at news conference first.
"It frankly did not occur to me at all," she said. "It was like going to the hardware store with no makeup on. It wasn't a secret." Then, turning to a reporter, she asked, "Do you call a press conference when you go on vacation?"
She has described the Nigerian trip as an effort at "quiet diplomacy" on environmental and human rights issues. The Senator's companion on the trip was Kgosie Matthews, her former fiance and former campaign manager, who has been tied to many of her troubles and who has been registered with the Justice Department as an agent for Nigeria.
Among the tempests that have swirled around Ms. Moseley-Braun:
* Just before her election, it was disclosed that Ms. Moseley-Braun and her siblings had accepted a $28,750 inheritance from her mother, who was in a nursing home on Medicaid. She had not reported the money for tax purposes and paid the state about $15,000 to clear up the matter.
* After her election, Ms. Moseley-Braun took a monthlong vacation in Africa and England with Mr. Matthews, infuriating supporters who expected her to use the time to assemble a staff.
*Her office has been in upheaval uncommon even by Senate standards; she has gone through four chiefs of staffs in four years.
*Her former campaign treasurer, Earl Hopewell, has filed a lawsuit against her accusing Mr. Matthews of using $39,000 in campaign money to pay Ms. Moseley-Braun's credit card bills. Ms. Moseley-Braun dismissed Mr. Hopewell as "a disgruntled employee who wants money."
In the interview, Ms. Moseley-Braun said the Federal Election Commission had found "zero irregularities" in her 1992 campaign. But her press secretary, Michael Briggs, interjected to remind her that thousands of dollars in improper contributions had been returned.
"They did find some things you might call an irregularity," Mr. Briggs told his boss.
"Like what?" the Senator asked.
"Like you gave back some money that was in excess of the contributions" limits, Mr. Briggs said.
"Oh," she said. "That was bookkeeping errors. But that's not, quote, financial irregularities."
The only Democrat who has been openly weighing a challenge to Ms. Moseley-Braun is Michael Bakalis, a former state comptroller who has not been active in party politics for years. "The Senate is all about judgment, and there's been a whole series of lapses in good judgment," Mr. Bakalis said. "I don't think you can hide behind race and gender."
In an interview with a suburban newspaper last summer, Ms. Moseley-Braun warned: "I'm the only African-American in the United States Senate. Anybody who is going to take me on in this state, a Democrat, is going to have a hard time getting elected in November."
But in the interview this week, Ms. Moseley-Braun insisted, "I wasn't threatening anybody. It was a statement of fact: I am the only black person in the Senate."
In her own election, Ms. Moseley-Braun had no qualms about taking on an incumbent. She knocked off a two-term incumbent, Senator Alan J. Dixon, in the primary, capitalizing on the outrage over Mr. Dixon's support for Clarence Thomas's confirmation to the Supreme Court. The economic woes in Illinois then helped Ms. Moseley-Braun defeat her Republican challenger, Richard S. Williamson, a conservative businessman.
This time, Mayor Daley's support is crucial. Since Mr. Daley faces a primary less than four months after the 1998 election, his advisers said he would avoid alienating black voters, particularly since a black lawmaker, Representative Bobby Rush, is considering challenging him. Moreover, Mr. Daley and many of his Democratic peers have never viewed the Senate to be as important as local offices, where politicians hold much sway over patronage jobs.
Republicans may not be as unwilling to take on a politician who has become a symbol for blacks and for women. "At one time there would be a reluctance to take on an African-American women who has a lot of charm and a great smile as Carol does," Ms. Netsch said. "I don't know that it would hold anyone back this time."
Many Democrats said they hoped Governor Edgar does not enter the race, leaving Ms. Moseley-Braun to compete with a more conservative rival than the Governor who voters would view as too extreme. But the Governor said he was thinking seriously about running.
"For an incumbent, she's vulnerable," Mr. Edgar said in an interview. "I don't think she's automatically beatable, but she's got some real problems."
Ms. Moseley-Braun said she would implore voters to focus on her work in the Senate. "I have a legislative record second to none in my class," she said. She has a liberal voting record and has been an eloquent advocate for minorities and women. In a stirring floor speech in 1993 in which she took on Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, Ms. Moseley-Braun successfully opposed a bill to renew the patent on the United Daughters of the Confederacy's insignia, which includes the Confederate flag. And, as she vowed in the campaign, Ms. Moseley-Braun has focused on improving the nation's crumbling schools.
In his speech here, Mr. Clinton praised Ms. Moseley-Braun for votes that had helped him carry out his agenda, including his first-term economic package and legislation on crime, deficit reduction, the recovery of big cities and medical leave for workers.
Still, John P. Pelissero, a political science professor at Loyola University here, said Ms. Moseley-Braun is best known for "all these character issues." As for this state's Democrats, Mr. Pelissero said: "Everybody's thinking about their own career. People who aspire to Moseley-Braun's seat may view the election as a referendum on her and not the party. And if she's defeated, so be it."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 15, 1997, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on July 4 about Senator Carol Moseley-Braun's political future misstated the circumstances of a $15,000 payment that Ms. Moseley-Braun, an Illinois Democrat, made to the state authorities in 1992. It was to cover Medicaid expenses improperly paid to her late mother, not to pay unreported taxes.

Dollar Up in Foreign Trading; Stock Prices Abroad Are Mixed

BYLINE: By Dow Jones 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against major currencies yesterday in trading that was kept thin by the Fourth of July holiday in the United States. Against the German mark, the dollar touched its highest level in nearly 41 months.
In stock markets abroad, prices rose in Frankfurt but declined in London and Tokyo. 
 The American currency stood at 1.7589 marks in late London trading, up from 1.7535 marks in New York on Thursday. It reached an intraday high of 1.7592 marks, its highest since Feb. 10, 1994, when it traded as high as 1.7645 marks.
Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at 113.82 yen, up from 113.80 yen.
Dealers said the dollar's outlook for next week was positive, even though the American employment figures released Thursday showed nothing that would point to an increase in interest rates. Higher interest rates would support the dollar by increasing the returns available from fixed-income investments denominated in dollars.
The mark continued to be hurt by worries about the inability of Germany to cut its budget deficit, while the pound continued to draw most of the market's attention after the British budget statement on Wednesday, which increased expectations of higher interest rates.
The pound rose to 2.9658 marks from 2.9599 marks in London Thursday. But it fell to $1.6861 from $1.6906 in New York on Thursday.
British stocks declined. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 issues fell 18.90 points, to 4,812.80; it had been up as much as 50 points during the session but moved downward as banking stocks, which had been providing much of the support, retreated.
On the Frankfurt exchange, stocks rose to a record for the fourth consecutive session. The DAX index of 30 shares gained 55.14 points, or 1.4 percent, to 3,942.53.
In Tokyo, stocks closed lower, and the Nikkei index of 225 issues fell below 20,000 for the first time since May 27. News that the Tokai Kogyo Company, a contractor, was filing for protection under Japanese bankruptcy law led to selling of the shares of banks and construction companies.
The Nikkei average declined 153.41 points, to 19,968.00.

HEADLINE: New Twist Makes Corporate Stock Options Even Sweeter

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
With the bull market going strong, stock options have become one of the sweetest deals available in the board rooms and corner offices of corporate America. And they are supposed to be good for outside investors, too, by encouraging directors and executives to generate big profits for the company so that they can generate big gains for themselves.
The only problem -- for the recipients anyway -- is the income tax that normally is due upon exercising the options. So, over the last few years, companies have developed a variety of ways to allow many executives, directors and valued employees to defer income taxes, often well into retirement, on the profits from exercising stock options. 
 And now, in a new twist on the tax deferral game, a handful of major corporations have come up with a method that not only lets those with stock options safely acquire their shares but also permits them to shed them and buy a diversified portfolio of other investments without paying taxes for years.
The question critics raise is whether this new strategy, by making it less costly for executives to dispose of their own company's stock, continues to serve one of the central purposes of stock options, which are special opportunities to acquire company shares at a set price and benefit from the rise in their market value.
Nell Minnow, an investment fund manger at Lens Inc., said that the new diversification approach, which was recently introduced at the Chrysler Corporation, "shows that you really can have your cake and eat it, too."
Under the Chrysler plan, which is only available to outside directors, board members can turn a profit when they acquire Chrysler shares through stock options. They are then able to eliminate the risk of continuing to own them by converting the gains into shares of other companies. And all this can be done without any taxes being owed for as much as 15 years.
The makers of accounting rules are looking into whether diversification strategies such as the one adopted by Chrysler should invalidate the favorable accounting treatment afforded to stock option plans. But mindful of the last time they tried to curb options and were squashed by pressure from Congress and high-technology business groups, those who set the standards are likely to be highly reluctant to act.
So far, only a handful of companies have adopted plans similar to Chrysler's, according to Brian Foley, an executive compensation consultant in White Plains. But dozens more have engaged consultants to draw up such plans.
Paul P. Bountras, a partner at Hale & Dorr, a Boston law firm that designed such a plan for Analog Devices Inc., an electronic switch company based in Norwood, Mass., said that such tax deferral efforts were perfectly justified. The Internal Revenue Service has long allowed executives to switch from one investment to another within a deferred compensation account, he said, so there should be no objection when company shares are acquired in a deferral account and then are effectively sold to buy the shares of other companies.
But such plans have plenty of detractors, too, even among those who might benefit from them.
Lester C. Thurow, the economist and a director of Analog Devices, said that he knew that the company allowed for tax deferral of exercised stock options. But he said he was unaware that Analog Devices also allowed executives and directors to continue the deferral after diversification.
"Maybe there is an argument, although dubious, that you can defer taxes on a stock option exercise if you stay" invested in the company's stock, said Mr. Thurow, who holds options on 66,500 Analog Devices shares. "But letting you move into another investment without paying taxes is just unfair."
Stock options have exploded in recent years, with the total value of shares set aside for options rising from some $60 billion in 1985 to about $600 billion today, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. They have become an increasingly popular way to pay directors and executives because they are so cheap, creating a corporate income tax deduction without a corresponding expense, and because they provide a strong performance incentive for executives. The main disadvantage is that they can dilute the value of shares held by regular stockholders.
Under the Chrysler plan, outside directors receive options to acquire 3,000 shares annually. Traditionally, the profits from exercising a stock option were taxable immediately, but Chrysler lets outside directors exercise their options in a way that delays income taxes for up to 15 years. The key is that the company does not formally deliver the newly acquired shares to the director until he or she retires.
That tax deferral approach has become widespread in the last four years, even though no statute, court decision or I.R.S. ruling specifically authorizes it.
Chrysler's plan then introduces a further element by allowing directors to choose to shed their Chrysler shares and invest the proceeds in a diversified portfolio of stocks. Again, the operating theory is that delivery of this portfolio is delayed until the director retires.
Laurie McTavish, a Chrysler spokeswoman, said that the tax deferral was legitimate because the company was not required to actually sell the Chrysler shares acquired by the outside director.
Instead, Chrysler essentially makes a promise to pay, upon retirement, the value of the other stocks the director chooses. The company can actually acquire the shares or not, but it must make good on the promise, even if the prices of those stocks go up so much that Chrysler has to dip into its own funds to fulfill its pledge.
Chrysler's plan, among others, has attracted the attention of the emerging issues task force of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the body that defines generally accepted accounting principles.
The committee's 13 members -- 11 of whom must agree if the committee is to declare such plans inconsistent with accounting principles -- displayed deep divisions on the issue during a recent meeting to examine the arcane financial reporting issues raised by the new tax deferral plans.
Their debate also touched fleetingly on whether allowing top executives and directors to dispose of their company stock without paying an immediate tax undermines the whole idea of encouraging stock options as a way to help align the interests of directors with those of shareholders.
While the accounting standards board continues to examine the issue, the I.R.S. has not challenged any of the handful of plans similar to Chrysler's, executive compensation experts say.
But even if the Government is not concerned, Ms. Minnow, the shareholder advocate, said, investors should complain if their companies adopt such plans. "This puts risks onto companies that should properly be borne not by shareholders but by the executives," she said.
Ms. McTavish, the Chrysler spokeswoman, defended the company's plan. She said that Chrysler required directors to own at least 10,000 company shares, which is plenty to assure that the motivations of directors are closely tied to the fate of Chrysler's stock. There is no good reason, she said, to forbid directors to dispose of shares above that amount.
Still, some companies are worried that such tax deferral plans go too far.
For instance, the American Home Products Corporation, a maker of over-the-counter medications and pharmaceuticals based in Madison, N.J., authorized such a plan last year. But it soon terminated it, said Lowell Weiner, a company spokesman, because of uncertainties about the accounting issues.

European Panel Opposes Takeover by Boeing
The European Union's antitrust advisory committee has come out against the $14 billion takeover of McDonnell Douglas by Boeing. It said the planned takeover would strengthen Boeing's "existing dominant position and therefore should be prohibited," people familiar with the decision said. 
 The recommendation does not end the European investigation into the impact the merger would have in Western Europe. A decision is expected later this month from the full European Union. Earlier this week, the Federal Trade Commission said it would not oppose the acquisition of McDonnell Douglas by Boeing. [36.]
 
The Lure of Inner Cities
People are spurning the suburbs and moving to inner cities like those of Detroit, Houston, Cleveland and Chicago where new developments look like suburban subdivisions with well-manicured lawns, backyards and white picket fences. [1.]
 
Bertelsmann Mum on Compuserve
The German media giant Bertelsmann refused to comment on a report that it may be teaming with America Online to acquire Compuserve, its rival in on-line computer services. Bertelsmann, which already has alliances with America Online, would provide the needed cash for the purchase of the money-losing division of H & R Block. [36.]
 
Germany has approved a law banning cyberspace smut and Nazi propaganda, but critics contend it is too vague on the responsibilities of companies that provide on-line services. [36.]
 
Bad Loans Plague Japan Banks
Japanese banks, savings institutions and agricultural cooperatives are still struggling to rid themselves of the 27.9 trillion yen, or $240 billion, in bad loans that have plagued them since the collapse of the real estate market earlier this decade. [37.]
 
A Town Suffers From a Long Strike
Few people were celebrating America's birthday yesterday in Mingo Junction, Ohio, which has been troubled by a 10-month strike by 4,500 workers of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel. It is not just the 400 families in the small town along the Ohio River who have felt the stress because of the loss of income. The town, suffering from a loss of fees from water it supplies the local plant, has been forced to lay off municipal workers, and businesses are bemoaning the lack of customers. [6.]
 
Dollar Rises Against Yen
The dollar rose against most major currencies in thin trading because of the Fourth of July holiday. The American currency stood at 113.82 yen, up from 113.80 yen Thursday, and at 1.7589 marks in London, up from 1.7535 marks in New York Thursday. The mark continued to be hurt by worries about the inability of Germany to cut its budget deficit, while the pound continued to draw most of the market's attention after the British budget statement on Wednesday, which increased expectations of higher interest rates. [37.]
 
A Japanese bureaucrat, Eisuke Sakakibara, with strong influence over the currency markets was appointed vice finance minister for international affairs. The promotion will make him Japan's top bureaucrat in global finance. Mr. Sakakibara, who is currently in charge of the Finance Ministry's International Finance Bureau, is widely credited with orchestrating the dollar's 1995 recovery from its lowest levels since World War II. [37.]
 
Ex-Dai-Ichi Officials Indicted
Tokyo prosecutors indicted a former vice president of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Ichiro Fujita, and a former managing director, Tateo Fukushima, in connection with illegal loans that the bank purportedly made to a corporate racketeer. Separately, NHK television said that prosecutors had arrested Tadashi Okuda, the bank's former chairman. [37]

HEADLINE: Demand for Single-Family Homes Helps Fuel Inner-City Resurgence

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 4

 BODY:
M. C. and Debra Hampton plan to move next week to their corner of the American Dream: a newly built house in a well-kept, middle-class neighborhood, the kind of home that for decades here has meant moving to the suburbs.
But like more and more people nationwide, the Hamptons are not steeling themselves for an hourlong commute. Instead, they are moving into a new two-story colonial house in the inner city, where few new houses were built for so long. 
 "All of our roots and family are still within the city," said Mr. Hampton, 42, who is moving with his wife from an older house elsewhere in Detroit. "We didn't want to go to the suburbs."
In cities like Detroit and Houston, Cleveland and Chicago, developers are discovering for the first time in decades a demand for new houses in inner-city neighborhoods. Most of the houses cost $85,000 to $250,000, with some priced at more than $500,000. The new neighborhoods tend to look like suburban subdivisions, with well-kept lawns, backyards and cul de sacs.
"There's a downtown housing boom" in several cities, said Bruce J. Katz, director of the Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy at the Brookings Institution.
Mr. Katz and other housing experts said the new inner-city subdivisions had been spawned by several disparate factors -- like an increase in available financing and a backlash against suburban sprawl -- that had brought government and market forces to bear at the same time.
In Detroit, buyers recently drove through blighted neighborhoods to the gates of a planned subdivision nearby, then waited in line all night for the chance to put deposits on houses costing $350,000 to $600,000. In Cleveland, it has become trendy to replace abandoned houses with large custom-built houses.
Houston hopes to spur the building or renovation of 5,000 houses a year in poorer neighborhoods, and in Chicago home building has also been on the rise in recent years, with 830 building permits for new houses issued last year, nearly twice as many as in 1991.
Most of the houses match the style of their neighborhoods. In sprawling cities like Detroit and Cleveland, new single-family homes are sprouting in neighborhoods that traditionally had them. In denser cities like New York and Baltimore, they are town houses or row houses.
A coalition of churches and synagogues in Brooklyn helped build 2,300 town houses in recent years, 1,200 in the Brownsville section and 1,100 in the East New York section, with another 1,200 single-family homes under construction in East New York.
And the New York City Partnership, a business group, has been building houses for middle-income buyers in the city's poor neighborhoods, including blocks of row houses in the South Bronx. In Newark, 800 town houses have been built and several hundred more are planned.
While few of the new privately developed homes are intended for lower-income people, the Federal Government is trying to stabilize inner-city neighborhoods by encouraging the very poor to buy homes. The Clinton Administration last month outlined a five-year pilot program under which up to 75,000 poor people who receive Federal rental vouchers would be eligible for "empowerment vouchers." If Congress passes the proposed legislation, which has fallen by the wayside in the previous four years, those who work and are able to contribute toward a down payment could apply their Federal subsidies to mortgage payments instead of rent.
Housing experts said the new private developments indirectly helped the poor because they tended to attract new grocery stores, drugstores and other businesses to neighborhoods with few such conveniences. Because the houses are built in underpopulated neighborhoods, they generally do not displace poor residents.
"They are being built in neighborhoods of abandonment and on sites that are literally vacant land or abandoned buildings," said Marc A. Weiss, special assistant to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. "This is not the urban renewal days where you're going into neighborhoods and throwing people out of their homes."
Homeowners who have already moved into the new city neighborhoods said the latter had proved safe, confounding stereotypes of the inner city. In Detroit, the new subdivisions tend to have a guarded entrance and to be fenced off from less prosperous neighborhoods nearby.
Henry C. Dace, 48, who has lived since 1995 in Victoria Park, a new 157-house subdivision that was the first built in Detroit since the Eisenhower Administration, said: "I love it. It is serene and peaceful."
To be sure, the number of new houses built in central cities does not come close to reaching the number built in the suburbs, and it has only slowed the continuing stream of people moving out of cities. But housing experts say the number of new central-city houses is notable because it represents the first downtown housing boom in decades.
The trend is most noticeable in Detroit and Cleveland, cities better known for the startling number of residents who have moved out, shrinking each city by one-third in just three decades. From 1988 to 1990, only one building permit for a single-family home was issued in the entire 139-square-mile city of Detroit. Since then, 360 building permits have been issued for single-family homes. In Cleveland, nearly 1,000 building permits for single-family homes have been issued since 1992, four times the number in the previous four years.
Perhaps the most striking transformation in the nation is under way in one of Cleveland's most downtrodden neighborhoods, Hough, where luxury houses are replacing abandoned ones.
Ronnie A. Stephens, 44, a civilian manager for the Defense Department in Cleveland, plans to move this autumn -- too late to open his swimming pool -- to the 4,200-square-foot colonial-style house he is building in a neighborhood that used to prompt passing motorists to lock their car doors.
People said he was crazy to build in that neighborhood, recalled Mr. Stephens, whose new house will cost about $500,000 and cut his nearly half-hour commute from the suburbs to eight minutes. But times have changed.
"That area now is really like a status symbol," Mr. Stephens said.
About 100 custom houses have been built in Hough in the past decade, and the pace has picked up in recent years, with the houses growing larger and more lavish and expensive.
Mr. Stephens said he had been lured downtown in part by the financial incentives offered by the city. To rebuild its neighborhoods and its tax base, Cleveland has been demolishing abandoned city-owned houses and selling the empty lots for $100, then giving the owners property tax abatements of 10 to 15 years while promoting a private mortgage program that offers interest rates about one percentage point below market rates.
"We are literally reknitting the fabric of inner-city communities one house at a time," said Mayor Michael R. White of Cleveland, who said about 40 percent of new downtown home buyers had moved from the suburbs, with the rest moving from elsewhere in the city.
In Cleveland and Detroit, many but by no means all of the buyers are black professionals.
While falling rates of crime and increased optimism about the cities have encouraged people to buy downtown, plenty of hurdles remain, the biggest of which seems to be the troubled public schools. Both Mr. White in Cleveland and Mayor Dennis W. Archer of Detroit acknowledged that concern about the schools had discouraged families with school-age children from moving in.
Instead, buyers tend to be childless couples, people with grown children or people who plan to send their children to private schools.
Gordon T. Ford, 28, a suburbanite who waited all night to put a deposit on a $450,000 waterfront home in Detroit, said he and his wife, Tina, who have not had children yet, had always planned to send them to private schools. Still, Mr. Ford recalled, some friends were shocked that the couple would consider moving downtown, warning them, ' "You're going to get killed.' "
While attitudes can take a long time to change, home buyers, real estate agents, builders, politicians and housing experts offered several reasons for the increase in new houses in cities around the country. Among them are these:
*It is easier for buyers to get home loans in the inner city, partly because of the strong economy and partly because of more strictly enforced lending laws.
*Decades with so few houses being built have created a pent-up demand for new city homes.
*Some cities have begun heading back up economically after seeming to hit bottom, inspiring confidence that the houses will prove a good investments, and many cities have grown safer as well.
*The large-scale abandonment in the past decades has left cities with low land prices and plenty of available space.
*As the suburbs and exurbs have grown more distant, cities have become attractive for their far shorter commuting distances to jobs and quick access to restaurants, theaters and sports stadiums.
*Cities have experimented more in recent years with partnerships between government and developers instead of relying solely on government programs to spur building.
While many of the new housing developments take advantage of Federal, state and local money available under urban homesteading provisions, the more houses that are built, the fewer subsidies seem to be needed. Buyers for many of the new houses in Houston are eligible for a $9,500 loan toward the down payment, with 20 percent forgiven for each year they live in the house. One skeptical builder insisted the down-payment loans be available for potential customers. To his surprise, "the houses were virtually all sold without the down-payment assistance," said Michael S. Stevens, a developer who is paid $1 a year to run Houston's housing program.
The housing boom has tapped feelings of community pride in home buyers, who like the idea of helping long-suffering cities that they believe are trying to revive themselves.
"You can actually be a part of the renewal," said Joanna V. Masten, 41, a software company executive who, with her husband, Herschell, will soon move into a new three-story waterfront house in Detroit.
Other home buyers say they hope their new homes will help their less fortunate neighbors improve their lot. "There is some low-income housing behind me," said Mr. Stephens, who is building the half-million-dollar house in Cleveland. "To put these type of houses around them gives people an incentive to want to do better."

Betsy's Place: An Oasis Fit for Bogart

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: TBILISI, Georgia

 BODY:
In Casablanca, everybody went to Rick's. In Tbilisi, they go to Betsy's Place.
On a narrow, steep and crumbling side street of the once raffish and now mostly ravaged capital of Georgia, there is a small hotel. Diplomats, World Bank analysts and consultants stay there. Le tout Tbilisi and visiting jet-setters drop in for dinner. In June, Shahpari Khashoggi, the wife of Adnan Khashoggi, the Saudi financier and former arms trader, had dinner there with the owner, daintily sampling lobio and satsivi by candlelight on the rooftop terrace. 
 The proprietor of the elegant Betsy's Place is in her own way as improbable an expatriate as the one played by Humphrey Bogart. Betsy is actually Elizabeth Haskell, an exquisitely dressed, impeccably coiffed former Baltimore debutante in her late 50's who most days looks as if she just stepped out of a garden club meeting in Georgetown.
"I wanted to call the hotel '21,' as in its address, 21 Gogibashvili, you know, like '21' in New York," she explained in brisk, upper-class tones. "But people kept calling it 'Betsy's Place,' and I figured I had better register before somebody stole the name."
The story behind Betsy's Place could not be more different from the founding of "21" in Manhattan. In 1994, Tbilisi, not yet recovered from civil war with neighboring Abkhasia, was in the throes of a power struggle between rival private armies. It was a city under curfew, with no heat, running water or electricity and gunfire echoing through the night.
That summer, Kalashnikov-toting paramilitary men loyal to Jaba Ioseliani, a charismatic bandit-rebel who is now in jail, took over the lobby of the Metechi Palace, a huge luxury hotel built by an Austrian chain in 1989. Combatants had a habit of spraying the lobby with bullets, leading the United States Embassy to decide it would be imprudent to continue putting up its visiting officials and humanitarian aid workers there.
"The embassy asked me if I could find someplace else," Ms. Haskell, who was then running her own real estate company here, recalled. "I had this wonderful house for rent, with bathrooms on every floor, so I said yes." Three weeks later, she opened for business.
Peace has been restored under President Eduard A. Shevardnadze. Prosperity, however, remains elusive. Foreign investors are not yet flocking in droves, and the occupancy rate of the $300-a-night Metechi Palace hovers at 20 percent.
The 13 rooms and two suites that make up Betsy's Place, however, are booked months in advance and cost $100 to $130 a night. Guests are greeted by cool stone and gleaming hardwood floors, plush Oriental carpets, antique furniture and fresh flowers.
Ms. Haskell installed a diesel-fueled furnace to provide heat and hot water for showers -- one of the few houses in Tbilisi with such a luxury. She has a generator -- and candles -- to deal with the frequent power failures. Telephone service in Tbilisi remains erratic, and guests cannot make trans-Atlantic calls from their rooms. Ms. Haskell is arranging to provide all guests with rented cellular phones.
She said she still had to ship in most supplies from Turkey, even cleaning products, sheets, towels and glassware. "The cost of business is high because everything is imported," she said. "It's like living on Nantucket."
With Georgian and foreign backers, she has also opened a swanky private business club, the Transcaucasian, in a stately mansion belonging to the composers' union. Worried that hotel guests will weary of the local fare of eggplant, tomatoes and cucumber, she is starting her own farm to grow peas and asparagus for her restaurant. "You can get bored with the food," she said with a small sigh. "There isn't much variety."
Ms. Haskell, a former labor organizer who is divorced and was widowed twice, has led a varied life, but she had never run her own business until she moved to Tbilisi five years ago. She had never even lived overseas.
When the Berlin wall came down and the Soviet empire began to crumble, Ms. Haskell was ensconced in Georgetown, running an exchange program to promote understanding between American politicians and their Soviet and Eastern European counterparts.
"Betsy would sweep these foreign dignitaries from the airport in her Chevrolet convertible, take them around and entertain them with fabulous dinner parties at her house," said Ann Polk, a friend in Washington. "Of course, they were all just enchanted."
But the exchange program shut down soon after the failed 1991 coup against the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Ms. Haskell said that without the program to run, she grew bored and restless in Washington. When a young Georgian politician came to her for advice on how to foster democracy under the rule of Georgia's first, authoritarian President, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, she ended up traveling to Tbilisi to organize a seminar on business planning and foreign investment.
Upon her return to Washington, she won a $250,000 grant from Metromedia, the communications giant, to encourage private investment in Georgia. That led to the opening of her real estate firm in 1993 with two female Georgian partners. Asked whether she knew anything about real estate before she started, Ms. Haskell airily replied, "No, but I moved a lot -- after a while, you just sort of know." She said it was easy. "After a month, we had a huge data base," she said. "Basically every house was available -- Georgians always have three houses."
She sold the firm to her partners last year to manage the hotel full time. The secret of her success in the uncharted and Byzantine world of Georgian business, said the confident and well-connected Ms. Haskell, is that she is a sole proprietor, unfettered by the shifting rules that can stymie major joint ventures.
"I'm not a winery or a bottling plant -- I'm a small-business blip," she said. She laughed when asked about corruption, saying, "Corruption can also work your way."
Ms. Haskell, who drives herself around town in a new, teal blue Russian-made Lada, said her only regret was that Tbilisi has nothing in the way of Chinese food, Western movie theaters or shopping.
"There are no real stores here," she said. "I order my clothes from Talbots."

HEADLINE: In Congo, Drivers Find They Can't Get There From Here

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: EPULU, Congo

 BODY:
In a country that may have the worst roads in the world, Sam Onzima was busy doing what drivers often do here in Congo. He was stretched out beneath his Land Rover in the middle of the jungle, hammering away and going nowhere.
"I've been stuck here three weeks," Mr. Onzima, a lanky 37-year-old with an understandably untrimmed beard, said as he stood and stretched beside the road, 20 miles west of the town of Epulu in northeastern Congo. "I hit a pothole and that broke the rear axle." 
 To carry passengers and cargo on these roads, as Mr. Onzima does, requires the patience of Job and the ingenuity of Edison, but most drivers seem equipped with both. Mr. Onzima salvaged a rear differential from another Land Rover that had been stripped and abandoned down the road. Then he lugged everything to Epulu, where someone let him use welding equipment.
"Finding that rear differential really saved me," Mr. Onzima said enthusiastically. "I figure I'll be here another couple of days and then I'll be on my way."
Congo itself is also trying to get back on its way, with the end of decades of rule by the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, and one of its central challenges is to build a transportation network. Congo, which was known as Zaire under Mr. Mobutu, is one-third the size of the United States and mostly in the same state of jungle that existed 1,000 years ago.
Roads are a problem for most of Africa -- the entire continent has only one-quarter as many miles of roads as the United States, even though Africa is three times the size -- and the consequences are profound. In much of Congo, for example, it is impossible to get goods to market, to distribute vaccines, to get children feverish with malaria to a clinic.
"Zaire's roads are maybe the worst, but its problem is representative of the problems in much of the continent except southern Africa," said Salih Booker, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. "This is a big bottleneck for all African countries when it comes to achieving more rapid economic growth."
There is an old joke that Mr. Mobutu once warned the leader of neighboring Rwanda, after a coup attempt there, "That's what happens when you start building roads." But even if impassable roads helped keep freeze the country politically and keep Mr. Mobutu in power, they also fossilized the interior and sent living standards spinning backward.
"The Mobutu regime totally neglected infrastructure, and so there are many villages that have been completely cut off, completely isolated," mused Lobela Alauwa, the Mayor of the hub city of Kisangani. "Those villages never see a truck, never see a bicycle."
Mr. Alauwa jabbed at a torn and faded map dating from 1958 -- the only map of Kisangani available -- and thrust his forefinger at an area where the roads are so overgrown that they have faded into jungle.
"This area is full of forgotten villages," he said. "Nobody even knows about them anymore."
Perhaps it is a commonplace to say that roads are to a nation what arteries and veins are to a human body, and that without circulation there is no development and only decay. But it seems a more profound truth after spending six days traveling across northeastern Congo and into Uganda, after bouncing over huge rocks, after pushing the vehicle through countless mudholes, after catching malaria on the route.
The road, ornamented by the carcasses of little engines that couldn't, plagued by bandits with machine guns, punctuated by submarine bogs that recall the Everglades, is not some minor track. On the contrary, it is now the only supply line across eastern Congo, a crucial link across central Africa, the kind of highway that merits a thick red line on maps.
But for the last few years it had been totally impassable. This spring the rebel soldiers forced their prisoners of war, the troops of the Mobutu Government, to repair the road, and so four-wheel-drive vehicles are again beginning to get through.
Still, a driver needs an assistant to jog ahead of the car for long stretches and wade through mud puddles to make sure that they are not too deep. If the puddles rise to a man's chest, it is time to pull out a machete and carve a bypass through the jungle.

Pockets of Isolation
 
A Provincial Town Is Now Unreachable
In 1960, when Belgium gave up this colony and it became independent, the country had 88,000 miles of usable roads. These days, particularly in the rainy season, there are almost no roads anywhere in the country that can be negotiated by an ordinary car.
In other words, as most of the world is getting smaller, Congo is getting larger.
The city of Buta is a provincial center that used to be just a six-hour drive by ordinary car from Kisangani. Now Congo has expanded so much that Buta is unreachable.
"There are no vehicles going to Buta anymore," Yambello Komba, the chief of a long-distance bus station in Kisangani, said with a look of incredulity. "If you want to go, first you'd have to buy gas for the ferry halfway there and pay it to take you across the river, because the ferry has stopped, too. Then on the other side of the river, the road is so bad that to get to Buta it would take a month, maybe two or three."
Cities like Buta spin off into their own economic universe, cut off from the rest of the world. The isolation is compounded because this region of eastern Congo no longer has postal delivery or inter-city telephone service. In the last year, even intermittent air service has ceased.
Because the roads of Congo are so awful, vehicles are rare on the road from Kisangani to Uganda, about one every two hours in each direction -- which is just as well, since it is a one-lane road. But there are dozens of bicycles for every motor vehicle, and the bicyclists are the real heroes of commerce in this country.
"This is very tough work," grunted Porluku Trofimo, a 30-year-old man who was sweating in the tropical heat as he struggled to push his bicycle and its load of flip-flops and clothes. "But it's the only thing I can do. It's better than stealing."
Mr. Trofimo's bicycle has no pedals, but it does not matter much. Most of the way he must push the bicycle rather than ride it. In any case, if Mr. Trofimo seemed in bad shape, his companion, Ezekiel Kitaholia, was doing even worse.
"I've got malaria," Mr. Kitaholia said weakly as he leaned on his bike during a brief stand-up rest. Looking as if he was about to collapse, he added, "I'm not feeling so good."
Alternately pushing their bicycles and riding them, from dawn to dusk, it takes the two men one week to carry their goods from the market town of Butembo to Isiro, a distance of about 250 miles. Then they sell the goods to shopkeepers in Isiro and buy palm oil to carry back home to Butembo.
They sleep by the side of the road, hiding themselves and their bicycles so bandits will not trouble them, and covering themselves with a tarpaulin when it rains.

The Road Hazards
 
Drivers Watch Out For Bandits, Mines
This concern about banditry -- whether by thieves, guerrillas or Government soldiers -- is a major impediment to commerce in Africa, particularly in Congo.
Under the Mobutu Government, the worst thieves were the soldiers, and the new troops who have defeated Mr. Mobutu's forces are clearly better-mannered. But at nearly every checkpoint, they ask for a donation before moving the barrier from the road; there is no direct threat, but it still seems churlish to refuse a man a gift when he is holding an AK-47 on you.
This particular road, because of the civil war of the last few months, offers a few special concerns.
"This road was mined for the next 60 kilometers," or 35 miles, the driver explained calmly as he left Kisangani for the east. "But I think the mines have probably been discovered, and in any case I'll just follow in the tracks of cars that have gone ahead of us."
A mile later, large mud puddles became frequent, so the driver started swerving to each side to avoid them, producing gasps from the passengers.

The Accidents
 
Trucks and People Get Little Help
In some stretches of the road, travelers spend less time driving than trying to extricate their vehicle from the mud. Trucks also sometimes topple over and block the road, for they are often so overloaded that the center of gravity is far off the ground.
"We just don't have roads," moaned Sammy Ruhigwa, a 32-year-old driver whose truck was stuck near another that had overturned, scattering its contents into the bush. "And without roads, how can you have development?" Mr. Ruhigwa is a mechanic, but even so the challenges of keeping a vehicle going are almost unimaginable. The new Government of Congo has said that improving roads is a major priority, but it would take billions of dollars and many years to establish a modern transportation network. The country needs not only asphalt but much more as well, for along Mr. Ruhigwa's entire route there are no auto supply stores or repair shops, no real gas stations, no tow trucks, no electrical outlets and no telephones.
And when there are accidents or illnesses, there are no doctors.
One quiet afternoon in Epulu, as villagers listlessly tried to sell meals of rice and beans to passing motorists or bicyclists, a group of men struggled to fix a 12-ton truck with axle trouble. It had been jacked up and was resting on sections of logs as several men lay underneath.
Then one of the props gave way. For several moments there was only shocked silence, and then an unearthly scream.
The village erupted as everyone nearby rushed to the truck and braced to lift it up, straining and sweating, precariously lifting it inch by inch, seeing it fall back a bit, and then pushing again, and suddenly it was up and somebody had put a new block under the chassis and two others were pulling out a man whose mouth was gushing blood.
The rescuers rushed him to the nearby clinic. But the clinic is a rudimentary one with no doctor, only a young nurse, who bandaged the man's head and unsuccessfully tried to halt the bleeding. It is unclear if he survived.
All the dangers to life and property naturally add to the cost of transportation. There are very few people in Congo with a good four-wheel-drive vehicle, and few want to risk such a valuable possession by sending it out into the bush.
"That's why things are so expensive out here, because of transportation," said Eduard Steffens, a 57-year-old Congo native who spent 18 years living in the United States.
"By the time you get to Kisangani, your truck is ready to be overhauled," sighed Mr. Steffens, who now makes a living trucking goods across eastern Congo in his pickup. "We're using the vehicles as bulldozers, pushing and scraping our way through."
The town where Mr. Steffens was passing the night, Nia-Nia, underscores the way regions have been almost lost to the jungle because of the decrepitude of the roads. A "Shell" sign still stands guard over the carcass of the local service station, but the building has been abandoned and now a mud hut stands where attendants once pumped gas.

HEADLINE: Mingo Junction Journal;
As Strike Wears On, Town's Life Ebbs

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: MINGO JUNCTION, Ohio, July 4

 BODY:
Archie Wilfred, a bartender at the Schutzen Club, was sweeping the sidewalk and said he had not served a customer all day. Sitting in a corner of the Hometown Luncheonette, which she runs with her husband, Thelma Peterson wondered if the July 4th Special for $3.50 -- one hamburger or two hot dogs, plus macaroni salad, potato salad and baked beans -- would draw any customers.
Lou Lane, who has run Lane's Lounge for 50 years, said business has fallen off so much "there hasn't been a card game in the back room for six months." 
 "Never seen anything like this before," Mr. Lane said from behind the front counter. "This is the worst, and it's been tough on everybody."
Mingo Junction, a town of 4,300 people three miles south of Steubenville, sits at ground zero of the longest steelworker strike in American history. More than 10 months ago, 4,500 workers in eight plants owned by the Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation walked out in a dispute that largely centers on pension benefits. The largest of the plants is here in Mingo Junction. It employed 2,600 of the striking workers, members of the United Steelworkers of America, who made a range of products from car parts to girders.
Periodic negotiations, some with a Federal mediator, have failed to resolve the differences, and caught in the middle are dozens of steel towns along the Ohio River in Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Here and elsewhere, businesses are closing, and families are stressed. The authorities have even attributed several suicides to the strike.
Today was the nation's birthday? It was hardly festive here in Mingo Junction, where the plant runs the length of town and touches virtually everything and everybody, one way or another. Few felt like celebrating. Even backyards in the hills overlooking Main Street and the plant were bereft of family gatherings and barbecues.
"You know, people tell me all the time they are tired of talking about the strike," said Chief Mike J. Maguschak of the Police Department. "But almost every conversation ends with people talking about the strike. It's affecting everything around here."
The town population includes 2,200 families, 400 of which have someone who works for Wheeling-Pitt, as it is known here, giving Mingo Junction one of the highest concentrations of steelworkers among towns in the Ohio Valley. As a result, the impact of the strike has been especially widespread and dramatic.
Not only have local residents lost income from jobs that pay $17 an hour and more, Mayor John A. Corrigan Jr. said Mingo Junction was losing $4,400 a day in fees the plant pays for water when fully operating, money that accounts for about a quarter of the town's $8 million annual budget. Without the money, Mayor Corrigan said, the town has laid off 20 employees, including a firefighter and 2 of its 12 police officers. The strike has also wiped out a summer jobs program that traditionally provides minimum wage work for as many as 80 of the town's young people.
Signs of stress are evident along Main Street. A poster hanging in a flower shop said almost every item was half-price. Down the street at Mazalick's Carryout Deli there was little to carry out. The shelves were empty of most items, except for candy, potato chips, newspapers and ice.
"We're just hanging on," said the owner, Betty Mazalick. "I opened in December and thought the strike would last only a couple of months. I was taking in $400 a day. Now, I'm down to $85. People can't even afford to buy candy."
Gino Ardito, a Mingo Junction native who has run a Main Street hardware and paint store for more than 40 years, said he had been closing up three and four hours early every day because no one had money to spend. He estimated that his business was off 50 percent, "and I'm struggling to keep it open."
Chief Maguschak said that crime had not increased in the last 10 months, but that alcohol-related incidents had. Officers, he said, have responded to more bar fights and domestic calls from "upset wives."
"The general feeling is that a lot of guys are mad," the Chief said. "They're mad about the situation with the company, and that more or less spreads to a lot of things they do."
At an entry to the plant, five strikers gathered for a daily vigil that passes for picketing. They gave up carrying signs long ago and now just hang out as a show of solidarity.
"The biggest thing for me is that I can't save any money," said Jim Guiliano, 43, a pipe fitter and welder who has worked at the plant for 22 years and has a 13-year-old son. "Let's face it, my life is about over, and I'm not going to be able to do anything different. But I would like to set him up so he could maybe go to college."
Several workers said they had known Kelly Lonetta, a 51-year-old crane operator who shot himself in the head about a month ago. Mr. Lonetta had told friends he was "obsessively depressed" over the strike and could not understand why the company was taking such a hard line. He left a wife and two children.
John Wiater, a company spokesman, sympathized with residents of Mingo Junction and other Ohio Valley towns, saying, "No doubt this has been a hardship on all the families."
But Mr. Wiater added that Wheeling-Pitt, a subsidiary of the WHX Corporation, was also at risk, uncertain whether its former customers will return.
That rationale was of little consequence to Mayor Corrigan, who could scarcely hide his depression.
"We're a one-industry town," he said. "Wheeling-Pitt is the heart of Mingo Junction. Right now, the heart is dead, and Mingo Junction is dying."

HEADLINE: Anti-Drug Tax Lifts Kansas City

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo.

 BODY:
When weekends turn rowdy, Preston Washington arranges for his clients to leave home and move temporarily into a halfway house to avoid violating their parole.
"They're living in surroundings where there's a lot of drugging and drinking on weekends," said Mr. Washington, a former policeman and parole officer who runs Opportunity to Succeed, a program that helps ex-convicts find jobs, housing and a drug-free life. 
 "None have barriers like convicted felons," Mr. Washington said. "The opportunity is here for them to make that transition as productive citizens."
Opportunity to Succeed is one of an ingenious array of local programs that are partly financed by tacking a modest quarter of a percent onto the local sales tax imposed in Jackson County, which includes half of Kansas City and all of its inner-city neighborhoods.
Seven years after it went into effect, the county's anti-drug tax remains highly unusual in financing drug treatment and prevention along with law enforcement. At a time when politicians vie to cut taxes, the Jackson County prosecutor, Claire McCaskill, concedes that "the prospect of passing a new tax appears daunting to most people."
Yet the surtax remains popular even though it raises the combined state and city tax to about 6.5 percent in Kansas City and 6 percent elsewhere in the county.
The anti-drug tax was approved by Kansas City voters in 1989 in response to a surge of violent crime that was linked to crack cocaine. But the county's former prosecutor, Albert Riederer, who championed the tax, had no detailed plan for spending the new revenue. More than $400,000 went to buy new computers for the prosecutor's office, while money earmarked for drug prevention and treatment took a long time to reach the street.
The tax's image was hardly enhanced by the choice of a hypodermic syringe as its symbol.
After Ms. McCaskill became prosecutor in 1993, she gave the anti-drug tax an aggressive and acronymic name, Combat, for community-based anti-drug tax. A clenched fist replaced the syringe, and an experienced public health administrator, James T. Nunnelly, was hired to run the program for the prosecutor's office.
The tax itself has been credited with some results. Last year, the number of drug cases filed for prosecution rose to 2,212, from 515 in 1989. Violent crime has declined 30 percent since 1991, pushing Kansas City, which once ranked as the third-most-violent city in the nation, off the list of the worst 10. And as many as 700 people a month have entered or returned to drug treatment, Mr. Nunnelly said.
But with drugs still a problem, other dividends are less tangible. "How do you prove that which you have prevented?" Ms. McCaskill asked.
To find out how voters felt, she organized another referendum to renew the tax in 1995, two years before it was to have expired. This time, 71 percent of the voters approved it, compared with 63 percent the first time around. Some actively campaigned for it, to little opposition.
"With Combat, we taxed our own selves," said Ethel Sutton, the chairwoman of the Vineyard Neighborhood Association, which represents an impoverished downtown area. "We knocked on doors because we wanted the tax."
Some Kansas City residents say the self-imposed tax has strengthened a willingness to work across racial and economic lines to resolve the drug problem.
"It has reinforced the glue that brings people together," said Ron McMillan, an outreach worker for the Kansas City Free Health Clinic, which provides health care for the indigent. "A lot of this is about getting people in the neighborhoods to say, 'Hey, we want to do something about this ourselves.' "
Ricardo Lucas, another outreach worker for Project Neighborhood, a group that steers people with drug-related problems into available programs, said, "Where can you find me, an ex-felon, sitting down with the Mayor and the prosecutor to get things done, not just pitty-pat conversation?"
Of the approximately $16 million raised annually by the tax, about $9.2 million goes to arrest and prosecute drug criminals.
"Combat has allowed us the manpower and resources to attack retail drug sales," said Maj. David M. Barton, the commander of the narcotics and vice division of the Kansas City Police Department.
The tax enables Major Barton to put 27 more detectives on the street and to hire two forensic chemists and several clerical workers.
"It has allowed us to expand and work both ends of the drug chain -- traffickers and retail markets," he said.
The tax has also paid for 19 prosecutors to expedite criminal cases through the court.
The tax supports a county drug task force that pursues drug trafficking outside Kansas City, and another response team that uses local housing codes, unpaid utility bills and neighbors' complaints to close down houses where drugs are sold.
The remaining $6.8 million in annual revenue is spent on drug treatment and prevention as forms of crime deterrence, including a drug court offering nonviolent felons with addiction problems the option of going into treatment instead of prison. Before, only limited state-supported programs were available.
"When people hurt people, we're going to lock them up for as long as we can," Ms. McCaskill said. "When people don't hurt people, we're going to save our money and force them to become good taxpayers. It is the only way this country is going to come to grips with this crisis."
The tax is even used to get truants back in school and to drug-test any juvenile who runs afoul of the criminal justice system.
Mrs. Sutton's Vineyard group received Combat money to enlist unemployed young people in a watch group against vandalism and drugs, and to help build a community center.
"If you live in a raggedy neighborhood, you're going to think raggedy," Mrs. Sutton said.
An alliance between police officials and such community gadflies is rare enough for most cities, but as Ms. McCaskill observed wryly, "There's nothing like money to force collaboration."
Combat money has also been used to match outside grants for drug treatment and prevention, including a summer program to teach computer and social skills to teen-agers.
"Combat is like a magnet that has the capacity to attract national dollars that otherwise wouldn't come into the community," said the Rev. Keith Brown, the director of Project Neighborhood.
Mr. Nunnelly said he did not worry about overextending Combat's resources.
"There are too many people who go at this thing with a one-shot approach, and they don't build a foundation for change," he said. "Don't be in a hurry. Really give it an opportunity to grow."
Mr. McMillan said he came to Kansas City to be treated for a cocaine problem because the waiting list in New York City was so long. He stayed on to do the same for gang members, prostitutes and other street people.
"Combat gives teeth to what I do," Mr. McMillan said. With the programs financed by the tax, he added, "I can take a person and get him into treatment the same day."
Ms. McCaskill said the tax had changed her views about drug abuse.
"This is such a multilayered problem that you've got to cover the waterfront," she said. "We've let the public think that we can take care of the problem. I understand the seduction of telling people what they want to hear, but the criminal justice system is not equipped to take care of the underlying causes of crime and drugs."

HEADLINE: Tiny Rover, Built on the Cheap, Is Set to Explore Mars

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
Space probes used to cost $1 billion a pop. No more. Struggling to slash costs while raising quality, NASA has built an unassuming gadget the size of a child's riding toy to rove across the dry Martian landscape, doing exploration on the cheap.
Despite its relative simplicity, the vehicle, named Sojourner, is to be the first to roam the surface of another planet. If it proves adept, the Sojourner will wander for a week, taking close-up pictures of rocks and analyzing their chemical makeup, shedding light on the inner nature of Mars. And if it is highly successful, it will do so for a month. 
 "It's the culmination of a lifelong dream for me," said Dr. Donna L. Shirley, the vehicle's designer and head of Mars exploration at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
"Going vicariously is not quite as good as being there," the 55-year-old engineer said of robotic exploration. "But it's a lot easier."
It's a lot cheaper, too, especially as mission designers have kept a sharp eye on cutting expenses, mainly by using "off the shelf" parts rather than developing new ones.
Costing a mere $25 million, the six-wheeled rover has small motors and a modest computer brain (with just 6,500 transistors, compared with 5.5 million in the best Pentium models).
The first hint of its birth came in the 1980's as Dr. Shirley dreamed of putting roving vehicles on Mars, seeking a way to follow up on the successful but expensive Viking missions of the 1970's, which cost the equivalent of $3 billion in today's dollars. She eventually headed a panel that said a return to Mars, if ever to be more than a dream, had to pinch pennies.
NASA balked at that advice. But in 1992, Daniel S. Goldin was appointed Administrator of the space agency and started a campaign to revitalize it by making its projects smaller, cheaper, faster and better.
Rather quickly, Dr. Shirley's plan got a thumbs up. And she was chosen to coordinate the new Mars push.
The rover that developed under Dr. Shirley's guidance is the heart of the $266 million Mars Pathfinder mission. It weighed only 34.2 pounds at launching and a mere 23 pounds once mobile on the Martian surface, where gravity is relatively weak.
At top speed, the vehicle crawls along at just 16 inches a minute, or 80 feet an hour. It has three cameras -- a forward stereo pair and a rear-looking one.
Its solar-power cells have an area of 1.9 square feet, sufficient to energize the rover for several hours a day, even in the worst dust storms. As a backup, the rover also has D-cell batteries. For the sake of simplicity and economy, they are not rechargeable.
The rover's brain is an Intel 80C85 processor, selected for its low cost and ruggedness. In speed and power, it lags behind many processors in the commercial computer market.
The rover carries an alpha proton X-ray spectrometer that will be pressed against soil and rock outcroppings to study their composition. Collecting data for each sample will take up to 10 hours, providing the first chemical analyses of what Mars is made of, as well as insights into its evolution and geologic history. The previous Viking landers conducted biological tests, which failed to detect any unambiguous signs of life.
The rover is to talk to the lander over a radio modem operating at 9,600 baud, which is slow compared with many terrestrial wireless data systems. The transmission range is up to about a third of a mile, but early operations are expected to be much closer, within a few dozen feet of the lander. The lander will then relay the images and data to Earth.
The time for radio signals to travel round-trip from Mars to Earth to Mars is about 20 minutes. This delay rules out ground operators on Earth controlling the rover in "real time." So the designers included a system to detect and avoid such hazards as hitting big rocks or driving off a cliff.
The system uses video images, laser-ranging and sensors of vehicle motion to help the rover detect obstacles in its path and avoid them.
John B. Wellman, the head of experiment operations for Mars Pathfinder, said that doing the mission on the cheap was "a challenge for all of us," and added, "All the people involved have been rather ingenious at doing things at lower cost."

The Sojourner's primary mission is to test how a self-powered, self-guided rover can make its way around the poorly understood terrain of Mars. It is also designed to take pictures and analyze rocks.

HEADLINE: Clinton and Internet

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Qualified congratulations are due the policy adviser Ira C. Magaziner and the rest of the Clinton Administration for taking a largely hands-off approach with regard to taxation and regulation of the Internet and electronic commerce (Business Day, June 30).
Let the Internet thrive and grow, and we'll position the United States at the forefront of the information economy in the 21st century.
For once, Washington seems to be resisting its we-know-best impulse to regulate. 
 I'm cautiously optimistic that deeds will follow words and that, in this case, President Clinton will prove Ronald Reagan wrong. ("If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it.")

HEADLINE: In Congo, Drivers Find They Can't Get There From Here

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: EPULU, Congo

 BODY:
In a country that may have the worst roads in the world, Sam Onzima was busy doing what drivers often do here in Congo. He was stretched out beneath his Land Rover in the middle of the jungle, hammering away and going nowhere.
"I've been stuck here three weeks," Mr. Onzima, a lanky 37-year-old with an understandably untrimmed beard, said as he stood and stretched beside the road, 20 miles west of the town of Epulu in northeastern Congo. "I hit a pothole and that broke the rear axle." 
 To carry passengers and cargo on these roads, as Mr. Onzima does, requires the patience of Job and the ingenuity of Edison, but most drivers seem equipped with both. Mr. Onzima salvaged a rear differential from another Land Rover that had been stripped and abandoned down the road. Then he lugged everything to Epulu, where someone let him use welding equipment.
"Finding that rear differential really saved me," Mr. Onzima said enthusiastically. "I figure I'll be here another couple of days and then I'll be on my way."
Congo itself is also trying to get back on its way, with the end of decades of rule by the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, and one of its central challenges is to build a transportation network. Congo, which was known as Zaire under Mr. Mobutu, is one-third the size of the United States and mostly in the same state of jungle that existed 1,000 years ago.
Roads are a problem for most of Africa -- the entire continent has only one-quarter as many miles of roads as the United States, even though Africa is three times the size -- and the consequences are profound. In much of Congo, for example, it is impossible to get goods to market, to distribute vaccines, to get children feverish with malaria to a clinic.
"Zaire's roads are maybe the worst, but its problem is representative of the problems in much of the continent except southern Africa," said Salih Booker, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. "This is a big bottleneck for all African countries when it comes to achieving more rapid economic growth."
There is an old joke that Mr. Mobutu once warned the leader of neighboring Rwanda, after a coup attempt there, "That's what happens when you start building roads." But even if impassable roads helped keep freeze the country politically and keep Mr. Mobutu in power, they also fossilized the interior and sent living standards spinning backward.
"The Mobutu regime totally neglected infrastructure, and so there are many villages that have been completely cut off, completely isolated," mused Lobela Alauwa, the Mayor of the hub city of Kisangani. "Those villages never see a truck, never see a bicycle."
Mr. Alauwa jabbed at a torn and faded map dating from 1958 -- the only map of Kisangani available -- and thrust his forefinger at an area where the roads are so overgrown that they have faded into jungle.
"This area is full of forgotten villages," he said. "Nobody even knows about them anymore."
Perhaps it is a commonplace to say that roads are to a nation what arteries and veins are to a human body, and that without circulation there is no development and only decay. But it seems a more profound truth after spending six days traveling across northeastern Congo and into Uganda, after bouncing over huge rocks, after pushing the vehicle through countless mudholes, after catching malaria on the route.
The road, ornamented by the carcasses of little engines that couldn't, plagued by bandits with machine guns, punctuated by submarine bogs that recall the Everglades, is not some minor track. On the contrary, it is now the only supply line across eastern Congo, a crucial link across central Africa, the kind of highway that merits a thick red line on maps.
But for the last few years it had been totally impassable. This spring the rebel soldiers forced their prisoners of war, the troops of the Mobutu Government, to repair the road, and so four-wheel-drive vehicles are again beginning to get through.
Still, a driver needs an assistant to jog ahead of the car for long stretches and wade through mud puddles to make sure that they are not too deep. If the puddles rise to a man's chest, it is time to pull out a machete and carve a bypass through the jungle.

Pockets of Isolation
 
A Provincial Town Is Now Unreachable
In 1960, when Belgium gave up this colony and it became independent, the country had 88,000 miles of usable roads. These days, particularly in the rainy season, there are almost no roads anywhere in the country that can be negotiated by an ordinary car.
In other words, as most of the world is getting smaller, Congo is getting larger.
The city of Buta is a provincial center that used to be just a six-hour drive by ordinary car from Kisangani. Now Congo has expanded so much that Buta is unreachable.
"There are no vehicles going to Buta anymore," Yambello Komba, the chief of a long-distance bus station in Kisangani, said with a look of incredulity. "If you want to go, first you'd have to buy gas for the ferry halfway there and pay it to take you across the river, because the ferry has stopped, too. Then on the other side of the river, the road is so bad that to get to Buta it would take a month, maybe two or three."
Cities like Buta spin off into their own economic universe, cut off from the rest of the world. The isolation is compounded because this region of eastern Congo no longer has postal delivery or inter-city telephone service. In the last year, even intermittent air service has ceased.
Because the roads of Congo are so awful, vehicles are rare on the road from Kisangani to Uganda, about one every two hours in each direction -- which is just as well, since it is a one-lane road. But there are dozens of bicycles for every motor vehicle, and the bicyclists are the real heroes of commerce in this country.
"This is very tough work," grunted Porluku Trofimo, a 30-year-old man who was sweating in the tropical heat as he struggled to push his bicycle and its load of flip-flops and clothes. "But it's the only thing I can do. It's better than stealing."
Mr. Trofimo's bicycle has no pedals, but it does not matter much. Most of the way he must push the bicycle rather than ride it. In any case, if Mr. Trofimo seemed in bad shape, his companion, Ezekiel Kitaholia, was doing even worse.
"I've got malaria," Mr. Kitaholia said weakly as he leaned on his bike during a brief stand-up rest. Looking as if he was about to collapse, he added, "I'm not feeling so good."
Alternately pushing their bicycles and riding them, from dawn to dusk, it takes the two men one week to carry their goods from the market town of Butembo to Isiro, a distance of about 250 miles. Then they sell the goods to shopkeepers in Isiro and buy palm oil to carry back home to Butembo.
They sleep by the side of the road, hiding themselves and their bicycles so bandits will not trouble them, and covering themselves with a tarpaulin when it rains.

The Road Hazards
 
Drivers Watch Out For Bandits, Mines
This concern about banditry -- whether by thieves, guerrillas or Government soldiers -- is a major impediment to commerce in Africa, particularly in Congo.
Under the Mobutu Government, the worst thieves were the soldiers, and the new troops who have defeated Mr. Mobutu's forces are clearly better-mannered. But at nearly every checkpoint, they ask for a donation before moving the barrier from the road; there is no direct threat, but it still seems churlish to refuse a man a gift when he is holding an AK-47 on you.
This particular road, because of the civil war of the last few months, offers a few special concerns.
"This road was mined for the next 60 kilometers," or 35 miles, the driver explained calmly as he left Kisangani for the east. "But I think the mines have probably been discovered, and in any case I'll just follow in the tracks of cars that have gone ahead of us."
A mile later, large mud puddles became frequent, so the driver started swerving to each side to avoid them, producing gasps from the passengers.

The Accidents
 
Trucks and People Get Little Help
In some stretches of the road, travelers spend less time driving than trying to extricate their vehicle from the mud. Trucks also sometimes topple over and block the road, for they are often so overloaded that the center of gravity is far off the ground.
"We just don't have roads," moaned Sammy Ruhigwa, a 32-year-old driver whose truck was stuck near another that had overturned, scattering its contents into the bush. "And without roads, how can you have development?" Mr. Ruhigwa is a mechanic, but even so the challenges of keeping a vehicle going are almost unimaginable. The new Government of Congo has said that improving roads is a major priority, but it would take billions of dollars and many years to establish a modern transportation network. The country needs not only asphalt but much more as well, for along Mr. Ruhigwa's entire route there are no auto supply stores or repair shops, no real gas stations, no tow trucks, no electrical outlets and no telephones.
And when there are accidents or illnesses, there are no doctors.
One quiet afternoon in Epulu, as villagers listlessly tried to sell meals of rice and beans to passing motorists or bicyclists, a group of men struggled to fix a 12-ton truck with axle trouble. It had been jacked up and was resting on sections of logs as several men lay underneath.
Then one of the props gave way. For several moments there was only shocked silence, and then an unearthly scream.
The village erupted as everyone nearby rushed to the truck and braced to lift it up, straining and sweating, precariously lifting it inch by inch, seeing it fall back a bit, and then pushing again, and suddenly it was up and somebody had put a new block under the chassis and two others were pulling out a man whose mouth was gushing blood.
The rescuers rushed him to the nearby clinic. But the clinic is a rudimentary one with no doctor, only a young nurse, who bandaged the man's head and unsuccessfully tried to halt the bleeding. It is unclear if he survived.
All the dangers to life and property naturally add to the cost of transportation. There are very few people in Congo with a good four-wheel-drive vehicle, and few want to risk such a valuable possession by sending it out into the bush.
"That's why things are so expensive out here, because of transportation," said Eduard Steffens, a 57-year-old Congo native who spent 18 years living in the United States.
"By the time you get to Kisangani, your truck is ready to be overhauled," sighed Mr. Steffens, who now makes a living trucking goods across eastern Congo in his pickup. "We're using the vehicles as bulldozers, pushing and scraping our way through."
The town where Mr. Steffens was passing the night, Nia-Nia, underscores the way regions have been almost lost to the jungle because of the decrepitude of the roads. A "Shell" sign still stands guard over the carcass of the local service station, but the building has been abandoned and now a mud hut stands where attendants once pumped gas.

However, even when a truck is upright, the challenges of keeping it moving on the muddy and sometimes-mined road are almost unimaginable. (Stephen Crowley/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Mingo Junction Journal;
As Strike Wears On, Town's Life Ebbs

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: MINGO JUNCTION, Ohio, July 4

 BODY:
Archie Wilfred, a bartender at the Schutzen Club, was sweeping the sidewalk and said he had not served a customer all day. Sitting in a corner of the Hometown Luncheonette, which she runs with her husband, Thelma Peterson wondered if the July 4th Special for $3.50 -- one hamburger or two hot dogs, plus macaroni salad, potato salad and baked beans -- would draw any customers.
Lou Lane, who has run Lane's Lounge for 50 years, said business has fallen off so much "there hasn't been a card game in the back room for six months." 
 "Never seen anything like this before," Mr. Lane said from behind the front counter. "This is the worst, and it's been tough on everybody."
Mingo Junction, a town of 4,300 people three miles south of Steubenville, sits at ground zero of the longest steelworker strike in American history. More than 10 months ago, 4,500 workers in eight plants owned by the Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation walked out in a dispute that largely centers on pension benefits. The largest of the plants is here in Mingo Junction. It employed 2,600 of the striking workers, members of the United Steelworkers of America, who made a range of products from car parts to girders.
Periodic negotiations, some with a Federal mediator, have failed to resolve the differences, and caught in the middle are dozens of steel towns along the Ohio River in Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Here and elsewhere, businesses are closing, and families are stressed. The authorities have even attributed several suicides to the strike.
Today was the nation's birthday? It was hardly festive here in Mingo Junction, where the plant runs the length of town and touches virtually everything and everybody, one way or another. Few felt like celebrating. Even backyards in the hills overlooking Main Street and the plant were bereft of family gatherings and barbecues.
"You know, people tell me all the time they are tired of talking about the strike," said Chief Mike J. Maguschak of the Police Department. "But almost every conversation ends with people talking about the strike. It's affecting everything around here."
The town population includes 2,200 families, 400 of which have someone who works for Wheeling-Pitt, as it is known here, giving Mingo Junction one of the highest concentrations of steelworkers among towns in the Ohio Valley. As a result, the impact of the strike has been especially widespread and dramatic.
Not only have local residents lost income from jobs that pay $17 an hour and more, Mayor John A. Corrigan Jr. said Mingo Junction was losing $4,400 a day in fees the plant pays for water when fully operating, money that accounts for about a quarter of the town's $8 million annual budget. Without the money, Mayor Corrigan said, the town has laid off 20 employees, including a firefighter and 2 of its 12 police officers. The strike has also wiped out a summer jobs program that traditionally provides minimum wage work for as many as 80 of the town's young people.
Signs of stress are evident along Main Street. A poster hanging in a flower shop said almost every item was half-price. Down the street at Mazalick's Carryout Deli there was little to carry out. The shelves were empty of most items, except for candy, potato chips, newspapers and ice.
"We're just hanging on," said the owner, Betty Mazalick. "I opened in December and thought the strike would last only a couple of months. I was taking in $400 a day. Now, I'm down to $85. People can't even afford to buy candy."
Gino Ardito, a Mingo Junction native who has run a Main Street hardware and paint store for more than 40 years, said he had been closing up three and four hours early every day because no one had money to spend. He estimated that his business was off 50 percent, "and I'm struggling to keep it open."
Chief Maguschak said that crime had not increased in the last 10 months, but that alcohol-related incidents had. Officers, he said, have responded to more bar fights and domestic calls from "upset wives."
"The general feeling is that a lot of guys are mad," the Chief said. "They're mad about the situation with the company, and that more or less spreads to a lot of things they do."
At an entry to the plant, five strikers gathered for a daily vigil that passes for picketing. They gave up carrying signs long ago and now just hang out as a show of solidarity.
"The biggest thing for me is that I can't save any money," said Jim Guiliano, 43, a pipe fitter and welder who has worked at the plant for 22 years and has a 13-year-old son. "Let's face it, my life is about over, and I'm not going to be able to do anything different. But I would like to set him up so he could maybe go to college."
Several workers said they had known Kelly Lonetta, a 51-year-old crane operator who shot himself in the head about a month ago. Mr. Lonetta had told friends he was "obsessively depressed" over the strike and could not understand why the company was taking such a hard line. He left a wife and two children.
John Wiater, a company spokesman, sympathized with residents of Mingo Junction and other Ohio Valley towns, saying, "No doubt this has been a hardship on all the families."
But Mr. Wiater added that Wheeling-Pitt, a subsidiary of the WHX Corporation, was also at risk, uncertain whether its former customers will return.
That rationale was of little consequence to Mayor Corrigan, who could scarcely hide his depression.
"We're a one-industry town," he said. "Wheeling-Pitt is the heart of Mingo Junction. Right now, the heart is dead, and Mingo Junction is dying."

HEADLINE: Anti-Drug Tax Lifts Kansas City

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo.

 BODY:
When weekends turn rowdy, Preston Washington arranges for his clients to leave home and move temporarily into a halfway house to avoid violating their parole.
"They're living in surroundings where there's a lot of drugging and drinking on weekends," said Mr. Washington, a former policeman and parole officer who runs Opportunity to Succeed, a program that helps ex-convicts find jobs, housing and a drug-free life. 
 "None have barriers like convicted felons," Mr. Washington said. "The opportunity is here for them to make that transition as productive citizens."
Opportunity to Succeed is one of an ingenious array of local programs that are partly financed by tacking a modest quarter of a percent onto the local sales tax imposed in Jackson County, which includes half of Kansas City and all of its inner-city neighborhoods.
Seven years after it went into effect, the county's anti-drug tax remains highly unusual in financing drug treatment and prevention along with law enforcement. At a time when politicians vie to cut taxes, the Jackson County prosecutor, Claire McCaskill, concedes that "the prospect of passing a new tax appears daunting to most people."
Yet the surtax remains popular even though it raises the combined state and city tax to about 6.5 percent in Kansas City and 6 percent elsewhere in the county.
The anti-drug tax was approved by Kansas City voters in 1989 in response to a surge of violent crime that was linked to crack cocaine. But the county's former prosecutor, Albert Riederer, who championed the tax, had no detailed plan for spending the new revenue. More than $400,000 went to buy new computers for the prosecutor's office, while money earmarked for drug prevention and treatment took a long time to reach the street.
The tax's image was hardly enhanced by the choice of a hypodermic syringe as its symbol.
After Ms. McCaskill became prosecutor in 1993, she gave the anti-drug tax an aggressive and acronymic name, Combat, for community-based anti-drug tax. A clenched fist replaced the syringe, and an experienced public health administrator, James T. Nunnelly, was hired to run the program for the prosecutor's office.
The tax itself has been credited with some results. Last year, the number of drug cases filed for prosecution rose to 2,212, from 515 in 1989. Violent crime has declined 30 percent since 1991, pushing Kansas City, which once ranked as the third-most-violent city in the nation, off the list of the worst 10. And as many as 700 people a month have entered or returned to drug treatment, Mr. Nunnelly said.
But with drugs still a problem, other dividends are less tangible. "How do you prove that which you have prevented?" Ms. McCaskill asked.
To find out how voters felt, she organized another referendum to renew the tax in 1995, two years before it was to have expired. This time, 71 percent of the voters approved it, compared with 63 percent the first time around. Some actively campaigned for it, to little opposition.
"With Combat, we taxed our own selves," said Ethel Sutton, the chairwoman of the Vineyard Neighborhood Association, which represents an impoverished downtown area. "We knocked on doors because we wanted the tax."
Some Kansas City residents say the self-imposed tax has strengthened a willingness to work across racial and economic lines to resolve the drug problem.
"It has reinforced the glue that brings people together," said Ron McMillan, an outreach worker for the Kansas City Free Health Clinic, which provides health care for the indigent. "A lot of this is about getting people in the neighborhoods to say, 'Hey, we want to do something about this ourselves.' "
Ricardo Lucas, another outreach worker for Project Neighborhood, a group that steers people with drug-related problems into available programs, said, "Where can you find me, an ex-felon, sitting down with the Mayor and the prosecutor to get things done, not just pitty-pat conversation?"
Of the approximately $16 million raised annually by the tax, about $9.2 million goes to arrest and prosecute drug criminals.
"Combat has allowed us the manpower and resources to attack retail drug sales," said Maj. David M. Barton, the commander of the narcotics and vice division of the Kansas City Police Department.
The tax enables Major Barton to put 27 more detectives on the street and to hire two forensic chemists and several clerical workers.
"It has allowed us to expand and work both ends of the drug chain -- traffickers and retail markets," he said.
The tax has also paid for 19 prosecutors to expedite criminal cases through the court.
The tax supports a county drug task force that pursues drug trafficking outside Kansas City, and another response team that uses local housing codes, unpaid utility bills and neighbors' complaints to close down houses where drugs are sold.
The remaining $6.8 million in annual revenue is spent on drug treatment and prevention as forms of crime deterrence, including a drug court offering nonviolent felons with addiction problems the option of going into treatment instead of prison. Before, only limited state-supported programs were available.
"When people hurt people, we're going to lock them up for as long as we can," Ms. McCaskill said. "When people don't hurt people, we're going to save our money and force them to become good taxpayers. It is the only way this country is going to come to grips with this crisis."
The tax is even used to get truants back in school and to drug-test any juvenile who runs afoul of the criminal justice system.
Mrs. Sutton's Vineyard group received Combat money to enlist unemployed young people in a watch group against vandalism and drugs, and to help build a community center.
"If you live in a raggedy neighborhood, you're going to think raggedy," Mrs. Sutton said.
An alliance between police officials and such community gadflies is rare enough for most cities, but as Ms. McCaskill observed wryly, "There's nothing like money to force collaboration."
Combat money has also been used to match outside grants for drug treatment and prevention, including a summer program to teach computer and social skills to teen-agers.
"Combat is like a magnet that has the capacity to attract national dollars that otherwise wouldn't come into the community," said the Rev. Keith Brown, the director of Project Neighborhood.
Mr. Nunnelly said he did not worry about overextending Combat's resources.
"There are too many people who go at this thing with a one-shot approach, and they don't build a foundation for change," he said. "Don't be in a hurry. Really give it an opportunity to grow."
Mr. McMillan said he came to Kansas City to be treated for a cocaine problem because the waiting list in New York City was so long. He stayed on to do the same for gang members, prostitutes and other street people.
"Combat gives teeth to what I do," Mr. McMillan said. With the programs financed by the tax, he added, "I can take a person and get him into treatment the same day."
Ms. McCaskill said the tax had changed her views about drug abuse.
"This is such a multilayered problem that you've got to cover the waterfront," she said. "We've let the public think that we can take care of the problem. I understand the seduction of telling people what they want to hear, but the criminal justice system is not equipped to take care of the underlying causes of crime and drugs."

HEADLINE: Tiny Rover, Built on the Cheap, Is Set to Explore Mars

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
Space probes used to cost $1 billion a pop. No more. Struggling to slash costs while raising quality, NASA has built an unassuming gadget the size of a child's riding toy to rove across the dry Martian landscape, doing exploration on the cheap.
Despite its relative simplicity, the vehicle, named Sojourner, is to be the first to roam the surface of another planet. If it proves adept, the Sojourner will wander for a week, taking close-up pictures of rocks and analyzing their chemical makeup, shedding light on the inner nature of Mars. And if it is highly successful, it will do so for a month. 
 "It's the culmination of a lifelong dream for me," said Dr. Donna L. Shirley, the vehicle's designer and head of Mars exploration at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
"Going vicariously is not quite as good as being there," the 55-year-old engineer said of robotic exploration. "But it's a lot easier."
It's a lot cheaper, too, especially as mission designers have kept a sharp eye on cutting expenses, mainly by using "off the shelf" parts rather than developing new ones.
Costing a mere $25 million, the six-wheeled rover has small motors and a modest computer brain (with just 6,500 transistors, compared with 5.5 million in the best Pentium models).
The first hint of its birth came in the 1980's as Dr. Shirley dreamed of putting roving vehicles on Mars, seeking a way to follow up on the successful but expensive Viking missions of the 1970's, which cost the equivalent of $3 billion in today's dollars. She eventually headed a panel that said a return to Mars, if ever to be more than a dream, had to pinch pennies.
NASA balked at that advice. But in 1992, Daniel S. Goldin was appointed Administrator of the space agency and started a campaign to revitalize it by making its projects smaller, cheaper, faster and better.
Rather quickly, Dr. Shirley's plan got a thumbs up. And she was chosen to coordinate the new Mars push.
The rover that developed under Dr. Shirley's guidance is the heart of the $266 million Mars Pathfinder mission. It weighed only 34.2 pounds at launching and a mere 23 pounds once mobile on the Martian surface, where gravity is relatively weak.
At top speed, the vehicle crawls along at just 16 inches a minute, or 80 feet an hour. It has three cameras -- a forward stereo pair and a rear-looking one.
Its solar-power cells have an area of 1.9 square feet, sufficient to energize the rover for several hours a day, even in the worst dust storms. As a backup, the rover also has D-cell batteries. For the sake of simplicity and economy, they are not rechargeable.
The rover's brain is an Intel 80C85 processor, selected for its low cost and ruggedness. In speed and power, it lags behind many processors in the commercial computer market.
The rover carries an alpha proton X-ray spectrometer that will be pressed against soil and rock outcroppings to study their composition. Collecting data for each sample will take up to 10 hours, providing the first chemical analyses of what Mars is made of, as well as insights into its evolution and geologic history. The previous Viking landers conducted biological tests, which failed to detect any unambiguous signs of life.
The rover is to talk to the lander over a radio modem operating at 9,600 baud, which is slow compared with many terrestrial wireless data systems. The transmission range is up to about a third of a mile, but early operations are expected to be much closer, within a few dozen feet of the lander. The lander will then relay the images and data to Earth.
The time for radio signals to travel round-trip from Mars to Earth to Mars is about 20 minutes. This delay rules out ground operators on Earth controlling the rover in "real time." So the designers included a system to detect and avoid such hazards as hitting big rocks or driving off a cliff.
The system uses video images, laser-ranging and sensors of vehicle motion to help the rover detect obstacles in its path and avoid them.
John B. Wellman, the head of experiment operations for Mars Pathfinder, said that doing the mission on the cheap was "a challenge for all of us," and added, "All the people involved have been rather ingenious at doing things at lower cost."

The Sojourner's primary mission is to test how a self-powered, self-guided rover can make its way around the poorly understood terrain of Mars. It is also designed to take pictures and analyze rocks.

HEADLINE: Clinton and Internet

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Qualified congratulations are due the policy adviser Ira C. Magaziner and the rest of the Clinton Administration for taking a largely hands-off approach with regard to taxation and regulation of the Internet and electronic commerce (Business Day, June 30).
Let the Internet thrive and grow, and we'll position the United States at the forefront of the information economy in the 21st century.
For once, Washington seems to be resisting its we-know-best impulse to regulate. 
 I'm cautiously optimistic that deeds will follow words and that, in this case, President Clinton will prove Ronald Reagan wrong. ("If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it.")

MONEY
 Who Has How Much and Why.
 By Andrew Hacker.
 254 pp. New York:
 Scribner. $25. 
 Jerry Seinfeld gets at least $22 million next year. Is he worth it? NBC thinks so. It pulls in more than $1 million a minute from advertisements during the show. The laundry worker down my street earns around $13,500 a year. Is he worth it? The laundry thinks so. Even though the economy is booming, it can get someone to replace him if he demands a penny more.
In his engaging book "Money," Andrew Hacker, a professor of political science at Queens College, examines who earns what, and why they do. He shows that most Americans are more like the person who does my laundry than like Seinfeld. If $30,000 is set as a minimum middle-class income, fewer than a third of all employed Americans can be considered middle class. Even at $20,000, only about half can.
At the very top, with yearly incomes over $1 million, sit some 68,000 of the nation's highest rollers (from whose ranks, Hacker tells us, came one-quarter of all the delegates to the most recent Republican National Convention), including 1,500 people on Wall Street, 600 chief executives, 246 professional football players, 241 baseball players and a collection of inventors, entertainers, entrepreneurs, financial wizards and heirs. Just under them come America's richest professionals -- the top 1 percent of all earners, with yearly incomes starting at $200,000 -- featuring not only star doctors and lawyers but also heads of charitable foundations (the Ford Foundation pays its president $839,139), university presidents (more than half a million dollars at Boston University) and even a football coach ($975,000 at Florida State, including endorsements).
These generous incomes are mostly explained by the special skills or education of their recipients. In Hacker's view, the substance of what they learned in college is less important than the style. "The years at college and graduate school pay off because they burnish students' personalities. The time spent on a campus imparts cues and clues on how to conduct oneself in corporate cultures and professional settings." Professors themselves, although hardly in the top ranks, are paid comfortable salaries "not so much for teaching subjects like history and philosophy as for being a professional presence that students can emulate."
The rest of Hacker's explanation for why the very rich got that way has even less to do with their expertise. He argues that when organizations or individuals want to demonstrate they are getting the "best," they hire people who are already paid the most. A similar ratcheting-up occurs with corporate boards, which always want to pay their chieftains just above the norm in order to prove that the company is ahead of the rest of the pack; or with Wall Street investment bankers, who conventionally receive a 1 percent commission on all deals and so promote the biggest ones conceivable. In any event, a payment of tens of millions of dollars just doesn't seem that extravagant when one is presiding over billions. How else to explain Michael Ovitz's $128 million severance package for about 60 weeks' work at Disney?
The bottom 80 percent of the population, meanwhile, receives a smaller share of the nation's total income than it did 20 years ago. The shift began in the early 1970's, when the median earnings of men began dropping. Middle-income households avoided downward mobility only by sending wives to work and by postponing both marriage and children. At the same time, the poor have become poorer. Some of this downdraft has been caused by technological advances and globalization, hurting those with few or outmoded skills.
Here, too, Hacker suggests additional culprits. Long-term contracts and wage-setting institutions that once shielded blue-collar workers, teachers and low-level civil servants from the labor auction block are disappearing. Meanwhile, the lowest economic rungs, on which most two-income families had once perched, are now occupied by single-parent households. In 1995, 31.3 percent of American children lived with just one parent or with someone other than a parent, up from under 15 percent in 1970. Largely as a result, a third of America's children now live in households earning less than $25,000. One in five children lives in poverty. For all its riches, the United States now has a greater percentage of its citizens in prison or on the streets, and more neglected children, than any other advanced nation.
This story isn't new, but Hacker embellishes it with rich detail. In 1970, for example, 3.1 percent of American households lived in trailers or mobile homes; by 1990, it was 7.2 percent. Sometimes the precision and profusion of his detail overwhelm his argument. (In 1995, the average sewing-machine operator earned $13,052; a hotel clerk, $15,028; and an orthopedic surgeon, $304,000. The median household income in West Virginia was $24,880, while in Connecticut it was $40,243. The poverty threshold for one person living alone was $7,763.)
From such an abundance of data, Hacker draws some provocative conclusions. He argues, for example, that certain states have intentionally low-balled welfare allowances in order to create "a ready pool of women to work at a minimum wage as household servants, motel maids and in food-processing plants." Some of his verdicts are simply bizarre, as when he states that "the farther a country is from the United States, the more likely will its immigrants be to secure higher-paying employment" because "it takes more resources, either financial or personal, to get here from India or the Philippines than, say, Mexico or the Dominican Republic." Canadians and Cambodians alike would find this statement curious.
Hacker is appropriately concerned about the corrosive consequences of growing disparities in wealth and earnings among Americans. "With the legacy we are now creating," he writes, "millions of men, women, children are prevented from being fully American, while others pride themselves on how much they can amass." But he is curiously silent about what we might do to reverse the trend. His skepticism about the substantive purposes of higher education and his awareness of the difficulties in countering any of the institutional or sociological reasons for the widening gap lead him to the brink of suggesting, perhaps by default, a far more progressive system of taxation.
Hacker notes, for example, that as recently as 1979, rich Americans paid an average of 47 percent of their income in Federal taxes. By 1994, the effective rate had declined to 32 percent.
In theory, economic winners could redistribute much of their earnings to losers and yet still come out far ahead. As an extreme example, he observes that an income ceiling of $100,000 per year, affecting approximately the top 7 percent of American families, would yield $285 billion annually -- a sum that, if transferred to the poorest 20 percent, whose incomes now average $7,764, would establish a floor of $22,219 per family.
But Hacker hastily warns us off any such fanciful thoughts. His book "should not be read as a plea for income redistribution," he protests near its end. "The reason is straightforward: if people are disinclined to share what they have, they will not be persuaded by a reproachful tone." One worries that the elevated tone he chooses instead may be too high to be heard.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
True Grits in Nashville

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV; ERIC ASIMOV writes the $25 and Under dining column for the Weekend section of The New York Times

 BODY:
SATURDAY night is rush hour in downtown Nashville. Cars stand bumper to bumper on Broadway, as police officers on bicycles wind slowly through the crowd. A gawking couple steps out of a horse-drawn carriage in front of the Old Spaghetti Factory, a franchise restaurant down the block from Hooters and around the corner from Planet Hollywood and the Hard Rock Cafe.
This is born-again Nashville, or "Nash Vegas," as denizens call it, where the prefabricated glitz of franchise clubs and packaged country entertainment is proving an irresistible siren to tourists. 
 I was hoping to find another city, where the music was more bourbon than Perrier, where the Southern restaurants still featured the Tennessee trinity of pork, pig and ham, and where lard, salt and "I'll have another beer" weren't dirty words. After all, it was just going to be a three-day weekend. And it was going to be cheap. In Nashville, music and food, judiciously chosen, are bargains.
The problem was getting there. Because I was arranging my trip on short notice -- just three days ahead -- a reasonable air fare between New York and Nashville was hard to find. American Airlines, one of the few airlines with a direct flight, quoted a fare of $992.
I tried the airline consolidators, those companies that acquire tickets in bulk and make them available at cut-rate prices, and easily found considerably cheaper round trips, $295 plus tax, but no direct flights. Then a solution appeared before my eyes.
Recently, I had subscribed to Net Saaver, a free weekly E-mail newsletter from American Airlines available through the American Web site, www.americanair.com. Net Saaver arrives each Wednesday, announcing last-minute discount fares available only on the coming weekend. These fares require departure on a Friday after 7 P.M. or anytime Saturday, with return the following Monday or Tuesday. The list of available tickets changes every week, and, from a New Yorker's perspective, the choices were always slim, with fares between New York and anywhere scarce.
This week, though, I was in luck. The current Net Saaver offered a round trip between New York and Nashville for a mere $129 plus tax! What's more, I could also rent a Hertz economy car with unlimited mileage for $24 a day through Net Saaver (I spent an extra $2 a day for a more comfortable compact).
So there I was, leaving Nashville International Airport on a Saturday morning in a Nissan Sentra -- not the Ford Escort I had been promised, but all I really cared about was that it had a decent radio.
I discovered two things right away: It's not as easy as you might think to find country music on the radio in Nashville, and it's even harder to find your way around. A good map ($4.95 at a newsstand) was essential.
I still got lost on my way to the Pancake Pantry, a Nashville institution. Even as the rest of the country has decided it has no time to eat in the morning, the South still venerates breakfast, especially in Nashville. This airy farmhouse-style restaurant on a block of low-slung stores and offices in the West End, near Vanderbilt University, offers 20 types of pancakes. My meal, deliciously coarse, granular cornmeal pancakes and rich country ham ($7.25), was the perfect welcome to Nashville, right down to the waitresses who called me "Hon" and replenished my iced tea unbidden.
Fueled up, I tried to get my bearings. My motel, a Shoney's Inn, was in the Music Row section, a center of the recording studios and industry offices. By simply stepping out of my functional but characterless room I could hear the quavering strains of a country ballad. A man in a nearby parking lot was belting out the song for tips, backed by a taped musical accompaniment in a kind of country karaoke. A little trolley plied Demonbreun Street, shuttling tourists between the nearby Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum and the sights downtown. Across the street were gift shops and quasi-museums advertising their prize possessions: "Barbara Mandrell's gown," "Hank Williams Jr.'s Cadillac," "George Jones's gold record." Each seemed to sell more local delicacies -- Goo-Goo Clusters and Moon Pies -- than musical trinkets.
I headed in another direction, to visit the Carl Van Vechten Gallery of Fine Arts at Fisk University, which houses a collection of paintings and sculptures once owned by Alfred Stieglitz. The collection was donated by his widow, Georgia O'Keeffe, in 1949 and includes works by Cezanne, Renoir and Diego Rivera, although I was more interested in less familiar modern artists like Marsden Hartley and John Marin, whose work Stieglitz had shown in his galleries.
My hope was to avoid the big country music tourist attractions -- the Grand Ole Opry, the Ryman Auditorium and the Wildhorse Saloon -- and to figure out where Nashvillians themselves go for music.
After a quick dinner at Rotier's, a dark, clubby West End bar and grill that serves the traditional Nashville "meat and three," meat with a choice of three vegetables ($5.75), I headed for the Station Inn, a nondescript stone building with a plywood floor, where Keith Little and Friends, a bluegrass group, were to play at 9 P.M. The cover charge was only $5, and Budweisers were $2.50, but with only 20 souls in the audience, the energy level was low. I moved on to 12th and Porter, a bar and restaurant that not only seemed to attract all of pierced, tattooed Nashville, but also offered valet parking.
It was packed, and waitresses in leather skirts and studded collars were squeezing through the crowd to serve dishes with names like Low Death Factor Fettuccine, the Nashville equivalent of spa cuisine. But the nightclub adjacent to the restaurant, done entirely in pink and black, was almost empty.
The band, Pat Gallagher and the Atomic Playboys, began a set of mellow love songs, the gentle lyrics settling like dew drops over the empty seats. A few more people trickled in, and as the band wound up its set, I left, having spent $3.50 for a Bass ale and $1 as tip for parking.
Could it be that all of Nashville had been invited to a party, and I hadn't gotten my invitation?
I found the party at my next stop, Exit-In, a club near Vanderbilt that specializes, I learned later, in the sort of alternative rock that appeals to a college audience. Exit-In was packed and pulsing, with a throng of young people who had paid $7 to hear Man or Astroman?, a psycho-surf thrash band, complete with props like cheesy Van de Graaff generators and big-screen televisions that flash footage from old science fiction movies. It was entertaining, but not what I was looking for. Besides, it was late, and I was hungry again. I headed out for Prince's Hot Chicken.
A friend had told me not to miss Prince's, but only chuckled when I asked him to describe it. Four or five other groups were waiting inside the largely takeout operation in a rundown storefront in northern Nashville. As chicken fried in huge, black frying pans, I read some warnings posted on the wall: Don't eat and drive at the same time. Don't touch the chicken and then touch your eyes, you could burn yourself. I ordered my chicken mild, with lemonade ($4.25), and took it back to my motel.
As I ate, the heat began with a tingling in the lips and tongue that rose into the sinuses and traveled down the throat. The plump, juicy chicken breast was undeniably a culinary treat, but perhaps not the best bedtime snack.
Particularly because I had to get up early on Sunday for breakfast. For years I had heard praise for the Loveless Motel and Cafe, most recently in "Eat Your Way Across the U.S.A." by Jane and Michael Stern. Now I was taking the 20-minute drive from Music Row to the Loveless in southwest Nashville.
Much of central Tennessee seems to congregate at the Loveless on Sunday mornings. Those without reservations are kept waiting in a little anteroom, or they may choose a buffet breakfast in an adjoining building. Those with reservations (like me) are seated right away in the homey dining room, where dishes of preserves, chunky peach and tart blackberry, sit on red-and-white checkered tablecloths.
I ordered country ham and eggs with red-eye gravy ($8.95) and a side order of grits ($1). Red-eye is a Southern specialty invented to go with grits and eggs: The salty, musky drippings from country ham are blended with a little coffee and cooked down. The eggs came with a platter of a dozen fluffy biscuits, which I tried with the jams, dipped in gravy and as a sandwich with the country ham, which had the proper leathery texture. The waitress clucked sympathetically when I told her I couldn't finish the last two. "Would you like me to pack 'em up for you?" she asked. I declined.
Later that morning I visited the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum. I almost missed the building, which was dwarfed by the B.M.I. building next door. The fascinating little museum ($10.75 admission) traces the history of country music from the Grand Ole Opry to the present, with an emphasis on the most commercially successful, of course. Among the tidbits I learned were that the early country players had been persuaded to trade in their formal attire for hillbilly costumes by George D. Hay, the founder of the Opry, who believed it would make them more accessible to their audience; that one of the early Opry stars was DeFord Bailey, a black harmonica player (the Opry also featured musicians in blackface); that Johnny Cash's hit "A Boy Named Sue" was written by Shel Silverstein; that when it came to outlandish customizing, Elvis Presley's gold Cadillac, with record player and cocktail cabinet, had nothing on Webb Pierce's 1962 Pontiac Bonneville, with its tooled leather upholstery, six-gun trim and silver-dollar decor.
I spent more than three hours at the museum, and could easily have dawdled longer, watching historic film clips of Roy Acuff and early Opry stars like Uncle Dave Macon. But I was eager to check into my room at the Union Station Hotel, which had been built in a beautifully refurbished Romanesque Gothic train station. I justified the $109 tab on two grounds. First, I was getting a good Sunday night deal; my room usually went for $175. Second, everything else had been a bargain in Nashville, so I had earned a treat.
The room seemed unadorned but not plain, with a king-size bed, comfortable armchairs and A-shaped struts that gave an unusual archlike feel to the room. A big picture window offered a view of a rail yard and a highway, and I could see that a rainstorm had begun. Tonight, I decided, I would look for music in the heart of Nash Vegas.
Maybe because of the rain, or maybe because it was Sunday, downtown Nashville seemed barren. Like a carnival barker, a woman in front of the empty Planet Hollywood tried to coax me in. But I was heading for the dives of old Nashville, like Robert's Western World, a venerable Western-wear shop turned nightclub that achieved local fame a few years back as home base to BR5-49, a retro country band that's gone on to recording-contract glory.
Onstage, the Lonnie Waters Band was playing to a dozen or so people, energetically picking its way through Hank Williams, Hank Snow and Elvis Presley. If the music wasn't original, it was played with verve and charm. As in all the older places along Broadway, the band played for tips, the people listened for the price of a beer.
At Tootsie's Orchid Lounge, which for decades served as the backstage bar for the Grand Ole Opry, Scott Wayne and the Boys were taking requests to the delight of the small crowd in an improbably bright, rundown room. I felt satisfied, as if I had finally found the music I was looking for. As the band finished its set, I left to get something to eat.
Easier said than done. After 9 on Sunday night, Nashville closes down. I stumbled on to Red, Hot and Blue, a shiny Memphis-style barbecue restaurant in the West End. There was one other person there, sitting at the bar. I sat down alongside.
"This is the only place I could find that was still open," I said.
"Viva Nash Vegas!" he replied.

Getting There
I spent an average of about $140 a day in Nashville, not including transportation. My round-trip ticket between New York and Nashville was $135, with tax, through American Airlines' Net Saaver, a free weekly E-mail list of discount fares.

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
Public Housing Tenants Trade Rents for Mortgages

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
IRA P. JACKSON, a 54-year-old clerk and mother of five grown children, will be writing her last rent check to the Jersey City Public Housing Authority this month. In August, Ms. Jackson will be closing on the two-family home she purchased with her daughter and son-in-law from the authority.
It is the same four-bedroom house she and her family have lived in for the last two years at the Dwight Street Homes, 50 two-family houses on scattered sites over three blocks in the city's Greenville section. Ms. Jackson will be the first resident to go from renter to owner, under a program sponsored by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development that enabled the authority to sell the homes to tenants who live there. 
 "This program gave me the opportunity to own a home," said Ms. Jackson, who has lived in public housing for 27 years. "Without it, I don't think I would have taken the chance."
Maria T. Maio, deputy executive director of the Jersey City Housing Authority, said the goal is that by 2000, all 50 of the two-family homes will be purchased by tenants. She said 15 more tenants are enrolled in the program.
The authority built the 100 apartments in the 50 town-house-style two-family houses, and has 400 more units in two- and three-family homes under way or planned. Forty of the homes will also be sold to tenants. All of the houses are part of the authority's plan to replace the apartments in six of the seven high-rise towers that it has razed or will raze at Curries Woods, a 712-unit public housing complex.
The high-rise complex, like others in New Jersey and elsewhere in the country, had become a symbol of a failed housing concept. Such projects were developed in the 1950's as an economical form of housing, but many of them -- beset by crime, neglect and mismangement -- became the dumping ground for the poorest of families. The Federal Government no longer supports the building of high-density housing towers.
Their replacements, like the Dwight Street Homes, are low-rise structures, which are considered more humane places for low-income families. High-rise buildings that can be are being renovated.
Housing officials in Washington are now accelerating efforts to encourage the sale of public housing, thinking that home ownership allows low-income tenants to take more control of their lives. It also supports the Clinton Administration's strategy to increase home ownership across the nation. Since 1993, HUD has approved the sale of 4,700 public housing units and plans to sell 25,000 more by 2000.
"This is a wise investment that strengthens families and helps more hard-working Americans enter the middle class," Andrew Cuomo, HUD Secretary, wrote in a statement. His department has several programs through which local housing authorities can help turn tenants into homeowners.
SUCH efforts are happening throughout New Jersey, which has 53,000 public housing units, said the Newark office of HUD. Newark is putting up 1,777 town houses to replace apartments in 12 of its high-rises as part of a 1989 settlement of a Federal lawsuit by a coalition of tenants and housing groups.
So far, 753 of the town houses have been built and occupied, and 196 more are in various stages of development, said Harry Robinson, a spokesman for the Newark Housing Authority. He said the authority was in the early stages of working with some tenants to buy their units.
The authority, using a $50 million grant from HUD, is also planning 630 more town houses, replacing apartments in high-rises that will be razed. As part of that effort, the New Community Corporation in Newark, among the state's largest nonprofit housing groups, will use a $25 million Federal grant to build 206 town houses that public housing tenants will be able to buy or rent with an option to buy. Work on the first 103 units is to start this fall. "This is another step in what we can do," said Msgr. William J. Linder, founder of New Community.
Paterson also received Federal money to raze two 10-story buildings with a total of 160 public housing units by the fall of 1998. Residents will receive Section 8 rent vouchers to move into private homes. Those vouchers, under pending Federal legislation, could be used to make mortgage payments, enabling tenants to buy homes, said Felix Raymond, executive director of the Paterson Housing Authority. He said the authority was also applying for Federal money to tear down another public housing complex, with 498 units. The plan, said Mr. Raymond, is to replace those apartments with an undetermined number of rental units and one- and two-family houses that will be sold to former tenants.
The idea of selling public housing to tenants has been tried before on a limited basis. In 1985, Brooks-Sloate Terrace, a 242-unit low-rise complex in Paterson, was one of 18 public housing authority projects in the country selected by HUD to take part in a demonstration to sell units to tenants. It was made a co-op, and in 1992 the Paterson Housing Authority turned over the complex to tenants. Today, 202 apartments at Brooks-Sloate have been sold.
In Jersey City, public housing residents at the Dwight Street Homes now have the chance to buy their units. The 50 vinyl-sided houses, with wrought iron fences and window shutters, look no different from other homes in the neighborhood. Each family has a separate front entrance to its three- or four-bedroom unit, with 1,100 to 1,200 square feet of space, and each unit has a small yard in front and back. Two-family homes "provide home ownership opportunities for low-income working families and retain rentals for those with lower incomes," said Ms. Maio of the housing authority.
The development was completed in 1995, and in the next two years the authority devised a plan, approved by HUD last month, to sell the units to eligible tenants. Twenty-five of the families earn no more than 80 percent of the median income in Jersey City, which translates into $35,000 for a family of four. The rest earn 50 percent or less of the median income, which is $24,000. Potential buyers must also complete a counseling program, covering such issues as money management and responsibilities of homeownership. Job training is also available. "It is a different approach that has the potential to be duplicated," said Diane Johnson, HUD's New Jersey coordinator.
The homes, priced at $140,000, will be sold first to the higher-income families "who have the financial wherewithal to buy and have a good shot at success," Ms. Maio said. Thirty-year mortgages at below market rate and zero percent down will be made available to eligible buyers through the New Jersey Housing Mortgage Finance Agency for $70,000. The Jersey City Housing Authority will provide a second no-interest loan for the remaining $70,000.
To receive the financing, buyers must agree to continue to rent the second apartment to public housing tenants, who if eligible will receive Federal Section 8 rent subsidies. That will make up the difference between what tenants now pay, which averages $225 a month, and market rents, averaging $800. Ms. Maio said the rental income is counted as part of buyers' income and will help them meet mortgage payments.
Buyers also must agree to live in the home for 10 years, and each year they do so the mortgage from the authority is reduced by 10 percent. If they leave before that time, there is a ceiling on the sale price that limits profit from appreciation.
Of buying one of the Dwight Street Homes, Ira Jackson said: "This is the begining of a new life for us. Something we can build upon for the future."

HEADLINE: Watershed Pact Brings Disputes And Lawsuits

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
THE ink had hardly dried on the landmark agreement to protect watershed areas north of New York City before the euphoria accompanying its signing began to wear thin.
When the land-use deal among diverse groups was completed earlier this year, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York predicted that it would serve as a national model of cooperation. 
 But by late last month, it was clear that some differences could not be swept under the rug.
On June 24, a State Supreme Court judge ruled that landowners have a right to file damage claims for lost property values resulting from regulations embodied in the agreement.
And controversy over whether to build a filtration plant for the imperiled Croton Reservoir has gathered steam, producing some unexpected bedfellows in the process and also generating a lawsuit on that issue.
Meanwhile, the construction industry, which is still reeling from a downturn several years ago, is bracing for yet more lean times because the watershed regulations limit where and how new building can occur. But the industry is also gearing up to fight back.
There is growing resentment among elected officials and the populace that the needs of Westchester and Putnam Counties were "shamefully neglected" in the deal, according to the Croton Watershed Clean Water Coalition, which represents several chapters of the Sierra Club, Friends of the Clearwater and other groups. "I don't think all is peaceful on the home front with this agreement," said Harold E. Vogt, president and chief executive officer of the Westchester Chamber of Commerce and president of the Alliance for Watershed and Water Quality Programs. "It may be a real disaster as it moves forward."
From the perspective of aggrieved property owners, a municipality should not be able to make decisions for the people it does not represent without having to compensate them, said Frederick J. Martin, a White Plains lawyer representing more than 80 plaintiffs in Westchester and Putnam Counties.
"It's like the old Revolutionary War cry," said Mr. Martin, a senior partner with Bleakley Platt & Schmidt: "No taxation without representation!"
The agreement was signed on Jan. 21 by the city, the watershed communities, the counties involved, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, the State Health Department, the state's Department of Environmental Conservation, the state's Department of State and some environmental groups. They agreed to a complex program to protect reservoirs feeding into the city.
Under the agreement, New York City said it would buy thousands of acres of land to shield its 19 upstate reservoirs from pollution, improve sewage treatment and subsidize so-called environmentally sound economic development.
The city also announced strict land-use regulations designed to protect the watershed area from further degradation.
But in a 55-page decision, Judge S. Barrett Hickman of the State Supreme Court in Carmel denied New York City's motion to dismiss the complaints of landowners affected by the regulations. The plaintiffs, many of whom are developers, are seeking financial compensation for lost property values, which they say result from the city's restrictions on new construction in the watershed.
"They have a lot to lose," Mr. Martin said of his clients. "The economic crux of the matter is that this land is extremely valuable from a development point of view."
The lawyer explained that while the city has the right to regulate use of the land, it also has the responsibility to compensate landowners.
Not everyone agrees with that line of reasoning. "If regulations preserve the quality of life, then property owners should be happy,"said David K. Gordon, a lawyer for the Hudson Riverkeeper Fund. "For most of us, this is a welcome plus."
And while few environmentalists would say that developing land is necessarily bad, their guiding principle is that such development should not degrade an area's natural resources.
"In other words, it's O.K. if you want to build a shopping center, just get out of the watershed," said William C. Harding, Town Supervisor for Somers. He was on the negotiating team that forged the watershed regulations, representing a mostly rural northern Westchester area known for its rolling hills, streams and meadows. The watershed area in Westchester includes the Muscoot, the Croton, the Amawalk, the Titicus and the Cross River Reservoirs.
Development interests, while not proposing chemical storage sites, are interested in shopping centers and housing developments, and they say that that kind of building can be done without harming underground water sources.
George Frank, the executive vice president of the Building and Realty Institute in White Plains, which represents 1,600 members in the real estate, home building, development and banking industries, said the regulations were harmful to healthy economic interests.
Explaining that the construction industry is slowly emerging from a recession that took place from 1992 to 1994, he said, "There's no need for these Draconian measures."
Edward R. Heelan, a realtor in Brewster and president of the Brewster Manor Development Corporation, which is a plaintiff in the property owners' suit, said both large developers and small land investors would lose their shirts because of the strict regulations.
"The politicians and the bureaucrats think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread, but many taxpayers and property owners are economically devastated," he said.
Another focus of controversy is whether to build a filtration plant for the Croton Watershed area east of the Hudson River. While the regulations are designed to avoid the need for a filtration plant for the Catskill and Delaware watershed systems west of the river, New York City is under orders from the Federal Environmental Protection Agency to build one for the Croton area.
Interests in favor of development say that New York City is one of the only cities in the world without such a filtration system. And since June 1993, the city has been in violation of the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act for failing to filter the Croton water.
In April, the Federal Government sued New York City in United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn for failing to build the $600 million filtration plant for the reservoirs east of the Hudson River, which supply about 10 percent of the city's water. The project has been in planning for 20 years but has been delayed by its high cost and disputes over where it will be built.
While environmentalists have often been at odds with the New York City Department of Environmental Protection over its policies and procedures, one group wants to align itself with the city in fighting the Federal lawsuit. The Croton Watershed Clean Water Coalition -- which represents groups from New York City, the Bronx, Westchester and Putnam Counties -- is seeking to join New York City in the suit.
Paul Moskowitz, president of the Huntersville Association, a neighborhood group in Yorktown, and a member of Friends of the Croton Watershed, said the coalition was opposed to filtration and supported tougher measures to keep the water pure.
"You have to prevent the problem to begin with, not try to deal with it after the fact," Mr. Moskowitz said.
He said the filtration issue was symptomatic of what he called a larger problem: that the Croton Watershed area was slighted in the agreement. "The heart of the problem is that we got neglected," Mr. Moskowitz said, explaining that New York City allocated $250 million to buy property in the Catskills but only $17.5 million for that purpose east of the Hudson.
Mr. Moskowitz and others have complained about that part of the agreement, calling it a token land-acquisition program, because in Westchester property values are so high that $17.5 million will not go very far.
There is also the worry that New York City will drag its feet in acquiring property and that its cumbersome bureaucracy is not up to the tasks outlined in the deal.
"There's a healthy distrust out there for the City of New York,"said Jeremiah R. Dineen, chairman of the Planning Board in Yorktown. "The city has been known to drag its feet. Its history has not been great."
Charles Sturcken, a spokesman for the city's Department of Environmental Protection, said New York was aware of its poor image and would seek to set matters straight. He said the department had hired more than 200 extra workers to implement the accord.
John R. Nolon, a professor of law at Pace University specializing in property and land-use issues, said it is difficult to predict how the watershed agreement would unfold.
"The issues here are huge -- the safety of drinking water, the ability of communities to develop their land and the rights of individual property owners to use their land," he said. "I think most people are taking a wait-and-see attitude on this."

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
The Domestic Airlines Fares Consumer Report, a new report from the Transportation Department calculates the average air fare between 1,000 pairs of cities in the continental United States and for each route identifies the average fare on both the dominant and least expensive airlines. For ticket buyers, the information is not as useful or reliable as what would result from a call to a competent travel agent, but it does provide a good overview.
For example, the survey showed that the average one-way fare from New York to Cincinnati was $244, with Delta, the biggest carrier, charging $274, and Continental, the least expensive, charging $199. But as the report notes, "airlines tend to offer a wide variety of prices in any given market and it is unlikely that the average fares from this report will be the same as any particular fare offered." 
 The report also gives the average cost of flying from various cities. Flying out of New York costs 16.7 cents a mile; it is 30.5 cents out of Charlotte, 27.0 cents out of Buffalo, 11.7 cents out of Phoenix and 9.3 cents out of Las Vegas. The difference is competition.
The department picked the city-pairs with the largest percentage price changes between the third quarter of 1996 and the same quarter in 1995. The biggest increases were Kansas City-Minneapolis (up 172.9 percent) and Boston-Philadelphia (up 90.8 percent). The biggest drops were Birmingham-Tampa and Fort Lauderdale-Tampa, both down 62 percent.
The department issued its first report on June 11, covering the third quarter of 1996, and said it would issue a report every three months. The cities covered account for about 70 percent of domestic air traffic.
The report is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.dot.gov/ost/aviation/ or from the Department of Transportation, Office of Aviation and International Economics, X-10, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590. MATTHEW L. WALD

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/After a Clean-Up, a $400 Million Paper Mill;
A New Life for a Polluted Old Bronx Rail Yard

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
THE 96-acre site at the southernmost tip of the Bronx, once a busy railroad yard, has sat unused for 25 years, its future clouded by the asbestos, hydrocarbons and lead left from its industrial past. Now, with an unusual alliance of developers working to revive the site, the asbestos and much of the heavily contaminated soil have been removed, and what remains will be paved over with clean material to seal up the remnants of pollution.
As a result of the clean-up, the site, which is owned by the state and leased to a private developer, is well on its way to redevelopment as a rail yard again as well as the site for a mill that will turn paper trash into clean newsprint. 
 But it has taken seven years to get to this point, most of it consumed dealing with administrative and legal issues. It is an indication of the difficulties inherent in re-using old industrial land with environmental contamination, usually called brownfields.
The Bronx rail yard is one of tens of thousands of such sites in cities across the nation that have sat idle as developers have flocked to pristine, former farmlands known as greenfields in the increasingly sprawling suburbs to build offices, warehouses and industrial parks.
Fear of the unknown is one of the great inhibitors to brownfield development. Who knew what had been dumped on the land during the 100 years the Harlem River Yard was operated by railroads? The operator, the Galesi Group, tested carefully and got lucky. The actual environmental problems were pretty straightforward and without any unexpected surprises, said Joseph Fiteni, a principal engineer with TAMS Consultants, which worked on the project. To start with, there was asbestos in the old railroad sheds, which had to be removed before the buildings could be demolished.
"There were six underground storage tanks which had held diesel fuel," he said. Surprisingly, none had leaked, but sloppy fuel-handling practices over the years had left the soil contaminated with a family of chemicals known as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, or PAH's.
Coal ash from the days when most structures were heated by coal had been used as fill on the site, and that, too, contained PAH's. And there were particles of lead from the days when leaded fuel exhaust spewed from the tailpipes of the cars on the Triborough Bridge, which bisects the site.
"This type of contamination is very common on old industrial sites," said Mr. Fiteni. "It could have been a lot worse if the railroads had done a lot of maintenance."
The solution was to remove the tanks and the contaminated nearby soil for disposal elsewhere. The remaining PAH-contaminated particles and lead will be kept from becoming airborne by being covered by parking lots and buildings or by two feet of clear fill in open areas. "This gets rid of the exposure pathway," Mr. Fiteni said.
THE proposed recycling facility, known as the NYC Paper Mill, is a $440 million project that is to take waste paper from the city's trash, remove the ink and form the cleaned fibers into rolls of newsprint.
The deal to build the mill is not complete, but the project has received political and financial support from the city and state, and dozens of engineers are currently at work specifying the details of the project. The exterior is being designed by Maya Lin, who is best known for her work on the Vietnam Memorial in Washington.
The mill is unusual because it would be in the middle of a city, rather than near forests where most paper mills are found. It is even more unusual because its principal developer is the Natural Resources Defense Council, a prominent environmental group.
Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist with the group, said the mill represented a change in environmental thinking. "We have spent years stopping projects and we are still not saving the forests," he said. "So we decided to do something more proactive to improve the way we use resources. And we also think if you can find a project that does something positive and produces a good financial return, industry will jump all over it."
"We intend to break ground before the end of the year and prove that major manufacturing is returning to New York City," said John A. Cavanagh, executive vice president of Morse Diesel International, the construction manager for the mill project.
Not only will the mill reduce the amount of trash the city must haul to a landfill, but it will also use 3 million gallons of water a day from the Wards Island sewage treatment plant, rather than scarce fresh water. The water will be cleaned, used, cleaned again and returned to Wards Island to help with the clean-up of Long Island Sound, which gets treated discharge from Wards Island.
Returning the land to productive use will provide economic benefits to the locality, people involved in the project say. "This site was vacant since 1972 and it was a blight on the poorest community in New York," said Anthony M. Riccio Jr., senior vice president of the Galesi Group, which has a 99-year lease on the site. "Now we are going to have a rail yard and a paper mill and we are going to provide jobs for the community."
The paper mill is expected to offer 600 full-time jobs, ranging from unskilled paper sorters to management engineers, as well as 2,200 construction jobs during the 24 months it will take to build the plant. Other jobs are expected to be available at the warehouses and solid-waste transfer station on the site as well as the rail yard. "I have a truck driver training program under way now," Mr. Riccio said.
T HE point was underscored by Michael C. Finnegan, counsel to Gov. George E. Pataki, who backs the paper-mill project. "One of the lessons learned is that brownfield development creates jobs where they are most needed," he said. "Another is that economic development and environmental protection are not incompatible."
Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, was more cautious. Although the project "has a lot of merit from the environmental, economic development and waste disposal perspective," he said, "there are still some hurdles to overcome." Among them is the need to negotiate a contract for the city to supply waste paper.
As with many brownfields, the progress so far at the Bronx site was more a result of determination by the developer than any exotic environmental technology. Galesi, which operates 8 million square feet of warehouse space in the Albany area, signed its lease in 1990, but is only now getting close to the point where building can commence.
Part of the delay was caused by a lawsuit brought by a local group that contended that any use of the land other than as a rail yard would illegally increase air pollution in the area. The group won in a lower court, but was unanimously overturned on appeal.
"New York is unique," said Mr. Riccio, who was the city's Commissioner of Ports, International Trade and Commerce in the late 1980's. "Name any issue, and I'll get 1,000 people to protest against it. There was so much misinformation. Because we had a certain type of permit, there was a rumor we were going to build an incinerator."
Recent improvements to the rail lines in the Bronx means that for the first time piggy-back freight cars, which carry complete truck trailers, can come directly into the city. As a result, about a third of the Harlem River site will be used as a rail yard. Trains will come into the yard, large forklift trucks will lift the trailers off and deposit them in a parking lot where they can meet up with a tractor for local delivery.
Mr. Riccio said the economics of putting 100 trailers on a single train versus 100 individual trucks being driven across the country should result in a sharp increase in rail freight arriving in the city. But that could create another problem. The city is a big importer of goods, but since it lost most of its manufacturing industry, it has little in the way of goods to export and railroads do not like to haul empty cars.
The solution is garbage. With the city committed to closing Staten Island's Fresh Kills landfill in the near future, there will be no local disposal place. So USA Waste, Inc. is building a transfer station to pack solid waste into containers for shipment by rail to distant landfills.

HEADLINE: At Hospitals, Construction Is Regaining Its Health

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
RESPONDING to sweeping changes in the country's health-care delivery systems, hospitals in New York City and the surrounding region are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on construction projects designed to make health services more efficient for accountants and more attractive for patients.
Whether transforming a seedy parking garage on West 135th Street in Manhattan into a two-story outpatient clinic with 13 doctors or moving an entire hospital away from its urban setting in Meriden, Conn., to a vast new suburban campus across from a shopping mall, the region's hospitals are building again, according to architects and hospital administrators. 
 In the midst of a spate of mergers and affiliations largely dictated by the country's move toward managed care, the hospitals are, at the same time, stepping up their efforts to attract new patients in a race to gain market share. Increasingly, they are asking architects and planners to make the old hospitals function better -- and, in rare cases, to tear them down and rebuild.
In their new push to combine attractive design and convenience, the hospital buildings are changing. In suburban locations, parking is being made more convenient -- winding one's way through needle-thin corridors to the front entrance is considered a thing of the past. In some, main entrances are being moved to the back, right off the parking area.
In many hospitals, pre-admission testing is being moved closer to the entrance lobby for easy access. Admissions offices are being dismantled, with an emphasis on in-room check-in and "concierge" services. Maternity wards are moving to separate "women's wings" or "well-patient wings." Dormitory-style, multibedded rooms are out: Tomorrow's patients will almost exclusively be given private rooms.
In the new $780 million addition to New York Hospital/Cornell Medical Center, Fritz Reuter, New York Hospital's senior vice president for facilities/real estate, boasted of private rooms with the best views in the city and gestured Toward one room with floor-to-ceiling windows seemingly perched above the sun-dappled waters of the East River.
Another hospital executive makes the case for reconfiguration more bluntly.
"We didn't want our pregnant women -- who are, after all, perfectly healthy people -- bumping into some guy on a gurney looking like death warmed over," said Theodore Horwitz, president and chief executive officer of Veterans Memorial Medical Center in Meriden, Conn. Along with the rebuilding of hospitals, many of the millions of dollars will be spent by hospitals wishing, as more than one administrator explained, to cover their bets by attracting new, healthy enrollees in previously underserved neighborhoods to newly built centers that, like the one Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center is opening on West 135th Street, will be staffed by hospital doctors. The center is Columbia-Presbyterian's "first venture outside its traditional service neighborhood," an executive said.
There are many examples of buildings that are rising, among them the $107 million replacement-hospital project at Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut, where the existing main building, designed by Skidmore Owings and Merrill in 1951, will be demolished and a new, three-story traditional brick structure with a mansard roof is rising. On a smaller scale, Maimonides Hospital is building a $2.5 million medical center inside a former Beefsteak Charlie's pub a few blocks from the Lundy's seafood restaurant in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn.
Last year, an estimated $700 million in hospital construction was approved in New York State alone, according to Kristine A. Smith, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Health.
And there are even more projects in the planning stages.
In White Plains, New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center has just begun meeting with community boards and lining up approvals for a planned redevelopment of its existing psychiatric center on an elaborate and verdant 230-acre campus. When completed, what the hospital will call a Medical Village will include assisted living apartments, a treatment center for Alzheimer's disease and special care facilities for children -- along with posh retail shops.
"We're working to develop new retail space," Mr. Reuter said. "Like more and more hospitals, we're using our real estate assets as a source for maintaining the mission. To convert to new programs we need capital; without it, the places would die."
Faced with dramatic reductions in inpatient care -- reductions both in numbers of patients and lengths of stay -- the hospitals are retooling their architecture, both inside and out, to the patient of today: the outpatient, or the new breed of occupant: the "23-hour patient," who stays less than 24 hours, and because he or she is never formally admitted is not charged the hospital's rate for bed and board.
As one hospital administrator after another explained, the objective of hospital management has flip-flopped in the age of managed care.
"In the old system, if the hospital administrator walked around and saw all the beds were full, he was happy," said Cesar A. Perales, a former deputy mayor under David N. Dinkins who was hired by Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital three and a half years ago to develop its network of community sites. "Now, if he sees those same beds empty, he's ecstatic. Under the new system, he's getting paid per person -- it's called 'capitation' -- and the goal is not to use his resources, because they cost money."
IN the world of managed care, the goal is to sign up as many "heads" or "covered lives" as possible, and to treat them as cheaply -- and, as hospital executives stress, as well -- as possible. Just how to do that is something the hospitals are still trying to discover.
"There's a lot of uncertainty now," said Richard Sprow, the manager of health-care services at HLW, a large Manhattan-based architectural and engineering company. "It's a game of musical chairs -- will there still be 10 chairs left to sit in when the music stops? So hospitals try to be smarter to survive in the marketplace."
To entice "lives" to sign up, hospital administrators and architects who specialize in hospital renovation say appearances and convenience count.
"It sounds cynical, but one of the ways people will judge the quality of care is by a hospital's appearance," said Don Blair, the general manager of the New York office of Perkins & Will, a Chicago-based architectural company with the country's fifth largest health-care practice.
Mr. Blair, whose 80-person Manhattan office is currently working on 2.5 million square feet of renovated or new medical space around the region -- $314 million of health-care projects in the tristate area alone -- sees a new wave of capital improvements now being planned and started.
"After a hiatus of five or so years, the institutions are regrouping and beginning major capital projects," he said, following a time when money grew scarce -- and when available was used to finance information systems and "buying up doctors' groups and other hospitals; capital had been diverted away from major construction."
Hospitals in New York and the Northeast, he said, had generally lagged behind the rest of the country in following the recent health-care trends -- an opinion shared by many hospital executives interviewed. Mr. Blair singled out hospitals in California and the Southeast as being "far in front."
IN Meriden, Conn., a blue-collar community sandwiched between New Haven and Hartford, Veterans Memorial Medical Center is abandoning its inner-city buildings and will move one mile to a spot across from the Route 691 off ramp.
Mr. Horwitz, the hospital's president, explained that after considerable controversy among the city's residents, the hospital decided not to try to reconfigure its aging facility, where the 1920's main building sits across from a row of boarded-up single and two-family clapboard houses awaiting the wrecker's ball.
In contrast, the new hospital, designed by Perkins & Will, will be a sleek, low-slung trio of two-story pavilions -- with patients in beds on the second floors -- connected by a jazzy main floor galleria. At one end, a women's wing will have its own entrance; at the other end will be a helipad and emergency room. Running across one side is an attached wing of doctors' and administrative offices.
The attached offices -- which cost less to build than the main hospital largely because of different building codes -- are a new concept. In the past, patients might have been reluctant to get so close to a hospital for routine matters, feeling more secure visiting a doctor on the ground floor of an apartment house or on the first floor of a Victorian house on a side street near the hospital.
But in the managed-care environment, hospitals want to share in the new emphasis toward preventive care, by employing the primary-care and specialist doctors themselves and having them work in space the hospitals own or lease, or by renting them space.
In interviews, architects and administrators stressed that the hospitals of tomorrow -- even the reconfigured ones -- will not look like the hospitals of yesterday; they will have gallerias and shopping malls and food courts and exciting artwork. And they won't even be hospitals. They will be medical centers and medical villages. They will be streamlined, and they will be economical.
The cost to reconfigure the 330,000 square feet in assorted wings and additions of the old Meriden hospital, according to its president, would have come to somewhere between $50 million and $60 million -- spread out over the six to seven years it would have taken to phase in the renovations while keeping the hospital operating. "The debt service over six years was a fortune," said Mr. Horwitz. "That really put it over the top -- plus you don't know what you're going to find when you start tearing down walls."
The new 236,900-square-foot hospital, with a landscaped "Town Green" in front, three pavilions and 92 beds, will cost $74 million; financing costs, designers' and consultants' fees and new state-of-the-art equipment makes up $27 million of the total. Construction began last fall and will take about two years to complete.
Mr. Horwitz's comments echoed those of architects who say reconfiguring an existing hospital -- the only solution for many hospitals, especially in urban areas -- presents one of the hardest design tasks of all: to move patients and partitions around while the hospital is still up and running takes years, and millions of dollars.
Yet that is what a host of regional hospitals are doing, among them Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn and St. Vincent's Medical Center in West Brighton, Staten Island. "These two hospitals have very carefully targeted relatively small capital improvements, in their ambulatory (outpatient) care, in improving access and visibility," said Mr. Sprow of HLW. "Like all hospitals in the city, they no longer need as many beds. The question is what do you do with this space and make the best use of the investment."
The hospitals decided, Mr. Sprow explained, to accent what they did best: St. Vincent's decided to emphasize obstetrics -- "They were already a strong player and they decided to get even better," he said. So St. Vincent's added more nursery space as well as more pre- and postpartum facilities.
Lutheran Medical Center already specialized in obstetrics, the architect continued, but it decided to add 26 psychiatric beds; the reshuffle necessitated relocating the hospital's dialysis and AIDS units within the building. "It's a complicated domino effect to change over," Mr. Sprow said.
Maimonides Medical Center also focused on relatively small changes in its effort to gain -- or merely to keep -- the elusive market share. "We're not capital rich or heavily endowed," said Stanley Brezenoff, the president and chief executive officer of Maimonides. "Nor have we accumulated large amounts of cash. So, in looking at our needs, one thing we can't do, nor would it be advisable to do, given the changing health care picture, is to invest large amounts of money in new towers.
"We're looking to redevelop, to rework existing interior areas of our hospital as we reduce the length of stay and free up space," he continued, adding that this year, the hospital will spend between $12 million and $18 million on renovations and rehabilitation -- and on the equipment to fill the space.
The first thing Mr. Brezenoff mentioned was Maimonides's efforts to "upgrade patient amenities," including creating lounges for patients and their families. Then, he said, the hospital was "enhancing cardiac catheterization; that's one of our premier services, as well as improving radiology services." He said the hospital had just opened a newly designed emergency room -- a project that had received state and Federal backing.
Following the trend, Maimonides has also begun to open "a large number of outpatient facilities," he said. "we've opened a half dozen in the recent past, and there are several more scheduled." The new centers, he said, range from a Brooklyn Women's Center in Bay Ridge to a program for the Chinese-American community in Sunset Park, a few blocks from the main hospital.
The look and structure for these out-patient centers varies, largely depending on location.
In one of the new satellite centers Columbia-Presbyterian is planning, expanding a medical practice inside the Fort Washington Houses -- public housing for the elderly -- the hospital is boosting the number of examination rooms from four to eight, knocking down walls, changing the entry staircase to a ramp, and using gentle yet contrasting colors as directional markers -- all for a cost of $500,000.
At Columbia-Presbyterian's new 15,000-square-foot center in the parking garage on West 135th Street near Broadway -- a $4.5 million project that has not yet been officially announced -- Mr. Perales said, the design is to be different from that of the hospital's other, smaller neighborhood clinics.
He compared the preliminary design -- with a dramatic staircase to replace the parking ramp, skylights and Caribbean colors everywhere -- with another older center uptown. "This is boring," he said, walking around the older clinic, painted in beige and gray. "This is drab."
AT New York Hospital, no one could say the $780 million, 11-story limestone and brick Maurice R. and Corinne P. Greenberg Pavilion is drab. It is the last of the mega-projects left over from the 1980's, when money was flowing and deluxe pavilions and wings were going up all over town.
"We're the last of the dinosaurs," Mr. Reuter said jokingly, referring to the glamorous new wing, which added 850,000 square feet to the 1.8 million-square-foot 1932 main hospital, designed to resemble the Palace of the Popes in Avignon. The new pavilion, designed by Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, with Taylor Clark Architects, takes its design cues from the earlier building but is totally contemporary. An 11-story structure built on a platform over the F.D.R. Drive, it has, according to the hospital, "as much floor space as the Chrysler Building."
Following the horizontal trend in hospital design, the 776-bed pavilion will cluster related health problems on one floor, regardless of their levels of severity -- an approach called "disease-cluster." Thus, heart patients will all go to the same floor, whether they are there for intensive care, surgery or recuperation. Seven hundred computers will be installed in the pavilion, with voice-recognition software that will let doctors and nurses dictate reports, creating, according to the hospital, "a virtually paperless and filmless environment."
New York Hospital has also reconfigured its ambulatory care, diagnostic services and offices within the main hospital -- and branched out. "We've gone from a 1,000-bed teaching hospital to 7,000 beds in 20 facilities, one in Westchester, two in Brooklyn, two in Queens," Mr. Reuter said.
Although boutique services like plastic surgery may make up some of the revenue lost by the decrease in inpatients and length of stays, the hospitals need these offshoots and satellites. "We're not going to pay off a $600 million debt with new noses," Mr. Reuter said wryly.
In addition to the enormous debts many of the large urban hospitals amassed in the 1980's, today's medical advances -- which hospital executives stress are also responsible for bringing down the length of hospital stays -- are wildly expensive. "To get a machine that can zap a tumor costs $8 million," Mr. Reuter said. "Some hospitals are going out of business, so we have to be big and strong."
He and other hospital executives listed a spate of major and minor hospitals that are reported to be discussing mergers. The architects keep track, too, and recite the reports; when two hospitals merge, there is usually money spent on a new master plan -- and the construction that grows out of it.
Even without a merger looming, hospitals are commissioning master plans. Mr. Blair of Perkins & Will said his firm was discussing master plans and/or major construction with two large New Jersey hospitals, along with other institutions in the region.
IN Greenwich, the hospital's board of trustees pushed aside one master plan, made in 1992, which called for an addition to house outpatient services as well as a significant renovation of existing space. By the next year, the board decided it needed another master plan and commissioned Perkins & Will, which wrote that: "In examining the future market potential for the hospital under a managed-care model, it was determined that the majority of the existing facilities were unable to accommodate changing technologies and operational strategies."
The new 325,000-square-foot hospital building -- in the traditional style requested by the hospital's board, according to its architect -- will include what the architects call an innovative "universal patient room" for patients at various levels of risk; clusters of private rooms, and a Day Recovery Center, with 20 rooms devoted to short stays. Harold Mindell, the hospital's executive in charge of the project, said that they were just getting ready to finish the steel infrastructure and that the hospital project would be finished in 2000. Mr. Mindell said the new hospital would be licensed for 160 beds, 100 fewer than the old hospital.
At Maimonides, a 705-bed hospital, Mr. Brezenoff worries about the rush to compete that is at least partly the reason for so much construction -- and, he says, so much money spent on advertising. "In the end, the results might not be in the public interest," he said, pausing often to consider his words. "What if something of high quality is in the wrong part of town or for other reasons, it doesn't succeed financially? That kind of free market is not always the result of a rational health-care planning process."
Mr. Brezenoff argued that the hospitals, instead of competing for market share, should instead cooperate. "We're spending money to advertise, Methodist is spending money to advertise, Staten Island is spending money to advertise. We're all scrambling, and there's a wealth of health-care dollars being spent."
Nevertheless, he said, the money spent on reconfiguration, new equipment, new buildings and new community centers -- designed not only to save money but to make the patient's experience a shorter and more pleasant one -- is different.
"The emphasis is on primary care, the breaking out of the hospitals and moving into the community, the emphasis on serving the patient," Mr. Brezenoff said. "Now that does make health-care sense."

HEADLINE: THE GREAT OUTDOORS;
Working Out The Bugs

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

DATELINE: TOMS RIVER

 BODY:
YOU'RE relaxed at last. You're finally home from work; the martini is in your hand, beautiful in its chilled magnificence, and you're looking out over the lawn, your lawn, your empire -- oh, yes, it is an empire, whether it is a postage-stamp plot or an acre expanse -- and you have this sense of well being, of richness. The look and smell of the grass (not to mention the taste of the juniper berries) stir in you a primeval feeling of being one with the earth.
In a neat, manicured way, of course. 
 But what's this?
A section is browning out.
All of a sudden, you have visions of microscopic creatures eating your grass, chinch bugs or bluegrass billbugs invading the turf you have nurtured with seed, fertilizer and water, an army of army worms hiding out in the thatch during the day and sneaking out at night to chomp, chomp, chomp away at blades and stems and the very core of your feelings of harmony.
So who ya gonna call?
Deborah Smith-Fiola, for one.
Experts like Dr. Smith-Fiola, an associate professor at Rutgers University and its cooperative extension agent assigned to Ocean County, are available to every New Jerseyan. And as the county agriculture agent, she and her horticultural specialists and the volunteers she has trained to answer the horticulture hot line receive lots of calls -- 3,500 last year to the volunteers known as master gardeners.
"They range from 'Why is my lawn dying?' to 'I've got spots on the leaves of my tree; what do I do?' " said Dr. Smith-Fiola, 37, who from childhood in her native Maryland wondered why plants grew and why they died, fascinated by the mystery of ecology.
"Or 'I found this insect in my kitchen; what is it?' Or 'Do I spray?' People often ask, 'What do I spray?' and often we try to talk them out of spraying. To 'What is eating my vegetable garden?' All kinds of crazy things."
Cooperative extension agents in each of New Jersey's 21 counties offer advice on agricultural productivity, food science, nutrition and health, marine and coastal resources, the environment and natural resources, and individual and community resource development.
Some, like Dr. Smith-Fiola, are agriculture agents. Each county has at least one. Others specialize in family and consumer sciences (formerly called home economics) and 4-H youth development.
Under the Smith-Lever Act passed by Congress in 1914, land-grant universities like Rutgers have been able to extend their educational programs into the community through financing by state, county and Federal governments.
"I Fear No Weevil," says one sign on the partition of Dr. Smith-Fiola's crammed and cluttered office in the two-story agricultural center building on Whitesville Road here. "Entomologists Get the Bugs Out," asserts another.
Dr. Smith-Fiola is the state's expert on integrated pest management, which involves using non-chemical alternatives, like microscopic worms called nematodes, to attack insects. She received a bachelor's degree in horticulture in 1981 and a master's in entomology and integrated pest management in 1985, both from the University of Maryland.
Shortly after joining the staff in 1989, she began the master gardener program to handle the calls more efficiently. Each year she trains about 40 volunteers, many of whom answer phone questions, educating the public about ticks and Lyme disease and doing diagnostics, which means analyzing problem plant samples and bugs.
There is not much farming in Ocean County (the No. 1 crop is hay, she says), so much of her time is spent consulting with "the ornamental horticulture industry" or, "the green industry," which, she adds, is the state's No. 1 agricultural industry in terms of gross receipts. This includes landscapers, "turf grass professionals" (the guys who cut the grass), arborists (tree guys) and groundskeepers (for golf courses).
In recent years, as landfill space for grass clippings has dwindled, Dr. Smith-Fiola has conducted meetings, classes and field inspections to encourage professionals to practice mulching, leaving clippings in the lawn.
She also shares the latest information on horticulture from Rutgers researchers like her husband, Joseph Fiola. "My husband is now the small-fruits specialist," she says. "He does grapes, raspberries, strawberries."
A majority of questions in April, May and September deal with lawns. "When should I fertilize my lawn?" (Fall.) "What is the proper time to water my lawn?" (Midnight to 8 A.M.) "If I mulch, will it increase my thatch?" (If done properly, absolutely not.)
"Do you have a lawn?" she is asked.
"Yes."
"So how does your lawn look?"
"Well," she said, "I've got melting-out disease on my lawn. It's a common disease right now. It starts off with a little spot on the leaf blade, and it works its way down. It's a fungus. It spreads with water. It works down to the crown, and it can girdle the plant and kill it. The lawn kind of turns a bleached color, an off-white color."
"What do you do about it?"
"I take pictures of it," she says, ever the scientist. "I can use it in classes later on."

HEADLINE: GOVERMENT AND POLITICS;
New Rules On Custody: Will They Aid Children?

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH SEYMOUR 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Two months after the State Supreme Court released sweeping revisions to New Jersey's child custody guidelines, experts are at odds over what the effects will be. Some say the changes could actually harm the children they were intended to protect.
At the center of the dispute is whether the amount of time noncustodial parents spend with their children should be linked to the financial support paid to the primary, or custodial, parent. 
 Under the court's "shared-parenting" philosophy, which takes effect on Sept. 1, noncustodial parents, who are overwhelmingly fathers, will be eligible for a reduction in their child support payments if they can prove that their children spend the equivalent of two nights a week with them throughout the year. They must also prove that they are feeding their children, paying for their transportation and providing them a room to sleep in.
Some lawyers said they applauded the adjustment for recognizing that child-rearing is increasingly shared by two parents. Others said it would taint the process by using money to encourage parents to spend time with their children.
"Visitation has to be decided without regard to money," said Nancy Goldhill, a senior attorney at Legal Services of New Jersey. "New Jersey's really making a big policy change to so directly interweave them and there can be negative consequences from that."
Child support guidelines were first drafted in 1986 so Family Court judges throughout the state would have a uniform method of deciding financial issues in custody disputes. The guidelines have been updated three times since then. The current revisions were drafted by the Supreme Court's family practice subcommittee in March 1996 and were announced this May.
"In terms of overall fairness, they're the best we've ever had," said Richard A. Russell, a former chairman of the family law section of the State Bar Association.
Too often, advocates of the change said, the court awards seven days of child support a week to be paid by noncustodial parents, who also incur expenses whenever the children are in their care.
"It is an attempt to mirror reality," said Mark H. Sobel, the current chairman of the bar association's family law section.
In many cases, the reduction would seem to be marginal. For example, a father of two children would pay $172 in child support a week if his weekly gross income is $630 and his ex-wife's is $500. If he were eligible for a shared parenting adjustment, his support payments would drop $28, or about $1,450 a year, court officials said. Any adjustment would be revoked if the custodial parent's net income, including child support payments, did not exceed 200 percent of the Federal poverty guidelines.
At least 20 states have adopted shared-parenting credits as part of their child support guidelines, court officials said, and a recent New Jersey custody case may have sparked particular interest here.
In 1995, the State Supreme Court rejected James Pascale's request to have his child-support payments lowered because his three children spent a significant amount of time with him. Mr. Pascale's lawyers argued that he did not want to pay less child support; he wanted to spend some of the money when the children were in his care.
Despite the ruling, the court's opinion did acknowledge that a custody arrangement could be so nontraditional that a judge might need to deviate from the guidelines.
John P. Paone Jr., who represented Mr. Pascale in the trial court, said that the case was the genesis for the court's new approach to the issue. But like many lawyers interviewed, Mr. Paone said he is concerned that in the attempt to be fair to both parents, money will now take precedence over children's interests in visitation arrangements.
"It's a problem, putting a price on visitation," he said. "Even though that's not the intent, that's what could happen."
Mary E. Coogan, a lawyer with the Association for Children of New Jersey, one of the state's leading advocacy groups, says a child's standard of living could be jeopardized under some shared parenting arrangements. The custodial parent could receive less money to care for the children, she said, while the noncustodial parent is granted a credit insufficient to provide a significantly higher standard of living for the child.
"At some point, the kid is losing in both households," Ms. Coogan said.
Judges and lawyers are undergoing training sessions to learn the new guidelines before they go into effect. Payments to some children will increase, mostly because the economic formula used to calculate awards has been updated. The court also is expanding the reach of its guidelines. In the past, basic child support awards were not drafted for families with combined annual incomes of more than $52,000. In those cases, child support payments were made at the judge's discretion. The new guidelines will apply to families with combined incomes of up to $150,000.
The 276,000 existing child support orders will not be subject to the new guidelines. But parents who already pay child support could seek to modify their agreements if other factors, such as income, have changed.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Tax Negotiators to Seek a Win-Win-Win Deal

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AFTER promising for months to deliver substantial tax cuts to Americans for the first time in 16 years, the House, the Senate and the White House now have all completed detailed plans to reduce Federal taxes on families, investors and others.
Unfortunately for taxpayers trying to determine what breaks are coming their way, or to prepare for the coming changes in the tax code, the plans vary in many ways. And you cannot just take one from Column A, another from Column B and a third item from Column C. In the process of drafting a final version that President Clinton will be willing to sign, a number of difficult and unpredictable trade-offs will be necessary. 
 The proposals can be viewed only as a rough guide to what will be enacted. Even specific provisions that are common to all three versions may be changed.
Still, it is clear that the final legislation will include certain elements. All sides have agreed on a credit to families for each child. Capital gains tax rates will be reduced. Some students will get credits for some college costs. The use of individual retirement accounts will be expanded.
Negotiators from the House, the Senate and the Administration are scheduled to start meeting late this week to fashion out of their differing plans a compromise package that they hope will give all sides enough to enable everyone to claim victory.
In general terms, the Administration will be pressing Republicans to shift the tax cuts away from higher-income taxpayers. Republicans will keep up their argument that tax relief should go to those who pay the most in taxes, and that the legislation should not be used to redistribute income.
One of the big fights will be over capital gains. Mr. Clinton particularly wants to strip out the provision in the House bill that would allow investors to index their capital gains for inflation starting in 2001. Indexing would become extremely expensive to the Treasury in later years, and could be difficult for both taxpayers and the Internal Revenue Service to administer. The odds are that Mr. Clinton will prevail.
Mr. Clinton seems less likely to win his fight to limit the capital gains rate reduction for upper-income taxpayers. His proposal to exclude 30 percent of capital gains from taxation would reduce the effective top rate just fractionally -- to 27.7 percent from 28 percent -- for taxpayers in the top 39.6 percent income-tax bracket. Both the House and the Senate bills would bring the maximum capital gains rate down to 20 percent and create a 10 percent rate for people in the 15 percent income-tax bracket.
Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, strongly supports a broad expansion of the I.R.A. program. But Administration officials argue that savings incentives primarily benefit the affluent, since they have the most money to save. But while the White House wants to limit the expansion of tax breaks for savings, it has signed on to the concept of educational savings accounts for college-bound children.
Even where there is broad agreement, there are differences in detail that could prove difficult to bridge. The Administration would phase out its proposed $500-a-child credit for families with incomes above $60,000, while the Republican bill would start the phaseout at $110,000. Mr. Clinton wants a more generous credit for the first two years of college, while Republicans question whether the credit would do anything more than fuel tuition inflation.
Scores of narrow provisions could be of immense interest to particular groups. Most of those might be dropped, but several could sneak in when the final deals are struck, probably in the wee hours of an early morning in late July just before Congress adjourns for its August recess.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Dissecting the Competing Proposals"

HEADLINE: Tax Spending, Not Savings

BYLINE: By Bruce Bartlett; Bruce Bartlett, a senior fellow with the National Center for Policy Analysis, was a Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary in the Reagan and Bush Administrations.
Frank Rich is on leave. His column will resume in November

DATELINE: GREAT FALLS, Va.

 BODY:
One can hardly pick up a personal finance publication these days without reading another story about how baby boomers are not saving enough for retirement. Yet our Federal tax code encourages consumption rather than saving.
Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has long advocated a national consumption tax, and has long been ignored. Now a growing number of economists and legislators are showing interest in the idea. Once the current tax legislation is out of the way, Mr. Archer says, his No. 1 goal will be to push such a plan. 
 To a large extent, the tax code's bias against saving is deliberate. When the existing code began to take shape in the 1940's, the memory of the Great Depression was still fresh. Keynesian theories, which view spending as the driving force in the economy and saving as a drag on growth, were triumphant. Federal officials rejected a national consumption tax for fear that it would stifle spending.
As a result, the United States has long had one of the most pro-consumption, anti-saving tax codes among the big industrialized countries. Our tax code looks kindly on debt, but we discourage people from putting money away by taxing returns on savings and investment. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, only Canada has a higher average tax rate on capital -- savings and investment -- than the United States.
Not surprisingly, the United States and Canada also have the lowest rates of saving among industrialized countries. In 1996, Americans saved just 5 percent of their after-tax income; Canadians saved 4.6 percent. By contrast, Italians saved 13.4 percent of their income, the French 12.8 percent, the Japanese 11.9 percent, and the Germans and British 11.6 percent.
In the long run, countries that save more tend to have higher standards of living. More domestic saving is associated with higher rates of investment, which in turn is associated with higher rates of productivity.
Growing concern that Americans are not saving enough has led to new interest in consumption taxes. There are only two things people can do with income: save it or spend it. The idea behind a consumption tax is to tax what people spend, rather than what they save. This can be done directly, through some form of a tax on goods and services, or indirectly, by not taxing investment income.
Countries can directly tax consumption in two ways. One, widely used in Europe, is to impose what is known as a value-added tax on goods and services -- a tax levied on producers that is incorporated into the price they charge consumers. The other way, which Mr. Archer favors, is a national sales tax, much like the sales taxes most states have.
Indirect approaches to taxing consumption can also take different forms. Bipartisan legislation was introduced in the last Congress that took this approach. Under that plan, taxpayers would have received a deduction for all savings. And a flat tax proposal supported by the House majority leader, Dick Armey of Texas, would eliminate taxes on savings and investment returns.
All of these approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, and once lawmakers get serious about the goal of taxing consumption rather than saving, they will have to consider such issues as the simplicity and fairness of a new tax system.
The time is right for a consumption tax. Rather than merely bemoan the difficulty Americans seem to have in saving for the future, why not make it easier for them to do so?

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;
Gauging the Bulls in Latin America

BYLINE: By DAN COLARUSSO 

 BODY:
IN the first half of 1997, Latin American stock funds produced some of the world's best returns. But whether that run will continue depends upon budget questions in Brazil, the aftermath of Mexico's elections today and investors' willingness to continue to see the stocks in the rallying region as attractively priced.
Stock markets in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Chile and Peru have been powered so far this year by a wave of privatizations, other economic and fiscal changes and increased flows of foreign capital. Those forces helped the Morgan Stanley Institutional Latin American A fund to post a 44 percent return in the first half of 1997, while Morgan Stanley Latin American A jumped 43 percent and the T. Rowe Price Latin America fund gained 41 percent. 
 Indeed, excluding specialty funds, Latin American stock funds accounted for 8 of the 10 top-performing funds during that period, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago fund trackers. Even the worst performer among the 28 Latin American funds that Morningstar follows, Wright Equifund -- Mexico, was up 24 percent through June 30.
The play in the first half was clearly Brazil, where the markets benefited from the Government's decision to privatize several key companies, including Telebras, Electrobras and Petrobras, respectively the telephone, electric and oil and gas companies.
Such privatizations, which are also taking place in Peru and Venezuela, can free enterprises to become markedly more profitable. Five years ago, state-owned Telebras, a staple holding in many Latin American funds, charged just 70 cents for monthly telephone line rentals; in 1997 Telebras was charging $10.
In addition, some fund managers say the region's rally is on firmer ground than in past upswings. For one, Latin America's economic growth this time is fueled in large part by exports and foreign investment, which are steadier sources of growth than domestic consumption.
The managers say the good times are also a product of long-needed changes by dedicated governments that have finally mastered their fiscal policies, from privatization to currency management.
Patti Satterthwaite, manager of the Fidelity Latin America fund, visited Brasilia in April and "was amazed at how consistent the reform story was" among all levels of government. "There's a strong commitment," she said.
Moreover, the poor performance of Asia's emerging markets may mean that Latin America will compete mostly with Central and Eastern Europe for investor dollars earmarked for developing lands. That may keep capital inflows high.
But there is wariness as the region heads into the second half of 1997. "Latin America looks good -- fairly good -- but not as good as early in the year," said Arjun Divecha, the manager of the GMO Emerging Markets Equity fund.
Mark Haet, a Latin American portfolio manager for Bankers Trust, agreed. "We should get 10 percent to 15 percent" from the region for the balance of the year, he estimated.
Many managers of Latin American funds worry that Brazil may be bedeviled by its budget deficit -- the provinces are a big financial drain on the national government -- and worries that its currency is somewhat overvalued.
MOREOVER, while Ms. Satterthwaite said that the Brazilian market might continue its upswing, buoyed in part by a state auction of cellular licenses and continuing privatizations, the fact is that Bovespa, the Brazilian stock index, has already risen 75 percent since January. And while the index was trading at 12 or 13 times earnings early this year, it now carries a multiple of 16. That is not quite the 23 of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, but Brazil is, after all, an emerging market.
The run-up may lead some investors to see Brazil as no bargain, and it has made Mr. Divecha ambivalent. He is wary of overplaying Brazil, but acknowledges being "chastened by what's happened in the U.S. market in the past couple of years -- the momentum can just keep pushing it up."
In the search for greener pastures that is typical of long-rallying regions, Mr. Haet's firm began to lighten up on Brazilian stocks in late April and to add some more Mexican positions. Similarly, Mr. Divecha has grown neutral on Brazil and bullish on Mexico.
Mexico's market has yet to return to the levels it reached before the 1995 peso crisis; indeed, with the index carrying a multiple of 14, many fund managers say Mexican stocks are undervalued.
Mr. Divecha added that Mexico's gross domestic product was growing and inflation falling. Some consumer stocks have gained sharply in this strengthening economy, Mr. Haet said, with Grupo Femsa, a beverage bottler, up more than 70 percent since January, for example. Experts also expect construction companies, like Cemex and Tribasa, to benefit from a recovery.
But Mexicans are voting in nationwide elections today, and the long-reigning Institutional Revolutionary Party is expected to sustain big losses. Managers expect a period of "uncertainty as the PRI learns to share power," said Robert Meyer, who along with Andy Skov, manages the Morgan Stanley Latin America fund. And some managers, like Ms. Satterthwaite, appreciate the private sector's efforts in Mexico but are disappointed by the Government's slow pace toward economic change.
"As a nation, Mexico has been left behind by the rest of the region," she said. "The reform hasn't been as robust."
Behind these fears, of course, managers are doubtless thinking about all those big, risky shifts, because of politics or economics, for which emerging markets are famous.
"When economies restructure," Mr. Meyer said, "it's often two steps forward and one step back."

HEADLINE: Condemning Nike Plants Won't Prod Change

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Regarding Bob Herbert's June 27 column on my report on Nike's overseas labor practices: 
 I was reluctant to get involved with Nike in its Asian shoe conflicts because it would inevitably put me back into the "reasonable moderate" role I agonized over throughout my civil rights career. I plead guilty to idealism and optimism, but I have been through too many human rights battles to be called naive.
Condemning people in the South or South Africa, however guilty, never produced much change. Helping them create a new relationship with a "no fault" analysis set them free to be part of the process of change.
I found Nike's staff in Asia idealistic, sports-centered, socially isolated Westerners struggling with the demands of production. Their focus was quality control, without which there would be no jobs for anybody. They tried to avoid micro-management, and this was possible because there were no "systematic abuses."
Young women in their late teens and early 20's are supervised largely by women in their late 20's or early 30's. This isn't "management by terror," as critics say. It's management without adequate training or language skills. Nike has agreed to get involved and try to change the process.
Nike's critics deserve credit for raising these issues, but continued condemnation of the same few incidents among a work force of several hundred thousand will cause people to stop listening or close factories.
The salary issue is seen by many as the primary structural abuse. I do not feel qualified to determine a living wage in Vietnam or Indonesia, but workers spoke, on and off factory grounds, of saving money and sending it home. Western clothing, motor scooters and the roadside merchants at factories, even where food was provided, did not give the impression of "starvation wages."
I believe that the United States and the world need a globally integrated economy. I am determined to facilitate that because it generates jobs at home and opportunity abroad.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;
A Successful Bond Navigator Sees Calm Waters

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY MIDDLETON 

 BODY:
MOST bond-market strategists have been worried about higher interest rates this year. Not William H. Gross, manager of some of the fixed-income industry's best-performing and most consistent portfolios.
"I think the next move by Greenspan and company will be down as opposed to up," said Mr. Gross, the strategist in charge of fixed income for the Pacific Investment Management Company, known as Pimco, of Newport Beach, Calif. "This probably will not occur until we are well toward the end of the year, or maybe early in 1998, but we could wind up the year at 6 percent on the long-term U.S. Treasury bond." 
 If he is right about the plans of the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, a decline from the current level of around 6.75 percent would have implications for equity investors as well.
Mr. Gross, who oversees $92 billion of fixed-income assets, or 84 percent of Pimco's $110 billion total, has been called "the Peter Lynch of bonds" by Newsweek magazine, in reference to the former manager of the Fidelity Magellan fund (though Mr. Gross shrugs off the comparison because, he noted, Mr. Lynch's upper lip is bare while his own sports a mustache).
MR. GROSS has been bullish on the bond market all year, but that hurt in the first quarter, when bond prices were down. But it paid off in the second quarter, when the average long-term Government bond fund -- the bellwether portfolio -- rose 4.27 percent, delivering nearly a year's worth of returns in only three months.
Indeed, Mr. Gross has been betting on lower interest rates since they spiked up in 1994, during the last round of Fed tightening.
Earlier this year, when the Fed nudged rates up, his optimism backfired for shareholders of the several bond funds he manages.
But the first quarter's weakness was more than erased by a rally in the second period, when the Fed declined to raise rates further -- as it did again on Wednesday. Over the first half, Pimco Low Duration rose 4 percent and Pimco Total Return gained 3.65 percent, surpassing the 3.1 percent return of the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond index.
Two funds that Pimco manages for other firms, Fremont Bond and Harbor Bond, also beat the index. The Pimco funds have five stars, the top ranking for risk-adjusted performance, from Morningstar Inc., the fund researchers in Chicago, and the other two have four stars.
"I think it's hard to talk about fixed-income managers without his name being the first one mentioned," said Mark Wright, senior analyst at Morningstar, of Mr. Gross. "Pimco's developed one of the best track records in the industry, consistently and over a long period of time."
Mr. Gross, 53, has spent his entire financial career with Pimco, which specializes in debt securities. He joined the firm as a securities analyst after receiving a master's degree in business administration in 1971 from the University of California at Los Angeles. A 1966 graduate of Duke University, Mr. Gross served three years as an engineering officer in the Navy and six months as a professional blackjack player in Las Vegas, Nev.
"It was blackjack that got me interested in securities markets," he said. The mathematics, memorization and gamesmanship that fuel success in one endeavor work equally well in the other, he said. "When I found out you could beat the house at blackjack -- and you can -- it encouraged me to test my skills in financial markets."
Mr. Gross was originally interested in equities, he said, but when he got out of school the competition for fixed-income jobs was less keen. "I only got two job offers when I got out of U.C.L.A., and this was the better of them," he said.
In his 26 years with Pimco, Mr. Gross has observed debt markets when inflation was surging, as it was in the 1970's, and when it was ebbing, as it was from 1981 through 1994. Each swing of the pendulum suggested a particular approach to investing. But in the last three years, he said, the market has been transformed in a way that requires a third, fundamentally different approach to bond investing.
He compares the first two eras to the turbulent Mississippi River, and the new one to Butler Creek, a placid stream near his boyhood home in Middletown, Ohio.
"Butler Creek is premised on a range-bound world -- of interest rates between 5.5 percent and 7.5 percent on the long-term U.S. Treasury bond," he said. "If interest rates are range bound, and move more like Butler Creek than the Mississippi, then what an investor should be concerned with would not be price movement, which was the focus of the 1970's and the 1980's and the first part of the 1990's, but more on yield." The yield on bonds moves in the opposite direction to the price.
When interest rates are either rising or falling, the resulting change in bond prices is the principal risk in bond investing. When interest rates are relatively stable, the higher yields paid by long-term bonds more than compensate investors for the added risk of owning them. "The art of bond management is taking the appropriate risks at the right time, and it seems to me that in this Butler Creek environment, one of the best ways to take risk is to lengthen the maturity of your portfolios to some extent," he said.
For example, he noted that the relatively low yields of money market securities could be improved, with very little additional risk, by investing in short-term bonds. Money market rates are currently about 4.5 percent. The Pimco Low Duration fund, which owns bonds with maturities of one to two years, is yielding about 6 percent. "So you pick up one and a half percentage points in yield by taking a slight extension risk in maturity," he said.
Another tactic for increasing a bond portfolio's yield in a range-bound environment is buying mortgage-backed bonds rather than Treasuries, Mr. Gross said. For example, a five-year Treasury note is currently yielding 6.4 percent, but a Government National Mortgage Association bond of similar characteristics yields 7.5 percent.
This strategy would be dangerous in a choppy bond market, Mr. Gross acknowledged, because mortgage-backed bonds are volatile when rates are in flux.
OF course, taking some even bigger risks is another way to plump up a portfolio's returns. Mr. Gross said the higher yields of junk and emerging-markets bonds -- which he said were running 8.5 percent to 9.5 percent -- make them attractive for a small portion of an investor's portfolio.
"We own at Pimco about a 5 percent position in emerging markets," Mr. Gross said.
Mr. Gross said he expected interest rates to ebb to 6 percent this year because inflation had been all but obliterated.
Wages, the biggest component of producer prices, are constrained by unusually high increases in productivity, he said. "The owners of machines and the owners of information are benefiting at the expense of labor, which suggests a surge in productivity, and it suggests, importantly, a continuing lid on wage rates -- and that's the perfect environment for a bond holder," Mr. Gross said.
The supply-demand equation is also benefiting bonds, he said. Because of a shrinking deficit, the Treasury is issuing only about $100 billion of fresh debt annually. But it is also paying $250 billion in interest on the debt, most of it immediately reinvested. "When you've got $250 billion chasing $100 million of new issuance, prices go up," he noted.
Higher bond prices mean lower interest rates, which vary inversely to price. This phenomenon is most visible in very short-term rates, which are around 5 percent for three-month Treasury bills. That is less than the overnight borrowing rate among banks, set by the Federal Reserve at 5.5 percent. Ordinarily, that rate is the lowest in the marketplace because it is for the shortest term.
Mr. Gross's new paradigm in bond investing has implications for equities, too, he said. He noted that in 1981, before the historic rally in stocks began, the average share traded at a price 10 times its annual earnings. Now the ratio is around 20.
"The reason p/e ratios have doubled has not been because the boomers have been starting to save for retirement," he said. "It's because inflation and interest rates have dropped so dramatically."
But interest rates are low, having come down more than 8 percentage points since the bull market began in the early 1980's. Indeed, if rates fell that far again, they would reach the unlikely level of zero.
"What that means is that from this point forward, you're down to the earnings growth of corporate America," he said. "I would suggest that based on a number of fundamental economic arguments, we're back down to this 7 percent earnings growth world, which produces a very attractive return for stocks, but not anything close to what we've had for the past 15 years."
Matching his deeds to his words, Mr. Gross said that he recently reallocated the assets of his personal 401(k) plan to 75 percent bonds and 25 percent stocks, from a 50-50 split. "That's a reflection of my attitude that bonds are more attractive than stocks at this point in time," he said.
Still, even Mr. Gross is making changes gingerly, rather than rushing headlong into the new environment. He reduced the duration, or effective average maturity, of the portfolio of the intermediate-term Pimco Total Return fund to 4.9 years from 5.4 years in the first quarter, and has not yet extended it.
"Actually, we're waiting for the appropriate entry point," he said. "When yields are slightly higher, closer to 7 percent, we plan to increase that duration to about five and a half or even close to six years, if chance affords the opportunity."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;
Why Fix What's Not Broken?

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
INVESTORS who were grumbling at the year's start and threatening to funnel their mutual fund money into index funds are singing a different tune now. While the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index still holds an edge, rising 19.49 percent in the first half of the year, the market's riches flowed over all types of stocks in the second quarter.
The results are a far cry from those of the first three months of the year, when investors could barely eke out decent returns anywhere apart from the S.& P. stocks. And it is a testament to the value of carefully constructed long-term portfolios and the ability to stick by them during tough times. 
 That has been the approach of the five professional money managers who created hypothetical retirement portfolios for The New York Times, and they have been justly rewarded for keeping the faith.
"What a difference a quarter makes," said Harold R. Evensky, an investment adviser in Coral Gables, Fla., whose portfolio rose 10.4 percent, to place fourth for the quarter. "It restores one's belief in diversification."
Mr. Evensky said that when he called the manager of one of his holdings, Compass Small Cap Growth, to discuss its 20 percent loss in the first quarter, the manager said he believed in what he was doing and planned no changes. That belief was vindicated: Compass roared back with a 21.7 percent gain. And Mr. Evensky's other first-quarter drags have also bounced back.
He conceded that balancing funds whose returns are poorly correlated with one another in a single portfolio may never produce eye-popping returns. But, he added, "it's comforting for those who have a long-term market view and whose goal is enjoying life and sleeping well."
Diversification is particularly good for these tricky times, agreed Eric M. Kobren, president of Insight Management and the editor of Fidelity Insight, an independent newsletter in Wellesley, Mass. The economy looks solid, but investors, who continue plowing money into mutual funds, face two gnawing questions, Mr. Kobren said: How much better can the economic environment get? And how high can the market value of the largest public companies rise?
"While nirvana may continue for a while longer, I feel very comfortable spreading my bets around in small-cap value, real estate and international stock funds," he said.
MR. KOBREN, who invests solely in Fidelity funds, took third place for the quarter, with a portfolio return of 11.6 percent. His top performer was Fidelity Dividend Growth, up 16.5 percent this quarter. He said its new manager, Charles Mangum, had transformed it into a more typical, large-cap growth fund.
Mr. Kobren cautioned that his laggard, Fidelity Real Estate, up a meager 5 percent this quarter, "serves as an anchor in the portfolio and that it should not be expected to reproduce last year's extraordinary gains." Over all, Mr. Kobren said he was happy with his portfolio and was not planning any changes.
Indeed, only one of the managers is planning even minor adjustments. The five portfolios have risen an average of 80 percent since they were created four years ago. That compares with a 119.6 percent cumulative four-year return for the Vanguard Index 500 fund, which mimics the S.& P. 500.
The performance of the hypothetical portfolios is tracked each quarter by Lipper Analytical Services, of Summit, N.J. It excludes sales charges, transaction costs and tax considerations because most retirement money is held in tax-deferred accounts. The five managers can choose any fund open to new investors and can shift money quarterly, though the portfolios are intended to grow for 20 years.
All five portfolios made money in the second quarter, with an average gain of just over 12 percent. Still, just one came close to the 15.4 percent average for diversified domestic equity funds followed by Lipper.
That portfolio is the "socially responsible" fund assortment created by Jack A. Brill, a San Diego investment adviser. It rose 15.1 percent for the quarter, helped by a large chunk in the Domini Social Equity fund. That fund owns stocks that meet certain social criteria and are culled from the S.& P. 500 and from the second 500, to mimic the sector distribution of the S.& P. 500 as closely as possible, and also include small- and micro-cap stocks. Domini gained 17.3 percent in the second quarter.
"During the past year, screening out tobacco stocks helped the Domini Social Equity fund outperform the S.& P. 500," Mr. Brill said.
John Rekenthaler, the publisher of Morningstar Mutual Funds in Chicago, was particularly pleased with the performance of his portfolio, which was up 14.4 percent and ranked second this quarter. "Since many of these funds fare relatively well when stocks are declining, I'm very happy with their bull-market results," he said.
Mr. Rekenthaler is the one manager who is altering his portfolio for the third quarter, but the change is small. "My portfolio is already heavy on the smaller-company and international stocks that have somewhat lagged the past few years' gains, so I'm already tilted toward those assets that I think are ready to play catch-up," he said.
He will replace Third Avenue Value with Third Avenue Value Small Cap, a new offering managed by Martin Whitman, who runs the original fund, and by one of his proteges, Curtis Jensen. "I love the idea of a smaller, nimbler version of Third Avenue Value," Mr. Rekenthaler said.
His hypothetical portfolio may not be changing much, but its management is. Mr. Rekenthaler is leaving Morningstar to join the John Nuveen Company as its vice president and manager of its investment strategies. For the next quarter, his portfolio responsibilities will be assumed by Susan Paluch, the new editor of the Morningstar Investor newsletter.
Sheldon Jacobs, who edits the No-Load Fund Investor in Irvington, N.Y., retains the overall lead among the five managers, with a gain of nearly 98 percent since the exercise began, on July 7, 1993.
But for the second quarter, his portfolio was in last place, even though it rose a respectable 8.8 percent. Mr. Jacobs says he is comfortable with his portfolio as it is.
"It's about at the level of risk I want, and while some of the funds didn't do as well in the second quarter as they had done in the first quarter, you have to stay with your selections," Mr. Jacobs said. "There is a lot of rotation in the market."

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Chevrolet Camaro SS;
At 30, Still a Diversion for Consenting Adults

BYLINE: By MARSHALL SCHUON 

 BODY:
THE car is spectacular, I'll give it that. It is a 30th-anniversary Camaro SS, Arctic white with "hugger orange" stripes, a houndstooth interior, huge tires and a snarling V8 under the hood. It is a car for superlatives. But at the moment it was totally inadequate.
"Let's try the stroller this way," I said to Mischa, rearranging things under the gaping hatch for, perhaps, the fifth time. And it fit, sort of. 
 Mischa is my daughter-in-law, visiting from her native Germany with my grandsons -- Hunter, 3, and Travis, 3 months -- and I was making good on my promise to take Hunter fishing. I dote on Hunter, you understand, and I am very proud that he is bilingual. Actually trilingual, if you count the "dises" and "dats" that sprinkle his English with what seems to be Brooklynese.
But this lovely car was not cooperating. Camaros are not made for two adults, two children, a pair of child-safety seats, a stroller, a tackle box and a couple of casting rods. And I realized why, given all the cars I have owned, I have let three decades of cramped Camaros pass me by.
I surveyed the remaining space and asked Hunter to pass me the bucket of worms.
"I do dat," he said.
This seems, incidentally, to be a year for anniversaries, what with America's oldest nameplate -- Olds, fittingly -- marking its 100th birthday; with Saab and Ferrari turning 50; with Toyota celebrating 40 years of sales in the United States, and with Mercury marking the 30th year of its Cougar with the announcement that this year's model will be the last, at least for now.
But the Camaro, along with its Pontiac Firebird stablemate, which also turns 30 this year, occupies a special corner of America's sporting heart. The Ford Mustang beat the G.M. models to market by more than two years, establishing the name for the pony-car group, and others like the Plymouth Barracuda grabbed the public fancy for a while. But the Camaro and Mustang and Firebird have been the stalwarts and survivors, and each has gotten better with age.
Dick Almond, Chevrolet's brand manager for Camaro, says the biggest problem with sporty cars has always been high insurance rates. But he said improvements in safety and anti-theft systems are making the cars more attractive to customers, and he sees a resurgence in sales of performance models. "Camaro has dropped out of the list of the 10 most-stolen cars," he said. "But it still offers something most cars don't -- it's flat-out fun, and the acceleration, cornering and handling are alive and well."
Still, the popularity of sporty cars has declined over the years and they now represent only about 8 percent of the passenger car market. Eight states, including New York, account for almost half the sales. The others are Florida, California, Texas, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
When the Camaro appeared in 1967, the craze for agile personal cars was in full flower. Its name, one of about 5,000 considered, is loosely based on the French word for comrade, and its friends over the years have been legion. As of now, more than 4.2 million Camaros have been built.
There have been just four generations of the car, beginning with the series that lasted from 1967 through 1969. Those cars, based on the Chevy II, were offered as coupes and convertibles, and prices started at a paltry $2,466. And while those little originals have become classics, the later models proved the staying power of good design.
In February 1970, the Camaro was radically restyled as a more aerodynamic coupe, and that design sold for a dozen years. In 1982, a new model rolled out with more chiseled lines, and the convertible returned in 1987 after an 18-year absence.
The current car has changed little since its birth in 1993, and it can be had in four flavors: plain Camaro, Camaro RS, Z28 and -- for the first time in 24 years -- as an SS, which stands for Super Sport. All are available as coupes, convertibles or T-tops with removable roof panels.
Prices, including delivery, start at $16,740 for a coupe with a 3.8-liter V6. That engine has just one more cubic inch of displacement than the six-cylinder '67, but it produces 200 net horsepower, compared with the original car's 140 gross horsepower. An anniversary-model Z28, with a 5.7-liter V8 that puts out 285 horses, is a bargain in today's market at $23,461. And the glowing orange-and-white SS test car, with an air-induction hood that lets the engine suck cool air and produces 305 horsepower, had a sticker that said $27,460.
Considering the car's power, fuel economy is reasonable, rated at 16 city, 27 highway. The SS likes 92-octane premium, but it will make do with less. And the big money buys more than zoom. There are the extra niceties of a beefier suspension, a limited-slip differential, a Hurst shifter for the six-speed stick, a 12-disk CD changer for the 200-watt stereo, and very nice floor mats.
Chevrolet says the Z28 will go from zero to 60 in 5.3 seconds, and the SS shaves that figure to 4.9. This is one quick car, but for all its strength the V8 can be amazingly civilized -- at least when you are at the wheel. For anyone behind the car, the thunderous exhaust is wondrously anti-social.
In fact, the SS is almost worth buying just for the sound, and it reminded me of the time I recorded half an hour of exhaust tunes at the rear of a friend's '59 Corvette. Call me crazy -- my wife did -- but I could sit on the couch and listen to that car all night. This Camaro is like that.
It is more fun on the road than on the couch, of course. The car's 17-inch wheels carry tires that are 9 inches wide, and the suspension glues the chassis to the asphalt -- as long as the surface is dry. In the wet, the tires' large contact patches spread the Camaro's weight over the water and send the car skittering. One must be careful, too, when approaching driveway ramps or when parking head-on against a curb; the low air dam in the front often scrapes bottom.
This is, of course, a toy. It is not meant for bad weather or as a family's only car. And as a toy, it is splendid. For 1997, there are new bucket seats, with contours redesigned to relieve fatigue on long trips. A new dashboard is swoopier and friendlier to the driver. There are four new cup holders and an extra lighter socket for your coffeepot (or, more probable, for your radar detector).
The body, mostly plastic and built on a steel unit-frame, is solid and relatively quiet, and even the 56-inch-wide doors don't judder or creak in the way of older Camaros. Those huge doors also make getting into the back seat less of a chore, and there is more room back there than any past pony-car could boast.
That still doesn't make it a vehicle for a fishing expedition. And, no, we didn't catch anything, but we had a good time. When we got home, Hunter ran for the house, stopped and looked back. Waiting for me, I thought. But what he said was, "I want dat car."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;
The Roller Coaster Known as Micro Cap

BYLINE: By ANNE TERGESEN 

 BODY:
MICRO-CAP mutual funds took investors on a wild ride this spring.
Since a brutal correction last summer in the market for small stocks and for its micro-cap subset, investors have favored blue chips. From January through April, funds specializing in micro caps -- stocks of companies with market values of less than $250 million -- trailed those investing in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by an average of about 14 percentage points. 
 In fact, the micro-cap funds had an average loss of 5.6 percent during that time, compared with an 8.8 percent gain for the index funds.
That prompted Satya Pradhuman, manager of United States quantitative analysis at Merrill Lynch, to wonder whether managers of the most beaten-down portfolios retained enough confidence to seize the opportunities he saw coming. "Investment managers have been traumatized," Mr. Pradhuman wrote in early May in a report to investors.
By the end of May, such concerns seemed misplaced. Almost overnight, the smallest stocks had transformed themselves from Wall Street's wallflowers into the life of the party, taking the funds that invest in them along for the ride. But when blue chips returned as the market leaders in June, investors were left to wonder whether May had been a cruel reminder of the short-lived surge in the spring of 1996 or the start of a long-awaited revival.
Such volatility is far from unusual. An analysis by Prudential Securities of data compiled by the University of Chicago's Center for Research in Security Prices shows that micro caps have historically posted ups and downs that are 87 percent more extreme than those of large stocks and 26 percent greater than those of small caps -- stocks with a market value under $1 billion.
The swings can increase sharply when fund managers shun diversification as a risk-management tool. American Heritage, a micro-cap fund that, like a lot of such funds, is too small to be included in many newspaper and other listings, posted a 78 percent return so far this year, largely on the back of one tiny stock. It plowed more than half its $18.1 million in assets into Senetek, a British company that says it has a treatment for male impotence.
The bet-the-store gamble paid off as Senetek's stock racked up a big percentage gain this quarter, rising from $3.38 to $4.50, but investors would have little cushion if the stock turned south. And the fund has an annual total return of just 2.2 percent over the last three years, suggesting that its valleys can be just as off-the-charts as its reported peaks.
"We are what you call a high-risk fund," said Heiko Thieme, the chairman and manager of the fund, defending his tendency to make heavy bets. "The very reason why we are up is that we remained focused."
Besides being highly volatile, the fund is also one of the most expensive around, charging fees of 6.25 percent of the fund's assets to defray overhead and other expenses, versus about 1.5 percent for the typical micro-cap offering.
Even diversified micro-cap funds can sometimes be a nightmare for impatient or risk-averse investors. Those who pulled money out of the Bridgeway Ultra-Small Company fund in response to its 3.6 percent loss in February missed out on gains that have left the portfolio up 20.6 percent for the first half of the year, when the average return for all diversified domestic funds was 13.1 percent, according to Morningstar. The Bridgeway fund concentrates on companies with market capitalizations of less than $100 million.
Micro-cap funds are particularly risky because of the speculative nature of many of the small companies they invest in. Stephen Janachowski, a co-founder of the investment advisory firm Brouwer & Janachowski, based in Tiburon, Calif., said the markets they trade in tend to be illiquid, adding to the volatility.
Those factors make micro caps a poor choice for investors unable to wait at least five years for returns, Mr. Janachowski said. He recommends that individual investors cap purchases of micro caps at 5 percent to 20 percent of a portfolio.
Although their outsized volatility makes small and micro-cap stocks notoriously difficult to predict, many market analysts argue that the fundamentals -- including a strong economy and a strong dollar -- are in place for a rebound in both sectors, which tend to move in tandem.
Other analysts point out, however, that these conditions have existed for some time but have yet to fuel a sustained micro-cap rally.
BUT even if micro caps fail to ride along with the current bull market, history suggests that patient investors will be rewarded. Since 1926, according to Prudential, micro caps have outperformed the rest of the market; their compounded annual returns of 12.6 percent were higher than the 11.8 percent for small caps and the 10.2 percent for blue chips.
"This is a great time to be looking at micro-caps," Mr. Pradhuman of Merrill Lynch said. With the heady multiples at which blue chips are now trading, he said, small stocks offer an opportunity to hunt for bargains and to diversify.
Mr. Pradhuman says small-cap stocks, including the micros, are cheaper relative to blue chips than they have been since the end of a small-stock bear market in 1990. Based on ratios of stock prices to sales, he said, micro-cap stocks are trading at about 0.32 times the average for large caps. That is 16 percent cheaper than the 0.38 they hit in 1990, the previous low for the decade.
Micro-cap funds are also relative bargains. Investors must now spend an average of $25.16 to receive $1 in earnings from funds that invest in the largest stocks, compared with $27.30 for small-cap stocks and $23.43 for those specializing in micro caps, Morningstar says.
Also working in the sector's favor is a proposed cut in the capital gains tax rate, said Claudia Mott, director of small-cap research at Prudential. If history repeats, she said, after a correction in one quarter, small stocks will rally by more than their large counterparts. That, she added, is because the smallest companies typically deliver returns in the form of price appreciation, or capital gains, rather than dividends.
On balance, advisers say, another positive factor for the smallest stocks is the recent decline in initial public offerings. Although deprived of high-flying small stocks they can sell at a quick profit, micro-cap mutual funds can benefit because investors interested in small stocks then turn their attention to existing issues, pushing prices higher.
With all these promising signs for micro caps, the only missing piece of the equation is earnings growth, Ms. Mott says. If analysts polled by the First Call Corporation are correct, after two years in which earnings improved too slowly to justify the higher risk of investing in small stocks, profit growth at small companies will outstrip that of market leaders by more than 10 percent this year and next.
The strength of the dollar argues in favor of that outcome, because a strong dollar squeezes profit margins on multinationals, which tend to be more reliant than small companies on exports. But skeptics argue that hopes for the smallest stocks could again be dashed by overly optimistic earnings projections or rising interest rates, which tend to punish small- and micro-cap stocks more than their larger counterparts.
 I'M not convinced that we're ready for a big-league period of outperformance," said Peter Canelo, an investment strategist at Morgan Stanley.
Mr. Canelo also notes that although conditions have been favorable to the smallest stocks for some time now, the stocks continue to lag behind blue-chip stocks. "I admit to being kind of mystified as to how some of these traditional relationships haven't been working," he said. "The strong economy doesn't help; the strong dollar doesn't help."
The lesson, he added, may be that in an increasingly integrated global economy, bigger is better.
Whatever doubts investors may have, they seem to have put them aside: The Russell 2000, the benchmark measure for small-cap companies, reached an all-time high on June 19.
Mr. Pradhuman argues that the current environment favors both growth funds, which invest in companies with above-average profit growth, and value funds, which pick stocks selling at discounts to their assets. The economy is strong, which is a plus for value funds, but not strong enough to ignite the rising interest rates that undermine growth funds, he said. If he is correct, that should reverse the poor performance among growth funds that has been responsible for most of the recent lag in small caps, he added.
Bruce Baughman, portfolio manager of the Franklin Group's Value and Balance Sheet Investment funds, says that it is only a matter of time before the rich price-earnings ratios of blue chips persuade investors to switch to smaller stocks. These days, Franklin's two value-oriented funds, which invest where they see value regardless of the size of the company, are heavily weighted in micro-cap companies, a greater number of which meet their criteria of selling near or below a discount to book value adjusted for overstated assets and under-estimated liabilities.
Mr. Baughman's portfolios are among this year's top 10 micro-cap performers, with the Balance Sheet fund, now closed to new individual investors, up 15.3 percent and the Value fund up 16.4 percent.
John Montgomery, manager of the Bridgeway Ultra-Small Company fund, which closed to new investors last month, said computer models that dictate his hybrid growth-value strategy showed early in the year that there were good deals to be found.
"When people start writing that the small-cap phenomenon is dead, that's the time to invest," he said.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;
Funds That Staggered as the Market Danced

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
GOOD news is no news for mutual fund investors these days, as seven years of sizzling stock market performance have conditioned millions of Americans to expect strong gains as a matter of course.
Mutual fund returns that just a few years ago would have had investors salivating are now greeted with a shrug, or even a yawn. Indeed, a new survey by Montgomery Asset Management found mutual fund owners confident that they would make 26 percent a year from their funds over the next decade, far more than the 10 percent that most market seers have suggested is reasonable. And who can blame investors for these expectations, given that over the last 12 months, the average stock mutual fund has gained almost 22 percent, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund trackers in Chicago? 
 So the real news, in the dog days of 1997, is not the fact that broad-based stock funds soared 14 percent in the second quarter of the year, or that almost every kind of stock fund, at home and abroad, posted double-digit gains, or even that bond funds turned in strong performances.
No, the man-bites-dog angle arises from the fact that in one of the greatest bull markets in history, a few funds have nonetheless managed to lose money in the last year or two or five. Not many funds, mind you, and it was certainly no mean feat, given that during the last five years, stock mutual funds as a group have averaged annual returns of almost 17 percent, international funds almost 12 percent and taxable bond funds roughly 7 percent.
That such funds are still around is perhaps even more astounding, given that investors usually flee seriously lagging funds. Their proprietors then generally close them, or fold them into other, better-performing funds, eliminating their poor track records.
The funds that have hung in there despite poor performance sometimes specialize in sectors -- like gold -- for which some investors still have hope. Others are one-time top dogs that suffered temporary but severe setbacks, like some high-octane funds that invest in small companies and are still trying to recoup losses they suffered last year and early this year. A handful of losers are just quirky.
And other dogs are simply, well, dogged. "I would guess that the laggards would typically be described as stubborn," said A. Michael Lipper, the longtime fund watcher who is president of Lipper Analytical Services. These funds are typically run by managers of a bearish bent who are convinced that the stock market is due for a crash -- and who have been waiting a very long time.
"We've been bearish so long I hate to admit it," said Charles L. Minter, who runs Comstock Partners and its two mutual funds, Comstock Capital Value, which is down an average of 5 percent a year for the last five years, and Comstock Strategy, which has eked out meager gains of 2.9 percent a year in that period.
Mr. Minter and his late partner, Stanley D. Salvigsen, achieved a certain renown on Wall Street for their economic and market forecasts, particularly for predicting the "rolling recession" in housing, which hit various parts of the real estate market in the late 1980's.
COMSTOCK turned negative on the American stock market in 1990, and has been betting ever since that stocks would fall. "I do believe that if the stock market continues to go up, we will wind up having to go out of business," Mr. Minter said. For him to become bullish on stocks, he said, the market would have to fall 30 percent or more.
The results of sticking to his convictions have been painful for Mr. Minter. The funds, which once had more than $2 billion in assets, have shrunk to less than $500 million. Losses have been so severe that the funds now have more than $200 million in potential tax benefits, which have become one of their main selling points. Future profits, if there ever are any, would be sheltered from taxes to some degree.
And Dreyfus, the big fund company that once sponsored one of Comstock's funds, basically jettisoned it last year after Dreyfus's longtime (and perennially bearish) chairman, Howard Stein, sold the company to Mellon Bank. The company also revamped its other bearish fund, Dreyfus Strategic Growth, in 1995; that fund is now an aggressive-growth vehicle. "We have no bearish funds at Dreyfus," a spokeswoman said.
Though few of the so-called bear funds have been around, or stayed around, as long as Comstock's, a few cubs are on the prowl, and they have all had terrible years. Lindner Bulwark dropped 18.4 percent in the last 12 months, for example, and Rydex Ursa, which is sort of an index fund for bears, fell 20.2 percent.
Then there is the Mathers Fund, which has pretty much eschewed stocks in favor of cash for the last decade; it is the worst-performing diversified stock fund for the last five years, its annual gain of just 1.4 percent barely beating cash under the mattress.
Another losing strategy, especially lately, has been trying to "time the market," as Wall Street puts it; this means trading in and out of funds to try to catch the peaks and avoid the valleys. In the last quarter, three funds in the Rightime fund family, which, as its name implies, uses a timing strategy, suffered losses of 0.9 percent to 1.9 percent.
Though the mutual fund business has become increasingly corporate over the last decade, there are still a few of the more eccentric entrepreneurs who became famous (or infamous) in the 70's and early 80's, before the big boom in funds. Charles Steadman, who is about to turn 83, continues to run four funds that have long been too small to be listed in this newspaper. They have, however, compiled one of the worst investment records on the planet. (Over the last decade, Steadman Technology and Growth has lost about 90 percent of its value.)
Then there is Fundamental's New York Muni Fund, which is the only fund investing in tax-exempt bonds to post a loss for the last five years, falling an average of three-tenths of a percent a year, according to Morningstar. (The average municipal bond fund made more than 6 percent a year.) Lance M. Brofman, the fund's founder and manager, said he was not sure whether the fund had indeed lost money during the five-year period. In 1994, the fund plunged 20 percent because of a wrong-way bet on interest rates.
AS a group, the biggest bow-wows of the 1990's have been gold funds. Over the last five years, precious-metals funds have averaged gains of 5.5 percent a year, barely beating money-market funds. Hardest hit have been funds that specialize in the shares of mining companies in South Africa, which have been beset by labor problems; U.S. Global Gold Shares has an annualized loss of 13 percent a year over the last five years.
Why, then, do investors keep what Lipper Analytical reckons is more than $4 billion in gold funds? For the investors known as gold bugs, gold investing is practically a religion; for others, who may also be stockpiling canned goods and shotgun shells in their basements, it is a hedge against apocalypse.
But for many others, it is simply a way to diversify on the off chance that inflation picks up again, said Jeffrey S. Molitor, principal and director of portfolio review at the Vanguard Group, which runs the biggest gold fund, one that returned an average of 4.2 percent annually over the last five years.
True, inflation has been falling for several years, and hovers just above 2 percent. (In the late 70's and early 80's, when gold funds were hot, inflation topped 10 percent.) But "should we see some upward movement in inflation, there is a reasonable chance of the portfolio doing better than bonds," Mr. Molitor said. And while gold may not seem like a promising bet, inflation has been known to rise, while it would take an unprecedented economic boom to produce the 26 percent annual returns that mutual fund investors said they expected in the Montgomery survey.
Just to prove that every dog has its day, the beleaguered Japanese stock market appears to be staging a small comeback, as does the country's currency. Funds that invest in Tokyo were the best-performing group last quarter, zooming 20.4 percent. Nevertheless, investors who took the plunge in 1996 have probably not fared well, given that the funds are still in negative territory for the last 12 months, down 5.6 percent.
To some extent, the recent recovery may be what Wall Street calls a "dead cat bounce," meaning that anything that falls far enough is likely to rebound a bit. But over the next three or five years, Japan may be a good investment, because "the momentum is building for Japan to come to grips with its problems," said Elizabeth Allan, who is co-manager of the publicly traded Scudder New Asia fund, as well as the Japan Fund, one of the hottest funds of the quarter.
In the short run, Ms. Allan, who has more seniority in her post than many of her competitors, is cautious, suggesting that "the market could take a breather here." She still finds "lots of good opportunities in Japan, if one is very selective," she added, "and I say selective because there are still a lot of companies that will experience a lot of challenges going forward."
With the United States stock market hitting new highs -- the Dow Jones industrial average closed on Thursday at 7,895.81, up 100.43 -- it may be tempting for investors to put their money into areas that have failed to perform well, like the stocks of basic industries, utilities, coal mines or real estate firms. But some experts warn against it.
"I think there's a bit of a trap investing in dogs," said Jeffrey M. Applegate, the chief investment strategist for Lehman Brothers. "You have to ask yourself, why should basic industrial stocks suddenly outperform? What's the fundamental case?"
But Mr. Applegate thinks there is still plenty of time for investors to get into the winning areas of the stock market. Concern about the length of the bull run is overblown, he said, adding that by his calculations, which look at economic cycles, the current bull market is by no means the longest or biggest in history.
"If you're in U.S. equities, continue to enjoy the rally," he wrote recently. "If you're not, we don't think it's too late to come in. After all, records are meant to be broken."

HEADLINE: The Greening of Gambling's Golden Boy

BYLINE: By JON CHRISTENSEN 

DATELINE: LAKE TAHOE, Nev.

 BODY:
"HE can't back down," said Steve Wynn, the chairman and chief executive of Mirage Resorts Inc. "I'll throw my body in front of the train."
Mr. Wynn had leaned close to buttonhole a board member at a meeting here in March of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, but his forceful stage whisper carried around the room, just as he had intended. "We sent a message to those guys," he said. "And as long as I'm around, we won't back down." 
 Mr. Wynn is used to getting his way. The strong-willed and hot-tempered head of one of the country's biggest gambling companies, he has built a string of hugely successful casinos in Las Vegas. He recently beat Donald Trump in a court battle over an access road that will pave the way for his triumphant return to the Atlantic City waterfront. And he is building the biggest casino on Mississippi's Gulf Coast.
He has also been flexing his muscles lately around Lake Tahoe, the popular gambling center and recreation area straddling the California-Nevada border, 350 miles northwest of his home base of Las Vegas.
But while Tahoe seems like a natural setting for yet another of his gargantuan gambling palaces, Mr. Wynn's tough talk at the planning board meeting had nothing to do with winning a building permit.
To the contrary, Mr. Wynn is on the board. What he was so emphatic about was water, specifically the once-pristine waters of the 250-square-mile lake that anchors the region. And the "train" he was so ready to throw his body in front of is the armada of Jet Skis and other so-called personal watercraft that he says are dumping large amounts of unburned fuel in those waters, contributing to the alarming pace at which the lake is losing its celebrated clarity. Ten days ago, he got his way, when the board voted to ban the machines from the lake starting in two years.
Steve Wynn, master developer of mega-casinos, meet Steve Wynn, hard-core environmentalist.
The man who runs a casino that sports a "live" volcano out front and another that pits pirates against the British Navy in lifesize ships every other hour says he is now worried about the excesses of development. And not just in Tahoe, where he owns a sprawling vacation home next door to Michael Milken's and serves as Nevada's at-large representative on the planning agency's 15-member governing board.
He has also spread the message to Las Vegas, a symbol to many of American overbuilding in full flower and a city that Mr. Wynn developed as much as anyone.
"It's time for us to slow down and think about where we're going," Mr. Wynn told a gathering of business executives and civic leaders there earlier this year. The breakneck pace of development that has made Las Vegas the fastest-growing city in the country for more than a decade is leading to "quality problems," he said.
Mr. Wynn the environmentalist is even about to take the national stage, when President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore visit Tahoe on July 26 and 27 for a meeting on how business and regulators can cooperate to protect the environment. Mr. Wynn, seen by some as an effective symbol of such cooperation, is expected to play a "substantial role" at the conference, said Jim Baetge, executive director of the Tahoe planning agency.
All of this has plenty of interested players -- environmentalists, casino competitors and gambling industry experts, not to mention Tahoe and Las Vegas residents -- putting down bets about what is going on.
Some question how a developer as dedicated as Mr. Wynn could suddenly reveal a deep green streak. They wonder whether his apparent commitment to the environment camouflages a more complicated agenda.
The possibilities are as varied as Mr. Wynn's interests. Did he join the board to protect his multimillion-dollar investment in a vacation paradise, and to do the same for Mr. Milken, a friend who helped finance his meteoric rise in the casino industry? Is he trying to win points with the Government at a time when a new Federal commission is starting hearings on the social and economic effects of the spread of legalized gambling? Is he simply trying to keep Tahoe at bay -- and put Las Vegas on hold -- now that his most expensive casino, the $1.4 billion Bellagio, is rising on the Vegas Strip, making him the biggest boy by far on the block?
"For him to say we should control growth is not that sincere when you consider that his business not only stems from all this growth but creates part of it," said Rick Nielsen, director of Citizen Alert, an environmental group that has fought growth in Las Vegas for years. "If he's sincere about protecting national treasures and being an environmentalist, he doesn't have to go all the way to Lake Tahoe to get involved. We've got Lake Mead, which is only 20 miles from Las Vegas."
John Smith, a columnist for The Las Vegas Review-Journal and the author of "Running Scared: The Life and Treacherous Times of Casino King Steve Wynn" (Barricade Books, 1995), is another skeptic. Mr. Wynn became involved in Tahoe "initially to protect his investment," Mr. Smith speculated. "I'm sure he has feelings about the environment. But Steve's world is about power and control. He won't do anything he can't control."
Others who know him or have followed his career disagree. This is a sincere new side to a complicated man, they say. The son of a compulsive gambler who died in debt, Mr. Wynn has spent his life fulfilling his father's dream of building a casino empire. Now that he is 55, these people say, he wants to be remembered for more than just casinos.
"A lot of people say, 'He's got his empire; why in the world would he want to be on this board?' " said Peter Neumann, a Reno lawyer who is also on the planning agency panel. "Whatever his motivation, he has really taken a personal interest. I think he thinks of Tahoe as his home. And I think he genuinely feels the lake is a treasure, as we all do."
The clock is ticking for Mr. Wynn in another way. He may go blind in not too many years, a likely outcome of the degenerative eye disease that surfaced when he was 29. The inherited, incurable disease, retinitis pigmentosa, destroys nerves in the retina.
Mr. Wynn says he is missing the lower half of his field of vision when looking at objects up close, along with some peripheral vision, but that he is otherwise fine and not getting worse. His ophthalmologist, Dr. Alan S. Crandall, is making no promises, however. "He's down to tunnel vision," Dr. Crandall said. "If he lives long enough, he probably will go blind."
And already, he sometimes seems to move as a sleepwalker does, feeling for walls with his hands and feet. On the way back to the March board meeting from lunch, Mr. Wynn walked face first into a post. He shook off the blow like a boxer and plodded on, showing no sign of pain.
Whatever is making Steve Wynn run, some environmentalists are glad to have a businessman of his power on their side. After all, he is a wily operator who knows how to make use of laws and government agencies to get what he wants in the gambling world. Bringing those skills to the defense of a lake's water quality should produce big dividends, some say.
They point to the rancorous, 12-hour meeting late last month at which the planning board backed his campaign against Jet Skis and similar machines, waterborne cousins of the motorcycle that are almost as fast and certainly just as loud as their wheeled relatives. The board voted 10 to 4 to ban all such machines, whose two-cycle engines run on a mix of gasoline and oil, from the lake beginning June 1, 1999. Mr. Wynn led the fight for the ban, arguing that the engines discharge hundreds of thousands of gallons of unburned fuel into the lake each year. The ban, which is expected to be appealed by manufacturers and rental shops, is far tougher than the position taken by the Environmental Protection Agency, which recently ordered makers of personal watercraft to begin equipping them with more efficient engines over the next decade.
Mr. Wynn also marshaled support last fall for a $20 million state bond issue for erosion-control projects on the Nevada side of the lake. Erosion, another byproduct of development, sends soil runoff into the lake, nourishing algae that further cloud the water.
"He has done a lot to focus additional attention on Tahoe," said Rochelle Nason, director of the League to Save Lake Tahoe, a nonprofit group. "He was very helpful in getting that bond issue on the ballot in the Nevada legislature. We've disagreed with him on a few issues, but on the whole our impression has been good."
 
Jumping Into a Lake's Future
For his part, Mr. Wynn says there is a simple, and innocent, explanation for his decision to serve on the board.
Whenever he went to a party, he heard people complaining about the agency, he said in a recent interview. "Environmentalists didn't like it. Developers didn't like it. Everybody talks about the environment, but very rarely do you have a chance to do anything about it. I thought it would be an interesting exercise, kind of like going to graduate school. I thought it was going to be a noncontroversial, low-keyed, rather technical activity. It was as far away from what I do for a living as you could get. And that suited me to a T."
Mr. Wynn joined the board two years ago. Established in 1968 by Congress and the states of California and Nevada, the planning agency is charged with overseeing development around the lake. The President names one nonvoting member, while California and Nevada each get seven voting members, all appointed by local and state governments except for Nevada's one at-large seat. That seat is filled by a vote of the other Nevada appointees. Mr. Wynn was one of eight or nine applicants for the unpaid position, and while he had no formal background in environmental protection or in regional planning, several members who voted for him say they were impressed by his energy and intelligence.
They were also certainly aware that Mr. Wynn is a powerful force in Nevada politics and a significant presence on the national scene. A major donor to both Republicans and Democrats, he threw a party at his private golf course in Las Vegas that raised a half-million dollars for Bob Dole's Presidential campaign. Mr. Wynn has also played golf with Bill Clinton.
Mr. Wynn came to the Tahoe area in 1992, building a getaway home in the lakeside enclave of Incline Village, or what locals call "Income Village." It is a "nice, roomy house," he said, "with three bedrooms, a gym and a media room, and a little guest house with two bedrooms, on five acres."
"It's not a mansion," he added, "but it is 11,000 square feet."
For a time, Mr. Wynn kept a fleet of five of the noisy watercraft at his dock, jumping waves in front of his estate with the likes of former President George Bush.
But Mr. Wynn soon learned that there was trouble in his newfound paradise. Lake Tahoe, set more than a mile high in the Sierra Nevada, is surrounded by granite peaks draped with dark green pine forest. But the lake's famous clarity is rapidly declining. The first scientist to measure the clarity in 1873 could see a dinner plate 108 feet down. A similar plate is visible only to 70 feet today and the clarity is deteriorating at the rate of a foot and a half a year, according to the regional planning agency.
Soil runoff is a major villain. After reading a magazine article about the banning of personal watercraft from a Swiss lake, Mr. Wynn decided that the zippy little machines were another. He sold off his fleet (though he kept a large powerboat, which uses a less-polluting four-cycle engine) and made a lakewide ban his mission.
That raised the hackles of some local residents, who quickly came to regard him as a high-profile interloper who was meddling with their way of life.
"Lake Tahoe is being taken over by fat cats like Steve Wynn," wrote Jeff Ackerman, publisher and editor of The Nevada Appeal, the daily newspaper in Carson City, the state capital. "The billionaires are running the millionaires out of Tahoe. And they're using Tahoe's clarity as a tool to rid themselves of the riffraff who can't afford a giant lake cruiser that Wynn and his buddies use to cruise what is becoming their own private paradise."
Mr. Wynn dismissed the attacks as "sound and fury signifying nothing." In an interview before the board vote, he said: "The agency is being put to the test on this issue. If it can't deal with something as black and white as that, then it's useless."
In this practical vein, he has been pushing to get the agency to cut back on red tape and become more "user friendly" to businesses and homeowners. The goal is to protect the environment, he said, not to "waste time on minutiae and irrelevant things."
"It's not a major issue whether someone adds a deck or a back porch to their house," he added. "It should not be a problem for a businessman to add a bathroom or other things to his business. You shouldn't need three consultants and an army of lawyers to increase the size of your building by 10 percent. Those things should be perfunctory."
Only then, he argues, will the agency attract the kind of popular support that it needs to succeed at its fundamental mission of protecting the lake.
Now, with the victory against Jet Skis and the like under his belt, the environmental conference is next.
What will Mr. Wynn tell the President when he comes to Lake Tahoe? "Lake Tahoe is worth saving," said Mr. Wynn, and it's going to take "a lot of capital."

'Always a Mountain Person'
Mr. Wynn gets up to Lake Tahoe on a company jet about once a month for board meetings, sometimes making additional trips to ski (which he says he can handle just fine, despite his vision problems) or to spend time on the lake.
He and his wife, Elaine, who serves on the board of Mirage Resorts, have another vacation place, a huge spread in Sun Valley, Idaho. Their daughters -- Gillian, 28, who works for Mirage as a designer of a water laser show, and Kevyn, 31, a marketer at Mirage -- are fanatically in love with Sun Valley, Mr. Wynn said.
"Tahoe is my thing," he explained. "I was brought up in the mountains in a place very much like Tahoe on a reduced scale, with a pine forest surrounding a lake. Once you're a mountain person, you're always a mountain person."
Mr. Wynn, who grew up in Utica, N.Y., spent his early summers at Old Forge in the Adirondacks. He named his Lake Tahoe home Old Forge out of "nostalgia for my childhood," he said.
It was a special childhood, marked by unusual defining moments. Mr. Wynn's father, who was born Michael Weinberg and later changed his last name, ran bingo parlors on the East Coast. While trying to open a bingo hall in Las Vegas, he showed his son, then 11, around the city. The father was often in debt but Steve had everything he wanted. He went to prep school before going to the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a bachelor's degree in English.
When his father died in 1963, while undergoing open heart surgery at the age of 46, he left behind tens of thousands of dollars in gambling debts. Mr. Wynn and his wife, who also grew up in a family headed by a compulsive gambler, took over the bingo business. They were both 21. He called the numbers and she counted the money. It took years to pay off the I.O.U.'s.
In 1967, Steve Wynn moved his family to Las Vegas to redeem his father's dream. He bought a 3 percent stake in the Frontier Hotel casino and became the slot manager. When investigators discovered that the hotel was owned by Detroit mobsters, Mr. Wynn sold his shares, denying any previous knowledge of the underworld link.
He then became friends with E. Parry Thomas, the founder and owner of the Valley Bank, which financed much of the Las Vegas casino industry's expansion in the 1960's and 70's and later merged with the Bank of America. In 1972, Mr. Thomas helped arrange a real estate deal in which Mr. Wynn bought a lot from Howard Hughes for $1.1 million and then sold it to Caesars Palace, next door, for $2.25 million.
Mr. Wynn used the profit to acquire a 5 percent interest in the Golden Nugget, then a rundown casino in the Glitter Gulch section of downtown Las Vegas. He eventually took control, becoming at 31 the youngest person ever to run a casino in Nevada.
 
Palace After Palace
Most casinos in those days were dimly lit affairs that exuded an illicit backroom feeling. Mr. Wynn brought in the sunlight. He transformed the "gambling joint," as he called it, into a sparkling palace for high rollers, directly across from the spot on Glitter Gulch where his father had failed to open a bingo parlor.
Unlike his father, Mr. Wynn does not gamble, viewing that part of his family history as a cautionary tale. "If you want to make money in a casino, own one," he has been quoted as saying. Like other major casino operators, Mr. Wynn sponsors programs to help compulsive gamblers. At the same time, though, he says most people enjoy gambling and know how to set their own limits, and he sees nothing wrong with bringing them in by the thousands to the glitzy showcases that have made his name.
In 1980, Mr. Wynn built the Golden Nugget in Atlantic City, using the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas as collateral on a raft of junk bonds floated by Mr. Milken. It was one of the first new casinos to bring Las Vegas glitter to the Boardwalk. He sold the operation to the Bally Corporation in 1987 for $440 million. That helped Bally fight off a takeover bid from Donald Trump (so that Bally owned too many casinos for Mr. Trump to acquire under New Jersey rules) while making a profit for Mr. Wynn of $250 million. He used the proceeds, along with junk bonds from Mr. Milken, to begin building a chain of ever more fabulous casinos on the Strip in Las Vegas.
The Mirage, with its fiery volcano, opened in 1989. Treasure Island, complete with pirates, opened next door in 1993. Down the road, the Bellagio is now taking shape on the site of the old Dunes, which Mr. Wynn blew up to make way for the new palace.
The gambling business has paid off handsomely for both Mr. Wynn and Mirage Resorts. The company's gross revenues totaled $1.37 billion in 1996, with profits of $206 million. The return to investors has averaged 22 percent a year for the last decade -- one reason Fortune magazine sees Mirage as one of the most admired companies in America, though the stock lately has been lackluster. It closed on Thursday at $24.875, still depressed from the $29.625 it reached a year ago.
Mr. Wynn's annual salary and bonus total about $4 million. His 15 percent stake in Mirage Resorts is now worth more than $500 million.
 
Seeing Past a Disease
Although the sparkle in his eyes has been dimmed by retinitis pigmentosa, Mr. Wynn's smile is still as dazzling as the well-lit facades of his casinos.
In 1993, he donated $1 million to the John Moran Eye Center at the University of Utah to create the Michael M. Wynn Center for Inherited Retinal Diseases, named for his father. He hopes a cure will be found, but he does not want to be defined by his disease.
"My handicap is an inconvenience," he said. "I can't see my own hand underneath my nose. And I can't see if you stick your hand out to shake with me, but my central vision is perfect. So the minute you're 8 or 10 feet from me I see everything. Honestly, I skied 39 days last year," albeit on wide-open runs with a guide.
And although many who know him well, including his mother, have said that he became more driven and short-tempered after the disease was diagnosed, Mr. Wynn says his basic character has not changed.
"Everybody always tries to do an interpretation of my attitude in business, my drive or my ambition with the fact that my vision diminishes, as if I have a limited amount of time, the lights are going out, the sun is dimming," he said. "It is true that having R.P. affects my behavior. I don't drive. I can't go in the dark and behave freely. I need help. I wear reading glasses like any 55-year-old man. But it's O.K."
As if to put to rest any concern about his vision, Mr. Wynn paused to look out at Lake Tahoe during a break at a recent agency meeting and commented on the "gumption" of a windsurfer who was wearing a short-sleeved wet suit on the cold choppy waters.
 
What Kind of Mission?
Asked whether he had any thoughts of pursuing any other public office, Mr. Wynn said, "I have thoughts and the answer is I won't. I'm not cut out for it."
Still, Mr. Wynn seemed relaxed at the agency meeting, where he bantered easily with fellow board members.
"You've got 15 board members and Steve's one of those members, and that's a change from his business and the way he operates normally," said Mr. Baetge, the agency's staff director. "You can't just come in and say, 'I'm in charge here.' You're not. He's got a strong personality in terms of making an argument and standing by it and stressing to the public why we do something. But I've found him fairly easy to work with."
Mr. Wynn left the recent meeting early to go to Las Vegas for the opening of the Secret Garden at the Mirage, a habitat for the rare tigers used in shows by the house entertainers, Siegfried and Roy. He also had to prepare for Mirage Resorts' annual meeting.
The next day, Mr. Wynn told stockholders that the era of rapid expansion in the gambling industry was slowing. He said that Mirage Resorts might consider expanding through acquisitions, but that too many gaming companies were saddled with aging buildings in second-rate locations. In the meantime, the stockholders could look forward to the opening in September 1998 of the Bellagio and, three months later, the Beau Rivage casino in Biloxi, Miss., on the Gulf Coast. Construction has not yet begun in Atlantic City, where Mr. Wynn plans to build a casino in the Marina section.
In his remarks, he echoed his concerns expressed earlier this year that Las Vegas suffered from "quality problems," particularly traffic congestion and air pollution.
The population of the Las Vegas metropolitan area is 1 million, and it is projected to reach 1.6 million in 10 years. "Any given area can only take so many people," he said. "I'm not sure what that number is. But if the air's not clean and you can't move in the streets, it seems like you're getting there. So what do you do about it?"
His answer is to learn something from the Lake Tahoe experience. "It takes consensus," he said. "And the only hope is to educate the public."
Skeptics say Mr. Wynn has a lot of moxie even to pose the question, given his own role in the city's growth. "If he's serious about controlling growth, he could be doing a lot more than he is," said Mr. Nielsen, of Citizen Alert. "It's a lot of hot air."
But others say he may be just the right person to ring the alarm. "When someone of his stature says things, people in Las Vegas tend to listen," said Mike Sloan, vice president of Circus Circus Enterprises, a competitor that jointly owns the Monte Carlo casino in Las Vegas with Mirage. "I don't think he's worried about competition. I think it is a quality-of-life issue."
Jeff Van Ee, a longtime Las Vegas environmental activist who sits on the local clean-air advisory board, offers some qualified support. "I find myself seemingly more in concert with him than I expected," Mr. Van Ee said. "I think he's changing. People are skeptical of his motives. As an environmentalist, looking at Steve Wynn and his impact on this community, I view him as a work in progress."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FLATBUSH -- UPDATE;
Market Is Off the Fast Track

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE 

 BODY:
Bowing to pressure from the community board and a ruling from the city's Corporation Counsel, Councilwoman Una Clarke and officials from the city's Department of Business Services last week backed away from a fast construction schedule for a prefabricated vendor's marketplace in Flatbush.
Members of Community Board 14 said that by blocking the plan they had foiled a potentially illegal and undemocratic back-room deal. But Ms. Clarke and Earl Andrews Jr., Commissioner of the Department of Business Services, said their intent had been misunderstood. 
 At the Councilwoman's urging, the business services department and the Economic Development Corporation planned to employ a rarely used procedure known as "emergency declaration" in the construction of a vendor's facility proposed for a city-owned parking lot at Flatbush and Caton Avenues. By using the "emergency declaration," the agencies would have been able to avoid a competitive bidding process and a Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, or Ulurp, which includes community board hearings.
Alvin Berk, chairman of Community Board 14, said the board had only recently learned of the $400,000 project. The board argued that the project had to go through Ulurp. After reviewing the project, the Corporation Counsel determined that because capital funds were being used, the land use review was required. Mr. Berk said the board was only trying to make the Department of Business Services follow the rules.
"This is a really solid argument for working within the system of the community boards," Mr. Berk said, "rather than trying to ram things through and bypass public debate and public discussion."
Ms. Clarke, who obtained $400,000 in city capital money for the project, denied any wrongdoing. She said she thought a Ulurp review was not required for the vendors' market because it was not a permanent structure and was being built by a city agency on a city-owned lot.
Mr. Andrews, the business services commissioner, said the emergency declaration was only an attempt to move the project along quickly.
"The word 'emergency' is not what the declaration was about," Mr. Andrews said. "It was just a mechanism to get it through."
At a June 30 meeting, the community board agreed that a pilot program that allows vendors to use 18 of the 93 spaces in the lot as an open-air market should continue until a final decision has been made.
But about 30 vendors who attended the meeting in support of the project expressed frustration at the delay.
"We're not going to have it for December," said Enid King, the president of the vendors' group. "I'm so disappointed. I don't know what we're going to do." DAVID ROHDE

HEADLINE: Juarez, Mexico: On the Border, Between Extremes

BYLINE: By TOM KUNTZ 

 BODY:
CIUDAD JUAREZ, a city of well over a million people just across the Rio Grande from El Paso, Texas, is a dynamic point along the membrane between the world of the desperately striving in Mexico and that of the relatively prosperous in the United States.
The photographs on this page capture some of the border's grit, hustle and run-of-the-mill horrors: Mongrel dogs prowl beneath freshly hung women's stockings in the midday sun. The body of an electrocuted man sizzles atop a power line he had illegally tried to tap. And a slain young woman lies partly buried in the sand -- one of those routinely savaged in a city that draws people from afar to jobs in its many maquiladoras, the foreign-owned border factories, or to its attendant professions, like prostitution. 
 These pictures are among thousands taken since 1993 by a group of Juarez photographers who set out to document the vibrant and violent life of their town. The work of the 11 photographers (several of whom are employed by the city's main paper, Diario de Juarez) is being published in a forthcoming book, "Juarez -- The Laboratory of Our Future" (Aperture).
Although the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement was supposed to bring economic prosperity to Mexico, some people see the grim Juarez photographs as evidence of the exploitive nature of Nafta. But Jaime Bailleres, one of the photographers, noted that this growing city next to the world's most powerful economy presented plenty of troubling tableaux long before the advent of free trade.
The photo project is noteworthy, he said, because it was produced locally, by people who were working with the same handicaps and under the same hazardous conditions that confront all Juarez residents. The photographers, using ancient Pentax cameras, typically earned $50 to $80 a week, and risked their lives, alienating drug traffickers, gangs and the Mexican authorities. "It's like working in Bosnia," Mr. Bailleres said. TOM KUNTZ

Crime Falls, but Not on TV

BYLINE: By LAWRIE MIFFLIN 

 BODY:
CRIME reporting is such a staple of local television news coverage that is has acquired its own cliche: "If it bleeds, it leads." Whatever else might have happened, if someone is murdered, that story will lead the day's newscast.
So the continuing plunge in the nation's crime rates -- last week, New York City reported that homicides in the first half of this year were down about 30 percent from the same period in 1996 -- raises a question for television news directors: Are they now putting fewer crime stories on screen, too? 
 The answer seems to be no.
"The fact that percentages are down doesn't affect our coverage," said Bill Carey, news director at Channel 2 in New York, CBS's flagship station. "The communities who suffered and the families who suffered the crimes still want to know about them."
The real-estate salesman who was stabbed to death and dumped in a pond in Central Park, allegedly by a teen-age girl and boy; the dedicated teacher and son of Time Warner's chief executive who was slain, the police say, by a former student; the 7-year-old girl abducted on her way to school in Chinatown -- these murders would have been news no matter what.
 
Breaking the Habit
 But it isn't the dramatic cases that dominate crime coverage on local TV, said Joseph Angotti, a former senior vice president of NBC News who is now a professor of communications at the University of Miami, and who directed a study this year of the content of local news programs in eight cities. "Since journalism began, people have been infatuated with stories of big crimes, big trials. What's driving television news today is the ordinary, continuous kind of crime stories. It's a habit they've gotten into and it's difficult to break."
Mr. Angotti and his colleagues found that crime and criminal justice stories took up 29 percent of the average early-evening newscast in eight cities studied. Other studies in the last decade have found a similar proportion -- around one-third of the average local newscast.
"Most of that crime coverage is not editorially driven, it's economically driven," Mr. Angotti added. "It's the easiest, cheapest, laziest news to cover, because all they do is listen to the police radio, react to it, send out a mobile camera unit, spend an hour or two covering it and put it on the air."
Naturally, not all news directors agree. Many believe crime news matters to viewers. And some say their coverage has shifted as crime patterns have changed. Mr. Carey at Channel 2 says the ebbing of the city's crack-cocaine problem has changed the nature of crime reporting.
"When the drug epidemic was worse, in the late '80's here in the city, the violence was much worse and the ways people killed people were worse," he said. He mentioned schoolyard shootings, drug users killing innocent people for money and, in particular, the story of a cocaine-using woman who held her crying toddler over flames on the stove, giving the child such severe burns that he later died.
But to the average citizen, random crime is scarier than the drug-related crime that occurs most often in the poorest neighborhoods. The four local news directors interviewed said that even as they continue to put crime stories on the air, their coverage has changed to reflect the general belief that the city is safer.
 
The Giuliani Factor
 Publicity helps build that belief, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his supporters have repeatedly publicized the statistics.
"Giuliani is making that his mantra, so if we're covering the Mayor of the City of New York, it's hard not to hear it," said Marie Hickey, the news director at Channel 5, the Fox Broadcasting station. "And of course people applaud the fact that crime is down. We did a piece on that in early June, and found that people do believe it's down and do feel the city is safer."
Paula Walker, the news director at Channel 4, NBC's New York station, said recently that she has been trying to change the mindset in her newsroom. "When I challenge our people on beat checks," she said, referring to the daily phone calls made to check for news, "it's to ask, 'Why are we calling the cops? Why don't we call the schools? Why don't we call the hospitals?' Because if you're going to call around and find out whether anything's going on today and the only places you call are the police stations, what diet will you present but a diet of crime?"
That has been the diet presented by most local television station newscasts, however, especially in cities. Mr. Angotti said it may change -- again because of economics. "In at least three of the cities in our study," he said, "we found that the stations that were using the least amount of crime news were getting the highest ratings. So the theory that if you give people lots of blood-and-guts, that's what they'll watch is not necessarily true."
As Channel 4's Ms. Walker pointed out, in a big city there will always be plenty of crime. It is each station's choice how much of it is worth putting on the air -- and what to keep off as a result.
"Crime is always devastating to the victims, and I don't want to minimize that," she said. "But we have only a finite amount of time to present our news agenda. And most people in our tri-state area do not walk around every day expecting to be murdered."

HEADLINE: Tax Code;
The Secret Language Of Social Engineering

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
NAME a social or economic problem. Maybe the tax code can fix it.
Think families these days are hard pressed? Give them a $500-per-child credit. 
 Want more people to attend at least two years of college? Create a credit to subsidize some of the cost.
Determined to address the nation's low savings rate? Expand the Individual Retirement Account to provide more tax incentives for long-term savings.
Eager to encourage entrepreneurs? Provide special breaks for investments in small businesses.
Unlike the two most recent big tax-cutting bills, in 1981 and 1986, the tax legislation now working its way through Washington does not include reductions in income tax rates. Although both parties have been proudly proclaiming the windfall they intend to bestow on voters, the $85 billion that Congress and the Administration have allocated for tax cuts over the next five years would finance only a tiny drop in income-tax rates.
So to get maximum bang for the buck, the leaders of both parties are instead concentrating the available money on a handful of other taxes and tax breaks. All of them appeal to at least one powerful constituency -- this year's favorites range from the religious right to Wall Street -- and all seek to support certain types of behavior or social goals.
Far from the ideal of a tax code designed solely to raise the revenue needed to finance the workings of Government, this year's legislation is just the latest evidence of how changes in the code frequently come down to dispensing favors under the guise of social and economic policy. Even modest attempts to focus the code more on revenue raising and less on distinguishing between classes of activity and income -- like the 1986 tax act -- are soon overwhelmed by the political imperative to respond to powerful constituencies who want better treatment.
"I view the tax code as a very poor place to do social engineering," said Iris J. Lav, the associate director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group in Washington, echoing what most conservative economists would say. "There's very scant evidence that the tax code has ever changed people's behavior. It's certainly a question of who has the loudest voice on tax policy."
Certainly, tax policy plays only a limited role in the economic decisions that most people make. People choose to invest or buy a home or send their children to college for all kinds of reasons unrelated to a line on their form 1040. But even where the tax code provides a direct incentive, its impact is unclear.
 
Saving, More or Less
 Both the House and the Senate bills propose sweeping expansions of the Individual Retirement Account, which is popular with banks, investment firms and middle and upper-income taxpayers who have money to save. Although some economists argue otherwise, Ms. Lav cited studies concluding that I.R.A.'s have done little or nothing to increase the savings rate, in part because decisions about saving may be more complex than they appear. Since many savers set specific goals, an increase in the after-tax yield that the I.R.A. advantage creates lets them save less than they would otherwise to reach the same goal -- not exactly what proponents of savings incentives have in mind.
But Ms. Lav acknowledged her own strong support on both economic or social grounds for programs like the earned income tax credit, which reduces taxes for low-income workers to encourage them to work rather than to go on welfare. So what seems unwarranted social engineering or interest-group pandering by one ideological camp is often seen as a worthy cause -- and a justified exception -- by the other.
Steve Forbes, who ran for the Republican Presidential nomination last year on a platform of replacing the current tax system with a single flat rate, issued a memo last week characterizing the emerging tax plan, although largely the work of Republicans, as "Big Brother Clinton knows best."
 
The Pathetic Reward
 "If your family does exactly what he wants you to do, when he wants you to do it, where he wants you to do it," Mr. Forbes said, "then you might get a pathetically small little break on your Federal taxes."
But by Mr. Forbes's standard few Congressional Republicans could claim to be pure. Speaker Newt Gingrich pushed into the House tax bill detailed provisions designed to attract investment, jobs and new residents to the District of Columbia. Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee rails against the complexities and inequities of the tax code, still champions narrow provisions, including a permanent extension of a tax credit to encourage pharmaceutical companies to do research on treatments for obscure diseases. And most Republicans have wholeheartedly embraced the religious right's argument that the proposed child credit will strengthen families, even while admitting that the credit will do nothing to strengthen the economy.
There is another reason politicians choose the tax code to pursue policy objectives. In this age of fiscal austerity, new spending programs are a tough sell in Congress. But if the same initiatives are dressed up as tax cuts they look much more palatable.
"One looks like smaller government," said C. Eugene Steuerle, a tax expert at the Urban Institute in Washington. "One looks like bigger government. In fact, they both do exactly the same thing."
 
Mortarboard Credit
 Take President Clinton's effort to encourage more high school students to go on to college. He has already won additional financing for Federal tuition grants for low-income students, and although he no doubt could have designed a spending program to make college more affordable for many middle-class students as well, he would have got little support in the Republican Congress.
As a $35 billion tax cut, however, Mr. Clinton's proposal to give credits of up to $1,500 for the first two years of college is almost certain to be enacted at least partially. Never mind that analysts doubt that the credit will inspire students who would otherwise be content with a high school diploma to enroll in college. Indeed, some analysts assert that the plan's main effect would be to increase tuition inflation.
Yet for all the uncertainty about what effects on behavior the tax bill will have, there is one outcome that is beyond doubt: In its efforts to make the tax code do more things for more people, Washington is again putting aside its promises of simplification and making the system more complex.

HEADLINE: No Great Shakes;
A Ritual Loses Its Grip

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
HANDSHAKES are part of history's greatest hits: Arafat and Rabin at the White House in 1993; Nixon thrusting out his hand to Zhou Enlai in Beijing in 1972. They are a big reason the airline industry does not feel threatened by the rise of videoconferencing: "You can't fax a handshake" is a popular saying at many companies.
And as American-style capitalism sweeps through distant countries, more people are shaking hands, according to Roger E. Axtell, editor of a series of "Do's and Taboos" books about body language around the world. In the United States, he added, even more women are joining in the ritual. 
 But think again before you reach out and glad-hand. The handshake, as natural an act as walking upright, is being shaken itself, devalued as a symbol of trustworthiness and denounced as a health threat at the same time that technology holds the promise of upgrading it for new uses.
By most accounts, handshakes started as a way to show that neither person was holding a weapon. Desmond Morris, the anthropologist, calls the handshake a "tie-sign" because of the bond it creates. Through the centuries, the growing use of the handshake reflected greater equality among individuals, and it was used to seal agreements. The handshake became a friendly greeting, a sign of respect, a bet that new faces would be remembered.
But now, if you want to show someone respect, perhaps you should consider not shaking hands. That was the lesson Alonzo Mourning, the star center for the Miami Heat, tried to draw in May from the fifth game of the Eastern Conference finals of the National Basketball Association, when Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls refused to shake his outstretched hand.
 
Respectfully Declined
 After the game, with the Heat eliminated, Mr. Mourning said Mr. Jordan's reaction flattered him. "It makes me think we got their respect," he said. (Athletic-shoe makers are no doubt fighting over rights to a new marketing slogan: "No Handshakes.")
Others interpreted Mr. Jordan's refusal more traditionally. The Bulls had criticized Mr. Mourning for dirty play throughout the playoffs.
The handshake after a game has long been a tradition in youth leagues, but it no longer moves kids to lay down grudges and hard feelings. Coaches say players often spit in their hands before congratulating opponents. In January, a fight broke out in a handshake line after a junior hockey game in Rhode Island.
At the French Open this year, Thomas Muster was so incensed by the antics of Jeff Tarango across the tennis court that he broke with tradition and refused to shake Mr. Tarango's outstretched hand after beating him.
Even the "golden handshake" appears to be suffering from deflation. In British Columbia, Canada, the provincial government is considering a rule to limit lump-sum severance payments to 24 months' pay for executives ousted from government-run companies and agencies. A former president of a government-run utility, for example, was found to be taking home $25,000 a month three years after he left.
Moreover, handshakes can be bad for your health. The Massachusetts Medical Society recently started an advertising campaign that encourages people to wash their hands more often, pointing out in one radio spot that "any friendly handshake can carry many illnesses."
Robert E. Swindle, a retired business professor in Peoria, Ariz., wants to abolish handshaking altogether. After all, now that most people don't carry concealed weapons in their hands, the ritual has lost its usefulness, he said. Mr. Swindle is also concerned about how quickly germs spread through handshakes, particularly in settings like doctor's offices and hospitals.
"I saw a cardiologist recently, and he shook hands with me three times," he said. When Mr. Swindle does not want to shake hands, he smooths out an uncomfortable moment by saying that he cannot because of a finger he fractured playing basketball.
But if Mr. Swindle got his way, something would clearly be lost in society. Allen Konopacki, who runs a sales training company in Chicago called the Incomm Center, tried an experiment last year to better understand the handshake effect. He and a group of students left a quarter in a public phone, and after strangers used the phone and took the coin, a student walked up to ask if they had seen the quarter. Of the roughly 75 people he tried this on, well over half lied, saying that they had not seen the 25 cents that they had pocketed.
Mr. Konopacki and his students then tried the experiment with 75 more strangers, but this time the student greeted the person with a quick handshake and introduction. Only 14 of the 75 lied.
"A handshake," Mr. Konopacki said, "creates a higher level of trust, a degree of intimacy, within a matter of seconds."
 
Hanging On
 Politicians who grab every hand they can on the campaign trail clearly believe this to be true. But the handshake is also a way for the masses to get some quality face time. When Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada was glad-handing in May at a campaign rally in Edmonton, Alberta, one man refused to let go as he yelled in Mr. Chretien's face about his decision to call an election at a time when flooding had caused a crisis in the West.
I.B.M. is perhaps the most ambitious of the lot in trying to find new uses for the handshake. Big Blue created a small stir at the annual consumer electronics trade show in January with a prototype of its Personal Area Network, or PAN.
Though it won't be available for a while, the company says it has the technology to transmit data -- like a digitized business card -- between two people with just a handshake. The PAN device, about the size of a thick credit card so it can be carried in a pocket, creates a low-power external electronic field using the natural salinity of the human body that can transmit data to, and receive data from, someone else with a PAN device. The stored information can be viewed later with a computer.
Some sociologists say the apparent drop in the traditional value of a handshake reflects a general decline of loyalty in American society to institutions like marriage and between employers and their workers.
But Alan Wolfe, a sociologist at Boston University, disagreed. He said that while the handshake has been devalued by those in the media spotlight, the gesture carries just as much weight as it always has among most people because so many face-to-face encounters have been replaced by phones, faxes and E-mail.
"The handshake is really reserved for special moments," he said.
And you never know when such moments might arise. In January, a small group of men were moved to shake the hands of staff members in a bank in central Italy. It was, after all, a special time for everyone involved. The men were about to leave, having just finished robbing the bank.

HEADLINE: From Dapper Don to Dirty Chin

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
IT has come to this. In a city accustomed to the very best in mob trials and to state-of-the-art gangland kingpins, the people must make do with Vincent Gigante, otherwise known as Chin.
It's a sorry spectacle for connoisseurs of crime. In a Brooklyn courtroom, the man painted by Federal prosecutors as the head of the Genovese crime family looks as though he could not find his way down the aisle of a Genovese drug store. The mob overlord who, according to prosecutors, ran an empire and ordered the killings of six gangland rivals, sits in court day after day staring vacantly, moving his lips in a silent, one-way conversation and occasionally dozing off. 
 Mr. Gigante may or may not be guilty of the multitude of crimes with which he has been charged, but he is certainly guilty of letting standards slip.
The double-breasted suits, bright ties and razor-sharp collars of a bygone age have given way to pajamas and a bathrobe, Chin's familiar strolling attire in his Greenwich Village neighborhood. When the judge ordered Mr. Gigante, wearing an open sport shirt over a dirty T-shirt, to make a better appearance in court, his lawyer countered that Mr. Gigante did not own a suit.
And the nickname is not good. It speaks volumes about the failing culture of organized crime that "Chin" is probably just short for Vincenzo. Americans like their gangsters gaudy and grand. Mr. Gigante does not seem prepared to step into the role.
John Gotti performed the role magnificently, but he's beginning to look like the flashy finale in a show that's been running too long. "John Gotti was exceptional," said Peter Maas, the author of "Underboss: Sammy the Bull Gravano's Story of Life in the Mafia." "The media loved him, and he loved the media. He looked like what America wanted a gangster to look like."
Al Capone set the standard. A snappy dresser, he held sway over Chicago at a time when criminals, like Hollywood stars, fully understood their obligations to the public. He played to a much broader audience than his own heavily muscled constituency. He dealt death to his enemies but also set up soup kitchens for the unemployed. And his nickname, Scarface, couldn't be beat.
The film industry jumped in quickly, putting a high gloss on the image of the gangster. It hit paydirt with "Little Caesar," in which Edward G. Robinson laid down the basic rules for proper mob-boss demeanor. He was cocky, cruel and vain. In one magnificent leap, Robinson's Rico distanced himself from the mongrel pack of two-time hoods, sadists and bootleg barons that had defined the criminal upper class in Hollywood films until then. "He was rough around the edges, but he had charisma, he was commanding," said Bruce Goldstein, the repertory programmer at the Film Forum. "The Paul Muni character in 'Scarface' was just a thug."
The capo di tutti capi, of course, was Marlon Brando in "The Godfather," a kind of industrial training film for would-be mob bosses. Well before Lee Iacocca, Donald Trump or Bill Gates arrived on the scene with big books about big bucks, Vito Corleone satisfied a growing American appetite for business heroes, guys who made big companies run. Among other things, "The Godfather" was an incisive case study of a well-run corporation, exactly the kind of story that would later fit right into "In Pursuit of Excellence."
It's been downhill ever since. The romantic view of organized crime in "The Godfather" has given way to more jaundiced films. The wiseguys in "Goodfellas" spend as much time chopping garlic as they do stuffing bodies in trunks. "Since 'The Godfather,' films have dealt with the subject in a more down-to-earth way," said Kent Jones, the film archivist for Martin Scorsese. "In Abel Ferrara's last film, 'The Funeral,' you have guys from Yonkers whose idea of Mecca is the Bronx."
Anticipating the headlines, film makers have gravitated toward darkly humorous stories in which small-time hoods wage inept battles for ever-smaller stakes. Mr. Gotti brought back a whiff of the old days, when the many-roomed mansion of organized crime was so capacious that there was even room for Jewish and Irish gangsters. The murder of Paul Castellano outside Sparks Steak House in 1985 stirred old memories of half-forgotten names that fall like music on the ear: Joe Valachi, Frank Costello, Lucky Luciano, Joe Bonnano, Albert Anastasia. These were giants.
And now, there is Chin.
The trial continues, but as it limps toward the end, it's hard not to believe that the glory days have long since passed. "Sammy met him three or four times," Mr. Maas said, "and he said Gigante's hands were not just dirty, they were caked, like you see on homeless people in the street." From the Dapper Don to the Disoriented Don in just a few years.
Mother of Mercy, is this the end of Rico?

Let's See if the System Still Works

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"No fund-raising calls or mail," warned White House Counsel Abner Mikva in 1995, "may emanate from the White House or any other Federal building."
That's the law. But money-hungry Bill Clinton soon replaced Mikva, a former Federal judge, with Jack (Tell 'em Nuthin') Quinn, less concerned with legal niceties. 
 "The POTUS [President of the United States] and VP," e-mailed aide Karen Hancox in that law-breaking year, "offered ON THEIR OWN to make f r [fund-raising] calls for the DNC."
A few months ago, after Al Gore dismayed his own supporters by claiming "no controlling authority" stopped him from soliciting money from his Federal desk, the President pretended he could not recall doing anything similar.
Now, on the eve of the Senate's Thompson committee hearings, the truth is seeping out: Clinton personally leaned on 15 to 20 fat cats, often from his Oval Office phone, for at least $500,000 -- including one call urged by Vernon Jordan to shake $100,000 out of a Maryland businessman.
Both Clinton and Jordan are lawyers. They know the law against soliciting on Federal property. They were reminded of that law by the unwelcome Judge Mikva. Perhaps they were confident that Janet Reno, acting as a one-woman Supreme Court, would choose not to enforce that law.
But they surely knew how repugnant the American people would find the spectacle of their President, in the Oval Office, personally wheedling money out of wealthy citizens, with all the intimidation that such a "request" carries. That's why the Clinton memory turned so fuzzy for months.
Why are White House memories of the law-breaking suddenly coming clear? Because the Thompson committee has listed Ms. Hancox on its list of witnesses this week. White House Spin Control leaked the story on the eve of a holiday weekend, amid Mars landings and Paula Jones denunciations, hoping to detract from the newsworthiness of the televised hearings.
Another unfamiliar name on the witness list for the following week is Paul Buskirk, a trade official who deals with a classified computer network. That suggests to me that senators will be looking into John Huang's access to secret government cables. Huang was Lippo's man at Commerce, later reassigned by Clinton himself to raise money from those he serviced.
Only Asia-connection buffs know of Huang's 37 sessions with his personal C.I.A. briefer, accompanied by calls from his Commerce phone to his former Indonesian bosses and an unexplained visit to the Chinese embassy. Fewer still know of Huang's use of the Washington office of Stevens Inc., the investment bank so close to the Clintons in the past, for calls and faxes to Canada and overseas.
But now a wider audience assembles. Will the hearings reveal Huang to be an agent of influence, with the Clinton White House penetrated by a Chinese-Indonesian economic espionage operation? No; but perhaps its findings will force the appointment of an independent counsel still being resisted by Clinton Justice. The Senate's primary job is not to show "everybody did it," but to expose to public view the unprecedented pattern of corrupt fund-raising that sullied the highest office in the land.
I hope Huang is required to take the Fifth in person, along with all the others delaying or obstructing this investigation. I hope senators discover why our State Department is not trying to bring Yah Lin (Charlie) Trie -- so available to Tom Brokaw and to other interviewers in Shanghai -- home for questioning under oath.
Wang Jun, the Chinese arms dealer helping Iran obtain missiles to menace our ships in the Persian Gulf, recently told an American friend that he gave $50,000 to Charlie and thereby met Clinton in the White House. No wonder State and Justice don't want Trie questioned under oath.
One witness that Democrats will try desperately to protect is Bruce Lindsey, the newly unprivileged White House lawyer who bridges the fund-raising and Whitewater scandals.
He was present at Clinton's infamous Sept. 13, 1995, "reassignment" of Huang. And when asked by the Senate last year if he was aware of Clinton Administration efforts to steer work to Webster Hubbell, Lindsey swore "No." Let's see him slip out of those.

HEADLINE: Momentous Days in Madrid

 BODY:
Bill Clinton heads to Madrid this week to construct the foreign policy centerpiece of his Presidency, the eastward expansion of NATO. The United States has initiated no more fateful enterprise since the end of the cold war, yet it has done so largely without public discussion. With NATO planning to issue invitations to three new members in Madrid, a national debate can no longer wait.
Twenty senators, representing both parties, did their best to start one last week. In a thoughtful, deceptively mild letter to Mr. Clinton, the lawmakers identified many of the questions about NATO expansion that Americans ought to consider before committing their soldiers and nuclear weapons to the defense of Warsaw, Prague and Budapest. The letter attracted little public attention, but was closely read by Administration officials looking for some early indication whether a two-thirds majority in the Senate can be assembled in 1998 to approve NATO expansion. 
 It is too soon to know, but the 20 senators, led by Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, served notice that cornerstone elements of the NATO plan look badly conceived and that the Administration has so far done a dismal job of explaining and justifying the decisions that will be taken in Madrid. A stronger letter was sent to Mr. Clinton last month by some 40 Americans with European expertise, including former Senators Sam Nunn and Bill Bradley.
Tinkering with the map of Europe is not something to be done lightly. Two world wars started on the Continent this century and it was the primary battlefield of the cold war. Europe today is largely at peace and the great threat to democracy, the Soviet Union, vanished in 1991. If the map is to be redrawn, the reasons must be overwhelming and the potential consequences beyond doubt. NATO expansion does not now meet those tests.
The Hutchison group, for instance, would like to know what military threat NATO expansion is intended to counter, now that the Russian threat has receded. The senators, including conservative Republican Jesse Helms and liberal Democrat Paul Wellstone, wonder whether potential armed border disputes among new NATO members would warrant the use of American forces, as provided under NATO security guarantees. They are also concerned that NATO growth might jeopardize Russian approval of current and future agreements to cut nuclear arsenals.
Two important issues cited by the senators flared up even before Madrid. One is that NATO enlargement may divide Europe into two classes of nations, those admitted to the alliance and those excluded. Even promises of future consideration for countries like Romania, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia would leave them on the sidelines politically, militarily and economically. That may well turn into one of the most damaging consequences of expansion.
The answer is not to admit every applicant now. Even proponents of expansion recognize that doing so would overwhelm and weaken NATO. That leaves Washington and its allies skirmishing over the pace of expansion. A showdown was barely avoided in Madrid when France last week withdrew its insistence that Romania be offered membership immediately. This issue will continue to be a source of corrosive friction within the alliance.
The other immediate concern is the financial cost of expansion and how it should be apportioned among NATO members. The Clinton Administration, not surprisingly, has calculated a relatively modest $35 billion price tag spread over 13 years to modernize the military forces of new member states. Washington's share would be roughly $2 billion, or 6 percent. Other estimates run much higher, up to a total cost of $125 billion, with Washington paying $19 billion, or 15 percent. Senator Hutchison and her colleagues legitimately ask how the White House can be so certain Washington will ultimately cover just a fraction of the bill.
Hanging over the whole expansion plan is the potential adverse impact on Russia as it moves painfully toward democracy and free markets. Helping Russia complete that transition should be the primary objective of American policy today. NATO expansion, though grudgingly accepted by President Boris Yeltsin, seems likely over time to embolden Russia's anti-democratic forces. The first time NATO rejects Moscow's advice at a new consultative council set up to ease the concerns of Mr. Yeltsin, his accommodation with the alliance is certain to come under withering attack at home.
Given the absence of a clear threat to Europe and the possibility of so many unpredictable consequences, NATO expansion seems a gratuitous risk. If Mr. Clinton is determined to make it happen, he has an obligation to tell the American people why he is so sure it will not undermine stability in Europe and lead to a waste of American resources. He can begin in Madrid.

HEADLINE: For Now, Few Are Going From Food Stamps to Soup Kitchens

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: SYRACUSE

 BODY:
When word spread that hundreds of unemployed, able-bodied adults would soon lose food stamps, this city's advocates took to the streets. They taped warnings on grocery store windows. They pinned fliers on community bulletin boards. And then the soup kitchens braced for the deluge of the hungry.
It never happened. 
 More than 500 people have vanished from the food stamp rolls since March, when Syracuse became one of the first cities in New York to deny those benefits to childless, able-bodied adults who fail to find work. But only a handful responded to the offer for help.
"We were thinking, 'Oh, my God, all these people will be coming,' " said Mary Anne Ruff, director of emergency services at the Salvation Army, "but to be honest, we just have not seen them." Ms. Ruff is still waiting for her telephone lines to burn and for lines of the needy to snake outside her food pantry's door.
More than 2,000 of New York's poorest people, those without income, jobs or public assistance, have lost food stamps for failing to find work. Under the new law, recipients are cut off after three months if they do not work at least 20 hours a week or participate in a workfare program. But to the surprise of county officials and advocates for the poor, they appear to be relying far more heavily on family, friends and low-wage, irregular jobs than on soup kitchens and homeless shelters.
They are the first public aid recipients in New York to hit time limits under the Federal welfare law. And supporters of welfare changes say their experiences prove that people will survive, and perhaps even benefit, after the safety net disappears.
Advocates for the poor say these people are just getting by, finding jobs that are quickly lost and leaning on relatives who can barely fill their own refrigerators. But even they acknowledge that the stories emerging from former food stamp recipients are tales of struggle, but also of survival.
Michael Manney, 30, illiterate and long unemployed, now shares his girlfriend's groceries and scrubs dishes for minimum wage at a Red Lobster restaurant in Glens Falls, a river town near Albany.
Theodore Clark, 36 and learning disabled, dined nightly in his retired mother's kitchen before reluctantly joining the workfare program in Fulton, just north of Syracuse.
And Cyrena Vance, 32, who had already been working off the books as a home health aide, took on another elderly client after she lost her food stamps.
"I don't need to bother with food stamps anymore," said Ms. Vance, who also receives help from her fiance.
Unexpectedly, these stories are emerging from cities with job shortages. Thirty-eight counties, including those in New York City, were granted Federal waivers to continue food stamps until November to able-bodied adults, those single men and women between the ages of 18 and 50 who lack physical or mental impairments that might prevent them from working.
But 18 of those counties, most of them upstate, like Warren County, which includes Glens Falls, and Onondaga County, which includes Syracuse, quietly refused the waivers. Saying they had enough workfare slots to place people who failed to find private-sector jobs, county executives sent hundreds of letters warning that benefits would soon be cut.
Over and over, the county officials encountered the same response: silence. Most people never responded to offers of workfare placements and simply disappeared once their food stamps were cut.
"We sent letters to 200 people asking them if they wanted a work slot and 30 showed," said Ted Mohr, the Commissioner of Social Services in Oneida County, whose office has cut food stamps to about 150 people.
But advocates for the poor and academics who have studied the impact of benefit loss in other states caution that while the anticipated chaos has so far failed to emerge, so have stable, long-term solutions for many people struggling to build new lives in the post-welfare world.
State officials estimate that about 17,000 able-bodied food stamp recipients will ultimately lose benefits for failing to meet the 20-hour-a-week work requirement. The vast majority live in New York City, where higher unemployment rates may make suffering more acute.
They are mostly men without high school diplomas who have received food stamps for less than a year. But many are illiterate, abuse drugs or alcohol and struggle to find permanent work.
"They are often street people who were living on the margins anyway," said Barbara Weiner, a lawyer with the Greater Upstate Law Project, an advocacy group that tracks changes in welfare rules. "We won't necessarily see them starving in the streets, but that doesn't mean everyone is happy and working. Their lives are more desperate."
Sandra K. Danzinger, an associate professor of social work at the University of Michigan, agreed.
"People turn to whatever limited and precarious personal resources they have and hold on as long as they can," said Ms. Danzinger, who has studied the elimination of Michigan's welfare program for able-bodied adults. "But friends and family absorb that impact at a cost that is kind of hard to measure."
In Glens Falls, Laureen Colbert, 40, prays every morning that her boyfriend, Mr. Manney, will keep his job. It is her only hope, she says, of staying afloat.
When Mr. Manney lost his $120 monthly allotment of food stamps in March, the couple survived on Ms. Colbert's disability check and food stamps. But at the end of every month, they found themselves living on spaghetti and Cup-a-Soup, unable to afford even milk or cereal.
In June, after months of resisting his girlfriend's entreaties to find work, Mr. Manney finally found the job washing dishes at Red Lobster.
In Fulton, Joan Clark fed her son, Theodore, and his wife, Cheryl, for three months in her sagging wooden house. Mr. Clark, who works as a school crossing guard 10 hours a week, refused to find another job to supplement his income.
"I already got a job," insisted Mr. Clark, who is illiterate and learning disabled. "I ain't going to kill myself for no food stamps."
He is a big man, who lost a full-time job as a janitor two years ago and never bothered to find another one. He cannot read the help-wanted ads in the newspaper or fill out a job application. And his confused blue eyes wander when his mother tries to explain the new welfare law.
"I wouldn't never let them go hungry," said Joan Clark, who helped support the couple with her disability check. "But we're lucky if we can afford a sandwich at Wendy's."
Two weeks ago, after enduring relentless pressure from his wife and his mother, Mr. Clark reluctantly agreed to join the local workfare program to help out. "I have to do what I have to do," he said.
In Glens Falls, Gerald Sutton, a 39-year-old recovering crack addict teetering on the brink of homelessness, is scraping by with the help of friends and the local food pantry.
He measures time not in the hours ticking away on his wristwatch, but in the slices of bread left in his cupboard and in the dwindling number of coins in his pockets.
Despite the hardship, he says he believes that food stamp recipients should work for their benefits.
"I got interviews at Wal-Mart, the hospital and the amusement park," said Mr. Sutton, a lanky, bald man wearing good-as-new slacks he dug from a thrift-store barrel. "That's the way it should be. You don't get something for nothing in this world."

HEADLINE: Clinton Credits Law For a Steep Decline In U.S. Welfare Rolls

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 5,

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that more than a million people had left public assistance rolls since last August, a figure he offered as proof that the tough new welfare measure he signed was working.
In his weekly radio address, Mr. Clinton said welfare caseloads fell by 3.1 million people between January 1993 -- when he took office -- and April of this year. In April, he said, there were 11 million people on welfare, or about 4 percent of the population, the lowest share since 1970. 
"All Americans should be very happy that three million of our fellow citizens are now off welfare rolls," Mr. Clinton said. "Let us redouble our determination to give more and more of our fellow citizens their own personal independence day."
Last August, the President signed a welfare measure that imposed a lifetime limit of five years for receiving welfare and gave the states control of Federal cash assistance and food stamps. The law, which took effect in all 50 states in July, ended the 60-year-old system of unlimited, direct assistance to the poor.
A report released in May by the White House Council of Economic Advisers attributed the drop in welfare rolls to three factors: strong economic growth, waivers that allowed states to experiment with welfare reform plans and Administration policies such as an expansion of the earned income tax credit, toughened child support enforcement and increased financing for child care.

Labor Groups Unimpressed By Democrats in Mayoral Race
With two months to go to the primary and four months to the general election, the Democratic candidates for Mayor of New York City have failed to win the backing of the city's most powerful unions, a traditional bastion of support that Democrats often rely on to lift them to victory in citywide races. In fact, several important unions have already thrown their support to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, and municipal unions that have long supported Democratic candidates have thus far refrained from making an endorsement. 1
 
Insider's View of 'Numbers'
Spanish Raymond wants to clear his name. In his first extensive interview, Raymond Marquez, a 67-year-old numbers kingpin, not only provided a rare look into the lucrative racket but also accused the government of singling him out for prosecution because of his life style as legendary figure in Harlem and East Harlem with a penchant for stylish clothes, glittering jewelry, luxury cars and yachting. 13

More than 2,000 of New York's poorest people, those without income, jobs or public assistance, have lost food stamps for failing to find work.

Rustic Life Of Amish Is Changing But Slowly

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: NARVON, Pa.

 BODY:
The horse carriages still ply the hilly roads of Lancaster County, a black top indicating a Mennonite driver and a gray top an Amish one.
But they are not traveling to and from farms so much anymore, as they have through decades in a style of life resistant to the march of technology and urban confusion. These days, the drivers are just as likely to be headed for a bakery, a clothing store, a handicraft shop or even a cement factory -- sure testimony that a revered and resolute way of life is changing ever so slowly. 
 "And it continues to happen," said Moses B. Smucker, 46, an Amish man whose life as owner of Smucker's Harness Shop Inc. seems to symbolize the evolution. "It's pretty simple. There is not enough land needed to farm. People are making other choices.
"I don't consider it a negative. Some do. But I don't."
Amish and Mennonite families make up 36,000 of the 435,000 people in Lancaster County. For generations, the traditional among them have clung to the land for their values and livelihoods, resisting the temptations and conveniences of the outside world. Theirs has always been a rustic life of hard work, plain clothes, horse-drawn plows and no electricity.
But their style of life has made them a curiosity to outsiders, and the curiosity has grown into a tourist industry, attracting up to five million visitors a year. Lancaster County towns like Intercourse and Bird in Hand, once dots on the map where carriage drivers met to talk quietly, are now vacation destinations.
Main streets are flecked with bed-and-breakfasts and boutiques that sell Amish and Mennonite wares. Many stores are open on Sundays, a practice once unheard of here.
New industry has also found the area, drawn by a culture, fostered by the Amish and Mennonites, of hard work and dependability. As one of the faster-growing regions in Pennsylvania, with a population surge of nearly 6 percent from 1990 to 1995, Lancaster County is now home to 10,000 businesses, including giants like the Kellogg Company, Tyson Foods Inc. and the R. R. Donnelley & Sons Company, which have all built factories.
The county unemployment rate, 2.6 percent, is well below the national average of 5 percent, and residential subdivisions are flourishing.
But the combination of tourism and commercial success is fundamentally changing the sociological fabric of the Amish and Mennonite communities, which share the same Christian beliefs but differ in how they practice them. The Amish are generally more conservative.
New residents have driven up property values, and Amish and Mennonite families, which tend to be large, often with six or more children, are struggling to find enough farmland for all to make a living.
Many offspring stay, working family acreage for corn, tobacco, grains and other crops, and many others are leaving to find cheaper land elsewhere. But a growing percentage of Amish and Mennonites are abandoning the farms to pursue their own entrepreneurial instincts or jobs with new businesses that their communities spurred.
Mr. Smucker grew up on his family's 40-acre farm just north of here, in Churchtown. His father began making harnesses for horses as a side business in 1962. But eight years later, he was killed when a truck in which he was a passenger was in an accident, and the farm was sold.
Like thousands of young Amish, Moses Smucker worked the fields, but once the farm passed out of the immediate family, his interest waned. "I wanted to be in business," he said, so he concentrated on harness making.
Today, Smucker's Harness Shop on Route 23, amid dozens of small farms, stands as thriving evidence to his fortitude and the increasing diversity of Amish and Mennonite people. Generating millions of dollars a year in revenue, the shop has become a world-renowned source of hand-crafted carriages, bridles and other horse-related products.
"Our whole industry buys here," said Paul McDade of Border Carriages in New York City, a company that operates horse-drawn carriages in Central Park. He and two friends had just bought new bridles.
About half of the 24 employees at Smucker's are Amish. They make many of the products, some of which cost thousands of dollars. And like other Amish and Mennonite people, they are adjusting to a life apart from the farm, once an anchor for their traditions and values.
"More and more, we're becoming business people," Mr. Smucker said. "And I'm not so sure our leaders, the ministers and bishops, know how to deal with it. They're getting the hang of it. But they're still uncomfortable with it."
It is not only financial pressures that are changing the Amish and Mennonites. With increasing commercial development around them, their communities are also being pushed closer to the technologies and leisure activities that most Americans take for granted.
Outside a small food market in Leola, an Amish boy passed by on Rollerblades, his traditional black boots in hand.
Some businesses owned by Amish and Mennonites have begun advertising. "It's unbelievable what's happening," Mr. Smucker said. "We're now using color advertising in our catalogues. When we first started, all we did was open the front door."
Mr. Smucker, who said he would like to leave his business to his children -- three daughters and two sons -- has his eye on a new pursuit. He wants to be a full-time auctioneer, something he now dabbles in.
On a recent Saturday in New Holland, hundreds of items were being offered for bids, including dozens of expensive horse carriages. As Mr. Smucker was preparing for the sale, he hurt his toe, which required an ice pack and a bandage.
To carry on, he climbed into a golf cart and drove around the grounds. Resting in the small console that would otherwise hold golf balls and tees was a cellular telephone.

Cardinals Rise in the N.L. Central on the Wings of Their Pitchers

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
So, what took them so long?
 The St. Louis Cardinals needed nearly a month more of this season than last to arrive in first place in the National League Central. Everyone sort of knew they were the team to beat, but that's what was happening to them the first three months of the season -- most everyone was beating them.
On July 1, the Cardinals reclaimed the position that was theirs on the last day of last season. The next day, they reached .500. for the first time. 
 "I just hope it lasts," said Walt Jocketty, the team's general manager, thankful for any sign of pennant-race stability. "I've been kind of waiting to get to .500. I think this club is capable of taking off."
But since the Cardinals finally reached the elusive .500 plateau, they have lost three successive games to the shockingly competitive Pittsburgh Pirates and have tumbled back into second place behind the Pirates. That is not what Jocketty and Manager Tony La Russa had in mind.
"We're still not scoring a lot of runs, but we're playing a little bit better," Jocketty said. "We're still waiting for the offense to take off. If we had the offense of Colorado or Cleveland, we'd have quite a club."
That the Cardinals have reached the top again is not an achievement strictly of their own doing. They have had plenty of help from the other teams in the division, particularly the Houston Astros. Before the teams had played a full month, Houston led the Cardinals by six and a half games, but the Astros were unable to maintain their strong start. The Pirates joined them at the top of the division, and both looked as if they were keeping the spot warm for the Cardinals.
If first place was the Cardinals' inevitable destination, responsibility fell on their pitchers to get them there.
"Our pitching continues to be the strongest part of our club," Jocketty said. "It starts with the pitching coach, Dave Duncan. He's done an outstanding job molding this staff to his own personality -- hard working, diligent in going about their business. They kept us in the race until the offense could come around."
The starting rotation of the Benes brothers, Andy and Alan; Todd Stottlemyre; Matt Morris, and, when healthy, Donovan Osborne, is as strong as any rotation, the general manager said. Osborne has missed two months because of a groin pull but is expected back late this month.
The pitching staff is ranked No. 2 in the N.L. Only Atlanta's 3.11 earned run average is better than the Cardinals' 3.36. The Cardinals have also allowed the second fewest home runs and are second in strikeouts. In addition, the Cardinals have an ageless closer. On Friday, Dennis Eckersley, 42, squandered only his third save in 21 chances.
The team's hitters, on the other hand, have not placed the Cardinals among the league's run-scoring leaders. But right fielder John Mabry and first baseman Dmitri Young have picked up in recent weeks, and Delino DeShields has made Jocketty's decision to sign him as a free agent look good. After three mediocre-to-poor seasons in Los Angeles, DeShields has returned to the hitting level he achieved earlier with Montreal.
"He's developing into the catalyst at the top of the order we hoped he would be when we signed him," Jocketty said.
The negatives for the Cardinals as they look to the second half of the season are catcher Tom Pagnozzi and Brian Jordan, the regular right fielder. Pagnozzi, afflicted with a groin injury, has played only four games. Jordan is on the disabled list for the second time with a bulging disk in his back and may miss the rest of the season.
"He sat out six weeks, came back and still wasn't right," Jocketty said. "At this point it doesn't require surgery, but it is something that's a constant irritant and affects his swing and the way he plays the game."
 
New York, New York: No Draw
 The Mets' three-game interleague series in Detroit drew the smallest attendance for a three-game interleague series. In fact, adding in the two-game series played by West teams, only the series between San Diego and Oakland attracted fewer fans.
While the Mets' visit to Detroit drew 46,060, the Yankees' three-game series there a week earlier attracted 45,776. Must be something about New York.
 
Disappearing Acts
 When Clyde King, then the Yankees' general manager, was able to trade Ed Whitson to San Diego in 1986, it was considered one of the greatest acts of prestidigitation of all time. The trade of Kenny Rogers and his $5 million-a-year contract to the Padres did not rank with the move that made Whitson disappear, but it was impressive even so -- while it lasted. It seems unlikely that the Yankees, now that the trade has been canceled because Greg Vaughn has a shoulder problem, can turn around and do it again, but the story behind the trade with the Padres remains intriguing.
Tony Attanasio is an agent who was desperately trying to liberate a client, Mariano Duncan, from the Yankees. The San Francisco Giants were interested in the utilityman, who had become the No. 1 resident in George Steinbrenner's doghouse.
Attanasio, given the authority to try to make a deal for Duncan, was talking with Bob Watson, the Yankees' general manager, early last week and told him that the Giants were more interested in a pitcher than Duncan, but would consider accepting a package including the two players.
Would they take Rogers? Watson asked. No, he was told, Rogers makes too much money for the Giants and, anyway, they were interested in Dwight Gooden. But, Attanasio told Watson, if you want to put Rogers and Duncan together and would be interested in Vaughn, the Padres may go for that deal. They did. As difficult a season and a half as Rogers spent with the Yankees, no player had ever been treated the way Duncan was. Steinbrenner has tried to dictate lineup changes throughout his 25-year ownership reign of error, but never has a manager so blatantly capitulated to the owner's dictates as Joe Torre did on Duncan.
Steinbrenner declared Duncan no longer the Yankee second baseman, and Torre then rendered him virtually invisible. Steinbrenner has occasionally had short-term success with his lineup declarations, but nothing that approached the Duncan affair.
 In 1986, the owner told Lou Piniella not to play Dave Winfield against certain right-handers, but Piniella said, "If I keep doing this, I'm going to lose everyone else on the team because everyone will know who's making out the lineup." He told Steinbrenner that if he wanted to write the lineup, he could get someone else to manage.
 
Show Henderson the Money
 Rickey Henderson entered June with a .164 batting average and the distinct appearance of a veteran player who would be better off beginning the rest of his life. A calf injury, the Padres' crowded outfield and his inability to hit kept Henderson's plate appearances to a minimum.
But Henderson's performance the past month showed that he is not ready to retire and that he should be the Padres' regular left fielder again. His performance also made it easier for the Padres to trade Greg Vaughn. Since languishing at .164, Henderson has 37 hits in 106 at-bats, a .349 pace that has raised his season average to .281.
"With Rickey," said a baseball executive who knows him well, "what matters is pride and economic incentive. He wanted to play every day, so he beat out Vaughn."
 
Dubious Distinction Awards
 It was not a good week for the Milwaukee Brewers. Not only did the Cincinnati Reds sweep them in a three-game interleague series, but the Brewers also had the worst showing in the All-Star voting. Their catcher, first baseman and second baseman finished last, their shortstop and designated hitter placed next to last, their third baseman was 11th out of 14 and their 3 outfielders were among the last 8 of 42 on the ballot.
Philadelphia entered last night's game with a .277 won-lost percentage. Over a full season, that percentage would give the Phillies a 44-118 record. And the Pirates were supposed to lose more than 100 games?
 
Pitchers Reclaim Dignity
 Pitchers have reclaimed some of their rightful share of the major league game. In the first three months, runs and home runs were down from the first three months of last season. In 1,118 games last year, teams scored 11,428 runs and hit 2,530 home runs; in 1,115 games this year, teams scored 10,624 runs and hit 2,201 home runs.
The National League dropped to 8.96 runs and 1.77 home runs a game from 9.43 and 2.07. The American League dipped to 10.11 and 2.18 from 11.01 and 2.46. The major league game averages fell to 9.53 runs from 10.22 and to 1.97 homers from 2.26.

HEADLINE: Computer Age Millionaires Redefine Philanthropy

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG

DATELINE: SEATTLE, July 5

 BODY:
Among the multitudes of Microsoft millionaires here, something big is brewing.
Something that, though emanating from what many consider the Evil Empire of computerdom, has the potential to do such tremendous good that it reminds philanthropy experts of the turn-of-the-century transformation of New York City by the railroad and oil barons. Or the infusion of civic-minded wealth into the Ford-and-Chrysler Midwest a generation later. 
 Slowly, scores, if not hundreds, of the several thousand millionaires created by Microsoft's high-technology hegemony, many of them so suddenly flush with rocketing stock shares that they can retire at 35, are coalescing into a network of unusually young, unusually rich people who think along these lines:
"We've been lucky -- we've been really lucky," said Trish Millines, a 39-year-old Microsoft retiree who has just created a foundation to help train minority children in computers. "And one of my first instincts as a person who grew up fairly poor is: You have it, you share it."
And sharing it they are, in ways that are beginning to transform the culture of the Seattle area and, experts say, of philanthropy itself.
The Microsoft techno-benefactors include billionaires like Paul Allen, the company co-founder who has given tens of millions of dollars to a variety of causes; Bill Gates himself, who last week announced the donation of $200 million toward connecting libraries here and around the nation with the Internet, and a constellation of mere millionaires backing projects like saving the historic Paramount theater, arming environmental groups with the latest in computer tools and creating a baby blanket company that gives all its proceeds to children's causes.
Charity specialists are watching with fascination as Microsoft disciples begin to try to remake the Puget Sound nonprofit world in their own image, introducing into the sometimes-stodgy world of philanthropy a high-energy, high-tech, hard-core business approach that seems to enter the DNA of employees on the Redmond, Wash., campus.
They are also taking note of the particular orientations of this new generation of givers: They tend to want to support education -- their own key to success -- and environmental causes, and share a certain belief in technology as salvation.
If their nascent efforts live up to their promise, said Craig Smith, a longtime philanthropy consultant here, the region will become a showcase for how high-technology patrons "help society make the transition into the information age," from spreading technology across class barriers to using its profits to improve education and help the poor.
The upstart geekocracy of high technology is not known for sharing, and grateful-but-skeptical Seattleites often point out the strings attached to gifts: Mr. Gates's library plan will help promote use of Microsoft software, and Mr. Allen, who recently paid for a statewide vote on a new $425 million stadium, which he will help build, to keep the Seattle Seahawks football team, which he just bought, in their hometown, is expected to make money off the deal. Many of the millionaires also use their donations for tax relief.
 
A New Generation Of Philanthropy
In general, techno-millionaires, who make up one of the biggest pools of new wealth in the country, have been regarded as one of the stingiest, too caught up in navigating the whitewater change in their industry to focus on helping others. And Mr. Gates, the richest individual in the world, has been seen as the group's alpha ingrate, balking at sharing his billions until he was older.
But the seedlings of a new generosity in the Seattle area, among what is thought to be the biggest crop of quick millionaires that any company has ever produced, has stirred hope that many are getting old enough or burned-out enough to start thinking about personal legacies.
And the giving seems to presage ever greater influence for the city's Microsoft elite, whose flash has already associated Seattle in the minds of most outsiders with, "Oh, Bill Gates!" despite the longstanding dominance here of the Boeing Company, a business behemoth that still dwarfs Microsoft.
What is happening among Microsoft millionaires now in Seattle, said Peter Dobkin Hall, a research scientist in the Program on Non-Profit Organizations at Yale University, is the formation of a "philanthropic community," the kind of network that is needed for large-scale investment in social needs.
And already, he said of the ever-more-sparkling city, "Largely due to the impact of these people on civic life, it's just been transformed."
The signs that the techno-millionaires are reaching a critical philanthropic mass here had begun well before Mr. Gates announced his gift last week.
Earlier in June, at a meeting of more than 130 potential contributors, five high-technology leaders, including two Microsoft retirees and a current executive, founded Social Venture Partners, a sort of donors' circle. Conceived by Paul Brainerd, a pioneer in desktop publishing who sold his Aldus Corporation in 1994 for $450 million, the partnership is set up much like a venture capital firm, with each member "investing" at least $5,000 in its initial stages.
And Microsoft Alumnet, which, among other things, helps Microsoft "graduates" figure out how to donate their money and time, has mushroomed in its two-year existence to more than 1,100 members.
 
Bill Gates Begins To Lead the Way
Mr. Gates may now begin leading the way with his personal giving, and Microsoft matches employees' charitable contributions with up to $12,000 a year.
But until now, it has been mainly the Microsoft alumni -- the hundreds who have thrown off the "golden handcuffs" of deferred stock options and concluded that where they want to go today is out -- who have set the examples.
Best known nationally for large-scale philanthropy is Mr. Allen, the bearded, bearish Microsoft co-founder, eighth-richest man in the world, whose estimated $13 billion fortune supports not only a man-in-a-toystore life of sports and jets but a broad array of contributions. They include gifts to hospitals and universities and his plan for a lavish, interactive rock music museum, the Experience Music Project, built in the shape of a smashed guitar.
Locally, a constellation of other former Microsoft employees have become associated with major good works, from Ida Cole, who used some of her millions to save the landmark Paramount theater, to Scott Oki, whose Oki Foundation gives away nearly half a million dollars a year, mainly to children's causes.
When he began the foundation, Mr. Oki said with wry candor, it was largely as a "tax dodge." But he has become so consumed with nonprofit work he is a member of 23 boards, he said, and sees his mission as blending philanthropy with entrepreneurship and persuading former Microserfs and others to do the same.
"Clearly, we're still at the tip of the iceberg," he said of his colleagues' contributions, "as more and more people leave Microsoft and really figure out what they want to do with the rest of their lives."
Not on the same scale of raw wealth, but considered the political star among Microsoft millionaire retirees is Tina Podlodowski, 37, a Seattle City Councilwoman who has championed neighborhood planning, gay rights and technological efficiency, saving the city millions in computer costs.
"Nobody ever thought Microsoft would get this big," Ms. Podlodowski said. "To get this money is a wonderful bonus. For most people it's just a matter of having a safety net -- so you start thinking, 'How can we crank that safety net for other people?' "
Then there is a passel of less prominent figures -- those beginning their own ventures, like Ms. Millines, whose Technology Access Foundation will train children and teen-agers on computers, and hundreds of others joining nonprofit boards and writing checks.
Of Alumnet's 1,100 members, staff members say, about 40 percent are mainly interested in nonprofit work, while another 40 percent have started new businesses and want networking help primarily with that.
 
New Assertiveness In Charitable Groups
And then there are those who choose to remain anonymous, like the former Microsoft backers of the Wilburforce Foundation, a new fund based in Seattle that gives away $2 million a year mainly to groups in the Pacific Northwest working on habitat conservation. Microsoft alumni say they think -- based on purely anecdotal surveys of their friends -- that only perhaps one-fifth of rich young retirees have not yet gotten around to doing much beyond lingering over their lattes.
For philanthropy-watchers and the retirees themselves, the most interesting aspect of the influx of Microsoft money is the people who come with it: their desire to throw themselves into some new passion and the habits they bring from their days and nights of cranking code, crunching numbers and quashing competitors.
"I'd expect to see a bunch of very aggressive, assertive foundations because that's the nature of Microsoft people, that they're going to be independent and really think about what they do," said Bruce Jacobsen, who left Microsoft last year. He is now president of Progressive Networks, a start-up founded by Rob Glaser, a fellow Microsoft retiree, that mainly makes RealAudio and RealVideo software but will donate a fixed percentage of its profits to charity and, as a sideline, backs political groups with free technological aid.
Even those like Mr. Glaser, swept up in a new business, demand Microsoft-style measurable results from the charities they support.
"I don't find it satisfying to just write a check when I don't know the money will be used in a positive way," he said. "There should be a hybrid of the purely commercial and purely philanthropic world. You can actually create an economic entity with metrics for measurability."
Fueling the philanthropy is a rise in Microsoft's stock -- it is up by a factor of 250 since it went public in 1986 -- and the stock option plan that spreads the wealth among thousands of employees. In January alone, employees exercised $400 million in options on $1.3 billion in stock, creating $900 million in net worth, said Tony Audino, the founder of Alumnet.
Estimates of how many millionaires the company has produced range from 5,000 to 10,000 or more; it depends in part on when people sold their stock.
Philanthropy experts say the growing altruistic bent also stems from a natural maturing, one that has gone a bit slower than in other fields simply because of the age of the new rich. Many are still busy having children and buying houses.
"It's a 10-year process of money coming back to the community, even from very wealthy people," said Gib Myers, a general partner at the Mayfield Fund in Menlo Park, Calif., which has been exploring ways to encourage philanthropy among the Silicon Valley's counterparts to the Microsoft millionaires.
Nonetheless, despite widespread criticism that the world cannot afford to wait for technology moguls to mature into giving more, even such a usually sharp-tongued philanthropy analyst as Waldemar Nielsen gets excited when he considers the good they are beginning to do.
"They're not only young and creative, but they're a different generation of newly wealthy people," said Mr. Nielsen, author of "The Dramas of Donorship" (University of Oklahoma, 1997). "I'm very optimistic that their philanthropic work will turn out as creative as their inventiveness in these new fields of electronics and communications." Normally, he said, "I'm a sour and skeptical old man, but I really feel great, great hopefulness about them."

HEADLINE: Why Does It Take a Wrestling Match to Get Tax Reductions?;
Capital vs. Labor

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I am rather puzzled by the Republican proposal in the House to index capital gains to inflation (editorial, July 2; front page, July 1). 
 If I understand the proposal correctly, if the inflation increase in a given year is 3 percent and I invest $20,000 in a stock whose value increases $600 during the year, I pay no taxes on the $600. However, if I receive a wage of $20,000 a year and I get a raise of $600, I am required to pay taxes on the $600. I fail to see the equity in this.
In the one case I am investing capital, but in the other case I am investing labor.

MONEY
 Who Has How Much and Why.
 By Andrew Hacker.
 254 pp. New York:
 Scribner. $25. 
 Jerry Seinfeld gets at least $22 million next year. Is he worth it? NBC thinks so. It pulls in more than $1 million a minute from advertisements during the show. The laundry worker down my street earns around $13,500 a year. Is he worth it? The laundry thinks so. Even though the economy is booming, it can get someone to replace him if he demands a penny more.
In his engaging book "Money," Andrew Hacker, a professor of political science at Queens College, examines who earns what, and why they do. He shows that most Americans are more like the person who does my laundry than like Seinfeld. If $30,000 is set as a minimum middle-class income, fewer than a third of all employed Americans can be considered middle class. Even at $20,000, only about half can.
At the very top, with yearly incomes over $1 million, sit some 68,000 of the nation's highest rollers (from whose ranks, Hacker tells us, came one-quarter of all the delegates to the most recent Republican National Convention), including 1,500 people on Wall Street, 600 chief executives, 246 professional football players, 241 baseball players and a collection of inventors, entertainers, entrepreneurs, financial wizards and heirs. Just under them come America's richest professionals -- the top 1 percent of all earners, with yearly incomes starting at $200,000 -- featuring not only star doctors and lawyers but also heads of charitable foundations (the Ford Foundation pays its president $839,139), university presidents (more than half a million dollars at Boston University) and even a football coach ($975,000 at Florida State, including endorsements).
These generous incomes are mostly explained by the special skills or education of their recipients. In Hacker's view, the substance of what they learned in college is less important than the style. "The years at college and graduate school pay off because they burnish students' personalities. The time spent on a campus imparts cues and clues on how to conduct oneself in corporate cultures and professional settings." Professors themselves, although hardly in the top ranks, are paid comfortable salaries "not so much for teaching subjects like history and philosophy as for being a professional presence that students can emulate."
The rest of Hacker's explanation for why the very rich got that way has even less to do with their expertise. He argues that when organizations or individuals want to demonstrate they are getting the "best," they hire people who are already paid the most. A similar ratcheting-up occurs with corporate boards, which always want to pay their chieftains just above the norm in order to prove that the company is ahead of the rest of the pack; or with Wall Street investment bankers, who conventionally receive a 1 percent commission on all deals and so promote the biggest ones conceivable. In any event, a payment of tens of millions of dollars just doesn't seem that extravagant when one is presiding over billions. How else to explain Michael Ovitz's $128 million severance package for about 60 weeks' work at Disney?
The bottom 80 percent of the population, meanwhile, receives a smaller share of the nation's total income than it did 20 years ago. The shift began in the early 1970's, when the median earnings of men began dropping. Middle-income households avoided downward mobility only by sending wives to work and by postponing both marriage and children. At the same time, the poor have become poorer. Some of this downdraft has been caused by technological advances and globalization, hurting those with few or outmoded skills.
Here, too, Hacker suggests additional culprits. Long-term contracts and wage-setting institutions that once shielded blue-collar workers, teachers and low-level civil servants from the labor auction block are disappearing. Meanwhile, the lowest economic rungs, on which most two-income families had once perched, are now occupied by single-parent households. In 1995, 31.3 percent of American children lived with just one parent or with someone other than a parent, up from under 15 percent in 1970. Largely as a result, a third of America's children now live in households earning less than $25,000. One in five children lives in poverty. For all its riches, the United States now has a greater percentage of its citizens in prison or on the streets, and more neglected children, than any other advanced nation.
This story isn't new, but Hacker embellishes it with rich detail. In 1970, for example, 3.1 percent of American households lived in trailers or mobile homes; by 1990, it was 7.2 percent. Sometimes the precision and profusion of his detail overwhelm his argument. (In 1995, the average sewing-machine operator earned $13,052; a hotel clerk, $15,028; and an orthopedic surgeon, $304,000. The median household income in West Virginia was $24,880, while in Connecticut it was $40,243. The poverty threshold for one person living alone was $7,763.)
From such an abundance of data, Hacker draws some provocative conclusions. He argues, for example, that certain states have intentionally low-balled welfare allowances in order to create "a ready pool of women to work at a minimum wage as household servants, motel maids and in food-processing plants." Some of his verdicts are simply bizarre, as when he states that "the farther a country is from the United States, the more likely will its immigrants be to secure higher-paying employment" because "it takes more resources, either financial or personal, to get here from India or the Philippines than, say, Mexico or the Dominican Republic." Canadians and Cambodians alike would find this statement curious.
Hacker is appropriately concerned about the corrosive consequences of growing disparities in wealth and earnings among Americans. "With the legacy we are now creating," he writes, "millions of men, women, children are prevented from being fully American, while others pride themselves on how much they can amass." But he is curiously silent about what we might do to reverse the trend. His skepticism about the substantive purposes of higher education and his awareness of the difficulties in countering any of the institutional or sociological reasons for the widening gap lead him to the brink of suggesting, perhaps by default, a far more progressive system of taxation.
Hacker notes, for example, that as recently as 1979, rich Americans paid an average of 47 percent of their income in Federal taxes. By 1994, the effective rate had declined to 32 percent.
In theory, economic winners could redistribute much of their earnings to losers and yet still come out far ahead. As an extreme example, he observes that an income ceiling of $100,000 per year, affecting approximately the top 7 percent of American families, would yield $285 billion annually -- a sum that, if transferred to the poorest 20 percent, whose incomes now average $7,764, would establish a floor of $22,219 per family.
But Hacker hastily warns us off any such fanciful thoughts. His book "should not be read as a plea for income redistribution," he protests near its end. "The reason is straightforward: if people are disinclined to share what they have, they will not be persuaded by a reproachful tone." One worries that the elevated tone he chooses instead may be too high to be heard.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
True Grits in Nashville

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV; ERIC ASIMOV writes the $25 and Under dining column for the Weekend section of The New York Times

 BODY:
SATURDAY night is rush hour in downtown Nashville. Cars stand bumper to bumper on Broadway, as police officers on bicycles wind slowly through the crowd. A gawking couple steps out of a horse-drawn carriage in front of the Old Spaghetti Factory, a franchise restaurant down the block from Hooters and around the corner from Planet Hollywood and the Hard Rock Cafe.
This is born-again Nashville, or "Nash Vegas," as denizens call it, where the prefabricated glitz of franchise clubs and packaged country entertainment is proving an irresistible siren to tourists. 
 I was hoping to find another city, where the music was more bourbon than Perrier, where the Southern restaurants still featured the Tennessee trinity of pork, pig and ham, and where lard, salt and "I'll have another beer" weren't dirty words. After all, it was just going to be a three-day weekend. And it was going to be cheap. In Nashville, music and food, judiciously chosen, are bargains.
The problem was getting there. Because I was arranging my trip on short notice -- just three days ahead -- a reasonable air fare between New York and Nashville was hard to find. American Airlines, one of the few airlines with a direct flight, quoted a fare of $992.
I tried the airline consolidators, those companies that acquire tickets in bulk and make them available at cut-rate prices, and easily found considerably cheaper round trips, $295 plus tax, but no direct flights. Then a solution appeared before my eyes.
Recently, I had subscribed to Net Saaver, a free weekly E-mail newsletter from American Airlines available through the American Web site, www.americanair.com. Net Saaver arrives each Wednesday, announcing last-minute discount fares available only on the coming weekend. These fares require departure on a Friday after 7 P.M. or anytime Saturday, with return the following Monday or Tuesday. The list of available tickets changes every week, and, from a New Yorker's perspective, the choices were always slim, with fares between New York and anywhere scarce.
This week, though, I was in luck. The current Net Saaver offered a round trip between New York and Nashville for a mere $129 plus tax! What's more, I could also rent a Hertz economy car with unlimited mileage for $24 a day through Net Saaver (I spent an extra $2 a day for a more comfortable compact).
So there I was, leaving Nashville International Airport on a Saturday morning in a Nissan Sentra -- not the Ford Escort I had been promised, but all I really cared about was that it had a decent radio.
I discovered two things right away: It's not as easy as you might think to find country music on the radio in Nashville, and it's even harder to find your way around. A good map ($4.95 at a newsstand) was essential.
I still got lost on my way to the Pancake Pantry, a Nashville institution. Even as the rest of the country has decided it has no time to eat in the morning, the South still venerates breakfast, especially in Nashville. This airy farmhouse-style restaurant on a block of low-slung stores and offices in the West End, near Vanderbilt University, offers 20 types of pancakes. My meal, deliciously coarse, granular cornmeal pancakes and rich country ham ($7.25), was the perfect welcome to Nashville, right down to the waitresses who called me "Hon" and replenished my iced tea unbidden.
Fueled up, I tried to get my bearings. My motel, a Shoney's Inn, was in the Music Row section, a center of the recording studios and industry offices. By simply stepping out of my functional but characterless room I could hear the quavering strains of a country ballad. A man in a nearby parking lot was belting out the song for tips, backed by a taped musical accompaniment in a kind of country karaoke. A little trolley plied Demonbreun Street, shuttling tourists between the nearby Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum and the sights downtown. Across the street were gift shops and quasi-museums advertising their prize possessions: "Barbara Mandrell's gown," "Hank Williams Jr.'s Cadillac," "George Jones's gold record." Each seemed to sell more local delicacies -- Goo-Goo Clusters and Moon Pies -- than musical trinkets.
I headed in another direction, to visit the Carl Van Vechten Gallery of Fine Arts at Fisk University, which houses a collection of paintings and sculptures once owned by Alfred Stieglitz. The collection was donated by his widow, Georgia O'Keeffe, in 1949 and includes works by Cezanne, Renoir and Diego Rivera, although I was more interested in less familiar modern artists like Marsden Hartley and John Marin, whose work Stieglitz had shown in his galleries.
My hope was to avoid the big country music tourist attractions -- the Grand Ole Opry, the Ryman Auditorium and the Wildhorse Saloon -- and to figure out where Nashvillians themselves go for music.
After a quick dinner at Rotier's, a dark, clubby West End bar and grill that serves the traditional Nashville "meat and three," meat with a choice of three vegetables ($5.75), I headed for the Station Inn, a nondescript stone building with a plywood floor, where Keith Little and Friends, a bluegrass group, were to play at 9 P.M. The cover charge was only $5, and Budweisers were $2.50, but with only 20 souls in the audience, the energy level was low. I moved on to 12th and Porter, a bar and restaurant that not only seemed to attract all of pierced, tattooed Nashville, but also offered valet parking.
It was packed, and waitresses in leather skirts and studded collars were squeezing through the crowd to serve dishes with names like Low Death Factor Fettuccine, the Nashville equivalent of spa cuisine. But the nightclub adjacent to the restaurant, done entirely in pink and black, was almost empty.
The band, Pat Gallagher and the Atomic Playboys, began a set of mellow love songs, the gentle lyrics settling like dew drops over the empty seats. A few more people trickled in, and as the band wound up its set, I left, having spent $3.50 for a Bass ale and $1 as tip for parking.
Could it be that all of Nashville had been invited to a party, and I hadn't gotten my invitation?
I found the party at my next stop, Exit-In, a club near Vanderbilt that specializes, I learned later, in the sort of alternative rock that appeals to a college audience. Exit-In was packed and pulsing, with a throng of young people who had paid $7 to hear Man or Astroman?, a psycho-surf thrash band, complete with props like cheesy Van de Graaff generators and big-screen televisions that flash footage from old science fiction movies. It was entertaining, but not what I was looking for. Besides, it was late, and I was hungry again. I headed out for Prince's Hot Chicken.
A friend had told me not to miss Prince's, but only chuckled when I asked him to describe it. Four or five other groups were waiting inside the largely takeout operation in a rundown storefront in northern Nashville. As chicken fried in huge, black frying pans, I read some warnings posted on the wall: Don't eat and drive at the same time. Don't touch the chicken and then touch your eyes, you could burn yourself. I ordered my chicken mild, with lemonade ($4.25), and took it back to my motel.
As I ate, the heat began with a tingling in the lips and tongue that rose into the sinuses and traveled down the throat. The plump, juicy chicken breast was undeniably a culinary treat, but perhaps not the best bedtime snack.
Particularly because I had to get up early on Sunday for breakfast. For years I had heard praise for the Loveless Motel and Cafe, most recently in "Eat Your Way Across the U.S.A." by Jane and Michael Stern. Now I was taking the 20-minute drive from Music Row to the Loveless in southwest Nashville.
Much of central Tennessee seems to congregate at the Loveless on Sunday mornings. Those without reservations are kept waiting in a little anteroom, or they may choose a buffet breakfast in an adjoining building. Those with reservations (like me) are seated right away in the homey dining room, where dishes of preserves, chunky peach and tart blackberry, sit on red-and-white checkered tablecloths.
I ordered country ham and eggs with red-eye gravy ($8.95) and a side order of grits ($1). Red-eye is a Southern specialty invented to go with grits and eggs: The salty, musky drippings from country ham are blended with a little coffee and cooked down. The eggs came with a platter of a dozen fluffy biscuits, which I tried with the jams, dipped in gravy and as a sandwich with the country ham, which had the proper leathery texture. The waitress clucked sympathetically when I told her I couldn't finish the last two. "Would you like me to pack 'em up for you?" she asked. I declined.
Later that morning I visited the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum. I almost missed the building, which was dwarfed by the B.M.I. building next door. The fascinating little museum ($10.75 admission) traces the history of country music from the Grand Ole Opry to the present, with an emphasis on the most commercially successful, of course. Among the tidbits I learned were that the early country players had been persuaded to trade in their formal attire for hillbilly costumes by George D. Hay, the founder of the Opry, who believed it would make them more accessible to their audience; that one of the early Opry stars was DeFord Bailey, a black harmonica player (the Opry also featured musicians in blackface); that Johnny Cash's hit "A Boy Named Sue" was written by Shel Silverstein; that when it came to outlandish customizing, Elvis Presley's gold Cadillac, with record player and cocktail cabinet, had nothing on Webb Pierce's 1962 Pontiac Bonneville, with its tooled leather upholstery, six-gun trim and silver-dollar decor.
I spent more than three hours at the museum, and could easily have dawdled longer, watching historic film clips of Roy Acuff and early Opry stars like Uncle Dave Macon. But I was eager to check into my room at the Union Station Hotel, which had been built in a beautifully refurbished Romanesque Gothic train station. I justified the $109 tab on two grounds. First, I was getting a good Sunday night deal; my room usually went for $175. Second, everything else had been a bargain in Nashville, so I had earned a treat.
The room seemed unadorned but not plain, with a king-size bed, comfortable armchairs and A-shaped struts that gave an unusual archlike feel to the room. A big picture window offered a view of a rail yard and a highway, and I could see that a rainstorm had begun. Tonight, I decided, I would look for music in the heart of Nash Vegas.
Maybe because of the rain, or maybe because it was Sunday, downtown Nashville seemed barren. Like a carnival barker, a woman in front of the empty Planet Hollywood tried to coax me in. But I was heading for the dives of old Nashville, like Robert's Western World, a venerable Western-wear shop turned nightclub that achieved local fame a few years back as home base to BR5-49, a retro country band that's gone on to recording-contract glory.
Onstage, the Lonnie Waters Band was playing to a dozen or so people, energetically picking its way through Hank Williams, Hank Snow and Elvis Presley. If the music wasn't original, it was played with verve and charm. As in all the older places along Broadway, the band played for tips, the people listened for the price of a beer.
At Tootsie's Orchid Lounge, which for decades served as the backstage bar for the Grand Ole Opry, Scott Wayne and the Boys were taking requests to the delight of the small crowd in an improbably bright, rundown room. I felt satisfied, as if I had finally found the music I was looking for. As the band finished its set, I left to get something to eat.
Easier said than done. After 9 on Sunday night, Nashville closes down. I stumbled on to Red, Hot and Blue, a shiny Memphis-style barbecue restaurant in the West End. There was one other person there, sitting at the bar. I sat down alongside.
"This is the only place I could find that was still open," I said.
"Viva Nash Vegas!" he replied.
 
The bottom line for music fans
 
Getting There
I spent an average of about $140 a day in Nashville, not including transportation. My round-trip ticket between New York and Nashville was $135, with tax, through American Airlines' Net Saaver, a free weekly E-mail list of discount fares. To receive Net Saaver, visit American's Web site: www.americanair.com.
 I rented an economy car for two days from Hertz through Net Saaver for a total of $54.44, with unlimited mileage, including a 5 percent discount as an American Aadvantage member and tax. A Rand McNally Easy Finder road map ($4.95) was a necessity.

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
Public Housing Tenants Trade Rents for Mortgages

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
IRA P. JACKSON, a 54-year-old clerk and mother of five grown children, will be writing her last rent check to the Jersey City Public Housing Authority this month. In August, Ms. Jackson will be closing on the two-family home she purchased with her daughter and son-in-law from the authority.
It is the same four-bedroom house she and her family have lived in for the last two years at the Dwight Street Homes, 50 two-family houses on scattered sites over three blocks in the city's Greenville section. Ms. Jackson will be the first resident to go from renter to owner, under a program sponsored by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development that enabled the authority to sell the homes to tenants who live there. 
 "This program gave me the opportunity to own a home," said Ms. Jackson, who has lived in public housing for 27 years. "Without it, I don't think I would have taken the chance."
Maria T. Maio, deputy executive director of the Jersey City Housing Authority, said the goal is that by 2000, all 50 of the two-family homes will be purchased by tenants. She said 15 more tenants are enrolled in the program.
The authority built the 100 apartments in the 50 town-house-style two-family houses, and has 400 more units in two- and three-family homes under way or planned. Forty of the homes will also be sold to tenants. All of the houses are part of the authority's plan to replace the apartments in six of the seven high-rise towers that it has razed or will raze at Curries Woods, a 712-unit public housing complex.
The high-rise complex, like others in New Jersey and elsewhere in the country, had become a symbol of a failed housing concept. Such projects were developed in the 1950's as an economical form of housing, but many of them -- beset by crime, neglect and mismangement -- became the dumping ground for the poorest of families. The Federal Government no longer supports the building of high-density housing towers.
Their replacements, like the Dwight Street Homes, are low-rise structures, which are considered more humane places for low-income families. High-rise buildings that can be are being renovated.
Housing officials in Washington are now accelerating efforts to encourage the sale of public housing, thinking that home ownership allows low-income tenants to take more control of their lives. It also supports the Clinton Administration's strategy to increase home ownership across the nation. Since 1993, HUD has approved the sale of 4,700 public housing units and plans to sell 25,000 more by 2000.
"This is a wise investment that strengthens families and helps more hard-working Americans enter the middle class," Andrew Cuomo, HUD Secretary, wrote in a statement. His department has several programs through which local housing authorities can help turn tenants into homeowners.
SUCH efforts are happening throughout New Jersey, which has 53,000 public housing units, said the Newark office of HUD. Newark is putting up 1,777 town houses to replace apartments in 12 of its high-rises as part of a 1989 settlement of a Federal lawsuit by a coalition of tenants and housing groups.
So far, 753 of the town houses have been built and occupied, and 196 more are in various stages of development, said Harry Robinson, a spokesman for the Newark Housing Authority. He said the authority was in the early stages of working with some tenants to buy their units.
The authority, using a $50 million grant from HUD, is also planning 630 more town houses, replacing apartments in high-rises that will be razed. As part of that effort, the New Community Corporation in Newark, among the state's largest nonprofit housing groups, will use a $25 million Federal grant to build 206 town houses that public housing tenants will be able to buy or rent with an option to buy. Work on the first 103 units is to start this fall. "This is another step in what we can do," said Msgr. William J. Linder, founder of New Community.
Paterson also received Federal money to raze two 10-story buildings with a total of 160 public housing units by the fall of 1998. Residents will receive Section 8 rent vouchers to move into private homes. Those vouchers, under pending Federal legislation, could be used to make mortgage payments, enabling tenants to buy homes, said Felix Raymond, executive director of the Paterson Housing Authority. He said the authority was also applying for Federal money to tear down another public housing complex, with 498 units. The plan, said Mr. Raymond, is to replace those apartments with an undetermined number of rental units and one- and two-family houses that will be sold to former tenants.
The idea of selling public housing to tenants has been tried before on a limited basis. In 1985, Brooks-Sloate Terrace, a 242-unit low-rise complex in Paterson, was one of 18 public housing authority projects in the country selected by HUD to take part in a demonstration to sell units to tenants. It was made a co-op, and in 1992 the Paterson Housing Authority turned over the complex to tenants. Today, 202 apartments at Brooks-Sloate have been sold.
In Jersey City, public housing residents at the Dwight Street Homes now have the chance to buy their units. The 50 vinyl-sided houses, with wrought iron fences and window shutters, look no different from other homes in the neighborhood. Each family has a separate front entrance to its three- or four-bedroom unit, with 1,100 to 1,200 square feet of space, and each unit has a small yard in front and back. Two-family homes "provide home ownership opportunities for low-income working families and retain rentals for those with lower incomes," said Ms. Maio of the housing authority.
The development was completed in 1995, and in the next two years the authority devised a plan, approved by HUD last month, to sell the units to eligible tenants. Twenty-five of the families earn no more than 80 percent of the median income in Jersey City, which translates into $35,000 for a family of four. The rest earn 50 percent or less of the median income, which is $24,000. Potential buyers must also complete a counseling program, covering such issues as money management and responsibilities of homeownership. Job training is also available. "It is a different approach that has the potential to be duplicated," said Diane Johnson, HUD's New Jersey coordinator.
The homes, priced at $140,000, will be sold first to the higher-income families "who have the financial wherewithal to buy and have a good shot at success," Ms. Maio said. Thirty-year mortgages at below market rate and zero percent down will be made available to eligible buyers through the New Jersey Housing Mortgage Finance Agency for $70,000. The Jersey City Housing Authority will provide a second no-interest loan for the remaining $70,000.
To receive the financing, buyers must agree to continue to rent the second apartment to public housing tenants, who if eligible will receive Federal Section 8 rent subsidies. That will make up the difference between what tenants now pay, which averages $225 a month, and market rents, averaging $800. Ms. Maio said the rental income is counted as part of buyers' income and will help them meet mortgage payments.
Buyers also must agree to live in the home for 10 years, and each year they do so the mortgage from the authority is reduced by 10 percent. If they leave before that time, there is a ceiling on the sale price that limits profit from appreciation.
Of buying one of the Dwight Street Homes, Ira Jackson said: "This is the begining of a new life for us. Something we can build upon for the future."

HEADLINE: Watershed Pact Brings Disputes And Lawsuits

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
THE ink had hardly dried on the landmark agreement to protect watershed areas north of New York City before the euphoria accompanying its signing began to wear thin.
When the land-use deal among diverse groups was completed earlier this year, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York predicted that it would serve as a national model of cooperation. 
 But by late last month, it was clear that some differences could not be swept under the rug.
On June 24, a State Supreme Court judge ruled that landowners have a right to file damage claims for lost property values resulting from regulations embodied in the agreement.
And controversy over whether to build a filtration plant for the imperiled Croton Reservoir has gathered steam, producing some unexpected bedfellows in the process and also generating a lawsuit on that issue.
Meanwhile, the construction industry, which is still reeling from a downturn several years ago, is bracing for yet more lean times because the watershed regulations limit where and how new building can occur. But the industry is also gearing up to fight back.
There is growing resentment among elected officials and the populace that the needs of Westchester and Putnam Counties were "shamefully neglected" in the deal, according to the Croton Watershed Clean Water Coalition, which represents several chapters of the Sierra Club, Friends of the Clearwater and other groups. "I don't think all is peaceful on the home front with this agreement," said Harold E. Vogt, president and chief executive officer of the Westchester Chamber of Commerce and president of the Alliance for Watershed and Water Quality Programs. "It may be a real disaster as it moves forward."
From the perspective of aggrieved property owners, a municipality should not be able to make decisions for the people it does not represent without having to compensate them, said Frederick J. Martin, a White Plains lawyer representing more than 80 plaintiffs in Westchester and Putnam Counties.
"It's like the old Revolutionary War cry," said Mr. Martin, a senior partner with Bleakley Platt & Schmidt: "No taxation without representation!"
The agreement was signed on Jan. 21 by the city, the watershed communities, the counties involved, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, the State Health Department, the state's Department of Environmental Conservation, the state's Department of State and some environmental groups. They agreed to a complex program to protect reservoirs feeding into the city.
Under the agreement, New York City said it would buy thousands of acres of land to shield its 19 upstate reservoirs from pollution, improve sewage treatment and subsidize so-called environmentally sound economic development.
The city also announced strict land-use regulations designed to protect the watershed area from further degradation.
But in a 55-page decision, Judge S. Barrett Hickman of the State Supreme Court in Carmel denied New York City's motion to dismiss the complaints of landowners affected by the regulations. The plaintiffs, many of whom are developers, are seeking financial compensation for lost property values, which they say result from the city's restrictions on new construction in the watershed.
"They have a lot to lose," Mr. Martin said of his clients. "The economic crux of the matter is that this land is extremely valuable from a development point of view."
The lawyer explained that while the city has the right to regulate use of the land, it also has the responsibility to compensate landowners.
Not everyone agrees with that line of reasoning. "If regulations preserve the quality of life, then property owners should be happy,"said David K. Gordon, a lawyer for the Hudson Riverkeeper Fund. "For most of us, this is a welcome plus."
And while few environmentalists would say that developing land is necessarily bad, their guiding principle is that such development should not degrade an area's natural resources.
"In other words, it's O.K. if you want to build a shopping center, just get out of the watershed," said William C. Harding, Town Supervisor for Somers. He was on the negotiating team that forged the watershed regulations, representing a mostly rural northern Westchester area known for its rolling hills, streams and meadows. The watershed area in Westchester includes the Muscoot, the Croton, the Amawalk, the Titicus and the Cross River Reservoirs.
Development interests, while not proposing chemical storage sites, are interested in shopping centers and housing developments, and they say that that kind of building can be done without harming underground water sources.
George Frank, the executive vice president of the Building and Realty Institute in White Plains, which represents 1,600 members in the real estate, home building, development and banking industries, said the regulations were harmful to healthy economic interests.
Explaining that the construction industry is slowly emerging from a recession that took place from 1992 to 1994, he said, "There's no need for these Draconian measures."
Edward R. Heelan, a realtor in Brewster and president of the Brewster Manor Development Corporation, which is a plaintiff in the property owners' suit, said both large developers and small land investors would lose their shirts because of the strict regulations.
"The politicians and the bureaucrats think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread, but many taxpayers and property owners are economically devastated," he said.
Another focus of controversy is whether to build a filtration plant for the Croton Watershed area east of the Hudson River. While the regulations are designed to avoid the need for a filtration plant for the Catskill and Delaware watershed systems west of the river, New York City is under orders from the Federal Environmental Protection Agency to build one for the Croton area.
Interests in favor of development say that New York City is one of the only cities in the world without such a filtration system. And since June 1993, the city has been in violation of the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act for failing to filter the Croton water.
In April, the Federal Government sued New York City in United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn for failing to build the $600 million filtration plant for the reservoirs east of the Hudson River, which supply about 10 percent of the city's water. The project has been in planning for 20 years but has been delayed by its high cost and disputes over where it will be built.
While environmentalists have often been at odds with the New York City Department of Environmental Protection over its policies and procedures, one group wants to align itself with the city in fighting the Federal lawsuit. The Croton Watershed Clean Water Coalition -- which represents groups from New York City, the Bronx, Westchester and Putnam Counties -- is seeking to join New York City in the suit.
Paul Moskowitz, president of the Huntersville Association, a neighborhood group in Yorktown, and a member of Friends of the Croton Watershed, said the coalition was opposed to filtration and supported tougher measures to keep the water pure.
"You have to prevent the problem to begin with, not try to deal with it after the fact," Mr. Moskowitz said.
He said the filtration issue was symptomatic of what he called a larger problem: that the Croton Watershed area was slighted in the agreement. "The heart of the problem is that we got neglected," Mr. Moskowitz said, explaining that New York City allocated $250 million to buy property in the Catskills but only $17.5 million for that purpose east of the Hudson.
Mr. Moskowitz and others have complained about that part of the agreement, calling it a token land-acquisition program, because in Westchester property values are so high that $17.5 million will not go very far.
There is also the worry that New York City will drag its feet in acquiring property and that its cumbersome bureaucracy is not up to the tasks outlined in the deal.
"There's a healthy distrust out there for the City of New York,"said Jeremiah R. Dineen, chairman of the Planning Board in Yorktown. "The city has been known to drag its feet. Its history has not been great."
Charles Sturcken, a spokesman for the city's Department of Environmental Protection, said New York was aware of its poor image and would seek to set matters straight. He said the department had hired more than 200 extra workers to implement the accord.
John R. Nolon, a professor of law at Pace University specializing in property and land-use issues, said it is difficult to predict how the watershed agreement would unfold.
"The issues here are huge -- the safety of drinking water, the ability of communities to develop their land and the rights of individual property owners to use their land," he said. "I think most people are taking a wait-and-see attitude on this."

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY;
Tracking Air Fares Across the Country

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The Domestic Airlines Fares Consumer Report, a new report from the Transportation Department calculates the average air fare between 1,000 pairs of cities in the continental United States and for each route identifies the average fare on both the dominant and least expensive airlines. For ticket buyers, the information is not as useful or reliable as what would result from a call to a competent travel agent, but it does provide a good overview.
For example, the survey showed that the average one-way fare from New York to Cincinnati was $244, with Delta, the biggest carrier, charging $274, and Continental, the least expensive, charging $199. But as the report notes, "airlines tend to offer a wide variety of prices in any given market and it is unlikely that the average fares from this report will be the same as any particular fare offered." 
 The report also gives the average cost of flying from various cities. Flying out of New York costs 16.7 cents a mile; it is 30.5 cents out of Charlotte, 27.0 cents out of Buffalo, 11.7 cents out of Phoenix and 9.3 cents out of Las Vegas. The difference is competition.
The department picked the city-pairs with the largest percentage price changes between the third quarter of 1996 and the same quarter in 1995. The biggest increases were Kansas City-Minneapolis (up 172.9 percent) and Boston-Philadelphia (up 90.8 percent). The biggest drops were Birmingham-Tampa and Fort Lauderdale-Tampa, both down 62 percent.
The department issued its first report on June 11, covering the third quarter of 1996, and said it would issue a report every three months. The cities covered account for about 70 percent of domestic air traffic.
The report is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.dot.gov/ost/aviation/ or from the Department of Transportation, Office of Aviation and International Economics, X-10, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590. MATTHEW L. WALD

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/After a Clean-Up, a $400 Million Paper Mill;
A New Life for a Polluted Old Bronx Rail Yard

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
THE 96-acre site at the southernmost tip of the Bronx, once a busy railroad yard, has sat unused for 25 years, its future clouded by the asbestos, hydrocarbons and lead left from its industrial past. Now, with an unusual alliance of developers working to revive the site, the asbestos and much of the heavily contaminated soil have been removed, and what remains will be paved over with clean material to seal up the remnants of pollution.
As a result of the clean-up, the site, which is owned by the state and leased to a private developer, is well on its way to redevelopment as a rail yard again as well as the site for a mill that will turn paper trash into clean newsprint. 
 But it has taken seven years to get to this point, most of it consumed dealing with administrative and legal issues. It is an indication of the difficulties inherent in re-using old industrial land with environmental contamination, usually called brownfields.
The Bronx rail yard is one of tens of thousands of such sites in cities across the nation that have sat idle as developers have flocked to pristine, former farmlands known as greenfields in the increasingly sprawling suburbs to build offices, warehouses and industrial parks.
Fear of the unknown is one of the great inhibitors to brownfield development. Who knew what had been dumped on the land during the 100 years the Harlem River Yard was operated by railroads? The operator, the Galesi Group, tested carefully and got lucky. The actual environmental problems were pretty straightforward and without any unexpected surprises, said Joseph Fiteni, a principal engineer with TAMS Consultants, which worked on the project. To start with, there was asbestos in the old railroad sheds, which had to be removed before the buildings could be demolished.
"There were six underground storage tanks which had held diesel fuel," he said. Surprisingly, none had leaked, but sloppy fuel-handling practices over the years had left the soil contaminated with a family of chemicals known as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, or PAH's.
Coal ash from the days when most structures were heated by coal had been used as fill on the site, and that, too, contained PAH's. And there were particles of lead from the days when leaded fuel exhaust spewed from the tailpipes of the cars on the Triborough Bridge, which bisects the site.
"This type of contamination is very common on old industrial sites," said Mr. Fiteni. "It could have been a lot worse if the railroads had done a lot of maintenance."
The solution was to remove the tanks and the contaminated nearby soil for disposal elsewhere. The remaining PAH-contaminated particles and lead will be kept from becoming airborne by being covered by parking lots and buildings or by two feet of clear fill in open areas. "This gets rid of the exposure pathway," Mr. Fiteni said.
THE proposed recycling facility, known as the NYC Paper Mill, is a $440 million project that is to take waste paper from the city's trash, remove the ink and form the cleaned fibers into rolls of newsprint.
The deal to build the mill is not complete, but the project has received political and financial support from the city and state, and dozens of engineers are currently at work specifying the details of the project. The exterior is being designed by Maya Lin, who is best known for her work on the Vietnam Memorial in Washington.
The mill is unusual because it would be in the middle of a city, rather than near forests where most paper mills are found. It is even more unusual because its principal developer is the Natural Resources Defense Council, a prominent environmental group.
Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist with the group, said the mill represented a change in environmental thinking. "We have spent years stopping projects and we are still not saving the forests," he said. "So we decided to do something more proactive to improve the way we use resources. And we also think if you can find a project that does something positive and produces a good financial return, industry will jump all over it."
"We intend to break ground before the end of the year and prove that major manufacturing is returning to New York City," said John A. Cavanagh, executive vice president of Morse Diesel International, the construction manager for the mill project.
Not only will the mill reduce the amount of trash the city must haul to a landfill, but it will also use 3 million gallons of water a day from the Wards Island sewage treatment plant, rather than scarce fresh water. The water will be cleaned, used, cleaned again and returned to Wards Island to help with the clean-up of Long Island Sound, which gets treated discharge from Wards Island.
Returning the land to productive use will provide economic benefits to the locality, people involved in the project say. "This site was vacant since 1972 and it was a blight on the poorest community in New York," said Anthony M. Riccio Jr., senior vice president of the Galesi Group, which has a 99-year lease on the site. "Now we are going to have a rail yard and a paper mill and we are going to provide jobs for the community."
The paper mill is expected to offer 600 full-time jobs, ranging from unskilled paper sorters to management engineers, as well as 2,200 construction jobs during the 24 months it will take to build the plant. Other jobs are expected to be available at the warehouses and solid-waste transfer station on the site as well as the rail yard. "I have a truck driver training program under way now," Mr. Riccio said.
T HE point was underscored by Michael C. Finnegan, counsel to Gov. George E. Pataki, who backs the paper-mill project. "One of the lessons learned is that brownfield development creates jobs where they are most needed," he said. "Another is that economic development and environmental protection are not incompatible."
Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, was more cautious. Although the project "has a lot of merit from the environmental, economic development and waste disposal perspective," he said, "there are still some hurdles to overcome." Among them is the need to negotiate a contract for the city to supply waste paper.
As with many brownfields, the progress so far at the Bronx site was more a result of determination by the developer than any exotic environmental technology. Galesi, which operates 8 million square feet of warehouse space in the Albany area, signed its lease in 1990, but is only now getting close to the point where building can commence.
Part of the delay was caused by a lawsuit brought by a local group that contended that any use of the land other than as a rail yard would illegally increase air pollution in the area. The group won in a lower court, but was unanimously overturned on appeal.
"New York is unique," said Mr. Riccio, who was the city's Commissioner of Ports, International Trade and Commerce in the late 1980's. "Name any issue, and I'll get 1,000 people to protest against it. There was so much misinformation. Because we had a certain type of permit, there was a rumor we were going to build an incinerator."
Recent improvements to the rail lines in the Bronx means that for the first time piggy-back freight cars, which carry complete truck trailers, can come directly into the city. As a result, about a third of the Harlem River site will be used as a rail yard. Trains will come into the yard, large forklift trucks will lift the trailers off and deposit them in a parking lot where they can meet up with a tractor for local delivery.
Mr. Riccio said the economics of putting 100 trailers on a single train versus 100 individual trucks being driven across the country should result in a sharp increase in rail freight arriving in the city. But that could create another problem. The city is a big importer of goods, but since it lost most of its manufacturing industry, it has little in the way of goods to export and railroads do not like to haul empty cars.
The solution is garbage. With the city committed to closing Staten Island's Fresh Kills landfill in the near future, there will be no local disposal place. So USA Waste, Inc. is building a transfer station to pack solid waste into containers for shipment by rail to distant landfills.

HEADLINE: At Hospitals, Construction Is Regaining Its Health

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON

 BODY:
RESPONDING to sweeping changes in the country's health-care delivery systems, hospitals in New York City and the surrounding region are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on construction projects designed to make health services more efficient for accountants and more attractive for patients.
Whether transforming a seedy parking garage on West 135th Street in Manhattan into a two-story outpatient clinic with 13 doctors or moving an entire hospital away from its urban setting in Meriden, Conn., to a vast new suburban campus across from a shopping mall, the region's hospitals are building again, according to architects and hospital administrators. 
 In the midst of a spate of mergers and affiliations largely dictated by the country's move toward managed care, the hospitals are, at the same time, stepping up their efforts to attract new patients in a race to gain market share. Increasingly, they are asking architects and planners to make the old hospitals function better -- and, in rare cases, to tear them down and rebuild.
In their new push to combine attractive design and convenience, the hospital buildings are changing. In suburban locations, parking is being made more convenient -- winding one's way through needle-thin corridors to the front entrance is considered a thing of the past. In some, main entrances are being moved to the back, right off the parking area.
In many hospitals, pre-admission testing is being moved closer to the entrance lobby for easy access. Admissions offices are being dismantled, with an emphasis on in-room check-in and "concierge" services. Maternity wards are moving to separate "women's wings" or "well-patient wings." Dormitory-style, multibedded rooms are out: Tomorrow's patients will almost exclusively be given private rooms.
In the new $780 million addition to New York Hospital/Cornell Medical Center, Fritz Reuter, New York Hospital's senior vice president for facilities/real estate, boasted of private rooms with the best views in the city and gestured Toward one room with floor-to-ceiling windows seemingly perched above the sun-dappled waters of the East River.
Another hospital executive makes the case for reconfiguration more bluntly.
"We didn't want our pregnant women -- who are, after all, perfectly healthy people -- bumping into some guy on a gurney looking like death warmed over," said Theodore Horwitz, president and chief executive officer of Veterans Memorial Medical Center in Meriden, Conn. Along with the rebuilding of hospitals, many of the millions of dollars will be spent by hospitals wishing, as more than one administrator explained, to cover their bets by attracting new, healthy enrollees in previously underserved neighborhoods to newly built centers that, like the one Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center is opening on West 135th Street, will be staffed by hospital doctors. The center is Columbia-Presbyterian's "first venture outside its traditional service neighborhood," an executive said.
There are many examples of buildings that are rising, among them the $107 million replacement-hospital project at Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut, where the existing main building, designed by Skidmore Owings and Merrill in 1951, will be demolished and a new, three-story traditional brick structure with a mansard roof is rising. On a smaller scale, Maimonides Hospital is building a $2.5 million medical center inside a former Beefsteak Charlie's pub a few blocks from the Lundy's seafood restaurant in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn.
Last year, an estimated $700 million in hospital construction was approved in New York State alone, according to Kristine A. Smith, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Health.
And there are even more projects in the planning stages.
In White Plains, New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center has just begun meeting with community boards and lining up approvals for a planned redevelopment of its existing psychiatric center on an elaborate and verdant 230-acre campus. When completed, what the hospital will call a Medical Village will include assisted living apartments, a treatment center for Alzheimer's disease and special care facilities for children -- along with posh retail shops.
"We're working to develop new retail space," Mr. Reuter said. "Like more and more hospitals, we're using our real estate assets as a source for maintaining the mission. To convert to new programs we need capital; without it, the places would die."
Faced with dramatic reductions in inpatient care -- reductions both in numbers of patients and lengths of stay -- the hospitals are retooling their architecture, both inside and out, to the patient of today: the outpatient, or the new breed of occupant: the "23-hour patient," who stays less than 24 hours, and because he or she is never formally admitted is not charged the hospital's rate for bed and board.
As one hospital administrator after another explained, the objective of hospital management has flip-flopped in the age of managed care.
"In the old system, if the hospital administrator walked around and saw all the beds were full, he was happy," said Cesar A. Perales, a former deputy mayor under David N. Dinkins who was hired by Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital three and a half years ago to develop its network of community sites. "Now, if he sees those same beds empty, he's ecstatic. Under the new system, he's getting paid per person -- it's called 'capitation' -- and the goal is not to use his resources, because they cost money."
IN the world of managed care, the goal is to sign up as many "heads" or "covered lives" as possible, and to treat them as cheaply -- and, as hospital executives stress, as well -- as possible. Just how to do that is something the hospitals are still trying to discover.
"There's a lot of uncertainty now," said Richard Sprow, the manager of health-care services at HLW, a large Manhattan-based architectural and engineering company. "It's a game of musical chairs -- will there still be 10 chairs left to sit in when the music stops? So hospitals try to be smarter to survive in the marketplace."
To entice "lives" to sign up, hospital administrators and architects who specialize in hospital renovation say appearances and convenience count.
"It sounds cynical, but one of the ways people will judge the quality of care is by a hospital's appearance," said Don Blair, the general manager of the New York office of Perkins & Will, a Chicago-based architectural company with the country's fifth largest health-care practice.
Mr. Blair, whose 80-person Manhattan office is currently working on 2.5 million square feet of renovated or new medical space around the region -- $314 million of health-care projects in the tristate area alone -- sees a new wave of capital improvements now being planned and started.
"After a hiatus of five or so years, the institutions are regrouping and beginning major capital projects," he said, following a time when money grew scarce -- and when available was used to finance information systems and "buying up doctors' groups and other hospitals; capital had been diverted away from major construction."
Hospitals in New York and the Northeast, he said, had generally lagged behind the rest of the country in following the recent health-care trends -- an opinion shared by many hospital executives interviewed. Mr. Blair singled out hospitals in California and the Southeast as being "far in front."
IN Meriden, Conn., a blue-collar community sandwiched between New Haven and Hartford, Veterans Memorial Medical Center is abandoning its inner-city buildings and will move one mile to a spot across from the Route 691 off ramp.
Mr. Horwitz, the hospital's president, explained that after considerable controversy among the city's residents, the hospital decided not to try to reconfigure its aging facility, where the 1920's main building sits across from a row of boarded-up single and two-family clapboard houses awaiting the wrecker's ball.
In contrast, the new hospital, designed by Perkins & Will, will be a sleek, low-slung trio of two-story pavilions -- with patients in beds on the second floors -- connected by a jazzy main floor galleria. At one end, a women's wing will have its own entrance; at the other end will be a helipad and emergency room. Running across one side is an attached wing of doctors' and administrative offices.
The attached offices -- which cost less to build than the main hospital largely because of different building codes -- are a new concept. In the past, patients might have been reluctant to get so close to a hospital for routine matters, feeling more secure visiting a doctor on the ground floor of an apartment house or on the first floor of a Victorian house on a side street near the hospital.
But in the managed-care environment, hospitals want to share in the new emphasis toward preventive care, by employing the primary-care and specialist doctors themselves and having them work in space the hospitals own or lease, or by renting them space.
In interviews, architects and administrators stressed that the hospitals of tomorrow -- even the reconfigured ones -- will not look like the hospitals of yesterday; they will have gallerias and shopping malls and food courts and exciting artwork. And they won't even be hospitals. They will be medical centers and medical villages. They will be streamlined, and they will be economical.
The cost to reconfigure the 330,000 square feet in assorted wings and additions of the old Meriden hospital, according to its president, would have come to somewhere between $50 million and $60 million -- spread out over the six to seven years it would have taken to phase in the renovations while keeping the hospital operating. "The debt service over six years was a fortune," said Mr. Horwitz. "That really put it over the top -- plus you don't know what you're going to find when you start tearing down walls."
The new 236,900-square-foot hospital, with a landscaped "Town Green" in front, three pavilions and 92 beds, will cost $74 million; financing costs, designers' and consultants' fees and new state-of-the-art equipment makes up $27 million of the total. Construction began last fall and will take about two years to complete.
Mr. Horwitz's comments echoed those of architects who say reconfiguring an existing hospital -- the only solution for many hospitals, especially in urban areas -- presents one of the hardest design tasks of all: to move patients and partitions around while the hospital is still up and running takes years, and millions of dollars.
Yet that is what a host of regional hospitals are doing, among them Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn and St. Vincent's Medical Center in West Brighton, Staten Island. "These two hospitals have very carefully targeted relatively small capital improvements, in their ambulatory (outpatient) care, in improving access and visibility," said Mr. Sprow of HLW. "Like all hospitals in the city, they no longer need as many beds. The question is what do you do with this space and make the best use of the investment."
The hospitals decided, Mr. Sprow explained, to accent what they did best: St. Vincent's decided to emphasize obstetrics -- "They were already a strong player and they decided to get even better," he said. So St. Vincent's added more nursery space as well as more pre- and postpartum facilities.
Lutheran Medical Center already specialized in obstetrics, the architect continued, but it decided to add 26 psychiatric beds; the reshuffle necessitated relocating the hospital's dialysis and AIDS units within the building. "It's a complicated domino effect to change over," Mr. Sprow said.
Maimonides Medical Center also focused on relatively small changes in its effort to gain -- or merely to keep -- the elusive market share. "We're not capital rich or heavily endowed," said Stanley Brezenoff, the president and chief executive officer of Maimonides. "Nor have we accumulated large amounts of cash. So, in looking at our needs, one thing we can't do, nor would it be advisable to do, given the changing health care picture, is to invest large amounts of money in new towers.
"We're looking to redevelop, to rework existing interior areas of our hospital as we reduce the length of stay and free up space," he continued, adding that this year, the hospital will spend between $12 million and $18 million on renovations and rehabilitation -- and on the equipment to fill the space.
The first thing Mr. Brezenoff mentioned was Maimonides's efforts to "upgrade patient amenities," including creating lounges for patients and their families. Then, he said, the hospital was "enhancing cardiac catheterization; that's one of our premier services, as well as improving radiology services." He said the hospital had just opened a newly designed emergency room -- a project that had received state and Federal backing.
Following the trend, Maimonides has also begun to open "a large number of outpatient facilities," he said. "we've opened a half dozen in the recent past, and there are several more scheduled." The new centers, he said, range from a Brooklyn Women's Center in Bay Ridge to a program for the Chinese-American community in Sunset Park, a few blocks from the main hospital.
The look and structure for these out-patient centers varies, largely depending on location.
In one of the new satellite centers Columbia-Presbyterian is planning, expanding a medical practice inside the Fort Washington Houses -- public housing for the elderly -- the hospital is boosting the number of examination rooms from four to eight, knocking down walls, changing the entry staircase to a ramp, and using gentle yet contrasting colors as directional markers -- all for a cost of $500,000.
At Columbia-Presbyterian's new 15,000-square-foot center in the parking garage on West 135th Street near Broadway -- a $4.5 million project that has not yet been officially announced -- Mr. Perales said, the design is to be different from that of the hospital's other, smaller neighborhood clinics.
He compared the preliminary design -- with a dramatic staircase to replace the parking ramp, skylights and Caribbean colors everywhere -- with another older center uptown. "This is boring," he said, walking around the older clinic, painted in beige and gray. "This is drab."
AT New York Hospital, no one could say the $780 million, 11-story limestone and brick Maurice R. and Corinne P. Greenberg Pavilion is drab. It is the last of the mega-projects left over from the 1980's, when money was flowing and deluxe pavilions and wings were going up all over town.
"We're the last of the dinosaurs," Mr. Reuter said jokingly, referring to the glamorous new wing, which added 850,000 square feet to the 1.8 million-square-foot 1932 main hospital, designed to resemble the Palace of the Popes in Avignon. The new pavilion, designed by Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, with Taylor Clark Architects, takes its design cues from the earlier building but is totally contemporary. An 11-story structure built on a platform over the F.D.R. Drive, it has, according to the hospital, "as much floor space as the Chrysler Building."
Following the horizontal trend in hospital design, the 776-bed pavilion will cluster related health problems on one floor, regardless of their levels of severity -- an approach called "disease-cluster." Thus, heart patients will all go to the same floor, whether they are there for intensive care, surgery or recuperation. Seven hundred computers will be installed in the pavilion, with voice-recognition software that will let doctors and nurses dictate reports, creating, according to the hospital, "a virtually paperless and filmless environment."
New York Hospital has also reconfigured its ambulatory care, diagnostic services and offices within the main hospital -- and branched out. "We've gone from a 1,000-bed teaching hospital to 7,000 beds in 20 facilities, one in Westchester, two in Brooklyn, two in Queens," Mr. Reuter said.
Although boutique services like plastic surgery may make up some of the revenue lost by the decrease in inpatients and length of stays, the hospitals need these offshoots and satellites. "We're not going to pay off a $600 million debt with new noses," Mr. Reuter said wryly.
In addition to the enormous debts many of the large urban hospitals amassed in the 1980's, today's medical advances -- which hospital executives stress are also responsible for bringing down the length of hospital stays -- are wildly expensive. "To get a machine that can zap a tumor costs $8 million," Mr. Reuter said. "Some hospitals are going out of business, so we have to be big and strong."
He and other hospital executives listed a spate of major and minor hospitals that are reported to be discussing mergers. The architects keep track, too, and recite the reports; when two hospitals merge, there is usually money spent on a new master plan -- and the construction that grows out of it.
Even without a merger looming, hospitals are commissioning master plans. Mr. Blair of Perkins & Will said his firm was discussing master plans and/or major construction with two large New Jersey hospitals, along with other institutions in the region.
IN Greenwich, the hospital's board of trustees pushed aside one master plan, made in 1992, which called for an addition to house outpatient services as well as a significant renovation of existing space. By the next year, the board decided it needed another master plan and commissioned Perkins & Will, which wrote that: "In examining the future market potential for the hospital under a managed-care model, it was determined that the majority of the existing facilities were unable to accommodate changing technologies and operational strategies."
The new 325,000-square-foot hospital building -- in the traditional style requested by the hospital's board, according to its architect -- will include what the architects call an innovative "universal patient room" for patients at various levels of risk; clusters of private rooms, and a Day Recovery Center, with 20 rooms devoted to short stays. Harold Mindell, the hospital's executive in charge of the project, said that they were just getting ready to finish the steel infrastructure and that the hospital project would be finished in 2000. Mr. Mindell said the new hospital would be licensed for 160 beds, 100 fewer than the old hospital.
At Maimonides, a 705-bed hospital, Mr. Brezenoff worries about the rush to compete that is at least partly the reason for so much construction -- and, he says, so much money spent on advertising. "In the end, the results might not be in the public interest," he said, pausing often to consider his words. "What if something of high quality is in the wrong part of town or for other reasons, it doesn't succeed financially? That kind of free market is not always the result of a rational health-care planning process."
Mr. Brezenoff argued that the hospitals, instead of competing for market share, should instead cooperate. "We're spending money to advertise, Methodist is spending money to advertise, Staten Island is spending money to advertise. We're all scrambling, and there's a wealth of health-care dollars being spent."
Nevertheless, he said, the money spent on reconfiguration, new equipment, new buildings and new community centers -- designed not only to save money but to make the patient's experience a shorter and more pleasant one -- is different.
"The emphasis is on primary care, the breaking out of the hospitals and moving into the community, the emphasis on serving the patient," Mr. Brezenoff said. "Now that does make health-care sense."

HEADLINE: THE GREAT OUTDOORS;
Working Out The Bugs

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

DATELINE: TOMS RIVER

 BODY:
YOU'RE relaxed at last. You're finally home from work; the martini is in your hand, beautiful in its chilled magnificence, and you're looking out over the lawn, your lawn, your empire -- oh, yes, it is an empire, whether it is a postage-stamp plot or an acre expanse -- and you have this sense of well being, of richness. The look and smell of the grass (not to mention the taste of the juniper berries) stir in you a primeval feeling of being one with the earth.
In a neat, manicured way, of course. 
 But what's this?
A section is browning out.
All of a sudden, you have visions of microscopic creatures eating your grass, chinch bugs or bluegrass billbugs invading the turf you have nurtured with seed, fertilizer and water, an army of army worms hiding out in the thatch during the day and sneaking out at night to chomp, chomp, chomp away at blades and stems and the very core of your feelings of harmony.
So who ya gonna call?
Deborah Smith-Fiola, for one.
Experts like Dr. Smith-Fiola, an associate professor at Rutgers University and its cooperative extension agent assigned to Ocean County, are available to every New Jerseyan. And as the county agriculture agent, she and her horticultural specialists and the volunteers she has trained to answer the horticulture hot line receive lots of calls -- 3,500 last year to the volunteers known as master gardeners.
"They range from 'Why is my lawn dying?' to 'I've got spots on the leaves of my tree; what do I do?' " said Dr. Smith-Fiola, 37, who from childhood in her native Maryland wondered why plants grew and why they died, fascinated by the mystery of ecology.
"Or 'I found this insect in my kitchen; what is it?' Or 'Do I spray?' People often ask, 'What do I spray?' and often we try to talk them out of spraying. To 'What is eating my vegetable garden?' All kinds of crazy things."
Cooperative extension agents in each of New Jersey's 21 counties offer advice on agricultural productivity, food science, nutrition and health, marine and coastal resources, the environment and natural resources, and individual and community resource development.
Some, like Dr. Smith-Fiola, are agriculture agents. Each county has at least one. Others specialize in family and consumer sciences (formerly called home economics) and 4-H youth development.
Under the Smith-Lever Act passed by Congress in 1914, land-grant universities like Rutgers have been able to extend their educational programs into the community through financing by state, county and Federal governments.
"I Fear No Weevil," says one sign on the partition of Dr. Smith-Fiola's crammed and cluttered office in the two-story agricultural center building on Whitesville Road here. "Entomologists Get the Bugs Out," asserts another.
Dr. Smith-Fiola is the state's expert on integrated pest management, which involves using non-chemical alternatives, like microscopic worms called nematodes, to attack insects. She received a bachelor's degree in horticulture in 1981 and a master's in entomology and integrated pest management in 1985, both from the University of Maryland.
Shortly after joining the staff in 1989, she began the master gardener program to handle the calls more efficiently. Each year she trains about 40 volunteers, many of whom answer phone questions, educating the public about ticks and Lyme disease and doing diagnostics, which means analyzing problem plant samples and bugs.
There is not much farming in Ocean County (the No. 1 crop is hay, she says), so much of her time is spent consulting with "the ornamental horticulture industry" or, "the green industry," which, she adds, is the state's No. 1 agricultural industry in terms of gross receipts. This includes landscapers, "turf grass professionals" (the guys who cut the grass), arborists (tree guys) and groundskeepers (for golf courses).
In recent years, as landfill space for grass clippings has dwindled, Dr. Smith-Fiola has conducted meetings, classes and field inspections to encourage professionals to practice mulching, leaving clippings in the lawn.
She also shares the latest information on horticulture from Rutgers researchers like her husband, Joseph Fiola. "My husband is now the small-fruits specialist," she says. "He does grapes, raspberries, strawberries."
A majority of questions in April, May and September deal with lawns. "When should I fertilize my lawn?" (Fall.) "What is the proper time to water my lawn?" (Midnight to 8 A.M.) "If I mulch, will it increase my thatch?" (If done properly, absolutely not.)
"Do you have a lawn?" she is asked.
"Yes."
"So how does your lawn look?"
"Well," she said, "I've got melting-out disease on my lawn. It's a common disease right now. It starts off with a little spot on the leaf blade, and it works its way down. It's a fungus. It spreads with water. It works down to the crown, and it can girdle the plant and kill it. The lawn kind of turns a bleached color, an off-white color."
"What do you do about it?"
"I take pictures of it," she says, ever the scientist. "I can use it in classes later on."

HEADLINE: GOVERMENT AND POLITICS;
New Rules On Custody: Will They Aid Children?

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH SEYMOUR

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Two months after the State Supreme Court released sweeping revisions to New Jersey's child custody guidelines, experts are at odds over what the effects will be. Some say the changes could actually harm the children they were intended to protect.
At the center of the dispute is whether the amount of time noncustodial parents spend with their children should be linked to the financial support paid to the primary, or custodial, parent. 
 Under the court's "shared-parenting" philosophy, which takes effect on Sept. 1, noncustodial parents, who are overwhelmingly fathers, will be eligible for a reduction in their child support payments if they can prove that their children spend the equivalent of two nights a week with them throughout the year. They must also prove that they are feeding their children, paying for their transportation and providing them a room to sleep in.
Some lawyers said they applauded the adjustment for recognizing that child-rearing is increasingly shared by two parents. Others said it would taint the process by using money to encourage parents to spend time with their children.
"Visitation has to be decided without regard to money," said Nancy Goldhill, a senior attorney at Legal Services of New Jersey. "New Jersey's really making a big policy change to so directly interweave them and there can be negative consequences from that."
Child support guidelines were first drafted in 1986 so Family Court judges throughout the state would have a uniform method of deciding financial issues in custody disputes. The guidelines have been updated three times since then. The current revisions were drafted by the Supreme Court's family practice subcommittee in March 1996 and were announced this May.
"In terms of overall fairness, they're the best we've ever had," said Richard A. Russell, a former chairman of the family law section of the State Bar Association.
Too often, advocates of the change said, the court awards seven days of child support a week to be paid by noncustodial parents, who also incur expenses whenever the children are in their care.
"It is an attempt to mirror reality," said Mark H. Sobel, the current chairman of the bar association's family law section.
In many cases, the reduction would seem to be marginal. For example, a father of two children would pay $172 in child support a week if his weekly gross income is $630 and his ex-wife's is $500. If he were eligible for a shared parenting adjustment, his support payments would drop $28, or about $1,450 a year, court officials said. Any adjustment would be revoked if the custodial parent's net income, including child support payments, did not exceed 200 percent of the Federal poverty guidelines.
At least 20 states have adopted shared-parenting credits as part of their child support guidelines, court officials said, and a recent New Jersey custody case may have sparked particular interest here.
In 1995, the State Supreme Court rejected James Pascale's request to have his child-support payments lowered because his three children spent a significant amount of time with him. Mr. Pascale's lawyers argued that he did not want to pay less child support; he wanted to spend some of the money when the children were in his care.
Despite the ruling, the court's opinion did acknowledge that a custody arrangement could be so nontraditional that a judge might need to deviate from the guidelines.
John P. Paone Jr., who represented Mr. Pascale in the trial court, said that the case was the genesis for the court's new approach to the issue. But like many lawyers interviewed, Mr. Paone said he is concerned that in the attempt to be fair to both parents, money will now take precedence over children's interests in visitation arrangements.
"It's a problem, putting a price on visitation," he said. "Even though that's not the intent, that's what could happen."
Mary E. Coogan, a lawyer with the Association for Children of New Jersey, one of the state's leading advocacy groups, says a child's standard of living could be jeopardized under some shared parenting arrangements. The custodial parent could receive less money to care for the children, she said, while the noncustodial parent is granted a credit insufficient to provide a significantly higher standard of living for the child.
"At some point, the kid is losing in both households," Ms. Coogan said.
Judges and lawyers are undergoing training sessions to learn the new guidelines before they go into effect. Payments to some children will increase, mostly because the economic formula used to calculate awards has been updated. The court also is expanding the reach of its guidelines. In the past, basic child support awards were not drafted for families with combined annual incomes of more than $52,000. In those cases, child support payments were made at the judge's discretion. The new guidelines will apply to families with combined incomes of up to $150,000.
The 276,000 existing child support orders will not be subject to the new guidelines. But parents who already pay child support could seek to modify their agreements if other factors, such as income, have changed.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Tax Negotiators to Seek a Win-Win-Win Deal

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AFTER promising for months to deliver substantial tax cuts to Americans for the first time in 16 years, the House, the Senate and the White House now have all completed detailed plans to reduce Federal taxes on families, investors and others.
Unfortunately for taxpayers trying to determine what breaks are coming their way, or to prepare for the coming changes in the tax code, the plans vary in many ways. And you cannot just take one from Column A, another from Column B and a third item from Column C. In the process of drafting a final version that President Clinton will be willing to sign, a number of difficult and unpredictable trade-offs will be necessary. 
 The proposals can be viewed only as a rough guide to what will be enacted. Even specific provisions that are common to all three versions may be changed.
Still, it is clear that the final legislation will include certain elements. All sides have agreed on a credit to families for each child. Capital gains tax rates will be reduced. Some students will get credits for some college costs. The use of individual retirement accounts will be expanded.
Negotiators from the House, the Senate and the Administration are scheduled to start meeting late this week to fashion out of their differing plans a compromise package that they hope will give all sides enough to enable everyone to claim victory.
In general terms, the Administration will be pressing Republicans to shift the tax cuts away from higher-income taxpayers. Republicans will keep up their argument that tax relief should go to those who pay the most in taxes, and that the legislation should not be used to redistribute income.
One of the big fights will be over capital gains. Mr. Clinton particularly wants to strip out the provision in the House bill that would allow investors to index their capital gains for inflation starting in 2001. Indexing would become extremely expensive to the Treasury in later years, and could be difficult for both taxpayers and the Internal Revenue Service to administer. The odds are that Mr. Clinton will prevail.
Mr. Clinton seems less likely to win his fight to limit the capital gains rate reduction for upper-income taxpayers. His proposal to exclude 30 percent of capital gains from taxation would reduce the effective top rate just fractionally -- to 27.7 percent from 28 percent -- for taxpayers in the top 39.6 percent income-tax bracket. Both the House and the Senate bills would bring the maximum capital gains rate down to 20 percent and create a 10 percent rate for people in the 15 percent income-tax bracket.
Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, strongly supports a broad expansion of the I.R.A. program. But Administration officials argue that savings incentives primarily benefit the affluent, since they have the most money to save. But while the White House wants to limit the expansion of tax breaks for savings, it has signed on to the concept of educational savings accounts for college-bound children.
Even where there is broad agreement, there are differences in detail that could prove difficult to bridge. The Administration would phase out its proposed $500-a-child credit for families with incomes above $60,000, while the Republican bill would start the phaseout at $110,000. Mr. Clinton wants a more generous credit for the first two years of college, while Republicans question whether the credit would do anything more than fuel tuition inflation.
Scores of narrow provisions could be of immense interest to particular groups. Most of those might be dropped, but several could sneak in when the final deals are struck, probably in the wee hours of an early morning in late July just before Congress adjourns for its August recess.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Dissecting the Competing Proposals"
Negotiators from the House of Representatives, the Senate and the Administration are working to reconcile three competing plans for changes in the tax code. Here are some ways the plans compare.

HEADLINE: Tax Spending, Not Savings

BYLINE: By Bruce Bartlett; Bruce Bartlett, a senior fellow with the National Center for Policy Analysis, was a Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary in the Reagan and Bush Administrations.
Frank Rich is on leave. His column will resume in November

DATELINE: GREAT FALLS, Va.

 BODY:
One can hardly pick up a personal finance publication these days without reading another story about how baby boomers are not saving enough for retirement. Yet our Federal tax code encourages consumption rather than saving.
Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has long advocated a national consumption tax, and has long been ignored. Now a growing number of economists and legislators are showing interest in the idea. Once the current tax legislation is out of the way, Mr. Archer says, his No. 1 goal will be to push such a plan. 
 To a large extent, the tax code's bias against saving is deliberate. When the existing code began to take shape in the 1940's, the memory of the Great Depression was still fresh. Keynesian theories, which view spending as the driving force in the economy and saving as a drag on growth, were triumphant. Federal officials rejected a national consumption tax for fear that it would stifle spending.
As a result, the United States has long had one of the most pro-consumption, anti-saving tax codes among the big industrialized countries. Our tax code looks kindly on debt, but we discourage people from putting money away by taxing returns on savings and investment. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, only Canada has a higher average tax rate on capital -- savings and investment -- than the United States.
Not surprisingly, the United States and Canada also have the lowest rates of saving among industrialized countries. In 1996, Americans saved just 5 percent of their after-tax income; Canadians saved 4.6 percent. By contrast, Italians saved 13.4 percent of their income, the French 12.8 percent, the Japanese 11.9 percent, and the Germans and British 11.6 percent.
In the long run, countries that save more tend to have higher standards of living. More domestic saving is associated with higher rates of investment, which in turn is associated with higher rates of productivity.
Growing concern that Americans are not saving enough has led to new interest in consumption taxes. There are only two things people can do with income: save it or spend it. The idea behind a consumption tax is to tax what people spend, rather than what they save. This can be done directly, through some form of a tax on goods and services, or indirectly, by not taxing investment income.
Countries can directly tax consumption in two ways. One, widely used in Europe, is to impose what is known as a value-added tax on goods and services -- a tax levied on producers that is incorporated into the price they charge consumers. The other way, which Mr. Archer favors, is a national sales tax, much like the sales taxes most states have.
Indirect approaches to taxing consumption can also take different forms. Bipartisan legislation was introduced in the last Congress that took this approach. Under that plan, taxpayers would have received a deduction for all savings. And a flat tax proposal supported by the House majority leader, Dick Armey of Texas, would eliminate taxes on savings and investment returns.
All of these approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, and once lawmakers get serious about the goal of taxing consumption rather than saving, they will have to consider such issues as the simplicity and fairness of a new tax system.
The time is right for a consumption tax. Rather than merely bemoan the difficulty Americans seem to have in saving for the future, why not make it easier for them to do so?

Gauging the Bulls in Latin America

BYLINE: By DAN COLARUSSO

 BODY:
IN the first half of 1997, Latin American stock funds produced some of the world's best returns. But whether that run will continue depends upon budget questions in Brazil, the aftermath of Mexico's elections today and investors' willingness to continue to see the stocks in the rallying region as attractively priced.
Stock markets in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Chile and Peru have been powered so far this year by a wave of privatizations, other economic and fiscal changes and increased flows of foreign capital. Those forces helped the Morgan Stanley Institutional Latin American A fund to post a 44 percent return in the first half of 1997, while Morgan Stanley Latin American A jumped 43 percent and the T. Rowe Price Latin America fund gained 41 percent. 
 Indeed, excluding specialty funds, Latin American stock funds accounted for 8 of the 10 top-performing funds during that period, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago fund trackers. Even the worst performer among the 28 Latin American funds that Morningstar follows, Wright Equifund -- Mexico, was up 24 percent through June 30.
The play in the first half was clearly Brazil, where the markets benefited from the Government's decision to privatize several key companies, including Telebras, Electrobras and Petrobras, respectively the telephone, electric and oil and gas companies.
Such privatizations, which are also taking place in Peru and Venezuela, can free enterprises to become markedly more profitable. Five years ago, state-owned Telebras, a staple holding in many Latin American funds, charged just 70 cents for monthly telephone line rentals; in 1997 Telebras was charging $10.
In addition, some fund managers say the region's rally is on firmer ground than in past upswings. For one, Latin America's economic growth this time is fueled in large part by exports and foreign investment, which are steadier sources of growth than domestic consumption.
The managers say the good times are also a product of long-needed changes by dedicated governments that have finally mastered their fiscal policies, from privatization to currency management.
Patti Satterthwaite, manager of the Fidelity Latin America fund, visited Brasilia in April and "was amazed at how consistent the reform story was" among all levels of government. "There's a strong commitment," she said.
Moreover, the poor performance of Asia's emerging markets may mean that Latin America will compete mostly with Central and Eastern Europe for investor dollars earmarked for developing lands. That may keep capital inflows high.
But there is wariness as the region heads into the second half of 1997. "Latin America looks good -- fairly good -- but not as good as early in the year," said Arjun Divecha, the manager of the GMO Emerging Markets Equity fund.
Mark Haet, a Latin American portfolio manager for Bankers Trust, agreed. "We should get 10 percent to 15 percent" from the region for the balance of the year, he estimated.
Many managers of Latin American funds worry that Brazil may be bedeviled by its budget deficit -- the provinces are a big financial drain on the national government -- and worries that its currency is somewhat overvalued.
MOREOVER, while Ms. Satterthwaite said that the Brazilian market might continue its upswing, buoyed in part by a state auction of cellular licenses and continuing privatizations, the fact is that Bovespa, the Brazilian stock index, has already risen 75 percent since January. And while the index was trading at 12 or 13 times earnings early this year, it now carries a multiple of 16. That is not quite the 23 of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, but Brazil is, after all, an emerging market.
The run-up may lead some investors to see Brazil as no bargain, and it has made Mr. Divecha ambivalent. He is wary of overplaying Brazil, but acknowledges being "chastened by what's happened in the U.S. market in the past couple of years -- the momentum can just keep pushing it up."
In the search for greener pastures that is typical of long-rallying regions, Mr. Haet's firm began to lighten up on Brazilian stocks in late April and to add some more Mexican positions. Similarly, Mr. Divecha has grown neutral on Brazil and bullish on Mexico.
Mexico's market has yet to return to the levels it reached before the 1995 peso crisis; indeed, with the index carrying a multiple of 14, many fund managers say Mexican stocks are undervalued.
Mr. Divecha added that Mexico's gross domestic product was growing and inflation falling. Some consumer stocks have gained sharply in this strengthening economy, Mr. Haet said, with Grupo Femsa, a beverage bottler, up more than 70 percent since January, for example. Experts also expect construction companies, like Cemex and Tribasa, to benefit from a recovery.
But Mexicans are voting in nationwide elections today, and the long-reigning Institutional Revolutionary Party is expected to sustain big losses. Managers expect a period of "uncertainty as the PRI learns to share power," said Robert Meyer, who along with Andy Skov, manages the Morgan Stanley Latin America fund. And some managers, like Ms. Satterthwaite, appreciate the private sector's efforts in Mexico but are disappointed by the Government's slow pace toward economic change.
"As a nation, Mexico has been left behind by the rest of the region," she said. "The reform hasn't been as robust."
Behind these fears, of course, managers are doubtless thinking about all those big, risky shifts, because of politics or economics, for which emerging markets are famous.
"When economies restructure," Mr. Meyer said, "it's often two steps forward and one step back."

HEADLINE: Condemning Nike Plants Won't Prod Change

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Regarding Bob Herbert's June 27 column on my report on Nike's overseas labor practices: 
 I was reluctant to get involved with Nike in its Asian shoe conflicts because it would inevitably put me back into the "reasonable moderate" role I agonized over throughout my civil rights career. I plead guilty to idealism and optimism, but I have been through too many human rights battles to be called naive.
Condemning people in the South or South Africa, however guilty, never produced much change. Helping them create a new relationship with a "no fault" analysis set them free to be part of the process of change.
I found Nike's staff in Asia idealistic, sports-centered, socially isolated Westerners struggling with the demands of production. Their focus was quality control, without which there would be no jobs for anybody. They tried to avoid micro-management, and this was possible because there were no "systematic abuses."
Young women in their late teens and early 20's are supervised largely by women in their late 20's or early 30's. This isn't "management by terror," as critics say. It's management without adequate training or language skills. Nike has agreed to get involved and try to change the process.
Nike's critics deserve credit for raising these issues, but continued condemnation of the same few incidents among a work force of several hundred thousand will cause people to stop listening or close factories.
The salary issue is seen by many as the primary structural abuse. I do not feel qualified to determine a living wage in Vietnam or Indonesia, but workers spoke, on and off factory grounds, of saving money and sending it home. Western clothing, motor scooters and the roadside merchants at factories, even where food was provided, did not give the impression of "starvation wages."
I believe that the United States and the world need a globally integrated economy. I am determined to facilitate that because it generates jobs at home and opportunity abroad.

A Successful Bond Navigator Sees Calm Waters

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY MIDDLETON

 BODY:
MOST bond-market strategists have been worried about higher interest rates this year. Not William H. Gross, manager of some of the fixed-income industry's best-performing and most consistent portfolios.
"I think the next move by Greenspan and company will be down as opposed to up," said Mr. Gross, the strategist in charge of fixed income for the Pacific Investment Management Company, known as Pimco, of Newport Beach, Calif. "This probably will not occur until we are well toward the end of the year, or maybe early in 1998, but we could wind up the year at 6 percent on the long-term U.S. Treasury bond." 
 If he is right about the plans of the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, a decline from the current level of around 6.75 percent would have implications for equity investors as well.
Mr. Gross, who oversees $92 billion of fixed-income assets, or 84 percent of Pimco's $110 billion total, has been called "the Peter Lynch of bonds" by Newsweek magazine, in reference to the former manager of the Fidelity Magellan fund (though Mr. Gross shrugs off the comparison because, he noted, Mr. Lynch's upper lip is bare while his own sports a mustache).
MR. GROSS has been bullish on the bond market all year, but that hurt in the first quarter, when bond prices were down. But it paid off in the second quarter, when the average long-term Government bond fund -- the bellwether portfolio -- rose 4.27 percent, delivering nearly a year's worth of returns in only three months.
Indeed, Mr. Gross has been betting on lower interest rates since they spiked up in 1994, during the last round of Fed tightening.
Earlier this year, when the Fed nudged rates up, his optimism backfired for shareholders of the several bond funds he manages.
But the first quarter's weakness was more than erased by a rally in the second period, when the Fed declined to raise rates further -- as it did again on Wednesday. Over the first half, Pimco Low Duration rose 4 percent and Pimco Total Return gained 3.65 percent, surpassing the 3.1 percent return of the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond index.
Two funds that Pimco manages for other firms, Fremont Bond and Harbor Bond, also beat the index. The Pimco funds have five stars, the top ranking for risk-adjusted performance, from Morningstar Inc., the fund researchers in Chicago, and the other two have four stars.
"I think it's hard to talk about fixed-income managers without his name being the first one mentioned," said Mark Wright, senior analyst at Morningstar, of Mr. Gross. "Pimco's developed one of the best track records in the industry, consistently and over a long period of time."
Mr. Gross, 53, has spent his entire financial career with Pimco, which specializes in debt securities. He joined the firm as a securities analyst after receiving a master's degree in business administration in 1971 from the University of California at Los Angeles. A 1966 graduate of Duke University, Mr. Gross served three years as an engineering officer in the Navy and six months as a professional blackjack player in Las Vegas, Nev.
"It was blackjack that got me interested in securities markets," he said. The mathematics, memorization and gamesmanship that fuel success in one endeavor work equally well in the other, he said. "When I found out you could beat the house at blackjack -- and you can -- it encouraged me to test my skills in financial markets."
Mr. Gross was originally interested in equities, he said, but when he got out of school the competition for fixed-income jobs was less keen. "I only got two job offers when I got out of U.C.L.A., and this was the better of them," he said.
In his 26 years with Pimco, Mr. Gross has observed debt markets when inflation was surging, as it was in the 1970's, and when it was ebbing, as it was from 1981 through 1994. Each swing of the pendulum suggested a particular approach to investing. But in the last three years, he said, the market has been transformed in a way that requires a third, fundamentally different approach to bond investing.
He compares the first two eras to the turbulent Mississippi River, and the new one to Butler Creek, a placid stream near his boyhood home in Middletown, Ohio.
"Butler Creek is premised on a range-bound world -- of interest rates between 5.5 percent and 7.5 percent on the long-term U.S. Treasury bond," he said. "If interest rates are range bound, and move more like Butler Creek than the Mississippi, then what an investor should be concerned with would not be price movement, which was the focus of the 1970's and the 1980's and the first part of the 1990's, but more on yield." The yield on bonds moves in the opposite direction to the price.
When interest rates are either rising or falling, the resulting change in bond prices is the principal risk in bond investing. When interest rates are relatively stable, the higher yields paid by long-term bonds more than compensate investors for the added risk of owning them. "The art of bond management is taking the appropriate risks at the right time, and it seems to me that in this Butler Creek environment, one of the best ways to take risk is to lengthen the maturity of your portfolios to some extent," he said.
For example, he noted that the relatively low yields of money market securities could be improved, with very little additional risk, by investing in short-term bonds. Money market rates are currently about 4.5 percent. The Pimco Low Duration fund, which owns bonds with maturities of one to two years, is yielding about 6 percent. "So you pick up one and a half percentage points in yield by taking a slight extension risk in maturity," he said.
Another tactic for increasing a bond portfolio's yield in a range-bound environment is buying mortgage-backed bonds rather than Treasuries, Mr. Gross said. For example, a five-year Treasury note is currently yielding 6.4 percent, but a Government National Mortgage Association bond of similar characteristics yields 7.5 percent.
This strategy would be dangerous in a choppy bond market, Mr. Gross acknowledged, because mortgage-backed bonds are volatile when rates are in flux.
OF course, taking some even bigger risks is another way to plump up a portfolio's returns. Mr. Gross said the higher yields of junk and emerging-markets bonds -- which he said were running 8.5 percent to 9.5 percent -- make them attractive for a small portion of an investor's portfolio.
"We own at Pimco about a 5 percent position in emerging markets," Mr. Gross said.
Mr. Gross said he expected interest rates to ebb to 6 percent this year because inflation had been all but obliterated.
Wages, the biggest component of producer prices, are constrained by unusually high increases in productivity, he said. "The owners of machines and the owners of information are benefiting at the expense of labor, which suggests a surge in productivity, and it suggests, importantly, a continuing lid on wage rates -- and that's the perfect environment for a bond holder," Mr. Gross said.
The supply-demand equation is also benefiting bonds, he said. Because of a shrinking deficit, the Treasury is issuing only about $100 billion of fresh debt annually. But it is also paying $250 billion in interest on the debt, most of it immediately reinvested. "When you've got $250 billion chasing $100 million of new issuance, prices go up," he noted.
Higher bond prices mean lower interest rates, which vary inversely to price. This phenomenon is most visible in very short-term rates, which are around 5 percent for three-month Treasury bills. That is less than the overnight borrowing rate among banks, set by the Federal Reserve at 5.5 percent. Ordinarily, that rate is the lowest in the marketplace because it is for the shortest term.
Mr. Gross's new paradigm in bond investing has implications for equities, too, he said. He noted that in 1981, before the historic rally in stocks began, the average share traded at a price 10 times its annual earnings. Now the ratio is around 20.
"The reason p/e ratios have doubled has not been because the boomers have been starting to save for retirement," he said. "It's because inflation and interest rates have dropped so dramatically."
But interest rates are low, having come down more than 8 percentage points since the bull market began in the early 1980's. Indeed, if rates fell that far again, they would reach the unlikely level of zero.
"What that means is that from this point forward, you're down to the earnings growth of corporate America," he said. "I would suggest that based on a number of fundamental economic arguments, we're back down to this 7 percent earnings growth world, which produces a very attractive return for stocks, but not anything close to what we've had for the past 15 years."
Matching his deeds to his words, Mr. Gross said that he recently reallocated the assets of his personal 401(k) plan to 75 percent bonds and 25 percent stocks, from a 50-50 split. "That's a reflection of my attitude that bonds are more attractive than stocks at this point in time," he said.
Still, even Mr. Gross is making changes gingerly, rather than rushing headlong into the new environment. He reduced the duration, or effective average maturity, of the portfolio of the intermediate-term Pimco Total Return fund to 4.9 years from 5.4 years in the first quarter, and has not yet extended it.
"Actually, we're waiting for the appropriate entry point," he said. "When yields are slightly higher, closer to 7 percent, we plan to increase that duration to about five and a half or even close to six years, if chance affords the opportunity."

Why Fix What's Not Broken?

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
INVESTORS who were grumbling at the year's start and threatening to funnel their mutual fund money into index funds are singing a different tune now. While the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index still holds an edge, rising 19.49 percent in the first half of the year, the market's riches flowed over all types of stocks in the second quarter.
The results are a far cry from those of the first three months of the year, when investors could barely eke out decent returns anywhere apart from the S.& P. stocks. And it is a testament to the value of carefully constructed long-term portfolios and the ability to stick by them during tough times. 
 That has been the approach of the five professional money managers who created hypothetical retirement portfolios for The New York Times, and they have been justly rewarded for keeping the faith.
"What a difference a quarter makes," said Harold R. Evensky, an investment adviser in Coral Gables, Fla., whose portfolio rose 10.4 percent, to place fourth for the quarter. "It restores one's belief in diversification."
Mr. Evensky said that when he called the manager of one of his holdings, Compass Small Cap Growth, to discuss its 20 percent loss in the first quarter, the manager said he believed in what he was doing and planned no changes. That belief was vindicated: Compass roared back with a 21.7 percent gain. And Mr. Evensky's other first-quarter drags have also bounced back.
He conceded that balancing funds whose returns are poorly correlated with one another in a single portfolio may never produce eye-popping returns. But, he added, "it's comforting for those who have a long-term market view and whose goal is enjoying life and sleeping well."
Diversification is particularly good for these tricky times, agreed Eric M. Kobren, president of Insight Management and the editor of Fidelity Insight, an independent newsletter in Wellesley, Mass. The economy looks solid, but investors, who continue plowing money into mutual funds, face two gnawing questions, Mr. Kobren said: How much better can the economic environment get? And how high can the market value of the largest public companies rise?
"While nirvana may continue for a while longer, I feel very comfortable spreading my bets around in small-cap value, real estate and international stock funds," he said.
MR. KOBREN, who invests solely in Fidelity funds, took third place for the quarter, with a portfolio return of 11.6 percent. His top performer was Fidelity Dividend Growth, up 16.5 percent this quarter. He said its new manager, Charles Mangum, had transformed it into a more typical, large-cap growth fund.
Mr. Kobren cautioned that his laggard, Fidelity Real Estate, up a meager 5 percent this quarter, "serves as an anchor in the portfolio and that it should not be expected to reproduce last year's extraordinary gains." Over all, Mr. Kobren said he was happy with his portfolio and was not planning any changes.
Indeed, only one of the managers is planning even minor adjustments. The five portfolios have risen an average of 80 percent since they were created four years ago. That compares with a 119.6 percent cumulative four-year return for the Vanguard Index 500 fund, which mimics the S.& P. 500.
The performance of the hypothetical portfolios is tracked each quarter by Lipper Analytical Services, of Summit, N.J. It excludes sales charges, transaction costs and tax considerations because most retirement money is held in tax-deferred accounts. The five managers can choose any fund open to new investors and can shift money quarterly, though the portfolios are intended to grow for 20 years.
All five portfolios made money in the second quarter, with an average gain of just over 12 percent. Still, just one came close to the 15.4 percent average for diversified domestic equity funds followed by Lipper.
That portfolio is the "socially responsible" fund assortment created by Jack A. Brill, a San Diego investment adviser. It rose 15.1 percent for the quarter, helped by a large chunk in the Domini Social Equity fund. That fund owns stocks that meet certain social criteria and are culled from the S.& P. 500 and from the second 500, to mimic the sector distribution of the S.& P. 500 as closely as possible, and also include small- and micro-cap stocks. Domini gained 17.3 percent in the second quarter.
"During the past year, screening out tobacco stocks helped the Domini Social Equity fund outperform the S.& P. 500," Mr. Brill said.
John Rekenthaler, the publisher of Morningstar Mutual Funds in Chicago, was particularly pleased with the performance of his portfolio, which was up 14.4 percent and ranked second this quarter. "Since many of these funds fare relatively well when stocks are declining, I'm very happy with their bull-market results," he said.
Mr. Rekenthaler is the one manager who is altering his portfolio for the third quarter, but the change is small. "My portfolio is already heavy on the smaller-company and international stocks that have somewhat lagged the past few years' gains, so I'm already tilted toward those assets that I think are ready to play catch-up," he said.
He will replace Third Avenue Value with Third Avenue Value Small Cap, a new offering managed by Martin Whitman, who runs the original fund, and by one of his proteges, Curtis Jensen. "I love the idea of a smaller, nimbler version of Third Avenue Value," Mr. Rekenthaler said.
His hypothetical portfolio may not be changing much, but its management is. Mr. Rekenthaler is leaving Morningstar to join the John Nuveen Company as its vice president and manager of its investment strategies. For the next quarter, his portfolio responsibilities will be assumed by Susan Paluch, the new editor of the Morningstar Investor newsletter.
Sheldon Jacobs, who edits the No-Load Fund Investor in Irvington, N.Y., retains the overall lead among the five managers, with a gain of nearly 98 percent since the exercise began, on July 7, 1993.
But for the second quarter, his portfolio was in last place, even though it rose a respectable 8.8 percent. Mr. Jacobs says he is comfortable with his portfolio as it is.
"It's about at the level of risk I want, and while some of the funds didn't do as well in the second quarter as they had done in the first quarter, you have to stay with your selections," Mr. Jacobs said. "There is a lot of rotation in the market."

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Chevrolet Camaro SS;
At 30, Still a Diversion for Consenting Adults

BYLINE: By MARSHALL SCHUON

 BODY:
THE car is spectacular, I'll give it that. It is a 30th-anniversary Camaro SS, Arctic white with "hugger orange" stripes, a houndstooth interior, huge tires and a snarling V8 under the hood. It is a car for superlatives. But at the moment it was totally inadequate.
"Let's try the stroller this way," I said to Mischa, rearranging things under the gaping hatch for, perhaps, the fifth time. And it fit, sort of. 
 Mischa is my daughter-in-law, visiting from her native Germany with my grandsons -- Hunter, 3, and Travis, 3 months -- and I was making good on my promise to take Hunter fishing. I dote on Hunter, you understand, and I am very proud that he is bilingual. Actually trilingual, if you count the "dises" and "dats" that sprinkle his English with what seems to be Brooklynese.
But this lovely car was not cooperating. Camaros are not made for two adults, two children, a pair of child-safety seats, a stroller, a tackle box and a couple of casting rods. And I realized why, given all the cars I have owned, I have let three decades of cramped Camaros pass me by.
I surveyed the remaining space and asked Hunter to pass me the bucket of worms.
"I do dat," he said.
This seems, incidentally, to be a year for anniversaries, what with America's oldest nameplate -- Olds, fittingly -- marking its 100th birthday; with Saab and Ferrari turning 50; with Toyota celebrating 40 years of sales in the United States, and with Mercury marking the 30th year of its Cougar with the announcement that this year's model will be the last, at least for now.
But the Camaro, along with its Pontiac Firebird stablemate, which also turns 30 this year, occupies a special corner of America's sporting heart. The Ford Mustang beat the G.M. models to market by more than two years, establishing the name for the pony-car group, and others like the Plymouth Barracuda grabbed the public fancy for a while. But the Camaro and Mustang and Firebird have been the stalwarts and survivors, and each has gotten better with age.
Dick Almond, Chevrolet's brand manager for Camaro, says the biggest problem with sporty cars has always been high insurance rates. But he said improvements in safety and anti-theft systems are making the cars more attractive to customers, and he sees a resurgence in sales of performance models. "Camaro has dropped out of the list of the 10 most-stolen cars," he said. "But it still offers something most cars don't -- it's flat-out fun, and the acceleration, cornering and handling are alive and well."
Still, the popularity of sporty cars has declined over the years and they now represent only about 8 percent of the passenger car market. Eight states, including New York, account for almost half the sales. The others are Florida, California, Texas, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
When the Camaro appeared in 1967, the craze for agile personal cars was in full flower. Its name, one of about 5,000 considered, is loosely based on the French word for comrade, and its friends over the years have been legion. As of now, more than 4.2 million Camaros have been built.
There have been just four generations of the car, beginning with the series that lasted from 1967 through 1969. Those cars, based on the Chevy II, were offered as coupes and convertibles, and prices started at a paltry $2,466. And while those little originals have become classics, the later models proved the staying power of good design.
In February 1970, the Camaro was radically restyled as a more aerodynamic coupe, and that design sold for a dozen years. In 1982, a new model rolled out with more chiseled lines, and the convertible returned in 1987 after an 18-year absence.
The current car has changed little since its birth in 1993, and it can be had in four flavors: plain Camaro, Camaro RS, Z28 and -- for the first time in 24 years -- as an SS, which stands for Super Sport. All are available as coupes, convertibles or T-tops with removable roof panels.
Prices, including delivery, start at $16,740 for a coupe with a 3.8-liter V6. That engine has just one more cubic inch of displacement than the six-cylinder '67, but it produces 200 net horsepower, compared with the original car's 140 gross horsepower. An anniversary-model Z28, with a 5.7-liter V8 that puts out 285 horses, is a bargain in today's market at $23,461. And the glowing orange-and-white SS test car, with an air-induction hood that lets the engine suck cool air and produces 305 horsepower, had a sticker that said $27,460.
Considering the car's power, fuel economy is reasonable, rated at 16 city, 27 highway. The SS likes 92-octane premium, but it will make do with less. And the big money buys more than zoom. There are the extra niceties of a beefier suspension, a limited-slip differential, a Hurst shifter for the six-speed stick, a 12-disk CD changer for the 200-watt stereo, and very nice floor mats.
Chevrolet says the Z28 will go from zero to 60 in 5.3 seconds, and the SS shaves that figure to 4.9. This is one quick car, but for all its strength the V8 can be amazingly civilized -- at least when you are at the wheel. For anyone behind the car, the thunderous exhaust is wondrously anti-social.
In fact, the SS is almost worth buying just for the sound, and it reminded me of the time I recorded half an hour of exhaust tunes at the rear of a friend's '59 Corvette. Call me crazy -- my wife did -- but I could sit on the couch and listen to that car all night. This Camaro is like that.
It is more fun on the road than on the couch, of course. The car's 17-inch wheels carry tires that are 9 inches wide, and the suspension glues the chassis to the asphalt -- as long as the surface is dry. In the wet, the tires' large contact patches spread the Camaro's weight over the water and send the car skittering. One must be careful, too, when approaching driveway ramps or when parking head-on against a curb; the low air dam in the front often scrapes bottom.
This is, of course, a toy. It is not meant for bad weather or as a family's only car. And as a toy, it is splendid. For 1997, there are new bucket seats, with contours redesigned to relieve fatigue on long trips. A new dashboard is swoopier and friendlier to the driver. There are four new cup holders and an extra lighter socket for your coffeepot (or, more probable, for your radar detector).
The body, mostly plastic and built on a steel unit-frame, is solid and relatively quiet, and even the 56-inch-wide doors don't judder or creak in the way of older Camaros. Those huge doors also make getting into the back seat less of a chore, and there is more room back there than any past pony-car could boast.
That still doesn't make it a vehicle for a fishing expedition. And, no, we didn't catch anything, but we had a good time. When we got home, Hunter ran for the house, stopped and looked back. Waiting for me, I thought. But what he said was, "I want dat car."
 
INSIDE TRACK: Even at 30, a teen dream for all of us.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;
The Roller Coaster Known as Micro Cap

BYLINE: By ANNE TERGESEN

 BODY:
MICRO-CAP mutual funds took investors on a wild ride this spring.
Since a brutal correction last summer in the market for small stocks and for its micro-cap subset, investors have favored blue chips. From January through April, funds specializing in micro caps -- stocks of companies with market values of less than $250 million -- trailed those investing in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by an average of about 14 percentage points. 
 In fact, the micro-cap funds had an average loss of 5.6 percent during that time, compared with an 8.8 percent gain for the index funds.
That prompted Satya Pradhuman, manager of United States quantitative analysis at Merrill Lynch, to wonder whether managers of the most beaten-down portfolios retained enough confidence to seize the opportunities he saw coming. "Investment managers have been traumatized," Mr. Pradhuman wrote in early May in a report to investors.
By the end of May, such concerns seemed misplaced. Almost overnight, the smallest stocks had transformed themselves from Wall Street's wallflowers into the life of the party, taking the funds that invest in them along for the ride. But when blue chips returned as the market leaders in June, investors were left to wonder whether May had been a cruel reminder of the short-lived surge in the spring of 1996 or the start of a long-awaited revival.
Such volatility is far from unusual. An analysis by Prudential Securities of data compiled by the University of Chicago's Center for Research in Security Prices shows that micro caps have historically posted ups and downs that are 87 percent more extreme than those of large stocks and 26 percent greater than those of small caps -- stocks with a market value under $1 billion.
The swings can increase sharply when fund managers shun diversification as a risk-management tool. American Heritage, a micro-cap fund that, like a lot of such funds, is too small to be included in many newspaper and other listings, posted a 78 percent return so far this year, largely on the back of one tiny stock. It plowed more than half its $18.1 million in assets into Senetek, a British company that says it has a treatment for male impotence.
The bet-the-store gamble paid off as Senetek's stock racked up a big percentage gain this quarter, rising from $3.38 to $4.50, but investors would have little cushion if the stock turned south. And the fund has an annual total return of just 2.2 percent over the last three years, suggesting that its valleys can be just as off-the-charts as its reported peaks.
"We are what you call a high-risk fund," said Heiko Thieme, the chairman and manager of the fund, defending his tendency to make heavy bets. "The very reason why we are up is that we remained focused."
Besides being highly volatile, the fund is also one of the most expensive around, charging fees of 6.25 percent of the fund's assets to defray overhead and other expenses, versus about 1.5 percent for the typical micro-cap offering.
Even diversified micro-cap funds can sometimes be a nightmare for impatient or risk-averse investors. Those who pulled money out of the Bridgeway Ultra-Small Company fund in response to its 3.6 percent loss in February missed out on gains that have left the portfolio up 20.6 percent for the first half of the year, when the average return for all diversified domestic funds was 13.1 percent, according to Morningstar. The Bridgeway fund concentrates on companies with market capitalizations of less than $100 million.
Micro-cap funds are particularly risky because of the speculative nature of many of the small companies they invest in. Stephen Janachowski, a co-founder of the investment advisory firm Brouwer & Janachowski, based in Tiburon, Calif., said the markets they trade in tend to be illiquid, adding to the volatility.
Those factors make micro caps a poor choice for investors unable to wait at least five years for returns, Mr. Janachowski said. He recommends that individual investors cap purchases of micro caps at 5 percent to 20 percent of a portfolio.
Although their outsized volatility makes small and micro-cap stocks notoriously difficult to predict, many market analysts argue that the fundamentals -- including a strong economy and a strong dollar -- are in place for a rebound in both sectors, which tend to move in tandem.
Other analysts point out, however, that these conditions have existed for some time but have yet to fuel a sustained micro-cap rally.
BUT even if micro caps fail to ride along with the current bull market, history suggests that patient investors will be rewarded. Since 1926, according to Prudential, micro caps have outperformed the rest of the market; their compounded annual returns of 12.6 percent were higher than the 11.8 percent for small caps and the 10.2 percent for blue chips.
"This is a great time to be looking at micro-caps," Mr. Pradhuman of Merrill Lynch said. With the heady multiples at which blue chips are now trading, he said, small stocks offer an opportunity to hunt for bargains and to diversify.
Mr. Pradhuman says small-cap stocks, including the micros, are cheaper relative to blue chips than they have been since the end of a small-stock bear market in 1990. Based on ratios of stock prices to sales, he said, micro-cap stocks are trading at about 0.32 times the average for large caps. That is 16 percent cheaper than the 0.38 they hit in 1990, the previous low for the decade.
Micro-cap funds are also relative bargains. Investors must now spend an average of $25.16 to receive $1 in earnings from funds that invest in the largest stocks, compared with $27.30 for small-cap stocks and $23.43 for those specializing in micro caps, Morningstar says.
Also working in the sector's favor is a proposed cut in the capital gains tax rate, said Claudia Mott, director of small-cap research at Prudential. If history repeats, she said, after a correction in one quarter, small stocks will rally by more than their large counterparts. That, she added, is because the smallest companies typically deliver returns in the form of price appreciation, or capital gains, rather than dividends.
On balance, advisers say, another positive factor for the smallest stocks is the recent decline in initial public offerings. Although deprived of high-flying small stocks they can sell at a quick profit, micro-cap mutual funds can benefit because investors interested in small stocks then turn their attention to existing issues, pushing prices higher.
With all these promising signs for micro caps, the only missing piece of the equation is earnings growth, Ms. Mott says. If analysts polled by the First Call Corporation are correct, after two years in which earnings improved too slowly to justify the higher risk of investing in small stocks, profit growth at small companies will outstrip that of market leaders by more than 10 percent this year and next.
The strength of the dollar argues in favor of that outcome, because a strong dollar squeezes profit margins on multinationals, which tend to be more reliant than small companies on exports. But skeptics argue that hopes for the smallest stocks could again be dashed by overly optimistic earnings projections or rising interest rates, which tend to punish small- and micro-cap stocks more than their larger counterparts.
 I'M not convinced that we're ready for a big-league period of outperformance," said Peter Canelo, an investment strategist at Morgan Stanley.
Mr. Canelo also notes that although conditions have been favorable to the smallest stocks for some time now, the stocks continue to lag behind blue-chip stocks. "I admit to being kind of mystified as to how some of these traditional relationships haven't been working," he said. "The strong economy doesn't help; the strong dollar doesn't help."
The lesson, he added, may be that in an increasingly integrated global economy, bigger is better.
Whatever doubts investors may have, they seem to have put them aside: The Russell 2000, the benchmark measure for small-cap companies, reached an all-time high on June 19.
Mr. Pradhuman argues that the current environment favors both growth funds, which invest in companies with above-average profit growth, and value funds, which pick stocks selling at discounts to their assets. The economy is strong, which is a plus for value funds, but not strong enough to ignite the rising interest rates that undermine growth funds, he said. If he is correct, that should reverse the poor performance among growth funds that has been responsible for most of the recent lag in small caps, he added.
Bruce Baughman, portfolio manager of the Franklin Group's Value and Balance Sheet Investment funds, says that it is only a matter of time before the rich price-earnings ratios of blue chips persuade investors to switch to smaller stocks. These days, Franklin's two value-oriented funds, which invest where they see value regardless of the size of the company, are heavily weighted in micro-cap companies, a greater number of which meet their criteria of selling near or below a discount to book value adjusted for overstated assets and under-estimated liabilities.
Mr. Baughman's portfolios are among this year's top 10 micro-cap performers, with the Balance Sheet fund, now closed to new individual investors, up 15.3 percent and the Value fund up 16.4 percent.
John Montgomery, manager of the Bridgeway Ultra-Small Company fund, which closed to new investors last month, said computer models that dictate his hybrid growth-value strategy showed early in the year that there were good deals to be found.
"When people start writing that the small-cap phenomenon is dead, that's the time to invest," he said.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;
Funds That Staggered as the Market Danced

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
GOOD news is no news for mutual fund investors these days, as seven years of sizzling stock market performance have conditioned millions of Americans to expect strong gains as a matter of course.
Mutual fund returns that just a few years ago would have had investors salivating are now greeted with a shrug, or even a yawn. Indeed, a new survey by Montgomery Asset Management found mutual fund owners confident that they would make 26 percent a year from their funds over the next decade, far more than the 10 percent that most market seers have suggested is reasonable. And who can blame investors for these expectations, given that over the last 12 months, the average stock mutual fund has gained almost 22 percent, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund trackers in Chicago? 
 So the real news, in the dog days of 1997, is not the fact that broad-based stock funds soared 14 percent in the second quarter of the year, or that almost every kind of stock fund, at home and abroad, posted double-digit gains, or even that bond funds turned in strong performances.
No, the man-bites-dog angle arises from the fact that in one of the greatest bull markets in history, a few funds have nonetheless managed to lose money in the last year or two or five. Not many funds, mind you, and it was certainly no mean feat, given that during the last five years, stock mutual funds as a group have averaged annual returns of almost 17 percent, international funds almost 12 percent and taxable bond funds roughly 7 percent.
That such funds are still around is perhaps even more astounding, given that investors usually flee seriously lagging funds. Their proprietors then generally close them, or fold them into other, better-performing funds, eliminating their poor track records.
The funds that have hung in there despite poor performance sometimes specialize in sectors -- like gold -- for which some investors still have hope. Others are one-time top dogs that suffered temporary but severe setbacks, like some high-octane funds that invest in small companies and are still trying to recoup losses they suffered last year and early this year. A handful of losers are just quirky.
And other dogs are simply, well, dogged. "I would guess that the laggards would typically be described as stubborn," said A. Michael Lipper, the longtime fund watcher who is president of Lipper Analytical Services. These funds are typically run by managers of a bearish bent who are convinced that the stock market is due for a crash -- and who have been waiting a very long time.
"We've been bearish so long I hate to admit it," said Charles L. Minter, who runs Comstock Partners and its two mutual funds, Comstock Capital Value, which is down an average of 5 percent a year for the last five years, and Comstock Strategy, which has eked out meager gains of 2.9 percent a year in that period.
Mr. Minter and his late partner, Stanley D. Salvigsen, achieved a certain renown on Wall Street for their economic and market forecasts, particularly for predicting the "rolling recession" in housing, which hit various parts of the real estate market in the late 1980's.
COMSTOCK turned negative on the American stock market in 1990, and has been betting ever since that stocks would fall. "I do believe that if the stock market continues to go up, we will wind up having to go out of business," Mr. Minter said. For him to become bullish on stocks, he said, the market would have to fall 30 percent or more.
The results of sticking to his convictions have been painful for Mr. Minter. The funds, which once had more than $2 billion in assets, have shrunk to less than $500 million. Losses have been so severe that the funds now have more than $200 million in potential tax benefits, which have become one of their main selling points. Future profits, if there ever are any, would be sheltered from taxes to some degree.
And Dreyfus, the big fund company that once sponsored one of Comstock's funds, basically jettisoned it last year after Dreyfus's longtime (and perennially bearish) chairman, Howard Stein, sold the company to Mellon Bank. The company also revamped its other bearish fund, Dreyfus Strategic Growth, in 1995; that fund is now an aggressive-growth vehicle. "We have no bearish funds at Dreyfus," a spokeswoman said.
Though few of the so-called bear funds have been around, or stayed around, as long as Comstock's, a few cubs are on the prowl, and they have all had terrible years. Lindner Bulwark dropped 18.4 percent in the last 12 months, for example, and Rydex Ursa, which is sort of an index fund for bears, fell 20.2 percent.
Then there is the Mathers Fund, which has pretty much eschewed stocks in favor of cash for the last decade; it is the worst-performing diversified stock fund for the last five years, its annual gain of just 1.4 percent barely beating cash under the mattress.
Another losing strategy, especially lately, has been trying to "time the market," as Wall Street puts it; this means trading in and out of funds to try to catch the peaks and avoid the valleys. In the last quarter, three funds in the Rightime fund family, which, as its name implies, uses a timing strategy, suffered losses of 0.9 percent to 1.9 percent.
Though the mutual fund business has become increasingly corporate over the last decade, there are still a few of the more eccentric entrepreneurs who became famous (or infamous) in the 70's and early 80's, before the big boom in funds. Charles Steadman, who is about to turn 83, continues to run four funds that have long been too small to be listed in this newspaper. They have, however, compiled one of the worst investment records on the planet. (Over the last decade, Steadman Technology and Growth has lost about 90 percent of its value.)
Then there is Fundamental's New York Muni Fund, which is the only fund investing in tax-exempt bonds to post a loss for the last five years, falling an average of three-tenths of a percent a year, according to Morningstar. (The average municipal bond fund made more than 6 percent a year.) Lance M. Brofman, the fund's founder and manager, said he was not sure whether the fund had indeed lost money during the five-year period. In 1994, the fund plunged 20 percent because of a wrong-way bet on interest rates.
AS a group, the biggest bow-wows of the 1990's have been gold funds. Over the last five years, precious-metals funds have averaged gains of 5.5 percent a year, barely beating money-market funds. Hardest hit have been funds that specialize in the shares of mining companies in South Africa, which have been beset by labor problems; U.S. Global Gold Shares has an annualized loss of 13 percent a year over the last five years.
Why, then, do investors keep what Lipper Analytical reckons is more than $4 billion in gold funds? For the investors known as gold bugs, gold investing is practically a religion; for others, who may also be stockpiling canned goods and shotgun shells in their basements, it is a hedge against apocalypse.
But for many others, it is simply a way to diversify on the off chance that inflation picks up again, said Jeffrey S. Molitor, principal and director of portfolio review at the Vanguard Group, which runs the biggest gold fund, one that returned an average of 4.2 percent annually over the last five years.
True, inflation has been falling for several years, and hovers just above 2 percent. (In the late 70's and early 80's, when gold funds were hot, inflation topped 10 percent.) But "should we see some upward movement in inflation, there is a reasonable chance of the portfolio doing better than bonds," Mr. Molitor said. And while gold may not seem like a promising bet, inflation has been known to rise, while it would take an unprecedented economic boom to produce the 26 percent annual returns that mutual fund investors said they expected in the Montgomery survey.
Just to prove that every dog has its day, the beleaguered Japanese stock market appears to be staging a small comeback, as does the country's currency. Funds that invest in Tokyo were the best-performing group last quarter, zooming 20.4 percent. Nevertheless, investors who took the plunge in 1996 have probably not fared well, given that the funds are still in negative territory for the last 12 months, down 5.6 percent.
To some extent, the recent recovery may be what Wall Street calls a "dead cat bounce," meaning that anything that falls far enough is likely to rebound a bit. But over the next three or five years, Japan may be a good investment, because "the momentum is building for Japan to come to grips with its problems," said Elizabeth Allan, who is co-manager of the publicly traded Scudder New Asia fund, as well as the Japan Fund, one of the hottest funds of the quarter.
In the short run, Ms. Allan, who has more seniority in her post than many of her competitors, is cautious, suggesting that "the market could take a breather here." She still finds "lots of good opportunities in Japan, if one is very selective," she added, "and I say selective because there are still a lot of companies that will experience a lot of challenges going forward."
With the United States stock market hitting new highs -- the Dow Jones industrial average closed on Thursday at 7,895.81, up 100.43 -- it may be tempting for investors to put their money into areas that have failed to perform well, like the stocks of basic industries, utilities, coal mines or real estate firms. But some experts warn against it.
"I think there's a bit of a trap investing in dogs," said Jeffrey M. Applegate, the chief investment strategist for Lehman Brothers. "You have to ask yourself, why should basic industrial stocks suddenly outperform? What's the fundamental case?"
But Mr. Applegate thinks there is still plenty of time for investors to get into the winning areas of the stock market. Concern about the length of the bull run is overblown, he said, adding that by his calculations, which look at economic cycles, the current bull market is by no means the longest or biggest in history.
"If you're in U.S. equities, continue to enjoy the rally," he wrote recently. "If you're not, we don't think it's too late to come in. After all, records are meant to be broken."

HEADLINE: The Greening of Gambling's Golden Boy

BYLINE: By JON CHRISTENSEN

DATELINE: LAKE TAHOE, Nev.

 BODY:
"HE can't back down," said Steve Wynn, the chairman and chief executive of Mirage Resorts Inc. "I'll throw my body in front of the train."
Mr. Wynn had leaned close to buttonhole a board member at a meeting here in March of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, but his forceful stage whisper carried around the room, just as he had intended. "We sent a message to those guys," he said. "And as long as I'm around, we won't back down." 
 Mr. Wynn is used to getting his way. The strong-willed and hot-tempered head of one of the country's biggest gambling companies, he has built a string of hugely successful casinos in Las Vegas. He recently beat Donald Trump in a court battle over an access road that will pave the way for his triumphant return to the Atlantic City waterfront. And he is building the biggest casino on Mississippi's Gulf Coast.
He has also been flexing his muscles lately around Lake Tahoe, the popular gambling center and recreation area straddling the California-Nevada border, 350 miles northwest of his home base of Las Vegas.
But while Tahoe seems like a natural setting for yet another of his gargantuan gambling palaces, Mr. Wynn's tough talk at the planning board meeting had nothing to do with winning a building permit.
To the contrary, Mr. Wynn is on the board. What he was so emphatic about was water, specifically the once-pristine waters of the 250-square-mile lake that anchors the region. And the "train" he was so ready to throw his body in front of is the armada of Jet Skis and other so-called personal watercraft that he says are dumping large amounts of unburned fuel in those waters, contributing to the alarming pace at which the lake is losing its celebrated clarity. Ten days ago, he got his way, when the board voted to ban the machines from the lake starting in two years.
Steve Wynn, master developer of mega-casinos, meet Steve Wynn, hard-core environmentalist.
The man who runs a casino that sports a "live" volcano out front and another that pits pirates against the British Navy in lifesize ships every other hour says he is now worried about the excesses of development. And not just in Tahoe, where he owns a sprawling vacation home next door to Michael Milken's and serves as Nevada's at-large representative on the planning agency's 15-member governing board.
He has also spread the message to Las Vegas, a symbol to many of American overbuilding in full flower and a city that Mr. Wynn developed as much as anyone.
"It's time for us to slow down and think about where we're going," Mr. Wynn told a gathering of business executives and civic leaders there earlier this year. The breakneck pace of development that has made Las Vegas the fastest-growing city in the country for more than a decade is leading to "quality problems," he said.
Mr. Wynn the environmentalist is even about to take the national stage, when President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore visit Tahoe on July 26 and 27 for a meeting on how business and regulators can cooperate to protect the environment. Mr. Wynn, seen by some as an effective symbol of such cooperation, is expected to play a "substantial role" at the conference, said Jim Baetge, executive director of the Tahoe planning agency.
All of this has plenty of interested players -- environmentalists, casino competitors and gambling industry experts, not to mention Tahoe and Las Vegas residents -- putting down bets about what is going on.
Some question how a developer as dedicated as Mr. Wynn could suddenly reveal a deep green streak. They wonder whether his apparent commitment to the environment camouflages a more complicated agenda.
The possibilities are as varied as Mr. Wynn's interests. Did he join the board to protect his multimillion-dollar investment in a vacation paradise, and to do the same for Mr. Milken, a friend who helped finance his meteoric rise in the casino industry? Is he trying to win points with the Government at a time when a new Federal commission is starting hearings on the social and economic effects of the spread of legalized gambling? Is he simply trying to keep Tahoe at bay -- and put Las Vegas on hold -- now that his most expensive casino, the $1.4 billion Bellagio, is rising on the Vegas Strip, making him the biggest boy by far on the block?
"For him to say we should control growth is not that sincere when you consider that his business not only stems from all this growth but creates part of it," said Rick Nielsen, director of Citizen Alert, an environmental group that has fought growth in Las Vegas for years. "If he's sincere about protecting national treasures and being an environmentalist, he doesn't have to go all the way to Lake Tahoe to get involved. We've got Lake Mead, which is only 20 miles from Las Vegas."
John Smith, a columnist for The Las Vegas Review-Journal and the author of "Running Scared: The Life and Treacherous Times of Casino King Steve Wynn" (Barricade Books, 1995), is another skeptic. Mr. Wynn became involved in Tahoe "initially to protect his investment," Mr. Smith speculated. "I'm sure he has feelings about the environment. But Steve's world is about power and control. He won't do anything he can't control."
Others who know him or have followed his career disagree. This is a sincere new side to a complicated man, they say. The son of a compulsive gambler who died in debt, Mr. Wynn has spent his life fulfilling his father's dream of building a casino empire. Now that he is 55, these people say, he wants to be remembered for more than just casinos.
"A lot of people say, 'He's got his empire; why in the world would he want to be on this board?' " said Peter Neumann, a Reno lawyer who is also on the planning agency panel. "Whatever his motivation, he has really taken a personal interest. I think he thinks of Tahoe as his home. And I think he genuinely feels the lake is a treasure, as we all do."
The clock is ticking for Mr. Wynn in another way. He may go blind in not too many years, a likely outcome of the degenerative eye disease that surfaced when he was 29. The inherited, incurable disease, retinitis pigmentosa, destroys nerves in the retina.
Mr. Wynn says he is missing the lower half of his field of vision when looking at objects up close, along with some peripheral vision, but that he is otherwise fine and not getting worse. His ophthalmologist, Dr. Alan S. Crandall, is making no promises, however. "He's down to tunnel vision," Dr. Crandall said. "If he lives long enough, he probably will go blind."
And already, he sometimes seems to move as a sleepwalker does, feeling for walls with his hands and feet. On the way back to the March board meeting from lunch, Mr. Wynn walked face first into a post. He shook off the blow like a boxer and plodded on, showing no sign of pain.
Whatever is making Steve Wynn run, some environmentalists are glad to have a businessman of his power on their side. After all, he is a wily operator who knows how to make use of laws and government agencies to get what he wants in the gambling world. Bringing those skills to the defense of a lake's water quality should produce big dividends, some say.
They point to the rancorous, 12-hour meeting late last month at which the planning board backed his campaign against Jet Skis and similar machines, waterborne cousins of the motorcycle that are almost as fast and certainly just as loud as their wheeled relatives. The board voted 10 to 4 to ban all such machines, whose two-cycle engines run on a mix of gasoline and oil, from the lake beginning June 1, 1999. Mr. Wynn led the fight for the ban, arguing that the engines discharge hundreds of thousands of gallons of unburned fuel into the lake each year. The ban, which is expected to be appealed by manufacturers and rental shops, is far tougher than the position taken by the Environmental Protection Agency, which recently ordered makers of personal watercraft to begin equipping them with more efficient engines over the next decade.
Mr. Wynn also marshaled support last fall for a $20 million state bond issue for erosion-control projects on the Nevada side of the lake. Erosion, another byproduct of development, sends soil runoff into the lake, nourishing algae that further cloud the water.
"He has done a lot to focus additional attention on Tahoe," said Rochelle Nason, director of the League to Save Lake Tahoe, a nonprofit group. "He was very helpful in getting that bond issue on the ballot in the Nevada legislature. We've disagreed with him on a few issues, but on the whole our impression has been good."
 
Jumping Into a Lake's Future
For his part, Mr. Wynn says there is a simple, and innocent, explanation for his decision to serve on the board.
Whenever he went to a party, he heard people complaining about the agency, he said in a recent interview. "Environmentalists didn't like it. Developers didn't like it. Everybody talks about the environment, but very rarely do you have a chance to do anything about it. I thought it would be an interesting exercise, kind of like going to graduate school. I thought it was going to be a noncontroversial, low-keyed, rather technical activity. It was as far away from what I do for a living as you could get. And that suited me to a T."
Mr. Wynn joined the board two years ago. Established in 1968 by Congress and the states of California and Nevada, the planning agency is charged with overseeing development around the lake. The President names one nonvoting member, while California and Nevada each get seven voting members, all appointed by local and state governments except for Nevada's one at-large seat. That seat is filled by a vote of the other Nevada appointees. Mr. Wynn was one of eight or nine applicants for the unpaid position, and while he had no formal background in environmental protection or in regional planning, several members who voted for him say they were impressed by his energy and intelligence.
They were also certainly aware that Mr. Wynn is a powerful force in Nevada politics and a significant presence on the national scene. A major donor to both Republicans and Democrats, he threw a party at his private golf course in Las Vegas that raised a half-million dollars for Bob Dole's Presidential campaign. Mr. Wynn has also played golf with Bill Clinton.
Mr. Wynn came to the Tahoe area in 1992, building a getaway home in the lakeside enclave of Incline Village, or what locals call "Income Village." It is a "nice, roomy house," he said, "with three bedrooms, a gym and a media room, and a little guest house with two bedrooms, on five acres."
"It's not a mansion," he added, "but it is 11,000 square feet."
For a time, Mr. Wynn kept a fleet of five of the noisy watercraft at his dock, jumping waves in front of his estate with the likes of former President George Bush.
But Mr. Wynn soon learned that there was trouble in his newfound paradise. Lake Tahoe, set more than a mile high in the Sierra Nevada, is surrounded by granite peaks draped with dark green pine forest. But the lake's famous clarity is rapidly declining. The first scientist to measure the clarity in 1873 could see a dinner plate 108 feet down. A similar plate is visible only to 70 feet today and the clarity is deteriorating at the rate of a foot and a half a year, according to the regional planning agency.
Soil runoff is a major villain. After reading a magazine article about the banning of personal watercraft from a Swiss lake, Mr. Wynn decided that the zippy little machines were another. He sold off his fleet (though he kept a large powerboat, which uses a less-polluting four-cycle engine) and made a lakewide ban his mission.
That raised the hackles of some local residents, who quickly came to regard him as a high-profile interloper who was meddling with their way of life.
"Lake Tahoe is being taken over by fat cats like Steve Wynn," wrote Jeff Ackerman, publisher and editor of The Nevada Appeal, the daily newspaper in Carson City, the state capital. "The billionaires are running the millionaires out of Tahoe. And they're using Tahoe's clarity as a tool to rid themselves of the riffraff who can't afford a giant lake cruiser that Wynn and his buddies use to cruise what is becoming their own private paradise."
Mr. Wynn dismissed the attacks as "sound and fury signifying nothing." In an interview before the board vote, he said: "The agency is being put to the test on this issue. If it can't deal with something as black and white as that, then it's useless."
In this practical vein, he has been pushing to get the agency to cut back on red tape and become more "user friendly" to businesses and homeowners. The goal is to protect the environment, he said, not to "waste time on minutiae and irrelevant things."
"It's not a major issue whether someone adds a deck or a back porch to their house," he added. "It should not be a problem for a businessman to add a bathroom or other things to his business. You shouldn't need three consultants and an army of lawyers to increase the size of your building by 10 percent. Those things should be perfunctory."
Only then, he argues, will the agency attract the kind of popular support that it needs to succeed at its fundamental mission of protecting the lake.
Now, with the victory against Jet Skis and the like under his belt, the environmental conference is next.
What will Mr. Wynn tell the President when he comes to Lake Tahoe? "Lake Tahoe is worth saving," said Mr. Wynn, and it's going to take "a lot of capital."

'Always a Mountain Person'
Mr. Wynn gets up to Lake Tahoe on a company jet about once a month for board meetings, sometimes making additional trips to ski (which he says he can handle just fine, despite his vision problems) or to spend time on the lake.
He and his wife, Elaine, who serves on the board of Mirage Resorts, have another vacation place, a huge spread in Sun Valley, Idaho. Their daughters -- Gillian, 28, who works for Mirage as a designer of a water laser show, and Kevyn, 31, a marketer at Mirage -- are fanatically in love with Sun Valley, Mr. Wynn said.
"Tahoe is my thing," he explained. "I was brought up in the mountains in a place very much like Tahoe on a reduced scale, with a pine forest surrounding a lake. Once you're a mountain person, you're always a mountain person."
Mr. Wynn, who grew up in Utica, N.Y., spent his early summers at Old Forge in the Adirondacks. He named his Lake Tahoe home Old Forge out of "nostalgia for my childhood," he said.
It was a special childhood, marked by unusual defining moments. Mr. Wynn's father, who was born Michael Weinberg and later changed his last name, ran bingo parlors on the East Coast. While trying to open a bingo hall in Las Vegas, he showed his son, then 11, around the city. The father was often in debt but Steve had everything he wanted. He went to prep school before going to the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a bachelor's degree in English.
When his father died in 1963, while undergoing open heart surgery at the age of 46, he left behind tens of thousands of dollars in gambling debts. Mr. Wynn and his wife, who also grew up in a family headed by a compulsive gambler, took over the bingo business. They were both 21. He called the numbers and she counted the money. It took years to pay off the I.O.U.'s.
In 1967, Steve Wynn moved his family to Las Vegas to redeem his father's dream. He bought a 3 percent stake in the Frontier Hotel casino and became the slot manager. When investigators discovered that the hotel was owned by Detroit mobsters, Mr. Wynn sold his shares, denying any previous knowledge of the underworld link.
He then became friends with E. Parry Thomas, the founder and owner of the Valley Bank, which financed much of the Las Vegas casino industry's expansion in the 1960's and 70's and later merged with the Bank of America. In 1972, Mr. Thomas helped arrange a real estate deal in which Mr. Wynn bought a lot from Howard Hughes for $1.1 million and then sold it to Caesars Palace, next door, for $2.25 million.
Mr. Wynn used the profit to acquire a 5 percent interest in the Golden Nugget, then a rundown casino in the Glitter Gulch section of downtown Las Vegas. He eventually took control, becoming at 31 the youngest person ever to run a casino in Nevada.
 
Palace After Palace
Most casinos in those days were dimly lit affairs that exuded an illicit backroom feeling. Mr. Wynn brought in the sunlight. He transformed the "gambling joint," as he called it, into a sparkling palace for high rollers, directly across from the spot on Glitter Gulch where his father had failed to open a bingo parlor.
Unlike his father, Mr. Wynn does not gamble, viewing that part of his family history as a cautionary tale. "If you want to make money in a casino, own one," he has been quoted as saying. Like other major casino operators, Mr. Wynn sponsors programs to help compulsive gamblers. At the same time, though, he says most people enjoy gambling and know how to set their own limits, and he sees nothing wrong with bringing them in by the thousands to the glitzy showcases that have made his name.
In 1980, Mr. Wynn built the Golden Nugget in Atlantic City, using the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas as collateral on a raft of junk bonds floated by Mr. Milken. It was one of the first new casinos to bring Las Vegas glitter to the Boardwalk. He sold the operation to the Bally Corporation in 1987 for $440 million. That helped Bally fight off a takeover bid from Donald Trump (so that Bally owned too many casinos for Mr. Trump to acquire under New Jersey rules) while making a profit for Mr. Wynn of $250 million. He used the proceeds, along with junk bonds from Mr. Milken, to begin building a chain of ever more fabulous casinos on the Strip in Las Vegas.
The Mirage, with its fiery volcano, opened in 1989. Treasure Island, complete with pirates, opened next door in 1993. Down the road, the Bellagio is now taking shape on the site of the old Dunes, which Mr. Wynn blew up to make way for the new palace.
The gambling business has paid off handsomely for both Mr. Wynn and Mirage Resorts. The company's gross revenues totaled $1.37 billion in 1996, with profits of $206 million. The return to investors has averaged 22 percent a year for the last decade -- one reason Fortune magazine sees Mirage as one of the most admired companies in America, though the stock lately has been lackluster. It closed on Thursday at $24.875, still depressed from the $29.625 it reached a year ago.
Mr. Wynn's annual salary and bonus total about $4 million. His 15 percent stake in Mirage Resorts is now worth more than $500 million.
 
Seeing Past a Disease
Although the sparkle in his eyes has been dimmed by retinitis pigmentosa, Mr. Wynn's smile is still as dazzling as the well-lit facades of his casinos.
In 1993, he donated $1 million to the John Moran Eye Center at the University of Utah to create the Michael M. Wynn Center for Inherited Retinal Diseases, named for his father. He hopes a cure will be found, but he does not want to be defined by his disease.
"My handicap is an inconvenience," he said. "I can't see my own hand underneath my nose. And I can't see if you stick your hand out to shake with me, but my central vision is perfect. So the minute you're 8 or 10 feet from me I see everything. Honestly, I skied 39 days last year," albeit on wide-open runs with a guide.
And although many who know him well, including his mother, have said that he became more driven and short-tempered after the disease was diagnosed, Mr. Wynn says his basic character has not changed.
"Everybody always tries to do an interpretation of my attitude in business, my drive or my ambition with the fact that my vision diminishes, as if I have a limited amount of time, the lights are going out, the sun is dimming," he said. "It is true that having R.P. affects my behavior. I don't drive. I can't go in the dark and behave freely. I need help. I wear reading glasses like any 55-year-old man. But it's O.K."
As if to put to rest any concern about his vision, Mr. Wynn paused to look out at Lake Tahoe during a break at a recent agency meeting and commented on the "gumption" of a windsurfer who was wearing a short-sleeved wet suit on the cold choppy waters.
 
What Kind of Mission?
Asked whether he had any thoughts of pursuing any other public office, Mr. Wynn said, "I have thoughts and the answer is I won't. I'm not cut out for it."
Still, Mr. Wynn seemed relaxed at the agency meeting, where he bantered easily with fellow board members.
"You've got 15 board members and Steve's one of those members, and that's a change from his business and the way he operates normally," said Mr. Baetge, the agency's staff director. "You can't just come in and say, 'I'm in charge here.' You're not. He's got a strong personality in terms of making an argument and standing by it and stressing to the public why we do something. But I've found him fairly easy to work with."
Mr. Wynn left the recent meeting early to go to Las Vegas for the opening of the Secret Garden at the Mirage, a habitat for the rare tigers used in shows by the house entertainers, Siegfried and Roy. He also had to prepare for Mirage Resorts' annual meeting.
The next day, Mr. Wynn told stockholders that the era of rapid expansion in the gambling industry was slowing. He said that Mirage Resorts might consider expanding through acquisitions, but that too many gaming companies were saddled with aging buildings in second-rate locations. In the meantime, the stockholders could look forward to the opening in September 1998 of the Bellagio and, three months later, the Beau Rivage casino in Biloxi, Miss., on the Gulf Coast. Construction has not yet begun in Atlantic City, where Mr. Wynn plans to build a casino in the Marina section.
In his remarks, he echoed his concerns expressed earlier this year that Las Vegas suffered from "quality problems," particularly traffic congestion and air pollution.
The population of the Las Vegas metropolitan area is 1 million, and it is projected to reach 1.6 million in 10 years. "Any given area can only take so many people," he said. "I'm not sure what that number is. But if the air's not clean and you can't move in the streets, it seems like you're getting there. So what do you do about it?"
His answer is to learn something from the Lake Tahoe experience. "It takes consensus," he said. "And the only hope is to educate the public."
Skeptics say Mr. Wynn has a lot of moxie even to pose the question, given his own role in the city's growth. "If he's serious about controlling growth, he could be doing a lot more than he is," said Mr. Nielsen, of Citizen Alert. "It's a lot of hot air."
But others say he may be just the right person to ring the alarm. "When someone of his stature says things, people in Las Vegas tend to listen," said Mike Sloan, vice president of Circus Circus Enterprises, a competitor that jointly owns the Monte Carlo casino in Las Vegas with Mirage. "I don't think he's worried about competition. I think it is a quality-of-life issue."
Jeff Van Ee, a longtime Las Vegas environmental activist who sits on the local clean-air advisory board, offers some qualified support. "I find myself seemingly more in concert with him than I expected," Mr. Van Ee said. "I think he's changing. People are skeptical of his motives. As an environmentalist, looking at Steve Wynn and his impact on this community, I view him as a work in progress."

THE GREAT NON-EVENT
The Fed Leaves Rates Steady As Economic Growth Slows
The Federal Reserve decided to leave interest rates unchanged, betting that the economy could continue to enjoy low unemployment without inflation. Economists and investors had widely anticipated the decision, pointing to evidence that economic growth slowed from its torrid pace early in the year to an annual rate of about 2 percent in the second quarter. Further evidence came later when the Government reported that unemployment rose unexpectedly to 5 percent in June from 4.8 percent in May. Personal consumption and income each increased 0.3 percent in May, half their pace in the first quarter; construction spending slid 1.8 percent, and factory orders declined an unexpected 0.7 percent. But the Conference Board calculated that its index of leading indicators climbed 0.3 percent in May, and the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that the manufacturing sector was still expanding in June, although at a slightly slower pace. Analysts say any surge in the economy could lead the Fed to push up rates at the next meeting, on Aug. 19.
 
THE MARKETS
More Records Tumble
Cheered by the Fed's inaction and the moderating economy, investors bid stock prices into record territory. In a broad-based rally, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 208.09 for the week, to 7,895.81 on Thursday, well above the previous record of 7,796.51 on June 20. The Nasdaq composite index also set a record, rising 29.46 for the week to 1,467.61. The inflation-sensitive bond market rallied to its highest level since February, with the benchmark 30-year bond priced at 100 1/32, pushing down its yield to 6.62 percent. 

TAX CUTS
An Echo Across the Atlantic
As Congress grappled with precisely how to cut Federal taxes substantially for the first time in 16 years, President Clinton, left, laid out his own $135 billion plan, bending to Republican demands for a broad reduction in capital gains taxes but shifting money toward his cherished higher-education programs. In Britain, the new Labor Government of Tony Blair, right, in its first budget, slashed business taxes and cut state borrowing in a five-year program. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, announced a plan to tackle unemployment among the young with state-subsidized jobs or training -- and threatened to cut welfare benefits for recipients who refuse. He said, "The welfare state today denies rather than provides opportunity."
 
MILITARY MERGER
Lockheed to Acquire Northrop
Lockheed Martin, the maker of the F-16 jet fighter and the nation's leading military contractor, agreed to acquire Northrop Grumman in a $7.9 billion stock swap plus the assumption of $3.3 billion in debt. The deal, the latest in a series of post-cold war mergers in the arms business, would create a combined company with 230,000 employees, annual sales of about $37 billion and the strength to compete with Boeing, which is acquiring McDonnell Douglas for $14 billion. Lockheed's chairman, Norman Augustine, will lead the new Lockheed Martin, and Northrop's chairman, Kent Kresa, is to be vice chairman.
 
'HOT DOCS'
Staples Deal Comes Undone
It's a variation on the theme of "loose lips sink ships." Staples and Office Depot called off their proposed $4 billion merger after Federal District Judge Thomas F. Hogan blocked the combination of office-supply superstores on antitrust grounds. Time and again, Bloomberg News reported, Judge Hogan referred to Staples' internal documents that bolstered the Federal Trade Commission arguments that the deal would be anticompetitive. In contrast, Staples argued in court that consumers would benefit. In antitrust circles, damaging internal documents are known as "hot docs," and they often scuttle mergers. When the Government sued to halt Microsoft's proposed $2.1 billion acquisition of Intuit two years ago, it cited an internal memo in which an executive said he couldn't "imagine anyone would be stupid enough" to compete with a Microsoft-Intuit combination. That deal was also abandoned.
 
COMPUTERS IN CARS
'Sorry, Officer, I Was Downloading'
Eager to take advantage of the hour or so a day that most Americans spend in their cars, Microsoft is developing programs -- code-named Apollo -- for dashboard-mounted computers that would allow drivers to check electronic mail, trade stocks and even surf the Internet using cellular telephone links. It is talking with Ford, Daimler-Benz and other car makers. But some in the auto industry fear there will be safety problems if drivers are distracted. Microsoft intends to use voice commands and automated synthesized voices, so drivers will not have to take their eyes off the road to look at a screen. With studies already showing higher accident rates among drivers using cellular phones, will there be highway mayhem if drivers discover on line that their stocks have plunged?
 
DOCTORS' PROTEST
Standing Up to Managed Care
In the first large, organized backlash against what they call the industrialization of medicine, a group of Massachusetts doctors is calling for a moratorium on corporate takeovers of health services and for curbs on managed-care companies' intrusion into doctors' decision-making. "It's time to put a stop to it," said Dr. Bernard Lown, 76, chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee to Defend Health Care. "We are troubled by any organization that places an interface between the patient and the doctor," added Dr. Lown, a Harvard professor who shared in a Nobel Peace Prize. Dr. John D. Stoeckle, 74, above, the senior member of a primary-care group at Massachusetts General Hospital, says he is angered by managed care's paperwork and bureaucratic second-guessing.
 
SOFTWARE
City of Brotherly Piracy?
Philadelphia is paying $121,610 to settle allegations that two City Hall offices, Air Management Services and Environmental Health Services, made hundreds of illegal copies of spreadsheet, word-processing and data base software from Microsoft, Lotus and Adobe. The settlement was reached with a watchdog group called the Business Software Alliance, which was tipped off by a whistle-blower. "What happened here was inadvertent," said Kevin Feeley, a spokesman for Mayor Edward G. Rendell. Bob Kruger, the alliance's head of copyright enforcement, said the payment was equal to the suggested retail prices for the software and far less than the seven-digit fine Philadelphia might have faced in court.
 
AUTO SALES OFF
Driving a Bargain
New cars are more affordable than they have been in nearly a generation, thanks to an auto industry price war, with more rebates, cut-rate loans, cheap lease deals and other discounts than ever. For the first time since early 1981, the average car costs less than half a year's pretax income for the average American family, according to Comerica, the biggest bank in Michigan. Behind the price war: falling sales. General Motors said its sales were down 13.3 percent last month, and Chrysler reported a 4 percent drop, its fifth in a row. Bucking the trend, Ford reported a 4.7 percent gain.

HEADLINE: Juarez, Mexico: On the Border, Between Extremes

BYLINE: By TOM KUNTZ

 BODY:
CIUDAD JUAREZ, a city of well over a million people just across the Rio Grande from El Paso, Texas, is a dynamic point along the membrane between the world of the desperately striving in Mexico and that of the relatively prosperous in the United States.
The photographs on this page capture some of the border's grit, hustle and run-of-the-mill horrors: Mongrel dogs prowl beneath freshly hung women's stockings in the midday sun. The body of an electrocuted man sizzles atop a power line he had illegally tried to tap. And a slain young woman lies partly buried in the sand -- one of those routinely savaged in a city that draws people from afar to jobs in its many maquiladoras, the foreign-owned border factories, or to its attendant professions, like prostitution. 
 These pictures are among thousands taken since 1993 by a group of Juarez photographers who set out to document the vibrant and violent life of their town. The work of the 11 photographers (several of whom are employed by the city's main paper, Diario de Juarez) is being published in a forthcoming book, "Juarez -- The Laboratory of Our Future" (Aperture).
Although the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement was supposed to bring economic prosperity to Mexico, some people see the grim Juarez photographs as evidence of the exploitive nature of Nafta. But Jaime Bailleres, one of the photographers, noted that this growing city next to the world's most powerful economy presented plenty of troubling tableaux long before the advent of free trade.
The photo project is noteworthy, he said, because it was produced locally, by people who were working with the same handicaps and under the same hazardous conditions that confront all Juarez residents. The photographers, using ancient Pentax cameras, typically earned $50 to $80 a week, and risked their lives, alienating drug traffickers, gangs and the Mexican authorities. "It's like working in Bosnia," Mr. Bailleres said. TOM KUNTZ

HEADLINE: Double Vision;
Crime Falls, but Not on TV

BYLINE: By LAWRIE MIFFLIN

 BODY:
CRIME reporting is such a staple of local television news coverage that is has acquired its own cliche: "If it bleeds, it leads." Whatever else might have happened, if someone is murdered, that story will lead the day's newscast.
So the continuing plunge in the nation's crime rates -- last week, New York City reported that homicides in the first half of this year were down about 30 percent from the same period in 1996 -- raises a question for television news directors: Are they now putting fewer crime stories on screen, too? 
 The answer seems to be no.
"The fact that percentages are down doesn't affect our coverage," said Bill Carey, news director at Channel 2 in New York, CBS's flagship station. "The communities who suffered and the families who suffered the crimes still want to know about them."
The real-estate salesman who was stabbed to death and dumped in a pond in Central Park, allegedly by a teen-age girl and boy; the dedicated teacher and son of Time Warner's chief executive who was slain, the police say, by a former student; the 7-year-old girl abducted on her way to school in Chinatown -- these murders would have been news no matter what.
 
Breaking the Habit
 But it isn't the dramatic cases that dominate crime coverage on local TV, said Joseph Angotti, a former senior vice president of NBC News who is now a professor of communications at the University of Miami, and who directed a study this year of the content of local news programs in eight cities. "Since journalism began, people have been infatuated with stories of big crimes, big trials. What's driving television news today is the ordinary, continuous kind of crime stories. It's a habit they've gotten into and it's difficult to break."
Mr. Angotti and his colleagues found that crime and criminal justice stories took up 29 percent of the average early-evening newscast in eight cities studied. Other studies in the last decade have found a similar proportion -- around one-third of the average local newscast.
"Most of that crime coverage is not editorially driven, it's economically driven," Mr. Angotti added. "It's the easiest, cheapest, laziest news to cover, because all they do is listen to the police radio, react to it, send out a mobile camera unit, spend an hour or two covering it and put it on the air."
Naturally, not all news directors agree. Many believe crime news matters to viewers. And some say their coverage has shifted as crime patterns have changed. Mr. Carey at Channel 2 says the ebbing of the city's crack-cocaine problem has changed the nature of crime reporting.
"When the drug epidemic was worse, in the late '80's here in the city, the violence was much worse and the ways people killed people were worse," he said. He mentioned schoolyard shootings, drug users killing innocent people for money and, in particular, the story of a cocaine-using woman who held her crying toddler over flames on the stove, giving the child such severe burns that he later died.
But to the average citizen, random crime is scarier than the drug-related crime that occurs most often in the poorest neighborhoods. The four local news directors interviewed said that even as they continue to put crime stories on the air, their coverage has changed to reflect the general belief that the city is safer.
 
The Giuliani Factor
 Publicity helps build that belief, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his supporters have repeatedly publicized the statistics.
"Giuliani is making that his mantra, so if we're covering the Mayor of the City of New York, it's hard not to hear it," said Marie Hickey, the news director at Channel 5, the Fox Broadcasting station. "And of course people applaud the fact that crime is down. We did a piece on that in early June, and found that people do believe it's down and do feel the city is safer."
Paula Walker, the news director at Channel 4, NBC's New York station, said recently that she has been trying to change the mindset in her newsroom. "When I challenge our people on beat checks," she said, referring to the daily phone calls made to check for news, "it's to ask, 'Why are we calling the cops? Why don't we call the schools? Why don't we call the hospitals?' Because if you're going to call around and find out whether anything's going on today and the only places you call are the police stations, what diet will you present but a diet of crime?"
That has been the diet presented by most local television station newscasts, however, especially in cities. Mr. Angotti said it may change -- again because of economics. "In at least three of the cities in our study," he said, "we found that the stations that were using the least amount of crime news were getting the highest ratings. So the theory that if you give people lots of blood-and-guts, that's what they'll watch is not necessarily true."
As Channel 4's Ms. Walker pointed out, in a big city there will always be plenty of crime. It is each station's choice how much of it is worth putting on the air -- and what to keep off as a result.
"Crime is always devastating to the victims, and I don't want to minimize that," she said. "But we have only a finite amount of time to present our news agenda. And most people in our tri-state area do not walk around every day expecting to be murdered."

HEADLINE: Tax Code;
The Secret Language Of Social Engineering

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
NAME a social or economic problem. Maybe the tax code can fix it.
Think families these days are hard pressed? Give them a $500-per-child credit. 
 Want more people to attend at least two years of college? Create a credit to subsidize some of the cost.
Determined to address the nation's low savings rate? Expand the Individual Retirement Account to provide more tax incentives for long-term savings.
Eager to encourage entrepreneurs? Provide special breaks for investments in small businesses.
Unlike the two most recent big tax-cutting bills, in 1981 and 1986, the tax legislation now working its way through Washington does not include reductions in income tax rates. Although both parties have been proudly proclaiming the windfall they intend to bestow on voters, the $85 billion that Congress and the Administration have allocated for tax cuts over the next five years would finance only a tiny drop in income-tax rates.
So to get maximum bang for the buck, the leaders of both parties are instead concentrating the available money on a handful of other taxes and tax breaks. All of them appeal to at least one powerful constituency -- this year's favorites range from the religious right to Wall Street -- and all seek to support certain types of behavior or social goals.
Far from the ideal of a tax code designed solely to raise the revenue needed to finance the workings of Government, this year's legislation is just the latest evidence of how changes in the code frequently come down to dispensing favors under the guise of social and economic policy. Even modest attempts to focus the code more on revenue raising and less on distinguishing between classes of activity and income -- like the 1986 tax act -- are soon overwhelmed by the political imperative to respond to powerful constituencies who want better treatment.
"I view the tax code as a very poor place to do social engineering," said Iris J. Lav, the associate director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group in Washington, echoing what most conservative economists would say. "There's very scant evidence that the tax code has ever changed people's behavior. It's certainly a question of who has the loudest voice on tax policy."
Certainly, tax policy plays only a limited role in the economic decisions that most people make. People choose to invest or buy a home or send their children to college for all kinds of reasons unrelated to a line on their form 1040. But even where the tax code provides a direct incentive, its impact is unclear.
 
Saving, More or Less
 Both the House and the Senate bills propose sweeping expansions of the Individual Retirement Account, which is popular with banks, investment firms and middle and upper-income taxpayers who have money to save. Although some economists argue otherwise, Ms. Lav cited studies concluding that I.R.A.'s have done little or nothing to increase the savings rate, in part because decisions about saving may be more complex than they appear. Since many savers set specific goals, an increase in the after-tax yield that the I.R.A. advantage creates lets them save less than they would otherwise to reach the same goal -- not exactly what proponents of savings incentives have in mind.
But Ms. Lav acknowledged her own strong support on both economic or social grounds for programs like the earned income tax credit, which reduces taxes for low-income workers to encourage them to work rather than to go on welfare. So what seems unwarranted social engineering or interest-group pandering by one ideological camp is often seen as a worthy cause -- and a justified exception -- by the other.
Steve Forbes, who ran for the Republican Presidential nomination last year on a platform of replacing the current tax system with a single flat rate, issued a memo last week characterizing the emerging tax plan, although largely the work of Republicans, as "Big Brother Clinton knows best."
 
The Pathetic Reward
 "If your family does exactly what he wants you to do, when he wants you to do it, where he wants you to do it," Mr. Forbes said, "then you might get a pathetically small little break on your Federal taxes."
But by Mr. Forbes's standard few Congressional Republicans could claim to be pure. Speaker Newt Gingrich pushed into the House tax bill detailed provisions designed to attract investment, jobs and new residents to the District of Columbia. Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee rails against the complexities and inequities of the tax code, still champions narrow provisions, including a permanent extension of a tax credit to encourage pharmaceutical companies to do research on treatments for obscure diseases. And most Republicans have wholeheartedly embraced the religious right's argument that the proposed child credit will strengthen families, even while admitting that the credit will do nothing to strengthen the economy.
There is another reason politicians choose the tax code to pursue policy objectives. In this age of fiscal austerity, new spending programs are a tough sell in Congress. But if the same initiatives are dressed up as tax cuts they look much more palatable.
"One looks like smaller government," said C. Eugene Steuerle, a tax expert at the Urban Institute in Washington. "One looks like bigger government. In fact, they both do exactly the same thing."
 
Mortarboard Credit
 Take President Clinton's effort to encourage more high school students to go on to college. He has already won additional financing for Federal tuition grants for low-income students, and although he no doubt could have designed a spending program to make college more affordable for many middle-class students as well, he would have got little support in the Republican Congress.
As a $35 billion tax cut, however, Mr. Clinton's proposal to give credits of up to $1,500 for the first two years of college is almost certain to be enacted at least partially. Never mind that analysts doubt that the credit will inspire students who would otherwise be content with a high school diploma to enroll in college. Indeed, some analysts assert that the plan's main effect would be to increase tuition inflation.
Yet for all the uncertainty about what effects on behavior the tax bill will have, there is one outcome that is beyond doubt: In its efforts to make the tax code do more things for more people, Washington is again putting aside its promises of simplification and making the system more complex.

HEADLINE: No Great Shakes;
A Ritual Loses Its Grip

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
HANDSHAKES are part of history's greatest hits: Arafat and Rabin at the White House in 1993; Nixon thrusting out his hand to Zhou Enlai in Beijing in 1972. They are a big reason the airline industry does not feel threatened by the rise of videoconferencing: "You can't fax a handshake" is a popular saying at many companies.
And as American-style capitalism sweeps through distant countries, more people are shaking hands, according to Roger E. Axtell, editor of a series of "Do's and Taboos" books about body language around the world. In the United States, he added, even more women are joining in the ritual. 
 But think again before you reach out and glad-hand. The handshake, as natural an act as walking upright, is being shaken itself, devalued as a symbol of trustworthiness and denounced as a health threat at the same time that technology holds the promise of upgrading it for new uses.
By most accounts, handshakes started as a way to show that neither person was holding a weapon. Desmond Morris, the anthropologist, calls the handshake a "tie-sign" because of the bond it creates. Through the centuries, the growing use of the handshake reflected greater equality among individuals, and it was used to seal agreements. The handshake became a friendly greeting, a sign of respect, a bet that new faces would be remembered.
But now, if you want to show someone respect, perhaps you should consider not shaking hands. That was the lesson Alonzo Mourning, the star center for the Miami Heat, tried to draw in May from the fifth game of the Eastern Conference finals of the National Basketball Association, when Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls refused to shake his outstretched hand.
 
Respectfully Declined
 After the game, with the Heat eliminated, Mr. Mourning said Mr. Jordan's reaction flattered him. "It makes me think we got their respect," he said. (Athletic-shoe makers are no doubt fighting over rights to a new marketing slogan: "No Handshakes.")
Others interpreted Mr. Jordan's refusal more traditionally. The Bulls had criticized Mr. Mourning for dirty play throughout the playoffs.
The handshake after a game has long been a tradition in youth leagues, but it no longer moves kids to lay down grudges and hard feelings. Coaches say players often spit in their hands before congratulating opponents. In January, a fight broke out in a handshake line after a junior hockey game in Rhode Island.
At the French Open this year, Thomas Muster was so incensed by the antics of Jeff Tarango across the tennis court that he broke with tradition and refused to shake Mr. Tarango's outstretched hand after beating him.
Even the "golden handshake" appears to be suffering from deflation. In British Columbia, Canada, the provincial government is considering a rule to limit lump-sum severance payments to 24 months' pay for executives ousted from government-run companies and agencies. A former president of a government-run utility, for example, was found to be taking home $25,000 a month three years after he left.
Moreover, handshakes can be bad for your health. The Massachusetts Medical Society recently started an advertising campaign that encourages people to wash their hands more often, pointing out in one radio spot that "any friendly handshake can carry many illnesses."
Robert E. Swindle, a retired business professor in Peoria, Ariz., wants to abolish handshaking altogether. After all, now that most people don't carry concealed weapons in their hands, the ritual has lost its usefulness, he said. Mr. Swindle is also concerned about how quickly germs spread through handshakes, particularly in settings like doctor's offices and hospitals.
"I saw a cardiologist recently, and he shook hands with me three times," he said. When Mr. Swindle does not want to shake hands, he smooths out an uncomfortable moment by saying that he cannot because of a finger he fractured playing basketball.
But if Mr. Swindle got his way, something would clearly be lost in society. Allen Konopacki, who runs a sales training company in Chicago called the Incomm Center, tried an experiment last year to better understand the handshake effect. He and a group of students left a quarter in a public phone, and after strangers used the phone and took the coin, a student walked up to ask if they had seen the quarter. Of the roughly 75 people he tried this on, well over half lied, saying that they had not seen the 25 cents that they had pocketed.
Mr. Konopacki and his students then tried the experiment with 75 more strangers, but this time the student greeted the person with a quick handshake and introduction. Only 14 of the 75 lied.
"A handshake," Mr. Konopacki said, "creates a higher level of trust, a degree of intimacy, within a matter of seconds."
 
Hanging On
 Politicians who grab every hand they can on the campaign trail clearly believe this to be true. But the handshake is also a way for the masses to get some quality face time. When Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada was glad-handing in May at a campaign rally in Edmonton, Alberta, one man refused to let go as he yelled in Mr. Chretien's face about his decision to call an election at a time when flooding had caused a crisis in the West.
I.B.M. is perhaps the most ambitious of the lot in trying to find new uses for the handshake. Big Blue created a small stir at the annual consumer electronics trade show in January with a prototype of its Personal Area Network, or PAN.
Though it won't be available for a while, the company says it has the technology to transmit data -- like a digitized business card -- between two people with just a handshake. The PAN device, about the size of a thick credit card so it can be carried in a pocket, creates a low-power external electronic field using the natural salinity of the human body that can transmit data to, and receive data from, someone else with a PAN device. The stored information can be viewed later with a computer.
Some sociologists say the apparent drop in the traditional value of a handshake reflects a general decline of loyalty in American society to institutions like marriage and between employers and their workers.
But Alan Wolfe, a sociologist at Boston University, disagreed. He said that while the handshake has been devalued by those in the media spotlight, the gesture carries just as much weight as it always has among most people because so many face-to-face encounters have been replaced by phones, faxes and E-mail.
"The handshake is really reserved for special moments," he said.
And you never know when such moments might arise. In January, a small group of men were moved to shake the hands of staff members in a bank in central Italy. It was, after all, a special time for everyone involved. The men were about to leave, having just finished robbing the bank.

HEADLINE: From Dapper Don to Dirty Chin

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
IT has come to this. In a city accustomed to the very best in mob trials and to state-of-the-art gangland kingpins, the people must make do with Vincent Gigante, otherwise known as Chin.
It's a sorry spectacle for connoisseurs of crime. In a Brooklyn courtroom, the man painted by Federal prosecutors as the head of the Genovese crime family looks as though he could not find his way down the aisle of a Genovese drug store. The mob overlord who, according to prosecutors, ran an empire and ordered the killings of six gangland rivals, sits in court day after day staring vacantly, moving his lips in a silent, one-way conversation and occasionally dozing off. 
 Mr. Gigante may or may not be guilty of the multitude of crimes with which he has been charged, but he is certainly guilty of letting standards slip.
The double-breasted suits, bright ties and razor-sharp collars of a bygone age have given way to pajamas and a bathrobe, Chin's familiar strolling attire in his Greenwich Village neighborhood. When the judge ordered Mr. Gigante, wearing an open sport shirt over a dirty T-shirt, to make a better appearance in court, his lawyer countered that Mr. Gigante did not own a suit.
And the nickname is not good. It speaks volumes about the failing culture of organized crime that "Chin" is probably just short for Vincenzo. Americans like their gangsters gaudy and grand. Mr. Gigante does not seem prepared to step into the role.
John Gotti performed the role magnificently, but he's beginning to look like the flashy finale in a show that's been running too long. "John Gotti was exceptional," said Peter Maas, the author of "Underboss: Sammy the Bull Gravano's Story of Life in the Mafia." "The media loved him, and he loved the media. He looked like what America wanted a gangster to look like."
Al Capone set the standard. A snappy dresser, he held sway over Chicago at a time when criminals, like Hollywood stars, fully understood their obligations to the public. He played to a much broader audience than his own heavily muscled constituency. He dealt death to his enemies but also set up soup kitchens for the unemployed. And his nickname, Scarface, couldn't be beat.
The film industry jumped in quickly, putting a high gloss on the image of the gangster. It hit paydirt with "Little Caesar," in which Edward G. Robinson laid down the basic rules for proper mob-boss demeanor. He was cocky, cruel and vain. In one magnificent leap, Robinson's Rico distanced himself from the mongrel pack of two-time hoods, sadists and bootleg barons that had defined the criminal upper class in Hollywood films until then. "He was rough around the edges, but he had charisma, he was commanding," said Bruce Goldstein, the repertory programmer at the Film Forum. "The Paul Muni character in 'Scarface' was just a thug."
The capo di tutti capi, of course, was Marlon Brando in "The Godfather," a kind of industrial training film for would-be mob bosses. Well before Lee Iacocca, Donald Trump or Bill Gates arrived on the scene with big books about big bucks, Vito Corleone satisfied a growing American appetite for business heroes, guys who made big companies run. Among other things, "The Godfather" was an incisive case study of a well-run corporation, exactly the kind of story that would later fit right into "In Pursuit of Excellence."
It's been downhill ever since. The romantic view of organized crime in "The Godfather" has given way to more jaundiced films. The wiseguys in "Goodfellas" spend as much time chopping garlic as they do stuffing bodies in trunks. "Since 'The Godfather,' films have dealt with the subject in a more down-to-earth way," said Kent Jones, the film archivist for Martin Scorsese. "In Abel Ferrara's last film, 'The Funeral,' you have guys from Yonkers whose idea of Mecca is the Bronx."
Anticipating the headlines, film makers have gravitated toward darkly humorous stories in which small-time hoods wage inept battles for ever-smaller stakes. Mr. Gotti brought back a whiff of the old days, when the many-roomed mansion of organized crime was so capacious that there was even room for Jewish and Irish gangsters. The murder of Paul Castellano outside Sparks Steak House in 1985 stirred old memories of half-forgotten names that fall like music on the ear: Joe Valachi, Frank Costello, Lucky Luciano, Joe Bonnano, Albert Anastasia. These were giants.
And now, there is Chin.
The trial continues, but as it limps toward the end, it's hard not to believe that the glory days have long since passed. "Sammy met him three or four times," Mr. Maas said, "and he said Gigante's hands were not just dirty, they were caked, like you see on homeless people in the street." From the Dapper Don to the Disoriented Don in just a few years.
Mother of Mercy, is this the end of Rico?

Let's See if the System Still Works

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"No fund-raising calls or mail," warned White House Counsel Abner Mikva in 1995, "may emanate from the White House or any other Federal building."
That's the law. But money-hungry Bill Clinton soon replaced Mikva, a former Federal judge, with Jack (Tell 'em Nuthin') Quinn, less concerned with legal niceties. 
 "The POTUS [President of the United States] and VP," e-mailed aide Karen Hancox in that law-breaking year, "offered ON THEIR OWN to make f r [fund-raising] calls for the DNC."
A few months ago, after Al Gore dismayed his own supporters by claiming "no controlling authority" stopped him from soliciting money from his Federal desk, the President pretended he could not recall doing anything similar.
Now, on the eve of the Senate's Thompson committee hearings, the truth is seeping out: Clinton personally leaned on 15 to 20 fat cats, often from his Oval Office phone, for at least $500,000 -- including one call urged by Vernon Jordan to shake $100,000 out of a Maryland businessman.
Both Clinton and Jordan are lawyers. They know the law against soliciting on Federal property. They were reminded of that law by the unwelcome Judge Mikva. Perhaps they were confident that Janet Reno, acting as a one-woman Supreme Court, would choose not to enforce that law.
But they surely knew how repugnant the American people would find the spectacle of their President, in the Oval Office, personally wheedling money out of wealthy citizens, with all the intimidation that such a "request" carries. That's why the Clinton memory turned so fuzzy for months.
Why are White House memories of the law-breaking suddenly coming clear? Because the Thompson committee has listed Ms. Hancox on its list of witnesses this week. White House Spin Control leaked the story on the eve of a holiday weekend, amid Mars landings and Paula Jones denunciations, hoping to detract from the newsworthiness of the televised hearings.
Another unfamiliar name on the witness list for the following week is Paul Buskirk, a trade official who deals with a classified computer network. That suggests to me that senators will be looking into John Huang's access to secret government cables. Huang was Lippo's man at Commerce, later reassigned by Clinton himself to raise money from those he serviced.
Only Asia-connection buffs know of Huang's 37 sessions with his personal C.I.A. briefer, accompanied by calls from his Commerce phone to his former Indonesian bosses and an unexplained visit to the Chinese embassy. Fewer still know of Huang's use of the Washington office of Stevens Inc., the investment bank so close to the Clintons in the past, for calls and faxes to Canada and overseas.
But now a wider audience assembles. Will the hearings reveal Huang to be an agent of influence, with the Clinton White House penetrated by a Chinese-Indonesian economic espionage operation? No; but perhaps its findings will force the appointment of an independent counsel still being resisted by Clinton Justice. The Senate's primary job is not to show "everybody did it," but to expose to public view the unprecedented pattern of corrupt fund-raising that sullied the highest office in the land.
I hope Huang is required to take the Fifth in person, along with all the others delaying or obstructing this investigation. I hope senators discover why our State Department is not trying to bring Yah Lin (Charlie) Trie -- so available to Tom Brokaw and to other interviewers in Shanghai -- home for questioning under oath.
Wang Jun, the Chinese arms dealer helping Iran obtain missiles to menace our ships in the Persian Gulf, recently told an American friend that he gave $50,000 to Charlie and thereby met Clinton in the White House. No wonder State and Justice don't want Trie questioned under oath.
One witness that Democrats will try desperately to protect is Bruce Lindsey, the newly unprivileged White House lawyer who bridges the fund-raising and Whitewater scandals.
He was present at Clinton's infamous Sept. 13, 1995, "reassignment" of Huang. And when asked by the Senate last year if he was aware of Clinton Administration efforts to steer work to Webster Hubbell, Lindsey swore "No." Let's see him slip out of those. (Hubbell, steered $100,000 from Lippo alone, now faces a threat of re-indictment for "hush money.")
The Fourth of July is behind us; let the quiet fireworks begin.

HEADLINE: Momentous Days in Madrid

 BODY:
Bill Clinton heads to Madrid this week to construct the foreign policy centerpiece of his Presidency, the eastward expansion of NATO. The United States has initiated no more fateful enterprise since the end of the cold war, yet it has done so largely without public discussion. With NATO planning to issue invitations to three new members in Madrid, a national debate can no longer wait.
Twenty senators, representing both parties, did their best to start one last week. In a thoughtful, deceptively mild letter to Mr. Clinton, the lawmakers identified many of the questions about NATO expansion that Americans ought to consider before committing their soldiers and nuclear weapons to the defense of Warsaw, Prague and Budapest. The letter attracted little public attention, but was closely read by Administration officials looking for some early indication whether a two-thirds majority in the Senate can be assembled in 1998 to approve NATO expansion. 
 It is too soon to know, but the 20 senators, led by Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, served notice that cornerstone elements of the NATO plan look badly conceived and that the Administration has so far done a dismal job of explaining and justifying the decisions that will be taken in Madrid. A stronger letter was sent to Mr. Clinton last month by some 40 Americans with European expertise, including former Senators Sam Nunn and Bill Bradley.
Tinkering with the map of Europe is not something to be done lightly. Two world wars started on the Continent this century and it was the primary battlefield of the cold war. Europe today is largely at peace and the great threat to democracy, the Soviet Union, vanished in 1991. If the map is to be redrawn, the reasons must be overwhelming and the potential consequences beyond doubt. NATO expansion does not now meet those tests.
The Hutchison group, for instance, would like to know what military threat NATO expansion is intended to counter, now that the Russian threat has receded. The senators, including conservative Republican Jesse Helms and liberal Democrat Paul Wellstone, wonder whether potential armed border disputes among new NATO members would warrant the use of American forces, as provided under NATO security guarantees. They are also concerned that NATO growth might jeopardize Russian approval of current and future agreements to cut nuclear arsenals.
Two important issues cited by the senators flared up even before Madrid. One is that NATO enlargement may divide Europe into two classes of nations, those admitted to the alliance and those excluded. Even promises of future consideration for countries like Romania, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia would leave them on the sidelines politically, militarily and economically. That may well turn into one of the most damaging consequences of expansion.
The answer is not to admit every applicant now. Even proponents of expansion recognize that doing so would overwhelm and weaken NATO. That leaves Washington and its allies skirmishing over the pace of expansion. A showdown was barely avoided in Madrid when France last week withdrew its insistence that Romania be offered membership immediately. This issue will continue to be a source of corrosive friction within the alliance.
The other immediate concern is the financial cost of expansion and how it should be apportioned among NATO members. The Clinton Administration, not surprisingly, has calculated a relatively modest $35 billion price tag spread over 13 years to modernize the military forces of new member states. Washington's share would be roughly $2 billion, or 6 percent. Other estimates run much higher, up to a total cost of $125 billion, with Washington paying $19 billion, or 15 percent. Senator Hutchison and her colleagues legitimately ask how the White House can be so certain Washington will ultimately cover just a fraction of the bill.
Hanging over the whole expansion plan is the potential adverse impact on Russia as it moves painfully toward democracy and free markets. Helping Russia complete that transition should be the primary objective of American policy today. NATO expansion, though grudgingly accepted by President Boris Yeltsin, seems likely over time to embolden Russia's anti-democratic forces. The first time NATO rejects Moscow's advice at a new consultative council set up to ease the concerns of Mr. Yeltsin, his accommodation with the alliance is certain to come under withering attack at home.
Given the absence of a clear threat to Europe and the possibility of so many unpredictable consequences, NATO expansion seems a gratuitous risk. If Mr. Clinton is determined to make it happen, he has an obligation to tell the American people why he is so sure it will not undermine stability in Europe and lead to a waste of American resources. He can begin in Madrid.

HEADLINE: For Now, Few Are Going From Food Stamps to Soup Kitchens

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS

DATELINE: SYRACUSE

 BODY:
When word spread that hundreds of unemployed, able-bodied adults would soon lose food stamps, this city's advocates took to the streets. They taped warnings on grocery store windows. They pinned fliers on community bulletin boards. And then the soup kitchens braced for the deluge of the hungry.
It never happened. 
 More than 500 people have vanished from the food stamp rolls since March, when Syracuse became one of the first cities in New York to deny those benefits to childless, able-bodied adults who fail to find work. But only a handful responded to the offer for help.
"We were thinking, 'Oh, my God, all these people will be coming,' " said Mary Anne Ruff, director of emergency services at the Salvation Army, "but to be honest, we just have not seen them." Ms. Ruff is still waiting for her telephone lines to burn and for lines of the needy to snake outside her food pantry's door.
More than 2,000 of New York's poorest people, those without income, jobs or public assistance, have lost food stamps for failing to find work. Under the new law, recipients are cut off after three months if they do not work at least 20 hours a week or participate in a workfare program. But to the surprise of county officials and advocates for the poor, they appear to be relying far more heavily on family, friends and low-wage, irregular jobs than on soup kitchens and homeless shelters.
They are the first public aid recipients in New York to hit time limits under the Federal welfare law. And supporters of welfare changes say their experiences prove that people will survive, and perhaps even benefit, after the safety net disappears.
Advocates for the poor say these people are just getting by, finding jobs that are quickly lost and leaning on relatives who can barely fill their own refrigerators. But even they acknowledge that the stories emerging from former food stamp recipients are tales of struggle, but also of survival.
Michael Manney, 30, illiterate and long unemployed, now shares his girlfriend's groceries and scrubs dishes for minimum wage at a Red Lobster restaurant in Glens Falls, a river town near Albany.
Theodore Clark, 36 and learning disabled, dined nightly in his retired mother's kitchen before reluctantly joining the workfare program in Fulton, just north of Syracuse.
And Cyrena Vance, 32, who had already been working off the books as a home health aide, took on another elderly client after she lost her food stamps.
"I don't need to bother with food stamps anymore," said Ms. Vance, who also receives help from her fiance.
Unexpectedly, these stories are emerging from cities with job shortages. Thirty-eight counties, including those in New York City, were granted Federal waivers to continue food stamps until November to able-bodied adults, those single men and women between the ages of 18 and 50 who lack physical or mental impairments that might prevent them from working.
But 18 of those counties, most of them upstate, like Warren County, which includes Glens Falls, and Onondaga County, which includes Syracuse, quietly refused the waivers. Saying they had enough workfare slots to place people who failed to find private-sector jobs, county executives sent hundreds of letters warning that benefits would soon be cut.
Over and over, the county officials encountered the same response: silence. Most people never responded to offers of workfare placements and simply disappeared once their food stamps were cut.
"We sent letters to 200 people asking them if they wanted a work slot and 30 showed," said Ted Mohr, the Commissioner of Social Services in Oneida County, whose office has cut food stamps to about 150 people.
But advocates for the poor and academics who have studied the impact of benefit loss in other states caution that while the anticipated chaos has so far failed to emerge, so have stable, long-term solutions for many people struggling to build new lives in the post-welfare world.
State officials estimate that about 17,000 able-bodied food stamp recipients will ultimately lose benefits for failing to meet the 20-hour-a-week work requirement. The vast majority live in New York City, where higher unemployment rates may make suffering more acute.
They are mostly men without high school diplomas who have received food stamps for less than a year. But many are illiterate, abuse drugs or alcohol and struggle to find permanent work.
"They are often street people who were living on the margins anyway," said Barbara Weiner, a lawyer with the Greater Upstate Law Project, an advocacy group that tracks changes in welfare rules. "We won't necessarily see them starving in the streets, but that doesn't mean everyone is happy and working. Their lives are more desperate."
Sandra K. Danzinger, an associate professor of social work at the University of Michigan, agreed.
"People turn to whatever limited and precarious personal resources they have and hold on as long as they can," said Ms. Danzinger, who has studied the elimination of Michigan's welfare program for able-bodied adults. "But friends and family absorb that impact at a cost that is kind of hard to measure."
In Glens Falls, Laureen Colbert, 40, prays every morning that her boyfriend, Mr. Manney, will keep his job. It is her only hope, she says, of staying afloat.
When Mr. Manney lost his $120 monthly allotment of food stamps in March, the couple survived on Ms. Colbert's disability check and food stamps. But at the end of every month, they found themselves living on spaghetti and Cup-a-Soup, unable to afford even milk or cereal.
In June, after months of resisting his girlfriend's entreaties to find work, Mr. Manney finally found the job washing dishes at Red Lobster.
In Fulton, Joan Clark fed her son, Theodore, and his wife, Cheryl, for three months in her sagging wooden house. Mr. Clark, who works as a school crossing guard 10 hours a week, refused to find another job to supplement his income.
"I already got a job," insisted Mr. Clark, who is illiterate and learning disabled. "I ain't going to kill myself for no food stamps."
He is a big man, who lost a full-time job as a janitor two years ago and never bothered to find another one. He cannot read the help-wanted ads in the newspaper or fill out a job application. And his confused blue eyes wander when his mother tries to explain the new welfare law.
"I wouldn't never let them go hungry," said Joan Clark, who helped support the couple with her disability check. "But we're lucky if we can afford a sandwich at Wendy's."
Two weeks ago, after enduring relentless pressure from his wife and his mother, Mr. Clark reluctantly agreed to join the local workfare program to help out. "I have to do what I have to do," he said.
In Glens Falls, Gerald Sutton, a 39-year-old recovering crack addict teetering on the brink of homelessness, is scraping by with the help of friends and the local food pantry.
He measures time not in the hours ticking away on his wristwatch, but in the slices of bread left in his cupboard and in the dwindling number of coins in his pockets.
Despite the hardship, he says he believes that food stamp recipients should work for their benefits.
"I got interviews at Wal-Mart, the hospital and the amusement park," said Mr. Sutton, a lanky, bald man wearing good-as-new slacks he dug from a thrift-store barrel. "That's the way it should be. You don't get something for nothing in this world."

HEADLINE: Few Community Boards Meet Deadline on Superstore Plans

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY

 BODY:
An effort by the City Council Speaker to defuse the controversy over where to put superstores is receiving a tepid reception from New York City's 59 community boards.
The Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, had set a June 30 deadline for submitting lists of potential sites for the sprawling suburban-style stores, such as Price-Costco or Home Depot. Mr. Vallone recently said his approach would give neighborhoods more control over site selection than a previous plan of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's. 
 So far, five community boards have submitted proposed sites. Fifteen other community boards have contacted the Council's Land Use Division and have sought help picking out sites, he said. And 10 boards are not expected to submit potential sites because their neighborhoods are considered to be too densely populated. About half the boards have made no proposals.
By soliciting advice from community boards, Mr. Vallone said he hoped to avoid the opposition that Mr. Giuliani encountered when he proposed making it easier for the superstores to open in some parts of the city. The Mayor's plan was rejected by all 59 community boards.
The failure of many community boards to meet Mr. Vallone's deadline is widely seen as a sign that some are still reluctant to embrace the very idea of superstores.
"Some of them," said Linda Cox, director of planning for the Municipal Art Society, "are not ready to take the risk of putting themselves on record as being in favor of superstore sites, which could open them up to criticism in their communities."
After defeating Mayor Giuliani's plan to make it easier for superstores to open in the city six months ago, Mr. Vallone introduced his own plan in May, calling on the Council to approve sites in advance after receiving suggestions from community boards and community-based groups.
Under Mr. Vallone's formula, the stores would be limited to 125,000 square feet of space, not the 200,000 square feet proposed by the Mayor. Mr. Giuliani had wanted to let the stores open in manufacturing zones without community review, contending that the city was losing retail business to suburban areas where the stores have proliferated.
Of the 44 proposed sites filed with the Council on Monday, half were submitted by Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey, a Queens Democrat who represents Long Island City and Sunnyside; the sites he proposed are all in his district. Civic groups, real estate concerns and chambers of commerce also drafted proposals, according to Mr. McCaffrey, the chairman of the Council's zoning and franchises subcommittee, and Council aides.
Mr. McCaffrey said he was pleased with the response so far, adding that while he views community boards as valuable, they are not the only source of suggestions.
He said that the June 30 deadline was not a firm one and that the Council would continue receiving suggestions until October, when a complete list of potential sites will be compiled.
"The question here is, are we coming up with megastore sites," Mr. McCaffrey said. "I don't care who's giving us the sites."
Adrian Joyce, the chairman of Community Board 7 in Queens, which represents parts of Flushing and College Point, said members of his board have not responded to Mr. Vallone's office because they simply do not have any sites. Originally, he said, he planned to propose sites in the 500-acre College Point Corporate Park, but it is being developed by the city's Economic Development Corporation.
Mr. Joyce said submitting a list of potential superstore sites would undercut the corporation's efforts in the park.
Deputy Mayor Randy M. Mastro declined to speculate at length on why many community boards let Mr. Vallone's deadline pass, saying that "they might well perceive it as we do, a plan to come up with a plan."
While the Giuliani administration has expressed skepticism about Mr. Vallone's approach, the Mayor's aides have maintained that they are willing to work with the Council, though they insist that the Mayor's plan was far superior.

HEADLINE: In Vote Today, Mexico Puts Election Reforms to the Test

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 5

 BODY:
Putting Mexico's electoral reforms to a crucial test, voters will cast ballots Sunday in midterm elections that are seen here as a watershed plebiscite on the country's 70-year-old authoritarian system.
Opinion polls suggest that President Ernesto Zedillo's governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, will lose control of Mexico City's vast municipal government and could for the first time give up its majority in Congress. 
 Those possibilities reflect major recent advances by opposition parties that for decades have been nibbling at PRI control in small town halls and distant statehouses and now may take control of institutions at the epicenter of Mexican power.
The offices up for grabs in the election are the entire Congress, a quarter of the Senate, six governorships and the Mexico City Mayor's office and municipal assembly. The results of the balloting are likely to usher in a new period of democratic ferment and potential conflict across America's southern border.
The biggest winner is likely to be Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, the leftist candidate for Mexico City Mayor, who ended his campaign with a two-to-one lead in opinion polls, and has already emerged as a powerful rival to Mr. Zedillo.
No Mexican President has ever had to preside over the nation from a capital city governed by the opposition, and senior Government officials said in interviews that they had already identified an array of prickly themes -- from how to control the police to how to divide federal tax revenues -- that are areas of potential dispute.
In a taste of the upheaval that could follow, crowds of PRI supporters blocked roads and seized municipal offices last week in several Mexico City suburbs controlled by opposition mayors. The suburban mayors asserted that the takeovers were intended to frighten citizens into voting for stability.
If ceding control of the capital has alarmed the PRI, losing its majority in the Congress would be an even more stunning blow. Since the governing party was formed in 1929, successive Presidents have enjoyed rubber-stamp approval of their proposals in the legislature.
But an opposition Congress could be expected to begin investigations into official corruption, require heightened disclosure of Government operations and force negotiations over economic priorities and the national budget.
The Zedillo administration will continue to control basic economic policies. Mr. Cardenas, the son of the PRI President who nationalized the country's oilfields, and several former socialists who share leadership of his Party of the Democratic Revolution, advocate a vigorous Government role in the economy, and their program calls for a "review" of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Mr. Cardenas said in an interview that he intended to concentrate on running Mexico City, but it remains unclear how forcefully others in his party may seek to alter the treaty.
In a striking contrast between Mexican and American political priorities, the hot-button Mexico issues in Washington, narcotics and immigration, went virtually undiscussed in the campaign here.
Instead, the opposition forged gains by focusing on Government corruption and an economic crisis that has cut the minimum wage to about $3 daily. The gains have also been possible because of electoral reforms that have increased opposition parties' access to press coverage, especially television, and have made fraud more difficult and campaign financing more equitable.
"Mexican politics have been dominated for years by the struggle to equalize the rules of the game," said Alberto Aziz Nassif, author of several studies of Mexico's democratic evolution. "Now the ground is fairly level and the struggle for power has begun."
Faced with the PRI's bleak electoral prospects, President Zedillo and his Cabinet officials are taking comfort in the view that if the balloting is fair, the world will credit them with the democratic opening.
"Whatever comes out will be the desire of the electorate, and we'll live with that," Foreign Minister Jose Angel Gurria said in an interview. "The message we'd like to get out is that the Mexicans did it again -- they had clean elections. We've achieved democratic normality, which means we're like all the other democracies in the world."
Opposition leaders are taking a wait-and-see attitude, especially since control of Congress may hang on a handful of votes in isolated districts where PRI coercion is a tradition.
Felipe Calderon, president of the conservative National Action Party, or P.A.N., said he trusted the independent "citizen counselors" who run the Federal Electoral Institute, the agency organizing the elections, but still had doubts about the electoral officials overseeing the country's 104,000 voting booths, many of whom are PRI officials.
For the 500-member lower house of Congress, 300 members are elected directly from districts while 200 others are chosen based on their parties' percentage of the national vote. A party must win at least 167 seats directly and earn more than 42 percent of the vote to gain a majority; polls suggest that no party will.
In a final survey that was published before campaigning formally ended this week and that measured opinions in late June, the newspaper Reforma reported that 37 percent of those polled preferred the PRI, 30 percent preferred the National Action Party, 26 percent preferred the Party of the Democratic Revolution, and 7 percent favored smaller parties. Voter preferences have shifted abruptly several times in the campaign, and Interior Minister Emilio Chuayffet on Thursday called the results "completely unpredictable."
The opposition strength has led commentators to announce the end of the Mexican system as it has been known, but Juan S. Millan, the PRI's secretary general, scoffed at such talk.
For years, people have been predicting "the death of the PRI and the end of Mexico's political system," he said in a meeting with foreign reporters. "They've been completely mistaken, and we think they're wrong this time too."
The system has been based on a single party led by a President who for a six-year term enjoyed extraordinary powers and then picked his own successor.
"What has presidentialism meant in contemporary Mexico?" Carlos Monsivais, a prominent writer, said to an audience here last week. "It has meant the unilateral power to mortgage the country in one administration, or to privatize it in another. It has meant that one person, the President, decides things for everybody, because the rest of us are said to not understand the problems."
This system has so completely dominated Mexico that as recently as 1976, the PRI candidate, Jose Lopez Portillo, was voted into the presidency unopposed. But over the last 15 years, two opposition parties have elbowed into the mainstream.
The National Action Party, a party rooted in the Catholic Church and supported by regional business groups, first gained momentum after 1983, when candidates criticizing PRI corruption won election to municipal governments in a series of northern cities.
The Party of the Democratic Revolution coalesced around Mr. Cardenas after he split from the PRI in 1987 and ran unsuccessfully for President the next year and again in 1994.
National Action Party governors currently control four states, and both parties have elected mayors in large cities. But neither has ever governed anything as important as Mexico City, whose Mayors have been appointed by successive Presidents since at least 1928.

HEADLINE: Clinton Credits Law For a Steep Decline In U.S. Welfare Rolls

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 5,

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that more than a million people had left public assistance rolls since last August, a figure he offered as proof that the tough new welfare measure he signed was working.
In his weekly radio address, Mr. Clinton said welfare caseloads fell by 3.1 million people between January 1993 -- when he took office -- and April of this year. In April, he said, there were 11 million people on welfare, or about 4 percent of the population, the lowest share since 1970. 
"All Americans should be very happy that three million of our fellow citizens are now off welfare rolls," Mr. Clinton said. "Let us redouble our determination to give more and more of our fellow citizens their own personal independence day."
Last August, the President signed a welfare measure that imposed a lifetime limit of five years for receiving welfare and gave the states control of Federal cash assistance and food stamps. The law, which took effect in all 50 states in July, ended the 60-year-old system of unlimited, direct assistance to the poor.
A report released in May by the White House Council of Economic Advisers attributed the drop in welfare rolls to three factors: strong economic growth, waivers that allowed states to experiment with welfare reform plans and Administration policies such as an expansion of the earned income tax credit, toughened child support enforcement and increased financing for child care.

Labor Groups Unimpressed By Democrats in Mayoral Race
With two months to go to the primary and four months to the general election, the Democratic candidates for Mayor of New York City have failed to win the backing of the city's most powerful unions, a traditional bastion of support that Democrats often rely on to lift them to victory in citywide races. In fact, several important unions have already thrown their support to Mayor Rudolph W.

Rustic Life Of Amish Is Changing But Slowly

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: NARVON, Pa.

 BODY:
The horse carriages still ply the hilly roads of Lancaster County, a black top indicating a Mennonite driver and a gray top an Amish one.
But they are not traveling to and from farms so much anymore, as they have through decades in a style of life resistant to the march of technology and urban confusion. These days, the drivers are just as likely to be headed for a bakery, a clothing store, a handicraft shop or even a cement factory -- sure testimony that a revered and resolute way of life is changing ever so slowly. 
 "And it continues to happen," said Moses B. Smucker, 46, an Amish man whose life as owner of Smucker's Harness Shop Inc. seems to symbolize the evolution. "It's pretty simple. There is not enough land needed to farm. People are making other choices.
"I don't consider it a negative. Some do. But I don't."
Amish and Mennonite families make up 36,000 of the 435,000 people in Lancaster County. For generations, the traditional among them have clung to the land for their values and livelihoods, resisting the temptations and conveniences of the outside world. Theirs has always been a rustic life of hard work, plain clothes, horse-drawn plows and no electricity.
But their style of life has made them a curiosity to outsiders, and the curiosity has grown into a tourist industry, attracting up to five million visitors a year. Lancaster County towns like Intercourse and Bird in Hand, once dots on the map where carriage drivers met to talk quietly, are now vacation destinations.
Main streets are flecked with bed-and-breakfasts and boutiques that sell Amish and Mennonite wares. Many stores are open on Sundays, a practice once unheard of here.
New industry has also found the area, drawn by a culture, fostered by the Amish and Mennonites, of hard work and dependability. As one of the faster-growing regions in Pennsylvania, with a population surge of nearly 6 percent from 1990 to 1995, Lancaster County is now home to 10,000 businesses, including giants like the Kellogg Company, Tyson Foods Inc. and the R. R. Donnelley & Sons Company, which have all built factories.
The county unemployment rate, 2.6 percent, is well below the national average of 5 percent, and residential subdivisions are flourishing.
But the combination of tourism and commercial success is fundamentally changing the sociological fabric of the Amish and Mennonite communities, which share the same Christian beliefs but differ in how they practice them. The Amish are generally more conservative.
New residents have driven up property values, and Amish and Mennonite families, which tend to be large, often with six or more children, are struggling to find enough farmland for all to make a living.
Many offspring stay, working family acreage for corn, tobacco, grains and other crops, and many others are leaving to find cheaper land elsewhere. But a growing percentage of Amish and Mennonites are abandoning the farms to pursue their own entrepreneurial instincts or jobs with new businesses that their communities spurred.
Mr. Smucker grew up on his family's 40-acre farm just north of here, in Churchtown. His father began making harnesses for horses as a side business in 1962. But eight years later, he was killed when a truck in which he was a passenger was in an accident, and the farm was sold.
Like thousands of young Amish, Moses Smucker worked the fields, but once the farm passed out of the immediate family, his interest waned. "I wanted to be in business," he said, so he concentrated on harness making.
Today, Smucker's Harness Shop on Route 23, amid dozens of small farms, stands as thriving evidence to his fortitude and the increasing diversity of Amish and Mennonite people. Generating millions of dollars a year in revenue, the shop has become a world-renowned source of hand-crafted carriages, bridles and other horse-related products.
"Our whole industry buys here," said Paul McDade of Border Carriages in New York City, a company that operates horse-drawn carriages in Central Park. He and two friends had just bought new bridles.
About half of the 24 employees at Smucker's are Amish. They make many of the products, some of which cost thousands of dollars. And like other Amish and Mennonite people, they are adjusting to a life apart from the farm, once an anchor for their traditions and values.
"More and more, we're becoming business people," Mr. Smucker said. "And I'm not so sure our leaders, the ministers and bishops, know how to deal with it. They're getting the hang of it. But they're still uncomfortable with it."
It is not only financial pressures that are changing the Amish and Mennonites. With increasing commercial development around them, their communities are also being pushed closer to the technologies and leisure activities that most Americans take for granted.
Outside a small food market in Leola, an Amish boy passed by on Rollerblades, his traditional black boots in hand.
Some businesses owned by Amish and Mennonites have begun advertising. "It's unbelievable what's happening," Mr. Smucker said. "We're now using color advertising in our catalogues. When we first started, all we did was open the front door."
Mr. Smucker, who said he would like to leave his business to his children -- three daughters and two sons -- has his eye on a new pursuit. He wants to be a full-time auctioneer, something he now dabbles in.
On a recent Saturday in New Holland, hundreds of items were being offered for bids, including dozens of expensive horse carriages. As Mr. Smucker was preparing for the sale, he hurt his toe, which required an ice pack and a bandage.
To carry on, he climbed into a golf cart and drove around the grounds. Resting in the small console that would otherwise hold golf balls and tees was a cellular telephone.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Cardinals Rise in the N.L. Central on the Wings of Their Pitchers

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
So, what took them so long?
 The St. Louis Cardinals needed nearly a month more of this season than last to arrive in first place in the National League Central. Everyone sort of knew they were the team to beat, but that's what was happening to them the first three months of the season -- most everyone was beating them.
On July 1, the Cardinals reclaimed the position that was theirs on the last day of last season. The next day, they reached .500. for the first time. 
 "I just hope it lasts," said Walt Jocketty, the team's general manager, thankful for any sign of pennant-race stability. "I've been kind of waiting to get to .500. I think this club is capable of taking off."
But since the Cardinals finally reached the elusive .500 plateau, they have lost three successive games to the shockingly competitive Pittsburgh Pirates and have tumbled back into second place behind the Pirates. That is not what Jocketty and Manager Tony La Russa had in mind.
"We're still not scoring a lot of runs, but we're playing a little bit better," Jocketty said. "We're still waiting for the offense to take off. If we had the offense of Colorado or Cleveland, we'd have quite a club."
That the Cardinals have reached the top again is not an achievement strictly of their own doing. They have had plenty of help from the other teams in the division, particularly the Houston Astros. Before the teams had played a full month, Houston led the Cardinals by six and a half games, but the Astros were unable to maintain their strong start. The Pirates joined them at the top of the division, and both looked as if they were keeping the spot warm for the Cardinals.
If first place was the Cardinals' inevitable destination, responsibility fell on their pitchers to get them there.
"Our pitching continues to be the strongest part of our club," Jocketty said. "It starts with the pitching coach, Dave Duncan. He's done an outstanding job molding this staff to his own personality -- hard working, diligent in going about their business. They kept us in the race until the offense could come around."
The starting rotation of the Benes brothers, Andy and Alan; Todd Stottlemyre; Matt Morris, and, when healthy, Donovan Osborne, is as strong as any rotation, the general manager said. Osborne has missed two months because of a groin pull but is expected back late this month.
The pitching staff is ranked No. 2 in the N.L. Only Atlanta's 3.11 earned run average is better than the Cardinals' 3.36. The Cardinals have also allowed the second fewest home runs and are second in strikeouts. In addition, the Cardinals have an ageless closer. On Friday, Dennis Eckersley, 42, squandered only his third save in 21 chances.
The team's hitters, on the other hand, have not placed the Cardinals among the league's run-scoring leaders. But right fielder John Mabry and first baseman Dmitri Young have picked up in recent weeks, and Delino DeShields has made Jocketty's decision to sign him as a free agent look good. After three mediocre-to-poor seasons in Los Angeles, DeShields has returned to the hitting level he achieved earlier with Montreal.
"He's developing into the catalyst at the top of the order we hoped he would be when we signed him," Jocketty said.
The negatives for the Cardinals as they look to the second half of the season are catcher Tom Pagnozzi and Brian Jordan, the regular right fielder. Pagnozzi, afflicted with a groin injury, has played only four games. Jordan is on the disabled list for the second time with a bulging disk in his back and may miss the rest of the season.
"He sat out six weeks, came back and still wasn't right," Jocketty said. "At this point it doesn't require surgery, but it is something that's a constant irritant and affects his swing and the way he plays the game."
 
New York, New York: No Draw
 The Mets' three-game interleague series in Detroit drew the smallest attendance for a three-game interleague series. In fact, adding in the two-game series played by West teams, only the series between San Diego and Oakland attracted fewer fans.
While the Mets' visit to Detroit drew 46,060, the Yankees' three-game series there a week earlier attracted 45,776. Must be something about New York.
 
Disappearing Acts
 When Clyde King, then the Yankees' general manager, was able to trade Ed Whitson to San Diego in 1986, it was considered one of the greatest acts of prestidigitation of all time. The trade of Kenny Rogers and his $5 million-a-year contract to the Padres did not rank with the move that made Whitson disappear, but it was impressive even so -- while it lasted. It seems unlikely that the Yankees, now that the trade has been canceled because Greg Vaughn has a shoulder problem, can turn around and do it again, but the story behind the trade with the Padres remains intriguing.
Tony Attanasio is an agent who was desperately trying to liberate a client, Mariano Duncan, from the Yankees. The San Francisco Giants were interested in the utilityman, who had become the No. 1 resident in George Steinbrenner's doghouse.
Attanasio, given the authority to try to make a deal for Duncan, was talking with Bob Watson, the Yankees' general manager, early last week and told him that the Giants were more interested in a pitcher than Duncan, but would consider accepting a package including the two players.
Would they take Rogers? Watson asked. No, he was told, Rogers makes too much money for the Giants and, anyway, they were interested in Dwight Gooden. But, Attanasio told Watson, if you want to put Rogers and Duncan together and would be interested in Vaughn, the Padres may go for that deal. They did. As difficult a season and a half as Rogers spent with the Yankees, no player had ever been treated the way Duncan was. Steinbrenner has tried to dictate lineup changes throughout his 25-year ownership reign of error, but never has a manager so blatantly capitulated to the owner's dictates as Joe Torre did on Duncan.
Steinbrenner declared Duncan no longer the Yankee second baseman, and Torre then rendered him virtually invisible. Steinbrenner has occasionally had short-term success with his lineup declarations, but nothing that approached the Duncan affair.
 In 1986, the owner told Lou Piniella not to play Dave Winfield against certain right-handers, but Piniella said, "If I keep doing this, I'm going to lose everyone else on the team because everyone will know who's making out the lineup." He told Steinbrenner that if he wanted to write the lineup, he could get someone else to manage.
 
Show Henderson the Money
 Rickey Henderson entered June with a .164 batting average and the distinct appearance of a veteran player who would be better off beginning the rest of his life. A calf injury, the Padres' crowded outfield and his inability to hit kept Henderson's plate appearances to a minimum.
But Henderson's performance the past month showed that he is not ready to retire and that he should be the Padres' regular left fielder again. His performance also made it easier for the Padres to trade Greg Vaughn. Since languishing at .164, Henderson has 37 hits in 106 at-bats, a .349 pace that has raised his season average to .281.
"With Rickey," said a baseball executive who knows him well, "what matters is pride and economic incentive. He wanted to play every day, so he beat out Vaughn."
 
Dubious Distinction Awards
 It was not a good week for the Milwaukee Brewers. Not only did the Cincinnati Reds sweep them in a three-game interleague series, but the Brewers also had the worst showing in the All-Star voting. Their catcher, first baseman and second baseman finished last, their shortstop and designated hitter placed next to last, their third baseman was 11th out of 14 and their 3 outfielders were among the last 8 of 42 on the ballot.
Philadelphia entered last night's game with a .277 won-lost percentage. Over a full season, that percentage would give the Phillies a 44-118 record. And the Pirates were supposed to lose more than 100 games?
 
Pitchers Reclaim Dignity
 Pitchers have reclaimed some of their rightful share of the major league game. In the first three months, runs and home runs were down from the first three months of last season. In 1,118 games last year, teams scored 11,428 runs and hit 2,530 home runs; in 1,115 games this year, teams scored 10,624 runs and hit 2,201 home runs.
The National League dropped to 8.96 runs and 1.77 home runs a game from 9.43 and 2.07. The American League dipped to 10.11 and 2.18 from 11.01 and 2.46. The major league game averages fell to 9.53 runs from 10.22 and to 1.97 homers from 2.26.

HEADLINE: Why Does It Take a Wrestling Match to Get Tax Reductions?;
Capital vs. Labor

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I am rather puzzled by the Republican proposal in the House to index capital gains to inflation (editorial, July 2; front page, July 1). 
 If I understand the proposal correctly, if the inflation increase in a given year is 3 percent and I invest $20,000 in a stock whose value increases $600 during the year, I pay no taxes on the $600. However, if I receive a wage of $20,000 a year and I get a raise of $600, I am required to pay taxes on the $600. I fail to see the equity in this.
In the one case I am investing capital, but in the other case I am investing labor.

HEADLINE: In Vote Today, Mexico Puts Election Reforms to the Test

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 5

 BODY:
Putting Mexico's electoral reforms to a crucial test, voters will cast ballots Sunday in midterm elections that are seen here as a watershed plebiscite on the country's 70-year-old authoritarian system.
Opinion polls suggest that President Ernesto Zedillo's governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, will lose control of Mexico City's vast municipal government and could for the first time give up its majority in Congress. 
 Those possibilities reflect major recent advances by opposition parties that for decades have been nibbling at PRI control in small town halls and distant statehouses and now may take control of institutions at the epicenter of Mexican power.
The offices up for grabs in the election are the entire Congress, a quarter of the Senate, six governorships and the Mexico City Mayor's office and municipal assembly. The results of the balloting are likely to usher in a new period of democratic ferment and potential conflict across America's southern border.
The biggest winner is likely to be Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, the leftist candidate for Mexico City Mayor, who ended his campaign with a two-to-one lead in opinion polls, and has already emerged as a powerful rival to Mr. Zedillo.
No Mexican President has ever had to preside over the nation from a capital city governed by the opposition, and senior Government officials said in interviews that they had already identified an array of prickly themes -- from how to control the police to how to divide federal tax revenues -- that are areas of potential dispute.
In a taste of the upheaval that could follow, crowds of PRI supporters blocked roads and seized municipal offices last week in several Mexico City suburbs controlled by opposition mayors. The suburban mayors asserted that the takeovers were intended to frighten citizens into voting for stability.
If ceding control of the capital has alarmed the PRI, losing its majority in the Congress would be an even more stunning blow. Since the governing party was formed in 1929, successive Presidents have enjoyed rubber-stamp approval of their proposals in the legislature.
But an opposition Congress could be expected to begin investigations into official corruption, require heightened disclosure of Government operations and force negotiations over economic priorities and the national budget.
The Zedillo administration will continue to control basic economic policies. Mr. Cardenas, the son of the PRI President who nationalized the country's oilfields, and several former socialists who share leadership of his Party of the Democratic Revolution, advocate a vigorous Government role in the economy, and their program calls for a "review" of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Mr. Cardenas said in an interview that he intended to concentrate on running Mexico City, but it remains unclear how forcefully others in his party may seek to alter the treaty.
In a striking contrast between Mexican and American political priorities, the hot-button Mexico issues in Washington, narcotics and immigration, went virtually undiscussed in the campaign here.
Instead, the opposition forged gains by focusing on Government corruption and an economic crisis that has cut the minimum wage to about $3 daily. The gains have also been possible because of electoral reforms that have increased opposition parties' access to press coverage, especially television, and have made fraud more difficult and campaign financing more equitable.
"Mexican politics have been dominated for years by the struggle to equalize the rules of the game," said Alberto Aziz Nassif, author of several studies of Mexico's democratic evolution. "Now the ground is fairly level and the struggle for power has begun."
Faced with the PRI's bleak electoral prospects, President Zedillo and his Cabinet officials are taking comfort in the view that if the balloting is fair, the world will credit them with the democratic opening.
"Whatever comes out will be the desire of the electorate, and we'll live with that," Foreign Minister Jose Angel Gurria said in an interview. "The message we'd like to get out is that the Mexicans did it again -- they had clean elections. We've achieved democratic normality, which means we're like all the other democracies in the world."
Opposition leaders are taking a wait-and-see attitude, especially since control of Congress may hang on a handful of votes in isolated districts where PRI coercion is a tradition.
Felipe Calderon, president of the conservative National Action Party, or P.A.N., said he trusted the independent "citizen counselors" who run the Federal Electoral Institute, the agency organizing the elections, but still had doubts about the electoral officials overseeing the country's 104,000 voting booths, many of whom are PRI officials.
For the 500-member lower house of Congress, 300 members are elected directly from districts while 200 others are chosen based on their parties' percentage of the national vote. A party must win at least 167 seats directly and earn more than 42 percent of the vote to gain a majority; polls suggest that no party will.
In a final survey that was published before campaigning formally ended this week and that measured opinions in late June, the newspaper Reforma reported that 37 percent of those polled preferred the PRI, 30 percent preferred the National Action Party, 26 percent preferred the Party of the Democratic Revolution, and 7 percent favored smaller parties. Voter preferences have shifted abruptly several times in the campaign, and Interior Minister Emilio Chuayffet on Thursday called the results "completely unpredictable."
The opposition strength has led commentators to announce the end of the Mexican system as it has been known, but Juan S. Millan, the PRI's secretary general, scoffed at such talk.
For years, people have been predicting "the death of the PRI and the end of Mexico's political system," he said in a meeting with foreign reporters. "They've been completely mistaken, and we think they're wrong this time too."
The system has been based on a single party led by a President who for a six-year term enjoyed extraordinary powers and then picked his own successor.
"What has presidentialism meant in contemporary Mexico?" Carlos Monsivais, a prominent writer, said to an audience here last week. "It has meant the unilateral power to mortgage the country in one administration, or to privatize it in another. It has meant that one person, the President, decides things for everybody, because the rest of us are said to not understand the problems."
This system has so completely dominated Mexico that as recently as 1976, the PRI candidate, Jose Lopez Portillo, was voted into the presidency unopposed. But over the last 15 years, two opposition parties have elbowed into the mainstream.
The National Action Party, a party rooted in the Catholic Church and supported by regional business groups, first gained momentum after 1983, when candidates criticizing PRI corruption won election to municipal governments in a series of northern cities.
The Party of the Democratic Revolution coalesced around Mr. Cardenas after he split from the PRI in 1987 and ran unsuccessfully for President the next year and again in 1994.
National Action Party governors currently control four states, and both parties have elected mayors in large cities. But neither has ever governed anything as important as Mexico City, whose Mayors have been appointed by successive Presidents since at least 1928.
"Cardenas will control vast resources," said Maria Amparo Casar, a political scientist. "He'll supervise thousands of patronage jobs, and he'll have tremendous power to destabilize. The potential for conflict in this city is extraordinary."

HEADLINE: The Mystery of Janet Reno;
What Is Janet Reno Thinking?

BYLINE: By Jeffrey Goldberg; Jeffrey Goldberg is a contributing writer for the Magazine. His most recent article, on Southern Baptists' attempts to convert Jews, appeared in March.

 BODY:
In may 1993, the Clinton White House sent Janet Reno to the Senate in order to call for the reinstatement of a law, the independent counsel statute, that Reno's predecessor as Attorney General, the Bush appointee William Barr, had tried enthusiastically to kill. The statute, which allows for the appointment of an independent prosecutor in cases of high-level executive-branch wrongdoing, had long been anathema to Republicans, who felt it was used as a nightstick against them during the Reagan and Bush years. The Democrats, of course, had grown quite fond of the statute, which was drawn up in the wake of Watergate, and hoped to revive it.
 "Bernie Nussbaum came to see me during the transition," Barr said recently, referring to Clinton's first White House counsel. "I told him, don't breathe new life into the statute. As a Republican, I said, nothing would please me more than seeing you guys live under it. As an American, I think it makes life in the executive branch miserable. But he said that the President and he were committed to run an Administration at the highest ethical standards" -- Nussbaum denies that this exchange took place -- and I said, be my guest." 
 It fell to Reno, then in her third month as the nation's top law enforcement official, to make the case for the reauthorization, and she did so with alacrity. "It is absolutely essential for the public, in the process of the criminal justice system, to have confidence in the system," Reno told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, "and you cannot do that when there is conflict or an appearance of conflict in the person who is, in effect, the chief prosecutor." The statute was soon reauthorized by Congress.
 Four years later, Reno finds herself in an unhappy predicament. During Clinton's first term she was quite liberal in the use of the statute, asking for independent prosecutors to investigate Mike Espy, then Secretary of Agriculture; Henry Cisneros, then Housing and Urban Development Secretary; Ron Brown, then Commerce Secretary, and, at the President's public urging, the Whitewater affair. But now, several months into her second term as Attorney General -- a second term that, by some accounts, the President granted her only with great reluctance -- she is under considerable pressure to seek the appointment of yet another independent prosecutor to investigate yet another Clinton scandal, the fund-raising practices of the President's re-election campaign.
 The President has expressed no desire to see an independent counsel appointed to investigate the charge that he knowingly and flagrantly violated campaign finance laws, and Reno has been, in the eyes of most Republicans, many editorial writers and even some Democrats, suspiciously agreeable. House Speaker Newt Gingrich has compared Reno to the felonious Nixon Attorney General, John Mitchell, and asked if she were "the protector of the President or the enforcer of the law." (Washington being Washington, Gingrich made these statements even as he was tidying up his own ethics mess.) Janet Reno has been called many unkind things during her four tumultuous years as Attorney General -- unfit to lead, myopic, unintelligent and, more frequently, too odd for Washington. But her integrity has never been seriously challenged, until now.
 That the attacks on Reno's integrity stem from a case involving the alleged misdeeds of others may seem paradoxical, but so is the nature of the job. The Attorney General is the President's loyal aide when forging policy on issues of crime and justice, yet she is also responsible for enforcing Federal law as head of the Justice Department, even as those laws apply to the Administration she works for.
 There is something paradoxical, too, in the new, intensified relationship Reno has with the President. She is a woman who came to Washington and immediately found herself relegated to the outermost circle of Clinton advisers. Now she has moved to center stage -- not because of policy matters but because of the alleged sins of the White House she works for.
 The campaign finance scandal -- Senate hearings on which are scheduled to begin this week -- comes at an unfortunate moment for Reno, because it has obscured the fact that she finally seems comfortable in her job, and is in it for the duration, despite the early-stage Parkinson's disease that now afflicts her. If she had the personality of a Rudolph Giuliani (or a Bill Clinton), she would be seizing credit for the dramatic dip in national crime rates -- not rightfully, necessarily, though she would certainly be blamed if crime were going up. Moreover, her department has scored some high-profile prosecutorial victories, most recently in the case of Timothy McVeigh. And though hers is a largely symbolic generalship, she has had significant success from the bully pulpit, preaching about volunteerism and early childhood development and greatly expanding the rhetorical possibilities of the office -- imagine Dick Thornburgh, or for that matter John Mitchell, making "deadbeat dads" into a policy centerpiece, or talking up the importance of prenatal care as a key to crime prevention.
 Such advocacy has helped secure respect for her outside Washington. This reputation partly explains why she has felt no need to defend herself against the charge, inside the Beltway, that she's protecting the President. She has explained, apparently to her own satisfaction, the reasons she thinks it unnecessary to remove a Justice Department task force from the investigation of campaign fund-raising and hand it over to an independent counsel. In a letter she sent in April to the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Utah Republican Orrin Hatch, Reno maintained she would need "specific and credible" evidence that a person covered by the statute -- one of about two dozen high Administration officials, including the President -- may have committed a crime and, barring that, she wrote that she would remove herself from the investigation only if she concluded that "there is a potential for an actual conflict of interest, rather than merely an appearance of a conflict of interest." The fact that she had once advocated the independent counsel statute as necessary precisely because even the appearance of a conflict of interest can undermine confidence in the system presented still another paradox, at least to those who are now convinced Washington has finally got to Reno.
 Since the release of the letter to hatch, reno has uttered barely a newsworthy word on campaign finance, even as it has continued to rivet the capital. Reno is not the most forthcoming high official, in any case. Her weekly news briefing is a fascinating ritual in which she invites reporters to ask her anything they want and then manages to say nothing at all. Nor is this just a problem she has at the office. Even her close friend Walter Dellinger, the acting Solicitor General, acknowledges, "She is not the easiest person to chat up."
 This is not to say that she is ungracious. She is courtly and solicitous, quite the opposite of the crazed Amazon portrayed on the Saturday Night Live" skit "Janet Reno's Dance Party." She is, however, as tall as "Saturday Night Live" would have her.
 In her office at the Justice Department one morning not long ago, she smiled serenely when the subject of the independent counsel statute was raised. Did she still support the statute as written?
 "I think it's best while this issue is pending not to comment," she replied.
 I then read aloud her comment to the Senate committee in 1993 about the necessity to trigger the statute even when there is the mere appearance of a conflict of interest. Did she still stand by this language?
 "I think Congress has tried to address it," she said, carefully, "because in a situation with respect to a covered person, Congress has in effect said what it thinks is the scope of an appearance of conflict, and then gives an additional part to it, and as I have said, I have not found specific and credible evidence with respect to a covered person."
 I tried again, asking if the alleged campaign finance abuses might fit into the category of an appearance of conflict of interest. I mentioned the memos written by Harold Ickes, the former White House deputy chief of staff, that detail the President's hands-on involvement in raising "soft money" that may have then been used not for Democratic Party matters but, illegally, for Clinton's campaign advertising.
 "It's very important when you look to make sure you don't jump to conclusions," Reno replied. "I think Congress said, Here are the covered people. I think it is generally correct where whether there is a conflict or not, there may be by the relationship an appearance and then you have got to look at everything and make sure that you're judging on facts and not innuendo and that's what we're trying to do."
 I then asked her to define the word "appearance."
 "I think you have to take every case on a case-by-case basis and look at the evidence," she said.
 I asked again if she stood by her 1993 statement on the appearance of conflict.
 "Mmm-hmmm," she affirmed, barely.
 Having hit a 6-foot-2 stone wall, I tried a bit of indirection.
 "Is it true," I asked, "that you are Janet, Queen of the Bunny Planet?"
 Reno laughed -- guffawed, really, and said, "It's a wonderful children's book, isn't it?" Two weeks before, Jamie Gorelick, who was Deputy Attorney General during Reno's first term, had mentioned that Reno is especially enamored of a children's book series called "Voyage to the Bunny Planet." It tells stories of little boy and girl bunnies who, having terrible, miserable days, dream of a place "far beyond the moon and stars, 20 light years south of Mars," where "spins the gentle Bunny Planet, and the Bunny Queen is Janet." Queen Janet then takes the little bunnies on a tour of the day as it should be.
 Gorelick, the mother of two small children, introduced the Attorney General to the Bunny Planet series, and Reno now reads the books during story hours at a Washington elementary school she has "adopted."
 Among Reno's aides, the Bunny Planet has become a running gag, but Gorelick sees deeper meaning in Reno's attraction to the character of Queen Janet. "It's not a joke," says Gorelick, who is now an official at the Federal National Mortgage Association. "It's not just the similarity of the names. The Bunny Queen tries to make the world a better place for kids. It's really her vision of a better world for children."
 Reno admitted that her goal is to make the world a little better place, but waved off Gorelick's analysis. "It's just the magic of the words," she said.
 Still, Gorelick may be on to something. Reno is among the Administration's foremost advocates for children, a surprising role for the chief Federal law enforcement officer to adopt. She is also an advocate for volunteerism, and drug treatment on demand, and gives speeches that could just as easily be delivered by a Surgeon General rather than an Attorney General. It is her populist oratory, her unusual willingness to accept blame and her reputation for straight talk when she is speaking with citizens groups or law enforcement people -- she possesses naturally what every congenitally inauthentic politician yearns for, sincerity and plain-spokenness -- that has made her a figure of great appeal, at least outside Washington.
 But here's the mystery. Throughout the independent counsel controversy, Janet Reno, the straight-talking prosecutor from the Everglades, has been contorting and bending her words in ways that would do proud the more obfuscatory members of the D.C. bar. Nowhere was this more in evidence than at a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing at the end of April, shortly after Reno rejected, for the fourth time, calls for her to seek the appointment of an independent counsel to look into the President's '96 campaign. One question at the center of the controversy is whether the Clinton campaign erased the line between soft money and hard money. So-called soft money is raised, without limits, for the ostensible purpose of "party building." "Hard" money, on which limits are placed, is raised to elect candidates. Soft money may be spent to create "issues advocacy" advertisements, which are meant to educate voters, but it cannot be spent on "express advocacy" advertisements, which are designed to win votes for political candidates.
 Deep into the afternoon session of the hearing, Reno was asked a seemingly simple question by the Pennsylvania Republican Arlen Specter, a former prosecutor who knows how to handle a witness. Specter first read to Reno the text of a television advertisement from last year's campaign, which states, in part: "Head Start, student loans, toxic cleanup, extra police, anti-drug programs. Dole-Gingrich wanted them cut. ...Dole-Gingrich: deadlock, gridlock, shutdowns. The President's plan: finish the job, balance the budget, reform welfare, cut taxes, protect Medicare. President Clinton gets it done."
 Specter then asked the Attorney General the following question: "Could that possibly be language, taken as a whole, that says anything other than urge the election expressly of President Clinton?"
 It seemed clear enough that the advertisement was designed not to educate the voting public about, say, the dangers of toxic waste. Here is how Reno saw it, however:
 "I think it is important again to consider the whole framework by which we have to judge that and the fact that the elections commission is in place to look at these decisions, to look at the message, to render advisory commission opinions. At this point the whole area is so murky, we cannot find clear and specific and credible evidence that the law has been violated."
 Specter: "Well, Attorney General Reno, if that is express advocacy the law has been violated. So the question is: Can you say to us that it is your legal judgment that that is not express advocacy?"
 Reno: "Based on the processes that have been established by the Department of Justice, the MOU" -- memorandum of understanding -- "with the elections commission, this is a situation in which we would not find specific and credible evidence that a crime had been committed that would justify triggering the statute."
 After the hearing, I asked Specter what he thought of Reno's answer.
 "I do not want to use the word gobbledygook," he said, by way of using the word gobbledygook. "But it was unintelligible."
 Was she intentionally unintelligible?
 "I do not want to impugn motives," he said.
 Later, in her office, I asked Reno about her answers to Specter.
 "What the issue there is that it was one of the most complicated issues," she said. "As he asked that particular question -- that's an easy question to answer, or could be, but in terms of the law it's a much more complicated issue, and so I may have not been as articulate as I could have been. And also, just the context of that oversight hearing on soft-money issues, hard-money issues -- it is one of the most difficult areas I have to deal with."
 But how would she have ill served the American people if she had simply said that the ad sounded like a campaign ad for Bill Clinton?
 "Because," she answered, "I did have to go back and describe what the Federal Election Commission has done and go into details and again, that's what we're trying to do in terms of responding to everybody. Just lay it all out so they can understand the whole history."
 Earlier, Reno's chief of staff, a straight-talking ex-Miami prosecutor named John Hogan, had told me that, when it comes to Federal election law, "by being plain-spoken you can mislead." He went on to say, "Any of the phrases they talk about can be overdefined," and then immediately, and wistfully, noted the looking-glass quality of his observation.
 When I mentioned Hogan's statement to Reno, she said that he "has a point." She added, "One of the things I have tried my level-best to do is when I'm confronted with a major issue I've got to explain -- I say, 'Go tell somebody to put that in plain English.' This one is very, very difficult to explain."
 But, I asked, "if the American people can't understand the system, and the system can't be explained, is something then rotten with system?"
 I immediately realized my mistake. Bluntness was not going to be lightly forgiven.
 "I'm not going to comment because you're using inflammatory language," she said, "and that probably gives us a good point to say that this is a pending matter and I shall not comment."
 T he question that goes unasked is this: why would Reno, who presumably values her reputation for straight talk and integrity, contort her words and evade questions, all the while bringing down scorn on her head, when she has the discretionary power to ask, this very second, for an independent counsel?
 There are any number of answers to that question. Hers, of course, is that she is exactly right on the law, even if she has been suddenly dispossessed of her ability to explain herself plainly. Another possible answer is that she is using her office to protect the President.
 If Janet Reno were a close friend of President Clinton, say, in a relationship like that between Ronald Reagan and Edwin Meese, the pressure on her to trigger the statute would have long ago grown unbearable. But because it is well known that she is not close to the President, she can still seem credible when she decides against triggering the statute. In other words, she provides the President cover by not providing him with cover.
 But that is much different than accusing Reno of engaging in a Watergate-style cover-up. To borrow language from the independent counsel debate, there is no specific and credible evidence that Reno agreed to stonewall Congress on appointing an independent counsel in exchange for a second term as Attorney General. There are important Republicans who do maintain, however, that she is not wholly immune to pressure from the White House.
 "There is tremendous pressure on her," Senator Hatch told me. "She knows she serves this Administration and she knows that the President gave her this opportunity. There should be a natural tendency for her to want to protect the President."
 But Reno never promised to protect the President. According to John Hogan, Reno's chief of staff, the President told Reno when he was first interviewing her for the job in early 1993 that he'd heard she was not a "team player." Hogan recalls that Reno told the President that she would be a fine team player, unless he did anything "illegal or unethical." The President, Hogan says, laughed out loud at her answer and appointed her later, a testament to either his desperation, his true innocence or a level of political sophistication so sublime that he could predict that Reno's reputation for independence would one day provide him with political cover.
 Reno didn't provide much cover early on. At one point during Clinton's first term, 3 of the other 13 Cabinet members Reno would meet
 at Cabinet meetings were under investigation by independent counsels she had requested, and she gained the enmity of much of the White House staff for creating the appearance of an Administration drowning in scandal. Particularly critical were those working to get Clinton re-elected last year.
 "The last thing she cared about was whether Clinton was re-elected or not," Dick Morris, the President's former political strategist, told me. He then inadvertently paid Reno a compliment: "Sometimes I thought she didn't realize she would lose her job if Clinton lost."
 Reno is, of course, the accidental Attorney General. The Clintons (Hillary played an active role in Justice Department staffing) had decided to name a woman to the job, but their first choice, Zoe Baird, and then their second, Kimba Wood, were done in by what became known as "Nannygate." Reno, a self-described "old maid," had no problems with immigrant domestics and taxes, and that's mainly what interested the White House.
 "I called the President and said, 'Here's somebody who won't have these personal difficulties,' " says Senator Bob Graham, the Florida Democrat who attended Harvard Law School with Reno and who is also a friend of Clinton's. "She is single, yes, but Janet is just a very careful person in her personal life, particularly in regard to her standards of conduct." What also comforted the White House was that she was the only one of the three original candidates to have been vetted by voters, who had returned her repeatedly to the top prosecutor's job in Dade County.
 Reno did not have any easy go of it during the first term. Along with the independent counsel investigations of other Cabinet members, there was the debacle at Waco, the worst moment of her career, in which, trusting the deeply flawed advice of the F.B.I., she ordered the gas attack on the Branch Davidians, which led members of the cult to set fire to their compound, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 80 people. And there was the perception in the White House that she was more social worker than prosecutor. Even today, the social-worker epithet rankles Reno. This is the woman, after all, who was the chief prosecutor in Dade County during its "Miami Vice" heyday. "I've probably asked for the death penalty far more often than people who call me a social worker," she told me. John Hogan, her chief of staff, is more explicit: "I don't know how many people Dick Morris has ever sent to the electric chair."
 Morris, who attacks Reno in his memoir for trying to block many of President Clinton's crime initiatives, seems to have misinterpreted Reno's record. In truth she has been, as she promised the President, the model of an Administration team player on issues of policy. She has abandoned, or at least shelved, many of her liberal beliefs, in order to support Clinton's get-tough approach to crime. Early in the term, she was critical of mandatory minimum sentencing for nonviolent drug offenders, but she soon learned the White House game plan: never expose Clinton's right flank on crime.
 "I think anybody who is going to function in government has to realize that you can't get everything you want," Reno says.
 Friends say this has been difficult for her. Talbot D'Alemberte, a former president of the American Bar Association and Reno's mentor, says, "She's taken some grief from friends about the way things are going on crime policy." He clearly counts himself as one of those friends. "I think some of the policies I've seen are silly," he says. "I'm not a fan of the death penalty, and adding new death penalties contributes nothing. . . .I'm really sorry that the Administration has not picked up Janet's rhetoric on programs that can prevent crime."
 It is an open secret that crime policy, which has traditionally been set at the Justice Department, was taken over by the White House staff, under the direction of Rahm Emanuel, now the President's senior adviser. "Her willingness to have us develop policy is a sign of strength, not weakness," Emanuel says. Despite her deference to the White House on most issues of policy, Reno has never become a friend, or even much of a sounding board, for the President.
 "I doubt the two of them ever met alone in the two years I was at the White House," Morris says. "He felt she was outside his Administration, almost kind of an auditor. He was very critical of her. It was almost like dealing with a foreign country."
 Unlike other Cabinet members, including her friend Donna Shalala, the master networker who runs the Department of Health and Human Services, Reno seldom if ever drops by the White House in the early evening to work the halls, or have coffee with the President.
 "She and the President have respect for each other, but for whatever reason, they've never been able to develop the kind of personal relationship that other Presidents had with their Attorneys General," says John Schmidt, who served during Clinton's first term as Associate Attorney General and is now a candidate for governor in Illinois.
 There is another aspect, insiders say, to Reno's problems within the Administration, one she shares with other senior Administration women.
 "I do think women have a slightly tougher time at the upper levels because the men assume that the women don't understand politics," Shalala says. "It took me a very long time to make the White House understand that. The White House has at least caught up with me." Shalala recalled parties given by senior Administration women during the first term at which the talk turned to sexism. "I can't say to you that Reno was telling the stories," Shalala said. "But she wasn't in the corner, and she giggled along with everybody else."
 Shortly after Clinton won re-election last November, articles began appearing that suggested that the President would rather start the new term with a new Attorney General. On different occasions, the President was presented with the opportunity to say kind things about Reno, and didn't. Reno doesn't respond to subtlety, however. She stated publicly her desire to stay, which would have forced the White House to very publicly remove her. But at the same time, when leaders of national police and law enforcement groups called up offering their lobbying help to keep Reno in the job -- she has developed quite a constituency among national policing groups -- she told her aides to decline all help. "She said, 'The President has a right to make his decision without pressure,' " one aide, Nicholas Gess, the director of intergovernmental affairs, said.
 When I asked Reno how she felt about the pressures during the transition period, and about the unkind talk that had apparently been emanating from the White House, she said she just "chuckled about it." And from the White House now, all is butter. "Janet Reno, outside of Madeleine Albright, is one of the most respected officials in America," Rahm Emanuel says magnanimously. "She is highly respected here." Emanuel has not always been so sweetly complimentary of Reno, Justice Department officials say. When asked if he has ever been critical of the Attorney General, he replied, "There hasn't been a single Cabinet officer in history about whom someone in the White House hasn't said, 'Goddammit, what's going on there?' "
 What exactly transpired between Clinton and Reno as his second term began no one can or will say. The President would not discuss it. All he would say, in a written statement, is: "Janet Reno is an invaluable asset to my Administration. As Attorney General, she has exhibited the highest standards of integrity and professionalism, a deep understanding of the needs of law enforcement and a personal commitment to our nation's young people. She is an integral part of my Administration's efforts to fight crime, improve our juvenile justice system and protect our environment."
 Those who know Reno best are convinced that she remains her own person. "The thing about Janet is that is she discovers evidence adverse to the President, she won't hesitate to use it," D'Alemberte says. "I doubt the President feels very protected by her."
 SO IF SHE'S NOT PROTECTING HER PRESIDENT, THEN WHY DOES SHE have such a difficult time explaining her decision? Her critics say it is because her position is defensible only in the most narrow, overly legalistic terms. Her defenders, however, say that by its nature, Federal election law is arcane and confusing.
 "I think you ought to give a prize to anyoe who can succinctly and plainly explain the Federal campaign and contribution laws," says Benjamin Civiletti, who served as Attorney General under Jimmy Carter.
 Just because Reno can't explain herself, in other words, doesn't mean her decision not to trigger the statue is wrong. What might be happening now, Justice Department officials say, is that the complexity and confusion of the case - and of the statue - is causing people to throw up their hands and call for an independent counsel to straighten everything out.
 But Lee Radek, the chief of the Justice Department's public integrity section and the man overseeing the campaign finance investigation, says, "Nowhere in the statute does it say you can have an independent counsel because it's all a big mess."
 Radek says that Reno has guidelines to follow when considering whether to take the investigation away from him and turn it over to an independent counsel. "In order to trigger, no matter what, you've got to have a specific and credible allegation that a person has committed a crime," Radek explained. "Now you look at two questions. Is he a covered person? If he is, then you go for an independent counsel. But if he isn't a covered person, then you look to see if there is a conflict of interest. If there's a conflict of interest, then the Attorney General has the discretion to trigger the statute."
 A key question is whether the Clinton campaign, under the direct coordination and control of the President, the most important covered person, knowingly flouted the laws governing campaign spending by turning the Democratic National Committee, a party organization, into a soft-money collection-and-advertising front for the campaign. The President's critics hold that money raised by Clinton during those famous "coffees" at the White House was funneled, in the main and illegally, to the D.N.C. Justice Department officials say privately that the violations of election law the President is alleged to have committed are of the type never prosecuted criminally, if only because the regulations are, in effect, a patchwork of laws and court orders that sometimes contradict one another.
 "Frequently when the Federal Election Commission tries to regulate something, the courts say they've gone too far, under the First Amendment," says Robert S. Litt, a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the criminal division.
 The real crime, some officials say, is that election law is loophole-filled and invites abuse by unscrupulous campaigns. Even if the President directed the spending of soft money for hard-money purposes, the argument goes, it is not at all clear that any law has been broken. "The law in his area is complicated and in flux," Litt said.
 No it isn't says Reno's first Deputy Attorney General, Philips Heymann, now a professor at Harvard Law School. He says, in essence, that the Justice Department is buying into a fiction scripted by the White House - that is, just because you call it soft money doesn't make it soft money.
 "They maintain that whatever money is paid into the D.N.C. is automatically soft money," he said. "But the people who donate it plainly intend to give it to the President because they want his approval, so if the President raises the money and puts it in my bak account with the understanding that he has a right to control it and spend it, then it's not money at all, but his. What the Justice Department is saying is that candidates can always avoid the law by this most easy of charades. I want them to say this is a violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act, and if they don't want to treat it as criminal, let them stand up and say that."
 RENO'S RELUCTANCE to appoint an independent counsel may have nothing to do with the White House and everything to do with her loyalty to her investigators inside the Justice Department. They maintain they can do the job, and what she is essentially doing as some see it, is giving them the chance. When Reno arrived in Washington, she arrived in Washington, she arrived without friends, without a cadre of aides to install all along the fifth floor corridor at Main Justice. She had joined the Administration relatively late, and the White House had already stacked the halls with its own people - Webster Hubbell as Associate Attorney General, for one. Reno forged friendships, though, among the ranks of the career prosecutors. And especially because the department is currently so bereft of top political appointees - the criminal division, under which the campaign finance investigation is being run, has been without a permanent head for nearly two years - she has listened to the career people, and the career people want to investigate campaign fund-raising.
 "She's doing this because the career people, every which way short of sophistry, are trying to keep the case," Joseph diGenova says. He is a former U.S. Attorney, a Republican who was independent counsel in the Bush passport affair. "I do not believe for one moment that Reno or anybody in the department is motivated to protect the President. They are in this to show that the career people can do it, and she backs them."
 Radek, a bluff, cheerful man of 54, was unwilling to discuss details of the ongoing investigation when I spoke to him, but he was happy to defend the Justice Department's ability to invesitgate the executive branch. The independent counsel statute is an insult," Radek said. "It's a clear enunciation by the legislative branch that we cannot be trusted on certain species of cases."
 But Radek also denied that Reno is reflexively beholden to the career prosecutors. "She does not always do what the career people tell her to do," he said. "There is nothing passive about the way she makes decisions. It is so discouraging to see her excoriated for doing what she always does, which is call it as she sees it." Radek went on to say that the independent counsel statute places his prosecutors in a no-win situation. "It we do very well in our investigation, we have to turn the case over to an independent counsel. If we don't find anything, then we're criticized for not making the case.
 "The fact is, through the history of the public integrity section, and its observation of and consultation with U.S. Attorney, I've never seen a problem with a prosecution going easy on the party of the administration in power," he added. "In fact, the opposite is often true - prosecutors are motivated to go the extra mile. They're often more strict with the incumbent administration to avoid the appearance of favoritism."
 Over and over again in the halls of the Justice Department, career prosecutors - and political appointees, too - point to the conviction of Representatives Dan Rosentkowski three years ago on corruption charges as proof the department will prosecutors - and political appointees, too - point to the conviction of Representative Dan Rosentkowski three years ago on corruption charges as proof the department will prosecute without political interference.
 At the time of his conviction, Rostenkowski was a key figure in the effort by the Clinton Administration to move its health care package through Congress, and Republicans feared that the Clinton Justice Department would go easy on Rostenkowski in order to assure that he remained as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Newt Gingrich, then the House minority whip, said at the time he worried that there would be "some kind of rigged deal where 15 or 20 felony counts magically get reduced to a misdemeanor to allow him to stay in charge of health care."
 That didn't happen; Rosetenkowski was indicted on multiple felony counts, and is now in jail, and the Clinton health care initiative failed. And what happened to Eric Holder, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, who brought the case against Rostenkowski? At this writing, he is the Administration's nominee to replace Jamie Gorelick as Deputy Attorney General, the No. 2 position at Justice.
 The Rostenkowski case should confirm to the world, Justice officials say, that the Department is fully capable, in theory, of handling the investigation into campaign fund-raising, even if it reaches all the way to the top, and that Clinton should not take undue comfort in the fact that the investigation is still in the hands of the Justice Department.
 "An independent counsel would almost be a better break than what Clinton's going to get from the career Justice people," Dick Morris says. "There's a fetish for independence that is manifested there."
 Morris's views are not widely shared in the White House, though. Most of the President's advisers would still rather have the investigation in the hands of the Justice Department, if only because Federal prosecutors under Reno will not end the case by declaiming from the Federal courthouse steps about the corrupt nature of the entire fund-raising process. The Justice Department prosecutors might very well bring the exact same charges in the matter that an independent counsel would bring, but they are bound by rules of discretion that simply do not bind a wildly ambitious or highly partisan independent counsel.
 FEW PEOPLE IN WASHington, even those partisans who wield the independent counsel statute like a club, profess to like it. Critics say the politicized and public nature of the statute has made the appointment of independent counsels tantamount to indictment. "When an independent counsel is appointed now, the whole presumption of guilt shifts," says Lloyd Cutler, former White House counsel to Presidents Carter and Clinton.
 Others argue that there is something inherently unfair when a prosecutor is handed unlimited time and unlimited resources to investigate a single individual. "Too much unreviewable power in the hands of a prosecutor is a dangerous thing," says Joseph diGenova, who led a three-year independent counsel investigation into accusations that Bush Administration officials rifled State Department passport files for incriminating information on Bill Clinton. "To only have one case to work on is a dangerous thing, because when a prosecutor has an array of cases, there is a kind of Darwinian case selection." In other words, prosecutor drop weaker cases in favor of stronger ones. "That doesn't come into play with an independent counsel because of the single-natured purpose of the statute," diGenova says.
 That said, by di Genova's reading, the campaign finance mess does qualify for an independent counsel. "It is a miserable statute, but it's the law," he says. "If there's ever a case that qualifies for an independent counsel, it's this one."
 'ALL THIS BANGING just makes her more stubborn," says Talbot D'Alemberte. "Just look at the way her jaw line sets."
 If it is true that Reno's reluctance to trigger the independent counsel statute has made her look bad, at least to some, it is also true that few officials in Washington care less about spin than Reno. "There's a feeling that we're getting her into trouble with the press and with Congress," Radek says. "But to her great credit, she never brings that up. It doesn't concern her."
 Tom Fiedler, the political editor of The Miami Herald who has reported about her since the 1970', said recently: "Washington is a culture that values responding to consensus. You can't be stiff-necked. You have to shed responsibility and bend to the prevailing winds. People in Washington get frustrated with her because she's supposed to bend to their whims. ... The harder you push, the more dug in she'll get."
 This is behavior that is seen as odd in compromise-driven Washington, but wouldn't necessarily be understood as such anywhere else. Reno never goes off the record with reporters; she never dishes Cabinet gossip; she stands awkwardly, and often alone, at the few receptions she attends.
 "I don't think she cares about Washington," says Rahm Emanuel, who does. "She might have one of the world's greatest poker faces, but I really don't think she cares."
 To hear Reno tell it, she has never much cared what people think about her, ever since she was a gangly girl at her first cotillion in Miami. "I was 5-11 1/2 when I was 11 years old and I had to go to cotillion when I was 12," she recalled. "Our cotillion teacher was a wonderful, wonderful lady. She was my P.E. teacher in elementary school and she was incredible - she taught me how to shoot baskets.
 "But she was basically a dance teacher. I can remember walking into cotillion and young men coming to my waist, and I guess I felt a little bit like an odd duck. And Mrs. Nowakowski was 5-8 and a very striking woman, and as I would slump, she would make me stand up straight. And after I had two years of cotillion, I think after that I never felt like an odd duck again, that I always had the capacity to look out from me and have the sense -." She stops suddenly.
 "She was a wonderful person. She died about a year or so ago, and they read a letter that I wrote to her -." Reno stops, choking up, and begins crying behind her big square glasses.
 "She made you feel like you were special," she went on. "When I won my first election, she sent me a note that just said, 'Attagirl.' ... I think I've always felt kind of awkward and knobby-kneed, and as my mother said, knock-kneed, and I've oftentimes felt like I was all arms and legs, but after Mrs. Nowakowski, it didn't bother me."
 The point of the story, of course, is that not much has bothered her since. Reno is often described as the most inner-directed official in Washington, which is why she seems at peace, even though it could reasonably be assumed that in some respects she is a lonely woman. And decisions on such questions as the independent counsel statutes could certainly be lonely ones.
When I asked her once what she like about Washington, the converation turned to her solitary pursuits - her exploration by canoe of wetlands, her long walks down the towpath of the C&O Canal. "A lot of the people that I've come to regard as friends for the rest of my life are centered around the Department of Justice, and one of the ways I keep my perspective on things is to have breaks from what I do all day long," she says. "What I enjoy doing is not going to socialize with people on a casual basis. It's not relaxing."
 HER OBSTINACY, AND HER aloneness, separate her from Washington. They keep her from playing Washington games, but hey also might keep her from responding to reasonable opinion and advice, especially when that opinion and advice comes from Capitol Hill or the pressw. It is a theory Senator Hatch has considered. Having failed to change Reno's mind so far on the independent counsel matter, Hatch is "moving to give her a little bit of leeway here," he told me recently. "She doesn't want to appear that she's caving into Congress. I want to give her a little room."
 Reno has spoken movingly about how important it is for the public to have faith in the justice system. Yet this faith is being tested each time a new revelation about Clinton's campaign fund-raising emerges, and each time Reno responds by refusing requests to ask for an independent counsel. And this faith is tested, whether she likes it or not, not just by conflicts of interest, but also by the simple appearance of a conflict.
 There has been little sign of a shift in her thinking. Her prosecutors have constructed a narrow argument against triggering the statute, and she continues, at increasing cost to her reputation and to that of the Justice Department, to defend it. "There's a lot of sniping at her that she isn't a hands-on administrator, that she's a terrible Attorney General," says William Barr, her Republican predecessor. "I say, hands-on, shmands-on, that's a nice thing. But aren't you looking for an Attorney General who will do the right thing? I think she has acted with integrity, until now."
 To her way of thinking, Reno is doing the right thing, and she presumably believes that she, and her reputation, will prevail. But when the Senate hearings on campaign finance commence, the blief that Reno is protecting the President may well harden, and spread beyond the Beltway. If that happend, she is likely to confront just how alone an official can be.

Pssst -- Wanna Be an American? Cheat Sheet Below

BYLINE: By TOM KUNTZ

 BODY:
TAKE that foot-long, Fourth-of-July-weekend wiener out of your mouth and answer this question: Have you got what it takes to be an American?
Last year a record 1.05 million immigrants made the grade, in part by passing written tests randomly culled from the 100 sample questions below. The Immigration and Naturalization Service uses them to gauge prospective Americans' knowledge of United States history and government. Among the other hurdles to citizenship applicants must jump, they must take a test made up of either 10 or 20 such questions, and get at least 7 out of 10 or 12 out of 20 correct. 
 After perusing the mostly elementary questions, you may be thinking: what fool couldn't get most of these right? Answer: quite possibly an all-American fool, for surveys regularly affirm that much of the established citizenry is largely ignorant of and indifferent toward basic American history and civics. (This state of affairs is probably not helped by current disagreements over what basic American history is).
In contrast, the newcomers now seasoning America's multicultural melting pot (and stirring resentment for doing so) are quite eager to learn this stuff cold -- with a diligence that the I.N.S. says is reflected in rising numbers of naturalizations. Oh, say, can you see a paradox here?
The I.N.S.'s 100 questions follow, with the agency's answers beneath them. TOM KUNTZ

HEADLINE: A Revived Long Island Finds Life After Military Contracts

SERIES: ECONOMIC PULSE: Long Island

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: BOHEMIA, N.Y.

 BODY:
As Long Island's economy boomed with the military buildup of the late 1980's, then crashed at the cold war's whimpering conclusion, the Periphonics Corporation poked along at its own pace. The company made automated telephone systems that allowed callers to shop or get information by pushing buttons. It was a product that seemed to have only limited appeal.
Then came the 1990's. In wave after wave of downsizing, corporate America dismissed many of the people who answered phones and took orders. Suddenly, interactive telephone systems were hot. Periphonics sold stock and raised new capital. Its work force, which hovered at about 200 employees through most of the 1980's, tripled in just over five years. 
 "It was a case of right place, right time," said the company's chairman, Peter J. Cohen.
Companies like Periphonics tell the story of Long Island's economy in the 1990's: Growth has come in unexpected ways that owe little to the rhythms and rules of the past.
A decade ago, this 110-mile-long finger of New York -- best known, perhaps, for its natural beaches and the suburban life style it created -- was also one of the most military-dependent places in America, home to Grumman, the aircraft giant. Five years ago it was among the areas hardest hit by the severe recession of the late 1980's and 1990's, when Grumman and other military contractors imploded.
Now it is growing again, at a pace that through most of the mid-1990's has been among the fastest in the region. The unemployment rate in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, which hit its worst, 8.1 percent, in July 1992, has been among the best in the state over the last year: 3.5 percent in May, according to the State Labor Department.
But it has not been a traditional economic recovery at all. Long Island did not bounce back; it bounced off in a new direction entirely. As military contracting has all but disappeared, Long Island has engineered a revival heavily reliant on smaller companies, computer technology, retailing and business services like law and accounting.
Long Island's break with the past was underlined again recently when Lockheed Martin, a military contractor in Maryland, announced that it was buying Northrop Grumman, based in Los Angeles, for $8.3 billion. The Grumman name, once synonymous with the nation's military and technological might, will disappear. Long Island will go on.
"Long Island is not following the old patterns," said Gary Huth, a labor market analyst at the New York State Department of Labor. "You may not be able to define what it is, but it's working."
Economists say this new pattern is reshaping Long Island with new jobs and new industries, but also with a resurgent wealth, largely driven by Wall Street. The mixture remains volatile, they say, and short-term predictions are dangerous. Construction has returned, and manufacturing has even shown strength. But an expansion in retailing jobs slowed suddenly in 1996.
"A year and half ago, job growth was almost entirely in lower paying, service sector industries, but we're now getting significant growth in higher paying jobs," said Matthew T. Crosson, president of the Long Island Association, a business group. "What is happening is not attributable to any one sector of the economy."
Ordinary workers have been left scratching their heads. "I was off a lot last year, then this year it really picked up," said Jerry Mahoney, a construction worker from Amityville who was unloading scaffold boards in late June in Manhasset for a major expansion of Ralph Lauren's Polo store. "It seems to be seasonal," Mr. Mahoney said.
The new rhythm has also brought back echoes of Long Island's past. In the 1990's, after decades of looking to Washington for its economic cues and signals, Long Island has been pulled back into the orbit of New York City.
The Long Island Rail Road expects the numbers of commuters into the city this year to match 1985's high. Jobs connected to the New York financial industry have grown.
And while many of those trends also hold true for New York's other nearby suburbs in Westchester County, Connecticut and New Jersey, economists say that three facts make Long Island different.
It fell further in the last recession than most of the other suburbs, and experienced deeper structural changes in its economy. And it has rebounded through a combination of forces that mirror more closely those spurring growth in New York City.
In many ways, Long Island seems to be emerging as a kind of economic companion and partner to the city, as finance, tourism and global trade have boomed in both places. Long Island is about the only nearby suburb of New York, for example, where tourism is a major force.
"It used to be that New York City was the hole in the doughnut and the suburbs grew faster," said Pearl M. Kamer, the chief economist at the Long Island Association. "That has been reversed. We have to admit that suburbs such as Long Island are benefiting."
Perhaps even more crucially, optimism -- battered and beaten by the bad years -- has begun to bubble up from customers to business owners to their suppliers.
"Frequently now, people have an upbeat tone in their voice," said Carole Kentrup, who, along with her sister, Kathy Dancik, and their husbands, owns a bakery in Bohemia called Jonathan Lord that supplies cheesecakes to restaurants and stores. "It's a cautious thing, but it's there," Ms. Kentrup said.
 
A Fresh Start
On Separate Track Among Suburbs
Other areas of the metropolitan region have certainly experienced turmoil and transformation in the 1990's -- notably southeastern Connecticut, home of the Electric Boat submarine yards. But for the most part, New York's closest suburbs are riding the same horses today that they did in years past. Wall Street has changed its hiring patterns, requiring fewer clerks because of new technologies. AT&T split itself apart in New Jersey and shed thousands of jobs. The International Business Machines Corporation downsized in Westchester County. But in the end, those institutions remained in place.
Here, the slate was closer to being wiped clean.
Grumman -- long the island's largest private employer and greatest home-grown success story -- shrank from 25,000 employees in 1986 to 3,500 today. It was sold along the way, becoming Northrop Grumman, with a headquarters in California. At the same time, the number of Long Island companies doing military contracting work fell to 25 from 70, and that does not even count the hundreds of subcontractors, like machine shops, that quietly folded.
Long Island lost a greater percentage of its jobs in the three and a half years of recession, more than 100,000 out of about 1.1 million jobs it had in its peak in early 1989, than any other New York suburb in New Jersey or New York State. Only Fairfield County in Connecticut lost a bigger percentage of jobs in the region, according to the United States Census Bureau and Regional Financial Associates, an economic research company in West Chester, Pa.
And the contrast with Connecticut is stark. In Fairfield, the recovery from recession has mirrored the boom of the 80's with corporate headquarters and financial services. In New London, one huge employer replaced another: As Electric Boat shrank, Foxwoods Casino, just 10 miles away, was expanding, eagerly hiring displaced workers.
But on Long Island, many of the largest and fastest-growing employers, like Computer Associates, a software company with 2,000 workers here, have hired few former military workers. The cultures of high-tech entrepreneurship and military contracting are just too different, a spokeswoman said.
Ravi Gulati, who founded a computer software company, Stonybrook Technologies, in 1992, said he avoided hiring former military workers, and dismissed some of those he did hire because they couldn't think their way to the cutting edge. "They needed a manual to go to the bathroom," he said.
For their part, former military workers describe a world where biased employers and self-doubt create vast walls between the old economy and the new one.
Larry Hackett, 39, an engineer who was laid off in 1991 from Airborne Instruments Laboratories, a division of the Eaton Corporation in Deer Park, is someone who broke through. Mr. Hackett, who went to work for Mr. Gulati's start-up company in 1994, said the key was to abandon the plodding, military-minded caution in which he had been steeped since college -- and then to convince Mr. Gulati that he could keep doing it.
"It was mostly a change of mind-set," Mr. Hackett said, sitting in his windowless, ground-level office at the company, near MacArthur Airport in Suffolk County. "I realized I had to take a risk."
Tom Sweeney, a former Grumman manager who now commutes into New York City from Farmingdale for his job at Cisco Systems, an Internet company that has expanded greatly in the city in the last year, said there are always faces he recognizes on the train. Like converts from an old faith to a new one, they exchange glances and say hello. But they have all moved on, Mr. Sweeney said. They have assimilated.
Economists say the mismatch of old skills and new cultures may partly explain why Long Island has continued to lose about 15,000 residents through migration each year, about six-tenths of a percent of its population. The average for New York's suburbs is four-tenths of a percent per year, and some suburbs, especially in New Jersey and in Rockland County, are growing, according to the Census Bureau.
Other echoes of the lean times resonate as well. Many companies, especially private contractors, had to cut prices to the break-even point or below to stay in business during the recession. Now they say competition keeps them struggling, unable to raise prices anywhere near the old levels.
"People cut prices 20 percent or 30 percent," said Steve Lucas, owner of Lucas Plumbing and Heating in Bohemia. "I don't know anybody who's making any money."
But many people say that the grim early 1990's, when many economists feared that Long Island's job and population losses could leave its economy crippled and handicapped for years, strengthened the people and businesses that stayed.
Anne M. Strauss, a public relations coordinator at Periphonics and a lifelong resident of Long Island, is a walking barometer of the local economy. She said that most of the new employees at her company, like herself, had been downsized out of someplace else. People like that work harder, she said. Ms. Strauss was laid off twice, first from a military contractor, then from a bank, before finding her way to Periphonics a year ago.
"Once that happens to you, it changes you, it changes your work ethic," she said. "It's like people who lived through the Depression -- you never forget."
 
New Money
Paper Millionaires By the Ream
Long Island has not been known for breeding fast fortunes, except perhaps for the heady days after World War II, when the explosive growth of suburban housing made it a real estate developers' paradise. It had old money, certainly, in wooded enclaves like Oyster Bay, where Teddy Roosevelt once romped. And it had a certain heavy-duty manufacturing stability: It gave the world the lunar landing module for the Apollo space program.
In the 1990's, companies like Stonybrook Technologies have streaked across that sky like meteors. Here was new money, made the new way -- quickly. Founded in late 1992 to create business networking software, the company was bought out in December 1996 for $35 million in stock by Ascend Communications, a California Internet company that put its name on the door, and, in classic Silicon Valley fashion, made Stonybrook's founders instantly, fabulously wealthy.
The company was never a job engine. It had all of 20 employees at the time of its purchase -- almost all of them software engineers like Mr. Hackett. But it did become a wealth engine.
"There's a lot of paper millionaires around here," said Mr. Gulati, now a general manager of Ascend's network management division. With stock options for every employee, Mr. Gulati said that even a new engineer who had been employed only a week cleared $20,000 to $30,000 in Ascend stock. "When it flows, everybody should catch a little of it," he said.
There is no lack of people holding out buckets.
From the shopping strips of Manhasset, where stores like Polo and Prada are building or expanding, to the vast glass-vaulted space of Roosevelt Field Mall in Garden City, where Nordstrom -- a high-end department store from Seattle -- is scheduled to open its first Long Island store this summer, money is chasing money.
Deals are flowing. Over the last 18 months, the dollar volume of retail real-estate transactions on Long Island that were handled by Garrick-Aug Associates, a large commercial real estate company in New York, equaled all those in New Jersey, Connecticut and Westchester combined, company officials said.
Housing prices in the first four months of 1997 rose faster than at any comparable time since the late 1980's, according to Mary Rice, a branch sales manager at Coldwell Banker Sammis in Huntington. But the number is also distorted. "The upper end has increased dramatically," Ms. Rice said. In the over-$550,000 market, there is now a shortage of inventory, she said.
Other places seem barely touched by the changes. High-tech jobs have grown in western Suffolk County, especially the Hauppauge area, and the surge in construction, retailing and tourism has been felt across the island. But in downtown Hempstead, a heavily minority area in Nassau County, there are still vacant stores. The Abraham & Straus that closed there in 1991 is still closed.
"Things are better on Long Island in general, but I don't think it's caught up with Hempstead," said Dale Goldstein, who works in Hempstead for the state, licensing day-care providers. "I would say right now it may be worse."
But on a recent sunny morning at the Americana at Manhasset, an upscale shopping strip on Northern Boulevard, the new prosperity seems almost taken for granted. Shoppers in pearls dismounted from their Land Cruisers. A Jaguar convertible, with a Gatsbyesque leather golf bag casually thrown in the back seat, sat parked unguarded in front of Louis Vuitton.
Marlene Kendal, who lives in Lynbrook but goes to the North Shore to shop, said the evidence is everywhere: "Money is still around and people are spending it," she said.
 
The Complexity
More Ties, Near and Far
The Intel Corporation, the Silicon Valley computer chip giant, sent shudders through places like Standard Microsystems, a semiconductor company in Hauppauge, when it dropped the prices on its network interface cards by 40 percent in February. Then, only a month later, Intel said it was buying 10 percent of Standard Microsystems's stock and starting a cooperative venture to develop certain new semiconductor integrated circuits.
Confused yet?
The Long Island economy's new web of economic connections -- to the global economy, to New York City's financial services industry and to the high-tech empires of California and Boston -- have made it a far more complicated place.
On one level, the growth of the New York City economy, especially financial services, has connected Long Island more to the city than was the case a decade ago. But at the same time, the growth in world markets for many Long Island products, and the ownership and investment connections to high-tech companies elsewhere, like Ascend, have also made Long Island more global in its outlook.
Defining jobs inside companies has become harder. The Olsten Corporation, the temporary services company that has become one of Long Island's largest employers, expects to place about 25 percent more workers on Long Island this year than last year. Last fall, it moved the headquarters of its information technology unit -- home base for about 3,000 consultants, many of them engineers -- from Manhattan to Melville. Temporary labor, whether engineers or secretaries, shows up on state labor charts as service work, obscuring the underlying direction of the economy.
Another difficulty is figuring out where people work. The growth in jobs -- about 15,000 between March 1996 and March 1997, and only 600 in the 12 months before that -- has not been enough to explain why the unemployment rate has fallen so low. Ms. Kamer said the only logical inference is that more Long Islanders are finding work in New York City.
Real estate professionals say that in the last two years bonuses from Wall Street have become major factors in the housing market, creating a new ripple early in the year when the checks are distributed.
Closer connections between New York and Long Island also seem to be working in the other direction as well. A children's clothing store called Metro Clothing, which has two sites, in upper Manhattan and the Bronx, plans to open its first store outside New York City in July at the Green Acres Mall in Valley Stream. Bert Lehnherr, the mall store's operations manager, said the company had been studying traffic patterns and demographics for months. The conclusion, he said, is that of all the malls and all the suburbs, this is the one to be in because it increasingly looks like the New York market in which the chain has prospered.
 
Help Wanted
Openings Abound, But So Do Fears
Right below the company's name on the building marquee at Standard Microsystems there is a list of job postings, apparently aimed at drive-by job seekers: Stock clerk, electronics technician, production operator. At Periphonics, the company offers bonuses up to $5,000 to workers whose referrals help fill jobs. At the Landing Deli in Bohemia, where aircraft terminology still dominates the menu (a "B-52" is turkey, ham and roast beef on a hero), better times have created a shortage of lunchtime help.
Are these good portents or bad? Is the intense and competitive market for labor, especially engineers, a sign of strength or of limitation?
"If someone had said four years ago that we would be having a shortage of engineers, you would have said they were crazy," said Mr. Huth at the State Department of Labor.
For Long Island's future, a looming labor shortage -- unthinkable as that might have seemed a few years ago -- raises some of the same specters that haunted its last boom. One question hangs over everything: Is this a repetition of 1988, when the local economy overheated and hit the wall, or can it be sustained?
Some signs indicate a sideways slide. Job growth declined suddenly last year, attributed by economists partly to fewer new retailing jobs, but also to the volatility of high-technology economics. Standard Microsystems laid off 65 workers in January, for instance, because of a slowdown of orders.
The question of the Long Island Lighting Company also hangs over the future of a region that has some of the highest electricity rates in the nation. Many residents fear in particular that a proposed partial state takeover of the utility, while possibly cutting electricity rates, would discourage the kind of innovation and competition that is sweeping other areas of the country.
In May, US Airways said it would sharply reduce service to MacArthur Airport as part of an efficiency drive, reducing its presence in markets where it was not profitable.
The constant possibility of mergers and buyouts among computer companies also creates uncertainty and adds to the sense of vulnerability that many Long Island residents still express. Those anxieties were set off in the fall of 1996, with the merger of two large Long Island software companies -- Computer Associates, based in Islandia, and Cheyenne Software, in Roslyn Heights. But in fact, a spokesman for Computer Associates, the surviving company, said that while the $1.2 billion transaction created some overlap of responsibilities, there were no layoffs. Everyone affected was given new duties and retained.
Ms. Kamer at the Long Island Association also worries that New York City is too dependent on one industry -- Wall Street -- for its current economic expansion, and that Long Island, through its closer alignment with the city, may share that vulnerability.
"The New York City economy is much less broadly based than it was," she said. "That's analogous to what we had in the 1980's with the defense sector."
Technology stocks, meanwhile, offer the very definition of volatility. Remember the $35 million in stock that Ascend Communications paid for Stonybrook Technologies last year? In late January, it peaked at just over $80 a share. It ended trading on July 3 at $49. Mr. Hackett, the former military engineer, cashed out one-third of his stock early this year, but he has let the rest ride the market.

Chart: "KEEPING TRACK: "Long Island's Recovering Economy"
Long Island was among the areas hardest hit by the recession of the late 1980's and 1990's when many military contractors based in Nassau and Suffolk folded. Now it is growing again, at a pace that has been among the fastest in the region.

HEADLINE: Intramural Warfare at CUNY

 BODY:
New York City has reaped incalculable benefit from the City University of New York, a system of public colleges that has educated hundreds of thousands of people, ushering many of them from poverty into the middle class and beyond. CUNY is already reeling from fiscal retrenchment and a dramatic influx of foreign-born students who need special help. Now a vendetta by some newly appointed trustees against the system's Chancellor, Ann Reynolds, is making matters even worse, raising the prospect of protracted instability.
The chairwoman of the trustees, Anne Paolucci, and the vice chairman, Herman Badillo, clearly intend to run Dr. Reynolds out of town. So far the majority of the board has seemed cowed into silence by this obstreperous pair. This silent majority needs to assert itself and prevent a season of internecine struggle between now and the next board meeting in September. Whether they side with or against Chancellor Reynolds is less important than that they exercise their civic duty to oppose the Paolucci-Badillo formula of management by constant conflict. 
 The new trustees are entitled by law to make policy changes and to scrutinize even the most minute aspects of educational policy. But from their very first days in office, Dr. Paolucci and Mr. Badillo have shown an exaggerated interest in confronting the Chancellor. The personal animus found cover in the recent controversy over the English competency examinations at Hostos Community College and elsewhere. But instead of embracing a testing procedure that the faculty had carefully developed over a period of years, the new trustees ordered policies that have spawned a lawsuit from students and that the faculty have viewed as dictatorial. Edith Everett, a longtime trustee, recently said the climate was the most political in memory and suggested that the new trustees were trashing the university as a prelude to downsizing it.
After weeks of personal attacks, Dr. Paolucci and Mr. Badillo have finally pointed out specific areas of concern, among them budget issues, remedial education, language instruction for non-English speakers and enhanced instruction in the city high schools from which CUNY draws most of its students. These are reasonable concerns, and on some of them Dr. Reynolds can cite accomplishments. Her administration put limits on remedial instruction in CUNY's four-year colleges. Her College Preparatory Initiative strengthened high school instruction and is now bringing CUNY its strongest freshman classes in decades. In addition, Dr. Reynolds has fought tenaciously for the system's poorest students, bringing her into conflict at times with both Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov. George Pataki.
Dr. Reynolds has flaws. Early in her tenure she spent too much time on outside business interests. Her relationship with the faculty has perhaps been more adversarial than necessary. Moreover, the failure rate among CUNY graduates on the state teacher certification tests is troubling. While we do not swallow whole what Mr. Badillo and others have said about graduation rates and grade inflation, the board can, with reason, compare CUNY's statistics to those of similar public institutions.
If the board decides on the merits that her debits outweigh her contributions, that is its right. It is even within reason to arrive at the judgment that it is simply time for fresh leadership. But an attempt to create crises unnecessarily in order to drive her out just will not do. It is unfair to the Chancellor. It creates chaos in a system that desperately needs order, and it will make it harder to attract a quality replacement. Dr. Paolucci's comments about how easy it would be to find someone good to run the place temporarily illustrate precisely the sort of unrealistic, grudge-driven decision making that CUNY and the city cannot afford.
The weeks between now and the next board meeting in September could be a crucial time for the system. Dr. Paolucci and Mr. Badillo say they are not sure they have the nine votes to dismiss the Chancellor. All 16 voting members of the board have a civic and institutional obligation to use the summer months for the creation of a more rational atmosphere rather than head counting on the success of the Paolucci-Badillo removal campaign.
The board members and the Chancellor explored and defined their differences. Now they have to work out the question of whether they can work together in a timely way. Moderate trustees like Ronald Marino and James Murphy have proposed a more measured approach to this problem, and that is encouraging. But if this is a summer of warfare that cripples a valuable institution, much of the political blame will come to roost on Governor Pataki and Mayor Giuliani, whose political appointees are behind the furor.

HEADLINE: Bootleg Videos: Piracy With a Camcorder

BYLINE: By LINDA LEE 

 BODY:
"Men in Black" opened across the country last Wednesday -- about six weeks after bootleg videos of the film went on sale on the streets of New York.
"Batman and Robin" opened June 20; it was available the same day at a Harlem market for $5. And a week before Disney's animated film "Hercules" opened, a bootleg version was on sale. (Adding insult to injury, it was camcorded from the balcony of Walt Disney & Company's own New Amsterdam Theater in New York.) 
 Video piracy is thriving in America, and nowhere more so than in New York. The growing sophistication of technology and the cachet of seeing something first are combining to intensify a persistent problem, despite raids on copying labs and occasional personal intervention by film figures like the director Spike Lee.
In effect, bootlegged films are like a nagging cold for the movie industry, a pesky problem that could undermine studios' financial health and in some places, like New York, threatens to turn into pneumonia.
It is almost impossible to know how much such bootleg competition costs Hollywood studios -- though studio spokesmen quote guesstimates of lost revenues running to hundreds of millions of dollars annually. But whatever the financial losses, the studios fear they will escalate some day with the introduction of DVD, digital video disks, which will enable pirates to make perfect copies of films.
Many bootleg videos are surreptitiously copied with camcorders smuggled into advance screenings. But some come from inside the industry: work copies of films from editing houses, special effects houses and early test screenings.
"Work prints get stolen all the time," said Tom Sherak, the chairman of the 20th Century Fox Domestic Film Group, part of the News Corporation. "Now that we edit on Avid, you can pull it right off. We try to watch it as closely as we can, but you can't watch everything." Avid is a computer editing technology widely used in film and television.
Using a $500 videocamera and a tripod and occasionally making use of the theaters' audio jacks for the hearing impaired, a bootlegger "can go to the movies once a week and make $1,000 or more," said Bill Shannon, the head of the Motion Picture Association of America's New York anti-piracy office. "If he makes 30 copies, and sells them for $100 apiece, that's $3,000. And that's tax free."
The association, which investigates and prosecutes piracy cases for the studios, estimates that the bootlegging of films costs the industry more than $250 million in potential domestic revenues. But the organization's figures for the economic impact of bootlegging presume that a person buying bootleg films would have spent $4 to $8 to see the movie in a theater; a risky assumption in neighborhoods where there are no first-run theaters.
Still, no one quarrels with the association's assertion that New York is the capital of American bootlegging. "New York is the center for this problem, and particularly for illegal labs and distribution networks," said Edmund J. Pistey, the director of United States anti-piracy operations for the association. "That's why we're focusing with the highest amount of intensity there."
One problem is that blase New Yorkers tend to see bootlegging, like counterfeiting Rolex watches, as a victimless crime.
"I don't know what's wrong with the African-American consumer in some urban areas," Spike Lee said. "They want to buy an inferior product and get something for a bargain."
When Mr. Lee's film "Malcolm X" came out in 1992, he took some of his friends, "muscle," he calls them, to 125th Street with baseball bats to clean the bootleg copies off the street.
Few vendors of bootleg tapes set up shop in highly visible areas of Manhattan, instead selling them along Hudson, Canal and Duane streets in lower Manhattan and out of vans parked on the Upper West Side. They are also found in busy shopping areas around Fordham Road, at the Grand Concourse Plaza in the Bronx, and on Fulton Street in Brooklyn.
The sale of bootlegs used to be widespread on 125th Street in Harlem. Now it is endemic at the Malcolm Shabazz Harlem Market, at 116th and Lenox, where the videos mentioned in this article were purchased over the last four months.
In New York, as in other cities, the structure of bootlegging operations is simple: scores of individuals obtain prints of the film. This network feeds into a highly organized group of duplication labs, which make copies in bulk -- and most of the profits. Shrink-wrapped copies are then distributed through groups of street vendors -- often recent immigrants. Some legitimate video stores also sell bootleg tapes. Two weeks ago, police raided 10 video stores in Suffolk County.
"In the final analysis, it's out-and-out theft, and can't be tolerated," said Mr. Pistey of the association. "You're stealing the works of people. That's what intellectual property rights are all about."
The motion picture association has recently focused its attention on duplication labs in New York. Last week, the organization, working with the Queens District Attorney's Office, cooperated in a raid on a bootleg video lab in Queens that had 100 machines copying movies; more than 10,000 counterfeit videotapes were seized, the District Attorney's Office said.
In May, the group helped the Bronx District Attorney's Office put five labs in the Bronx out of business. Eleven people were arrested on felony charges at the operation, which was churning out bootleg copies of "The Fifth Element," "Anaconda," "Jerry Maguire," "Beverly Hills Ninja," "Selena" and "Liar Liar." A year ago, the largest operation of its kind, a group of labs in Manhattan and Brooklyn that was turning out 100,000 high-quality bootleg videotapes a week on 800 machines, was shut down.
The movie studios, said Daniel J. Castleman, chief of the investigation division of the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, "would like the police department to do nothing but pick up people for bootleg films."
"But there are murders and rapes," he said. "We're aware of the economic impact of bootlegging. We have a terrific relationship with the M.P.A.A. But they want us to solve their problem."
Alassane Diop is the manager of the Harlem Market, which is on an empty lot owned by the Malcolm Shabazz mosque, named for the slain leader of the Nation of Islam. He said the vendors who rent space there sell "African masks, art, costume jewelry, dolls, eyeglasses, hats, beads, designer jeans, handmade sweaters, cassette tapes."
"They have some videotapes," he added.
But on visits in March, April and May, the main business of the Harlem Market seemed to be videotapes. Booths, which vendors, many of them recent immigrants from West Africa, rent for $42 a week, are stocked with the latest films, from "Hercules," and "Men in Black," to "Face/Off," "The Lost World" and "Batman and Robin." Several of the booths even had video players so that customers could check the quality of the tapes before buying.
The site has become so popular that it is now a tourist attraction. Buses from New York Apple Tours pull up to the Harlem Market and discharge passengers to shop. "We stop at Canal Street, Delancey Street -- and I'm sure bootleg items are sold at those locations," said Hayim Grant, the president of New York Apple Tours. "It's not our concern what the vendors sell."
Even the businessmen who seem most threatened by the piracy occasionally buy bootleg copies. Ed Arentz, who manages Cinemavillage, an art house theater in Manhattan, found Jim Jarmusch's "Dead Man" at Harlem Market. "The price was right," he said, "and I hadn't seen the film."
Allen McCollum, the manager of the Blockbuster video store that opened last year on 125th Street, said: "It doesn't affect us much. A lot of people don't like bootlegs. People say it's a waste of money, too foggy."
Even a policeman, approached at the 116th Street subway station across from the market, shown a bag full of bootleg tapes and asked if they were legal, said, with a shrug, "If you bought them, they must be legal."
Mr. Arentz said lax enforcement of domestic bootlegging would hurt the industry abroad, where piracy has been an even bigger problem. "To give up the ghost here would mean that the Chinese and the Egyptians would say, 'Why pick on us? You can't even enforce your own laws,' " he said.
"We go after vendors, the labs; we're trying to hit at every level," Mr. Shannon of the motion picture group's New York office said. But arresting vendors and charging them with the misdemeanor offense of selling pirated tapes will not halt the practice, the organization argues.
Peter English of the same office said of arrested vendors, "Basically, they'll be let out the next day." And, he added, buying or owning a bootleg film is not a crime in New York. "It has to be for commercial advantage or private financial gain," he said.
A year ago, the group announced the largest raid in its history, at Amarson Video, on West 26th Street in Manhattan, and at three labs in Brooklyn. The operators of the business were arrested and charged with criminal possession of a forged instrument and other felonies involving the sale and manufacture of unauthorized recordings.
But a year later, Barbara Thompson, a public information officer for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, said the accused counterfeiters, out on bail, had fled the country.
Threat though it may be to the industry, bootlegging is still a joke to many. This past season, an episode of NBC's hit comedy "Seinfeld" featured a subplot in which the show's characters dabbled in bootlegging. "Seinfeld made light of it," Mr. English said. "But to the M.P.A.A., it's something that's putting people out of business."
 
BOOTLEG VIDEO REVIEW
The Good, the Bad and the Soundless
The quality of 30 tapes bought this spring in New York ranged from execrable to excellent, from those with neither audio nor color to those that had a clear picture and almost cinema-quality sound. Half of the tapes were obviously shot with camcorders in theaters, and often had a hollow sound and audible audience reactions. Three of the pirated casettes were copied from advance tapes, of the kind sent to video-store owners. The rest were excellent copies that appeared to be based on 35-millimeter films.
 None of the camcorded tapes showed a shaky hand, though some revealed an intermittent focus problem. Camcorded tapes never showed the extreme left or right side of the movie screen and always contained the top or bottom edge of the screen, sometimes, in the latter case, including other viewers' heads. Most had crowd noises. All of the tapes were bought for $5 and all except one were of movies still playing in theaters. Here are one viewer's reactions:
 
"Jerry Maguire" (Columbia-Tristar)
Released in December, bought in April, a month before release of the video version.
A very good copy of the video version. The words "Property of CTHV. Duplication, sale or rental of this video is strictly prohibited" are displayed every 20 minutes. The tape ends abruptly 15 minutes before the end of the film.
 
"Liar Liar" (Universal)
Released on March 20, bought on March 21.
Clearly camcorded, from a seat in front on the left. The angle makes Jim Carrey seem like a pinhead in long shots. Audible laughter and comments give the viewer the feeling of watching "Mystery Science Theater 2000" with a laugh track.
 
"Men in Black" (Columbia-Tristar)
Bought on May 24, opened in theaters on July 2.
An M, for master print, appears in the upper-right corner throughout the film. The sound quality varies. Some special effects are missing: A talking dog doesn't move his mouth; a movie star being eaten by a giant bug briefly appears in white wire-frame. Lacks any audio track for the last 20 minutes.
 
"The Lost World" (Universal)
Released on May 23, bought on May 24. (Tape is labeled Jurassic Park.)
No visible or audible theater audience. Good sound, possibly from an audio jack in the movie theater's seat meant for the hearing impaired, but the tape looks extremely blurry, like a fifth generation copy. Dark scenes are difficult to see.
 
"Crash" (Fine Line)
Bought shortly after it was released in March.
There are no obvious signs that this NC-17 rated auteur film was shot in a movie theater. It has bad distortion at the top of the screen, making Holly Hunter and James Spader look like coneheads. Persistent hum makes the dialogue difficult to hear. LINDA LEE

Computer Makers vs. the Television Industry
The recent challenge Microsoft, Intel and Compaq issued to the television industry seems to be fading. The computer makers said they would set the standards for the new digital era. But even others in the personal computer business have failed to lend support, and the three-company front appears to be crumbling. [Page D2.]
 
Growth on Long Island
In the 1990's, Long Island is undergoing a nontraditional economic recovery. As military contracting has all but disappeared, the area has engineered a revival heavily reliant on smaller companies, computer technology, retailing and business services. [A1.] 

Here Comes Cellularvision
Shant Hovnanian has been a tireless advocate for a wireless technology he says can be used to beam phone conersations, Internet access and television pictures to small dishes mounted on windowsills. A dispute with other companies has limited Cellularvision's access. But recent breakthroughs may spread the technology throughout New York City. [D3.]
 
Farm Workers Win Right to Unionize
Employees at the DeCoster Egg Farm, the Maine farm that is the nation's largest producer of brown eggs, recently won Gov. Angus King's approval of legislation allowing them to unionize and requiring the farm to pay overtime. The measures are only the latest setback for DeCoster, which has also been under fire from state and Federal officials for unsanitary and unsafe working and living conditions. [A12.]
 
News Bureau Blues
Knight-Ridder is taking the control of its foreign bureaus away from its four big papers and placing the reporters under the direction of a single foreign desk in Washington. The shift has irritated some editors. [D7.]
 
Internet Address Inquiry
The Justice Department is investigating the current practice of assigning Internet addresses, to determine if the control exercised by Network Solutions Inc. amounts to a violation of antitrust laws. [D5.]
 
Of Britain and Libel
Britain's libel laws are considered some of the toughest in the world. They come from a deep-seated tradition that often seems archaic to outsiders. Defendants are required to prove the truth of their statements, an extremely hard standard to meet. Recently, Alan Rusbridger, editor of The Guardian, presided over his paper's defense of a lawsuit brought by the former Minister for Defense Procurement. The paper prevailed, just barely. Publishing.

Newsletters and the Web
Many newsletter publishers are embracing the Internet. The Newsletter Publishers Association estimates that 40 percent of all newsletter companies have Web sites. The different approaches newsletters take may suggest what works in new media. [D7.]

HEADLINE: Can Russia Be a NATO Insider and Outsider?;
Defense Opportunists

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "U.S. Arms Makers Lobby for NATO Expansion" (news article, June 30): Defense manufacturers and their allies in the Pentagon are scurrying to cash in on NATO expansion by dangling expensive weapons systems in front of Central European nations. Meanwhile, the Departments of State and Treasury are expressing concern about the economic consequences of increases in the military budgets of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. 
 Why this disparity between responsible fiscal concern by State and Treasury and an opportunistic hawking of wares by the Defense Department and its industry pals? Such a disconnect arises every time there is an important arms trade policy decision to be made.
NATO is not an American jobs program. Defense industry lobbying -- by company executives or Pentagon officials -- has no place in the debate.

HEADLINE: Fort Lee Mayor Girds for a Showdown Over Bridge Traffic

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: FORT LEE, N.J., July 3

 BODY:
For years, this little town of high rises and heavy traffic has been a most unhappy host to the George Washington Bridge.
City Hall has long grumbled that the bridge brings bumper-to-bumper traffic most mornings and ill-tempered drivers zipping around side streets, particularly on holiday weekends like this one. The traffic forces the community to hire additional police officers, and guarantees potholes, motor vehicle violations and high taxes, all without a cent of reimbursement from the bridge's owner, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. 
 After quietly enduring the indignities, Fort Lee has decided to fight back. That means, roughly, that the gnat -- a 2.5-square-mile town of 32,000 people -- is publicly bullying the elephant -- a sprawling bistate agency with $2.1 billion in gross revenues.
"The bridge is a nuisance," Mayor Jack Alter said. "They're collecting the gross receipts and someone else is paying the expenses, and that's our suffering taxpayers. We'd like to get reimbursed for our costs for the bridge's presence. We're tired of their inertia and stonewalling."
The Mayor said the City Council had set aside $10,000 for summer billboards encouraging travelers to cross the Hudson River on the Tappan Zee Bridge in Tarrytown, N.Y., about 20 miles up the Hudson River. And he said, Fort Lee might file a lawsuit over congestion and air pollution generated by the 97 million vehicles that used the bridge, and streets and highways in Fort Lee, last year.
The Mayor also noted that the local police have standing orders to set up roadblocks at Fort Lee's borders when traffic back-ups on the bridge create absolute gridlock on local streets and hinder Fort Lee's firetrucks, ambulances and other emergency vehicles.
This tactic is a holdover from Fort Lee's last public plea for reimbursement, in 1994. Since then, the roadblocks have gone up twice, each time for only a few minutes. But that was just long enough to leave thousands of motorists fuming on the clogged streets of the neighboring towns of Leonia, Edgewater and Englewood Cliffs.
After Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, Mayor Alter is the Port Authority's noisiest public critic. But for all the saber-rattling, he said he was ready to negotiate with Port Authority officials. "I called them the other day and asked if a discussion would be useful," he said. "I'm waiting for an answer."
The Port Authority suggested that it would be willing to discuss a specific proposal, but none has been mentioned by Fort Lee officials. "There's nothing on the table they've proposed to us," Allen Morrison, an agency spokesman, said. "They have not come up with an appropriate project for us to contribute to."
Mr. Morrison said the Port Authority is developing a $25 million electronic system to manage bridge traffic, with road sensors that detect tie-ups and big message signs that suggest alternate routes. And, he pointed out, Fort Lee rejected a Port Authority offer in 1993 to build the town a $7 million police station near the bridge and finance it with 30-year bonds.
Mayor Alter, a Democrat, negotiated that deal. But he said local Republicans, now out of power, scuttled it. "It fell apart in a political pile of mush," he said.
He noted that the George Washington Bridge was the Port Authority's most lucrative facility last year, with $134 million in income, more than Newark, Kennedy and La Guardia airports, which the agency runs.
A 1990 study commissioned by the town found that the bridge's presence forced Fort Lee to spend about $5 million a year for extra police to deal with traffic, crashes, and arrests and summonses for motor vehicle violations, the Mayor said.
Fort Lee's chief financial officer, Joseph Iannaconi, estimated that the town could cut its 92-member police force and its $10.5 million police budget by one-third to one-half if the bridge were somewhere else. Bridge-related road maintenance, like repairing potholes on the town's streets caused by the high volume of traffic, costs $100,000 more a year, he said.
But the Port Authority said there was no spare money from the bridge's 1996 net income of $134 million. That money helped cover deficits in other parts of its bistate transportation network, including the $192.8 million the PATH train system lost last year and the $60.2 million deficit of the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan, according to the agency's annual report. Mayor Alter also spoke of a $10 million property tax bill Fort Lee sends the Port Authority each year for the bridge. "They ignore it," he said.
Disingenuous, the Port Authority countered. As a bistate agency, its mission, agency officials noted, is to serve the public good by improving regional transportation and the regional economy. And like all government agencies, its property and operations are tax exempt. "Governments don't pay taxes to other governments," Mr. Morrison said.
Mayor Alter also contends that the agency gives money in lieu of taxes to other communities that house its operations. Bayonne, for instance, gets $104,000 a year for an auto import-export terminal the agency owns, and Jersey City receives $645,000 a year for a shipping terminal the agency owns in old rail yards. But in Fort Lee, "We get nothing -- zero," Mayor Alter said.
Mr. Morrison said Fort Lee was not eligible for such payments because the bridge's toll booths, its entrance and exit plazas, and the bridge itself were part of highways that were tax exempt.
Most important, he said, the bridge has made Fort Lee, which has one of the area's strongest local economies, a boom town.
Town officials conceded that. But, they added, there is a down side. All the new high-rise apartments in the last quarter century have brought in more children and forced the town to raise school taxes.

HEADLINE: Save Tax Cut for When Cupboard Is Bare

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Representative Tom Campbell's excellent article on the folly of ignoring the deficit to pay for a tax cut (Op-Ed, July 1) missed a crucial argument against cutting taxes now: timing. 
 At the top of the business cycle, with low unemployment and economists worried about inflation, now is not the time for a supply-side view that would pour $85 billion into the money supply over five years. Now is the time to finish off our budget deficit and save money for tax cuts when we need them, in future recessions.
Some argue that structural changes in the global economy have brought the end of the business cycle, but their evidence is far from conclusive. Until it is, our Government would be foolish to spread money around in a time of economic growth, bringing the inflation that could lead to an economic slowdown.
Mr. Campbell says a balanced budget in two years would be possible if not for the tax cuts, and would have been "an immense psychological and political achievement." It also would have been a case of politicians investing in the future beyond the next election cycle, a phenomenon almost unheard of in the permanent campaign atmosphere of today's Washington.

HEADLINE: Integrated Wireless Service May Be Coming Soon to a Windowsill Near You

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
Shant S. Hovnanian is nothing if not patient. For more than a decade, Mr. Hovnanian has been the lonely advocate for a wireless technology that he says can be used to beam television pictures, phone conversations and Internet access to small dishes mounted on windowsills.
Mr. Hovnanian's company, Cellularvision, has persuaded 14,000 customers in Brooklyn and Queens to install its squat, boxy receivers, which enable them to receive 49 channels of television. But the company has been unable to spread its wings farther because of a dispute with other companies that laid claim to its slice of the airwaves. 
 Now, after five years of relentless lobbying in Washington, Mr. Hovnanian has at last prevailed. And he is determined to create the nation's first integrated wireless provider of voice, video and data services. If you live in the five boroughs of New York City, Cellularvision is coming to a microwave tower near you.
"One goal is to turn wireless into a broadband pipe capable of delivering all kinds of services," said Mr. Hovnanian, a burly, genial 38-year-old, whose family built houses in New Jersey and got into telecommunications by stringing cable systems to those homes.
His technology goes by a forbidding name: local multipoint distribution, or LMDS. Basically, it works like cellular telephone service, in which a signal is transmitted from a central tower to a small antenna. But unlike cellular, it is beamed to many receivers. It is also remarkably pliant: the signal can bounce off buildings and still be received with clarity, which makes it well suited to the canyons of Manhattan.
Cellularvision began its first big assault on Manhattan last month, when it introduced unlimited high-speed Internet access at a price of $49.95 a month, plus a one-time installation fee of $199.
Mr. Hovnanian recently recruited Bruce Judson, former general manager of Time Inc.'s new media division, to market Cellularvision's service to people who are used to navigating the Internet via phone lines.
The wireless technology would allow subscribers to download material from the Internet at speeds of 500 kilobits a second -- roughly four times as fast as the service offered by phone companies like Nynex. The company's installation fee covers the cost of the receiver dish, a modem and a set-top converter box.
Time Warner, the dominant cable provider in New York City, has introduced a high-speed Internet service, called Roadrunner, in Elmira, N.Y. and several other cities. But a spokesman said the company would not bring Roadrunner to New York before next year.
"We believe there is a huge demand for Internet access," Mr. Judson said. "By early next year, we'll introduce an even faster service."
Cellularvision will focus its Internet marketing on Manhattan, where it sees an affluent population starved for high-speed access. In Brooklyn and Queens, the company is pushing its package of television channels, including Home Box Office and the Cable News Network, as a low-cost alternative to cable television.
Such segmentation is easy to do because, unlike phone or cable companies, Cellularvision does not need to upgrade its entire physical plant -- wires or switches -- to offer two-way data services.
Mr. Hovnanian eventually hopes to provide telephone service on his network as well. Last month, the company signed an agreement with Nynex, under which Cellularvision will lease lines from Nynex and resell the service under its brand name. When it signs up enough customers, Cellularvision plans to shift them over to its wireless network.
"This market is ours to lose because we feel we have an inherent economic advantage in our delivery system," said Patrick J. Greaney, a former senior vice president of Philips Electronics North America, who joined Cellularvision last week as its chief operating officer.
Mr. Greaney is a true believer. At Philips, he oversaw a $5 million investment in Cellularvision. The company has also attracted small investments from Bell Atlantic and J. P. Morgan. In February 1996, Cellularvision made an initial public offering of its stock, raising $39.8 million.
Still, it has not yet won over Wall Street. The stock has slumped with the rest of the wireless industry because of fears of ruinous competition. On Thursday, it closed at $8.25, up 12.5 cents on Nasdaq -- well below its high of $16.75 in July 1996.
And Cellularvision needs to raise capital because it is investing $25 million to build its network of transmitters.
While specialists said that local multipoint technology does work, it is prone to the weaknesses that afflict other types of wireless service. For one, the signal can fade in heavy rain if the network is not properly designed. And while it does not have the crippling line-of-sight limitations of technologies like wireless cable, it may not work too well in hilly areas.
Some of Mr. Hovnanian's competitors say that his wireless technology will ultimately hobble Cellularvision.
"What do they have?" said David C. McCourt, chief executive of the RCN Corporation. "They have an inferior video product, no phone product and no way of migrating their traffic to a fiber network." RCN, a unit of the cable operator C-Tec, is building a fiber optic network to provide alternative cable and local phone service in Manhattan.
But other experts said it was not fair to lump Cellularvision with other, garden-variety wireless companies. The company's technology was invented by Bernard B. Bossard, who helped develop the guidance system for the Patriot missile. Mr. Bossard is still chief technical officer and a major shareholder.
Moreover, Cellularvision has an indisputable advantage over other wireless competitors. Because it pioneered local multipoint technology under a special Federal program, it did not have to pay for its license, which covers 8.3 million people in New York City, Westchester, Rockland and Putnam counties.
Mr. Hovnanian thinks he will be vindicated this fall, when the Federal Communications Commission auctions licenses nationwide. Phone and cable companies are expected to bid millions of dollars for licenses in markets far smaller than New York.
Given all these virtues, he cannot understand why investors are not lining up outside his door. He noted somewhat ruefully that Microsoft recently invested $1 billion in Comcast, a cable company run by Brian L. Roberts, a fraternity brother of his at the University of Pennsylvania in the late 1970's.
"I'm glad that Bill Gates found my fraternity brother," Mr. Hovnanian said, "but I think there's someone else in my fraternity he ought to be talking to."

HEADLINE: Knight-Ridder Revises Its Foreign Reporting

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

 BODY:
Like other big news organizations, the Knight-Ridder newspaper chain spends millions of dollars to maintain reporters and news bureaus overseas. Yet much of this expensive coverage never makes its way into most of its papers.
Knight-Ridder's solution: It is taking the control of its foreign bureaus away from its four big newspapers and placing their reporters under the direction of a single foreign desk in Washington. 
 The move has upset senior editors at the papers that will lose bureaus they had operated as their own, but management said the move was needed both to coordinate overseas coverage and to try to resolve a problem facing many big newspapers: how to make overseas reporting meaningful to American readers.
Still, some editors believe this shift in control of the bureaus will mean that Knight-Ridder foreign correspondents will spend more time covering breaking news with short, quick articles and less time developing more in-depth articles about trends overseas. Reporters are also likely to feel that they have less say about how their articles are edited than when they reported to a particular newspaper.
Clark Hoyt, a vice president for news at Knight-Ridder's Miami headquarters, said that the move was not aimed at cutting the $2 million a year the company spends to support eight overseas bureaus and that there were no plans to close any of them. Foreign bureaus operated independently by Knight-Ridder papers would also not be affected, Mr. Hoyt said, although the bureaus would be expected to coordinate coverage more closely with the chain.
"When the bureaus were set up around 1980, there was a lot of discussion about whether they should be centralized or distributed among the newspapers," Mr. Hoyt said. "The final decision was that they would be operated by what were then our four largest papers, but that they would operate as a trust for all the papers and be responsive to the needs of all Knight-Ridder papers."
Knight-Ridder then opened eight overseas bureaus and awarded two each to The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Detroit Free Press, The Miami Herald and The San Jose Mercury News in California. But the bureaus -- in Moscow, Rio de Janeiro, Jerusalem, Beijing, Tokyo, Mexico City, Warsaw and Harare, Zimbabwe -- soon became largely associated with their parent newspapers. In addition to its Knight-Ridder bureaus, The Inquirer also has its own reporters in London, Rome, South Africa and the Middle East.
"When I was in Detroit we ran the coverage and we promoted people to our bureaus, and we were satisfied with that, but I would say the other Knight-Ridder papers were not satisfied," said David Lawrence, who had been the editor of The Free Press, and who is now publisher of The Miami Herald.
As Mr. Hoyt pointed out in a June 13 memo outlining the change, while The Miami Herald used all 65 articles filed by its Jerusalem correspondent, John Donnelly, in the first four months of this year, no other Knight-Ridder paper used more than 4, and most used none.
"I think it ought to work to our benefit," said Glenn Guzzo, managing editor of The Akron Beacon Journal, which has no foreign bureaus, but is one of the founding papers of the Knight-Ridder chain. "We are not prepared to run the foreign stories that are generated by Knight-Ridder correspondents at the length they are now being written, and we have difficulty finding out, in fact, what is being written and when it is coming."
Case in point: Last week, when Hong Kong reverted to Chinese rule, The Beacon Journal covered the event with articles only from the news services of The Washington Post and The New York Times. The only Knight-Ridder coverage of one of the biggest stories of the year in The Beacon Journal was a Sunday piece, filed well enough ahead to let Mr. Guzzo know it was available. "If you don't tell us what's coming, how can we use it?" he asked.
Maxwell E. P. King, editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer, said, "I have my differences about the direction that this is going, but I do not argue with the assessment that this is a problem." Mr. King said he tried to persuade Mr. Hoyt to allow the host newspapers to retain control of the bureaus and to focus on improving coordination. But as Mr. Hoyt pointed out in an interview, that had been the original intent, and it had not worked. The Inquirer operates Knight-Ridder bureaus in Beijing and Moscow, as well as having reporters in four other areas overseas.
In his memo, Mr. Hoyt also spoke of changing the nature of foreign coverage, a move that is likely to raise concerns among Knight-Ridder's foreign reporters. A questionnaire being prepared for the senior management at all Knight-Ridder papers will include questions about whether bureaus should focus on news or on longer, in-depth pieces; should concentrate on certain subjects, like world trade and economics, or be general, and on how foreign pieces should be made more "local" for American readers.
"Our coverage has been very enterprise-driven as opposed to breaking-news driven," Mr. King said. "I think from the note that they will want to do more news-driven and shorter pieces, and it's a particular source of my worry, that the jobs will still be satisfying and sustaining for career journalists if that happens."

After The Handover

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: HONG KONG

 BODY:
For many Americans, the handover of Hong Kong is just the latest installment in the long-running China-U.S. morality play -- "The Butchers of Beijing vs. the People." But Hong Kongers look at events here with much more mixed emotion. For them, it's not Communism versus democracy, but nationalism versus the rule of law. That is, there is real ethnic pride here in the return of Chinese sovereignty, after 156 years of British colonialism. But there is also real fear that what Hong Kongers appreciated most about Britain's colonialism -- the rule of law -- will vanish along with it. As one Hong Kong businessman remarked to me on handover day: "I feel torn -- like I just watched my mother-in-law drive out of town in my new Mercedes. I'm glad she's gone, but what about my car?"
Well, what about that car? Since the reversion, there have been some intriguing straws in the wind here. The first is how relaxed this place is. The democracy activists wasted no time defying a police ban on unlicensed demonstrations and the police responded that they were not going to waste taxpayer money prosecuting them. End of story. My favorite democracy demonstrators were those selling miniature plaster replicas of the "Goddess of Democracy" the students of Tiananmen Square had erected. They went for $100 a copy, and they were "Made in China." Where else? 
 The Chinese Army troops that the U.S. networks focused on so relentlessly planted China's sovereignty here and then disappeared into their barracks. China's Communist Party is still banned in Hong Kong, and Beijing is hesitating to make it legal, because if it becomes a legal party in Hong Kong it will have to run in Hong Kong's next legislative elections, and if it runs it will get creamed by the democratic parties. Tung Chee-hwa, China's hand-picked chief here, last week promised that elections for a new legislature would be held by mid-1998. The hottest-selling T-shirt at Hong Kong's Shanghai Tang department store is emblazoned: "Most Flavoured Nation."
What might this be telling us? The relationship between China and Britain over Hong Kong was like a bad marriage: everything one did the other disparaged. Any democratization by Britain, China treated as a stick in the eye. Any assertion of sovereignty by China, Britain treated as potentially the next Tiananmen. But now that China has Hong Kong back, China, and Mr. Tung, can afford to be more relaxed, because leniency no longer constitutes kowtowing to Britain. Rather, it's something they do in the interest of stability in Hong Kong, which is now also their interest.
The second straw in the wind is the speech China's President, Jiang Zemin, gave on handover day. Christine Loh, one of the leading pro-democracy activists in the recently disbanded Hong Kong legislature, insisted on reading aloud to me passages from that speech when I visited her last week: "Hong Kong residents will enjoy their rights and freedoms in accordance with law and will all be equal before the law. . . . A gradually improved democratic system suited to Hong Kong's reality is an important guarantee for its social and political stability. Hong Kong will develop democracy gradually with the ultimate aim of electing the chief executive and the Legislative Council by universal suffrage. Hong Kong's success is attributable to . . . its well-developed legal system and highly efficient civil service."
What's new is that the Chinese President wasn't speaking about some British colony. He was speaking about the importance of rights, legality and democracy for what is now part of China. How long before elites in Shanghai or Tianjin come to Mr. Jiang and say that they can't compete economically with Hong Kong unless they have what he has vowed to preserve in Hong Kong -- civil society, rule of law and a market economy free of corruption?
The point is that -- post-handover -- there are still real politics in Hong Kong. And it will add to the real politics already going on inside China. How much and for how long remains to be seen. But if you only look at China through the simplistic lens of "Butchers of Beijing," you'll miss those politics and their possibilities. The people who understand that best are the democrats here. Until China proves otherwise, argued Ms. Loh, "The best thing America can do is not to look at Hong Kong as a problem, but as an opportunity -- something that might actually add value to the U.S.-China relationship."

Gates's largesse stirs a discomfiting question: Is there indeed a computer literacy?

BYLINE: By Edward Rothstein 

 BODY:
WHO could possibly object to $400 million of free computer equipment and software? Last month, when William H. Gates and his wife, Melinda French Gates, announced that gift to financially troubled North American libraries, it was hailed as a major act of philanthropic wisdom, a worthy successor to the donations by Andrew Carnegie that built 1,679 libraries in 1,412 cities and towns, helping to establish the nation's public library system.
Just think of all those hard drives, loaded with Microsoft software, ready to download files from the Internet, available in even the poorest communities. (The donation, by the Gates Library Foundation, is described at the organization's site, http://www.glf.org/pr.html). Isn't this the sort of idea President Clinton had in mind when he posed a "technology literacy challenge" in 1996? 
 "We know, purely and simply," the President then declared, "that every single child must have access to a computer, must understand it, must have access to good software and good teachers and to the Internet, so that every person will have the opportunity to make the most of his or her own life"
It is also a goal the National Education Association has supported. A 1996 report (summarized at http:// www.nea.org/cet/BRIEFS/brief9.html) argued that one educational necessity "transcends institutions, resources and goals." That transcendent need is for "the use and implementation of technology" in the classroom and library. A poll of teachers last year ranked computer skills and media technology as more important than the study of biology, chemistry, physics, classical literature or European history.
The drums have been beating at the local level, as well. There are schools in which the study of music or art has been sacrificed for cyberspace exploration. Few parents seem to think that a school is doing its job unless computers are widely available. At a New York City school recently, a computer company's representative held a computer literacy night for parents, describing the Internet as a library containing everything that has been thought or known in the world, a kind of universal repository of knowledge.
What child should be denied access to something like that? And if it costs at least $10 billion a year for at least five years to guarantee such access, the lowest of the national estimates, shouldn't it still be a top priority?
But it has become increasingly clear that there is something a bit peculiar about these ambitions. Reacting to the President's original declaration, Edward Miller, editor of the Harvard Education Letter, said, "Of all the things one could wish for American education, I would place this very far down the list." Even as ardent an advocate of computer skills as Sherry Turkle, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology social scientist, has asked, "Are we using computer technology not because it teaches best but because we have lost the political will to fund education adequately?" (http://epn.org/prospect/31/31turkf.html).
In a series of articles, The San Jose Mercury News said that despite surveys that have reported vast improvement in student performance from the use of technology, their own analysis "showed no strong link between the presence of technology -- or the use of technology in teaching -- and superior achievement." Only in low-income areas did technology make a noticeable difference, partly perhaps because its presence may have been accompanied by an attentiveness to students that was lacking before. (The debate about computer literacy is summarized at http:// www.sjmercury.com/news/local/ schools/main115.htm). This month, the Atlantic Monthly has also published a cover story, "The Computer Delusion" by Todd Oppenheimer, associate editor of Newsweek Interactive. It recapitulates much of the controversy (and can be found at http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97jul/computer.htm), but is unabashed in its conclusion, "Cutting other school subjects to make room for computers may be educational malpractice."
That is beginning to seem like an understatement. What, after all, does computer literacy consist of? Unlike ordinary literacy, it is not even required to obtain other forms of knowledge. One can be mathematically literate, literarily literate, musically literate and historically literate without knowing a single command in a computer language.
Of course, real computer literacy requires training in logic, in clear thinking, in the values of planning, in economy and efficiency, in the abilities to manage information and correct errors. But right now, the term computer-literate usually just refers to the ability to use a few commercial products and perhaps being able to smoothly touch-type.
Are there any curricula that require eighth-graders to know the programming language C++ and analyze the structure of a processing chip -- a computer literacy that might actually involve something substantial? Joseph Weizenbaum, professor emeritus of computer science at M.I.T., has pointed out that computer languages are unlike natural languages; there is no advantage to acquiring them when young. And, one might add, they are far less useful when older.
As for universal access to the Internet, it would be quite helpful for some student research -- but it, too, is hardly the kind of prerequisite for success that the President outlined. The Internet will not come close to replacing even the most ordinary library until every book of importance is published in digital form, financial arrangements are worked out with publishers, and search engines become as powerful as the index in back of a reference book. Right now, even the most limited local library has much the Internet cannot touch.
Only a Luddite could dismiss the potential value of computers. But imagine if instead of donating millions of dollars to purchase soon-to-be-obsolete equipment -- with its built-in hunger for profitable upgrades to the donated software -- technological philanthropy involved real training in mathematics and science for students or teachers. And imagine that computer education was seen as supplementary, rather than as a cure-all for widespread problems. It seems almost an impossibly utopian dream -- one worthy of a major philanthropist.

DATA SMOG
Surviving the Information Glut
By David Shenk
250 pages. Harper Edge/HarperCollins. $24.
 Sometime around the middle of this century, David Shenk tells us in his new book, something happened to alter human history: "We began to produce information much faster than we could process it." 
 With the introduction of computers, microwave transmissions, television and satellites, we were pushed from "a state of information scarcity to one of information surplus, from drought to flood in the geological blink of an eye." Today we are drowning in data, pelted by newspaper and magazine stories, 24-hour television news, E-mail, junk mail and faxes. Cellular phones, car phones and beepers insure that we are always on call, while ubiquitous television sets -- in bars, sports arenas, airports and airplanes -- insure that we never lack visual distraction. Advertisements have proliferated along highways, in schoolrooms and on the World Wide Web, and they adorn everything from our hats to our luggage to our shoes.
In "Data Smog," Mr. Shenk, a journalist and radio commentator, tells us that the average American spends 60 percent of the office day processing documents. In the 1980's, per capita paper consumption tripled (to 1,800 pounds a year), and third-class mail grew 13 times faster than the population.
Such statistics aren't new, but Mr. Shenk has done a good job of pulling together a lot of observations about the downside of information technology and presenting them in a coherent and highly readable fashion. Though one may not agree with all of Mr. Shenk's theories, his book nonetheless forces one to re-evaluate the effects that data smog has on daily life and its long-term social and political consequences.
As Mr. Shenk sees it, data smog is bad for your health, promoting stress, memory overload, compulsive behavior and attention-deficit disorder. It's also bad, he suggests, for the health of the community, producing what could be called the Dennis Rodman or Madonna effect. By overstimulating us to the point of distraction, he argues, data smog forces people to resort to hyperbole and histrionics to get attention. "The degree to which today's television programmers, movie producers, performers, spokespersons and publishers apparently feel compelled to turn up the heat is a serious threat to moderation and intelligence in society," he writes. "It reduces our attention span. It makes us numb to anything that doesn't lurch out and grab us by the throat."
Although much has been written about mass communications' turning the world into a global village, Mr. Shenk astutely points out that that village is, at the same time, growing increasingly fragmented and factionalized as people, despairing of being able to master a grand overview, retreat into their own special interests. These days there are more and more niche magazines and more and more niche advertising targeted at specific audiences and neighborhoods. As a result, community begins to give way to tribes, shared values to irreconcilable differences.
The Internet accelerates this trend. "Like niche radio and cable TV," Mr. Shenk writes, "the Net encourages a cultural splintering that can render physical communities much less relevant and free people from having to climb outside their own biases, assumptions, inherited ways of thought. This is perhaps best evidenced by the ominous emergence of so-called smart agents, which automatically filter out information deemed irrelevant to the customer."
With smart agents, there is no stumbling across unexpected subject matter, and there are fewer exchanges with people with different interests and opinions. As a result, both the idea and practice of pluralism suffer.
Throughout this book, Mr. Shenk admonishes readers to refrain from "info-pollution" by being economical in what they "say, write, publish, broadcast and post on line." This is advice that Mr. Shenk tries to follow himself, with largely admirable results. Toward the end of the book, however, when he turns from sociological assessment to more subjective political analysis, his penchant for concision can lead to oversimplification.
He argues, for instance, that cyberspace promotes "a highly decentralized, deregulated society with little common discourse and minimal public infrastructure," and then goes on to make the gross generalization that "the digerati are helping conservative Republicans create the world they have been after for a long time." In another chapter, he asserts that "the emergence of niche culture has also turned the tables on political alienation," suggesting that "poor minority groups" have ceased to be "invisible to the world and to each other" because they now have the ability to put out "their own 'zines, listservs, Web sites and cable TV shows."
Such reductive assertions unfortunately distract the reader from the other, more substantial arguments in this book, which despite its lapses stands as a useful overview of the unintended consequences of information technology.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls vs. Yen on Surge In the Japanese Trade Surplus

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday to a nearly four-week low against the yen after Japan reported a surge in its June trade surplus, reviving concern that the dollar's strength is hurting American exporters.
But the dollar recovered from an early selloff against the mark and ended higher against the pound, helped by British data showing unexpected manufacturing weakness. 
 The data at least temporarily dampened market expectations that the Bank of England would raise interest rates at its policy-making meeting Thursday. Expectations of higher rates have been been driving sterling higher in recent weeks.
Traders said the foreign-exchange volume was thin because of summer vacations, exaggerating currency movements. But the rise in Japan's surplus surprised the market.
The data showed Japan's surplus rose to 453.20 billion yen in the first 20 days of June, far more than expected and more than double the 197.65-billion-yen surplus a year earlier.
The dollar traded as low as 112.16 yen in intraday dealings before settling in New York at 112.77 yen, down from 113.89 Thursday and the lowest closing level since June 11. United States financial markets were closed Friday.
The dollar also fell to an intraday low of 1.7421 marks before recovering to settle at 1.7521 marks in New York, down from 1.7535 marks on Thursday. The pound cost $1.6886, down from $1.6906.
The early weakness of the dollar against the mark partly reflected its decline compared with the yen, as well as mark strength on fears of a delay in Europe's single currency plan past its January 1999 starting date. Most participants in the plan for the single currency, known as the euro, are having trouble meeting its strict fiscal criteria.
The fears were based on a Financial Times interview with Edmund Stoiber, Governor of Bavaria and a political ally of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who called for a delay in the introduction of the euro rather than proceeding with a weak currency.
But the impact of the Stoiber remarks diminished as the day progressed, partly because the predominant view in the market is that the single currency plan will proceed as scheduled.

After The Magic Dies

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER; A. M. Rosenthal is on vacation.

 BODY:
In the old days husbands and wives murdered each other. Now they hire hit men to do it for them. This is surely the final disgrace of a society corrupted by its own riches.
Before the big money rolled in few couples could afford to hire somebody to clean house, much less a hit man. 
 We are talking of an age before anybody ever heard of mutual funds. Back then, husbands killed their own wives and wives killed their own husbands. They did it extensively, too.
Two years of news reporting on the police beat filled me with wonder at the connubial murder rate. The first warm corpse I ever saw was the late husband of a young wife with a gun.
The best trial I ever covered dealt with a husband who had planned to subject his wife to the perfect murder. He succeeded in killing her, but not in getting away with it, and was subsequently hanged.
Most marital murders were routine. Prime time for them was Saturday night. Usually one or both parties to the marriage had taken too much whisky, gin, beer or Sneaky Pete.
Argument ensued. The family gun appeared. The job was almost always done with bullets. I recall no case in which she used the carving knife or he his old trophy Japanese bayonet brought back from the Pacific.
I suppose there was an occasional murder produced by rat-poison overdose, but I never covered one. If you occupied the murkier levels of society and dropped dead suddenly, the medical examiner did not invariably favor you with an autopsy, so a poisoning spouse might just possibly get away with it.
Three recent hit-man events in the Baltimore-Washington area illustrate the new style. A Maryland woman, a minor political figure, has just been charged with trying to hire a hit man to dispose of her husband.
Outside Baltimore the cops have booked one Mark Cordero, alleging that he offered $10,000 for his wife's murder. Cordero is said to have made the offer to an undercover policeman after the usual anonymous tipster disclosed that he was up to no good.
Another undercover cop figures in the case of a man in Capitol Heights, Md., charged with trying to hire a hit man to dispose of his wife. Again, Anonymous Tipster talked to the cops, who had one of their own pose as a hit man for hire. The police say the price offered in this case was $1,500.
Several questions arise. How often does a spouse in search of a hit man make a deal with the real article instead of an undercover cop? If hit men are available, how do they set the price for their work?
And finally, are there really that many hit men out there willing to work for disgruntled husbands and wives? Murderers have traditionally preferred to work only for powerful institutions -- kings and queens, crime families, national intelligence agencies -- which could guarantee them protection from the law.
Are there really any willing to work for psychologically unstable malcontents who cannot be relied upon to tell a professional killer from an undercover cop? That consumers should think so may mark them as foolish. Nevertheless, that ordinary Americans now feel sufficiently well off to afford professional murders enhances the glory of our market economy.
I think we ought to be outraged about having the hit man turned into a romantic American figure. Romanticizing murder suggests that we are far gone in decadence.
Murder has never been a career to boast about. In "Macbeth" and "Richard III," Shakespeare painted his professional murderers as loathsome. Four knights murdered Thomas a Becket in Canterbury Cathedral to please King Henry II, and infamy has been their reward for the past 800 years.
Now, though, we have movies like "Grosse Pointe Blank," in which charming John Cusack is a professional killer; "Goodfellas," in which funny Joe Pesci is a professional killer, and "Prizzi's Honor" -- admittedly a satire on romantic Mafia movies -- in which hit-man Jack Nicholson marries hit-woman Kathleen Turner.
When hit men are such rich and famous stars, how can we fail to think them glamorous? How romantic their work must be. Surely the woods must be full of these fascinating rogues. Surely they are itching to represent you for $10,000, or maybe only $1,500.

HEADLINE: Dorothy Chandler, 96, Dies; Arts Patron in Los Angeles

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN 

 BODY:
Dorothy Buffum Chandler, whose vision and fund-raising fervor helped transform modern Los Angeles and who as the wife and mother of successive publishers helped turn The Los Angeles Times into one of the nation's great newspapers, died on Sunday at a rest home in Hollywood. She was 96.
Mrs. Chandler's greatest single achievement was probably her nine-year drive in the late 1950's and early 60's to finance and build the Music Center of Los Angeles County, which revitalized the city's downtown district and fused old-line society with the newer wealth of Hollywood. 
 The opening of the center in 1964 earned her a spot on the cover of Time magazine and an accompanying article that declared her effort to get it built as "the most impressive display of virtuoso money-raising and civic citizenship in the history of U.S. womanhood."
The next year, the center's largest auditorium, which has become a frequent home to the Academy Awards ceremonies, was named the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.
Gov. Pete Wilson of California called Mrs. Chandler "the heart and soul of Southern California's cultural life." Mayor Richard Riordan of Los Angeles told The Los Angeles Times that "her imprint will be part of Los Angeles for many centuries to come," particularly its cultural life.
Dorothy Buffum was born in Lafayette, Ill., and moved with her family to Long Beach, Calif., when she was a toddler. Her father and uncle opened a dry-goods store in Long Beach that eventually grew into the chain of Buffum's department stores, a fixture of Southern California until the 1980's.
She met Norman Chandler, the son of Harry Chandler, publisher of The Los Angeles Times, at a dance at Stanford University, and they married in 1922.
During the years that Norman Chandler trained to be publisher and worked his way through the newspaper's executive echelons, Mrs. Chandler raised their daughter, Camilla, and son, Otis, and did volunteer work for the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles and other institutions.
When Harry Chandler died in 1944, Norman Chandler took over as publisher, and four years later his wife was named his administrative assistant. Her presence was quickly felt within the newspaper, particularly in the coverage of women and the arts. She was instrumental in inaugurating the paper's Women of the Year awards, which were given to more than 200 women between 1950 and 1976.
"She was just really a ball of fire with whatever she set her mind to, whatever she wanted to get done," said James Bellows, a former editor of The New York Herald-Tribune and The Washington Star who was associate editor of The Los Angeles Times in the late 1960's and early 70's. "She really worked at the role of women in the city, and was very involved in setting up the Women of the Year. She was very concerned that it reflect the diversity of the city and that it be given to women for their achievements and not just for social activities."
Mr. Bellows said he found Mrs. Chandler to be "tough, but not intractable," someone who knew her mind, was willing to debate and listen to argument and who eventually "usually got her way."
Mrs. Chandler's role as a civic fund-raiser began in earnest in 1950, when she undertook a successful drive to save the Hollywood Bowl. A few years later she began her effort to build the Music Center, eventually raising $19 million and forming a committee to float an additional $13.7 million in bonds that were guaranteed by the county.
"She was a critical figure in the modernization of Los Angeles," said David Halberstam, whose book, "The Powers That Be," chronicled the newspaper's rise under Mrs. Chandler's husband and son. "If you're charting the coming of a big, sleepy, conservative community into the modern, affluent, increasingly sophisticated metropolis that exists today, she may be the single most important player."
At the time, Mr. Halberstam said, Los Angeles was split between an older establishment centered in the downtown area and a newer establishment in Hollywood and farther to the west.
"Culturally, she helped connect West Los Angeles with downtown Los Angeles, two communities that 40 years ago had almost nothing in common and barely spoke the same language," he said. "It was her drive, energy, ambition and even hubris that connected them."
Otis Chandler succeeded his father as the paper's publisher in 1960 and held that post for 20 years, though Norman Chandler remained an executive with the company until his death in 1974. Mrs. Chandler strongly supported her son's efforts to improve the quality of the newspaper and to raise it to the ranks of the nation's finest. Otis Chandler is now a board member of the Times Mirror Corporation, which owns the newspaper.
In later years, Mrs. Chandler served on numerous boards and Presidential commissions, devoting special attention to the University of California. She was among three women chosen by President Lyndon B. Johnson to visit South Vietnam in 1967 to assess the status of the American war effort. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan included her in the first group of winners of the National Medal of Arts.
She is survived by her son; her daughter, Camilla Chandler Frost, eight grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.
Anecdotes about Mrs. Chandler's fund-raising prowess are numerous.
One friend recalled how she tore up a $20,000 check from a wealthy businessman and handed it back to him, telling him that it was unacceptably paltry. At a private dinner where she was a guest, just weeks before the Music Center was to open, Mrs. Chandler is said to have stood up after coffee was served and gone from person to person collecting money in a large, blue bag.
"I think of myself as a catalyst," she said in an interview shortly after the Music Center opened. "There are so many people with good ideas and good intentions. They doubtless know more about the arts than I do. But I pull them together. That's my job."

HEADLINE: Rivals Say Giuliani Belittled Stapler Factory's Closing and Job Losses

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
The planned closing of a Queens stapler factory led to a mini-debate yesterday over Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's economic policies, after his Democratic opponents questioned a series of remarks he made that appeared to belittle the loss of the plant's 450 manufacturing jobs.
On Sunday, asked at a news conference about the recent announcement that the Swingline Stapler factory in Long Island City would close over the next two years, and the loss of its jobs to Nogales, Mexico, Mr. Giuliani said, "the city comes out of that quite well." The loss might have meant something when the city's economy was declining, he said, but nowadays the city can do without employers who do not want to pay their workers a decent wage. 
 For months, the Mayor's Democratic rivals have signaled that they will focus on the city's sluggish job growth, and yesterday two of them seized on the remarks to demonstrate what they said was Mr. Giuliani's insensitivity to the harsh realities of life at the lower end of the city's economic spectrum, where every manufacturing job counts.
Ruth W. Messinger, leading in the polls for the Democratic nomination, noted that the city's unemployment rate had risen over the last year, and said Mr. Giuliani was "fiddling" while Swingline burned.
"This city needs an economic development policy that pays attention to small businesses," she said. "The one thing I will never do as mayor is: when human beings lose their jobs, I will never say the city comes out well, or that it doesn't mean anything. When 450 additional people lose their jobs, that is not O.K. It means something."
At a news conference yesterday, the Mayor went even further than he had the day before. He said it was a loss of perspective to concentrate on Swingline when on the same day, the new Mercantile Exchange opened in the World Financial Center. That, he said, preserved 8,100 jobs that might have gone to New Jersey had he not offered the exchange $184 million in tax incentives to stay. (The Mayor rang the bell for the opening day of the exchange yesterday.)
Asked whether those jobs affected people in a far different economic class than those in the stapler factory, he called the question "ignorant." The exchange "employs people at all levels, including entry levels," Mr. Giuliani said.
"They have a kitchen, they have food they serve all day, they have custodial services," he said. "So a large employer can produce a large number of entry-level jobs." He added: "And then just think of the 8,100 people who work there; think of how much money they spend in the restaurants surrounding that area, new restaurants going up."
Demonstrating an increasing willingness to attack Ms. Messinger by name, Mr. Giuliani said her political philosophy had "devastated this city economically." Specifically, he said, she had voted to increase the city's hotel occupancy tax when she was on the City Council years ago, while he cut the tax shortly after taking office.
The Mayor cites the tax cut several times a week to bolster his contention that such cuts can stimulate economic growth, although tourism officials have said the city's reduced crime rate and increasing number of attractions may be more responsible for the rise in visitors to the city.
Sal F. Albanese, a Brooklyn City Council member who is also running for mayor, said Mr. Giuliani's remarks about the Mercantile Exchange showed that he was willing to "bend over backwards" for the city's booming financial industry but did not seem interested when lower-paying manufacturing jobs left town.
"He should have shown more empathy for those workers," Mr. Albanese said.
Officials in the Giuliani administration said they had tried unsuccessfully to retain the Swingline jobs. Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine said the city had told the company it would do "whatever it takes" to keep the stapler factory in New York, but he said the company showed no interest in any of the city's incentives.
Wendi Kopsick, a spokeswoman for Acco USA, Swingline's parent company, said it would save $12 million a year by moving the factory to Mexico over the next two years, adding that none of the city's incentives would change Acco's "cost position."
Although the city's economy is improving because of gains in financial services, its unemployment rate rose to 9.4 percent in May from 8.5 percent in May 1996, an increase of 33,556 unemployed people, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Mayor said the increase was because more people are now looking for work, having been moved off welfare by his policies.

HEADLINE: Phone Wars Heat Up Over Sponsorship of Ad

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
As the war over telephone deregulation grows ever more rancorous, newspaper advertisements have become a favored battleground where local and long-distance phone companies trade accusations.
But an ad published yesterday in The New York Times and other area publications seemed to be different. The half-page ad, which contended Nynex had the highest local rates in the country, was sponsored by a consumer group, New York Consumers for Economic Competition. 
 The trouble is, the group -- and the ad -- were financed entirely by the AT&T Corporation, which is lobbying against Nynex in a rate proceeding before the New York State Public Service Commission.
AT&T's name does not appear anywhere in the ad -- an omission that has prompted protests from consumer groups and has drawn the scrutiny of New York State's Attorney General, Dennis C. Vacco.
"Dennis Vacco is obviously concerned if there is any misleading of consumers," said Jennifer Farina, a spokeswoman for Mr. Vacco. "So we are looking into it."
The ad, which also appeared in The Albany Times-Union and Crain's New York Business, urged the Public Service Commission to reject a proposal by Nynex to impose a variety of surcharges on local phone calls carried by new competitors in the New York market. Nynex, the ad said, was trying "to preserve its monopoly over local phone service."
The ad's readers are encouraged to fill out an attached coupon and mail it to the group's headquarters in Albany. They can also dial a toll-free number for more information. The group has scheduled radio and television commercials to run later this week in the Albany area.
A spokesman for AT&T, John Heath, acknowledged that the company had financed New York Consumers for Economic Competition. But he said AT&T did not believe the ad was misleading because the coalition included several other companies and organizations.
"We support the group, but there are several other non-telecom companies that also support it," Mr. Heath said.
Among the other members of New York Consumers for Economic Competition are the MCI Communications Corporation and the Small Business Survival Committee, a lobbying group that represents entrepreneurs and small companies. An MCI official said the company did not pay for membership.
Ray Keating, a spokesman for New York Consumers for Economic Competition, said AT&T had provided the seed money for the campaign, but that he hoped to raise money from other donors. A spokeswoman for The New York Times, Nancy Nielsen, said a half-page ad in the newspaper costs about $36,000.
Susan Kraus, a spokeswoman for Nynex, said yesterday that the ad's central accusation -- that it has the highest rates in the country -- was unfair. And she said the surcharges would be a reasonable compensation for the cost of opening up Nynex's local network to new rivals like AT&T and MCI.
Some consumer lobbyists complained that the ad undermined their credibility. "If the powers that be see that this is a front group for the long-distance industry, it doesn't make our job any easier," said Robert Ceisler, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, a consumer group that he said was supported by donations from individual members.

HEADLINE: What's in a Name? At Wyoming Butte, a Culture and a History

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: DEVILS TOWER, Wyo.

 BODY:
For millions of years, the gray volcanic plug has towered majestically over the surrounding plains, rising a quarter-mile into the sky.
But now the two races of humans that regularly congregate around the tower's base are warring over its name: Devils Tower or Bear Lodge. 
 "To name it Devils Tower is a slap in the face because of what the whites used to call Indians back then: they were devils, dirty devils," said Diana Mitchell, an Eastern Shoshone Indian.
The English name Devils Tower first worked its way into official status through the 1875 writings of an Army colonel. But many Plains Indians argue that a traditional name, Bear Lodge, should be restored to the tower, which is in northeast Wyoming about 275 miles north of Cheyenne. They cite ancient stories that say a massive bear raked its claws down the sides of a magically rising tree stump that later petrified into the tower. In addition, some maps from the early 1800's identify the tower as Bear Lodge.
Noting that Indians increasingly go to the tower to pray, to leave prayer bundles and to participate in sweat lodges and vision quests, Mrs. Mitchell asked, "Who wants to pray at something called Devils Tower?"
White residents of the area strongly resist any name change, retorting that what was good enough for Theodore Roosevelt is good enough for them.
In 1907, Roosevelt, who was then President, created Devils Tower National Monument, which seemed to settle a name disparity that had existed since the first French trappers explored the region a century earlier.
"My dad came here in 1913 in a covered wagon," said Winifred Bush, Mayor of Hulett, the town nearest the tower. "I've been here ever since I was a little girl, and I never saw any Indians around here until two years ago. If the tower's sacred to them, it's sacred to us, too."
Mrs. Bush has won statewide applause from Wyoming's overwhelmingly white population for taking verbal whacks at the idea of changing the name of the nation's oldest national monument.
"That name change idea is like a rattlesnake," she said. "You can't just let it sit there."
The three members of Wyoming's Congressional delegation, all Republicans, have introduced bills in both chambers this year to block any move to erase "Devils Tower" from American maps.
Devils Tower is not the only place in the West where Indians and whites are jousting for cultural supremacy.
Earlier this year, for example, in Lake Tahoe, Nev., the United States Forest Service ordered rock climbers to stay off Cave Rock, a volcanic core revered by Washoe Indians as charged with spiritual energy. And last November, in New Mexico, the Forest Service barred a ski area outside Santa Fe from expanding its lifts and trails to a mountain held sacred by Tesuque Pueblo Indians.
But here in Wyoming's remote northeastern corner, the conflict, which involves more than just the name of the tower, is perhaps the sharpest.
In April, lawyers argued in Federal court over a ban imposed by the National Park Service last year on commercial rock climbing on Devils Tower for June, a month when Sioux and other Plains Indians congregate here for summer solstice dances. The Federal judge hearing the case has yet to rule.
To spiritual Indians, said Deborah O. Liggett, the park superintendent, the sight and sound of climbers hammering pitons into Devils Tower is akin to people rappelling down the walls of the Vatican while Roman Catholics try to pray.
To whites, the issue is part commercial, part sentimental.
Wyoming is heavily dependent on its tourism industry, which brings in $1 billion and three million people a year, six times the state's population.
For the souvenir shops, motels, campgrounds and gas stations that give economic life to the villages surrounding the monument, Devils Tower is a nationally recognized name that must be guarded as zealously as a trademark. Located between Mount Rushmore and Yellowstone National Park, Devils Tower now receives almost half a million visitors a year.
Tourism started to surge here in 1977, the year that Richard Dreyfuss met the aliens at Devils Tower in the movie "Close Encounters of the Third Kind."
White residents fear that the recent resurgence of American Indian religious activity devalues their own pioneer history and traditions. Older residents warmly recall the Fourth of July picnics that the settler families had at the tower's base. On July 4, 1893, two local ranchers made the first known ascent of the tower, planting the American flag on top of the summit.
"Who did the major part of the roads, setting up the trails?" said Rodney Hackett, a member of the Hulett town council, recalling the work done by local men enrolled in the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930's.
Andy Petefish, a rock climbing guide who is suing over the climbing ban, added: "It really irritates me that the Indians are calling our ancestors liars and manipulators. The Indians are using the excuse that they didn't have a written language. Well, the Euro-Americans were the great record keepers, the great cartographers."
The locals say the Park Service is bending over backward to accommodate Indian visitors.
"If you are Native American and show an I.D., you don't pay at the door," said Gisele M. Robinson, whose husband, Peter, was superintendent at Devils Tower in the 1970's. "They get away with things the rest of us never would."
To some locals, Ms. Liggett, the superintendent, is pushing diversity policies to curry favor with the bureaucracy in Washington.
The view is different to Ms. Liggett, who regularly meets with a core group of the 23 American and Canadian tribes who ascribe cultural and religious significance to the tower.
"Every time I consult with the tribes, it is the No. 1 issue," the superintendent said, referring to the tower's name.
One solution, she said, would be to rename the butte Bear Lodge and retain the park name, Devils Tower National Monument.
To Elaine Quiver, a Lakota Sioux who works with a society of traditional elders, the name dispute is simply a matter of mistranslation.
"Mato Tipila, the Bear Lodge, has been in our oral history as long as I can remember -- and we would like to restore that name," Mrs. Quiver said from her home in Pine Ridge, S.D. "For us, in our culture, there was no word for devil, no description of the devil. That name is offensive, demeaning."
To reach an intertribal consensus on a suitable name, Mrs. Quiver has met with four tribes over the last year, and both sides plan meetings for the summer. Bear Lodge is the leading name candidate.
Last fall, The Gillette News-Record, a local newspaper, conducted a reader contest: "Name that Rock!" Though most respondents said the name should not be changed, Lyndon Hunt won the prize, a free night in a Black Hills motel, with a culturally neutral offering: "The Tower."

30-Year Bond's Yield Hits 5-Month Low in Light Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices rose yesterday for a fourth consecutive session, with the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond dropping to its lowest level in nearly five months.
The rally comes as investors remain optimistic over slowing growth, low inflation and the diminishing odds that the Federal Reserve will soon raise short-term interest rates. 
 "From a fundamental and from a technical standpoint, you have green lights in all direction," said Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of fixed income at J. W. Charles Securities Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla., pointing to falling gold and commodity prices as well as an expected decline in June producer prices, to be reported Friday.
"I am not predicting deflation, but then again I see no inflation either," Mr. Pugliese said. "There are plenty of people willing to buy in any pullback here."
The 30-year bond rose 21/32 yesterday, to a price of 10022//32 to yield 6.57 percent, down from 6.62 percent on Thursday and the lowest yield since Feb. 19. Bond prices and their yields move in opposite directions.
Still, the gains came on light trading, which often exaggerates price movement. Maureen Mooney, a market analyst with Govpx Inc. bond pricing service, said trading volume yesterday was down about 6 percent for a Monday in the third quarter. The lightest volume she said was in bills, while coupon issues were active.
Bonds were helped by an article in Business Week magazine that suggested that Federal Reserve officials might have changed the way they view the economy and inflation, accepting a faster pace and lower rate of unemployment than they would have previously allowed.
Kenneth J. McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, an economic consulting and forecasting firm, said that the Fed's decision last week to leave interest rates unchanged indicated that the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, was betting that the recent performance of the economy, its ability to grow at a healthy pace without increasing inflation, was not a temporary fluke, but a new trend caused by major fundamental changes.
"Greenspan is betting that increasing global competition and the mass infusion of new technology into the economy are having a permanent effect, enabling the economy to grow more rapidly than it has in the past 25 years without creating inflation," Mr. McCarthy said.
Bonds were also bolstered by a slide in gold prices. Gold for August delivery fell $6.20 an ounce, to $319, on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, the lowest price since December 1985. Gold is traditionally a hedge against inflation, and declining gold prices suggest continued low inflation.
Doug Burtnick, managing analyst with Technical Data of Boston, said the bond market continued to move higher yesterday on the good cheer it established Thursday before the three-day Fourth of July weekend.
But the market may be reaching some critical yield levels, he added. "After all," he said, "who really wants to buy two-year notes yielding 5.875 percent unless they think the Fed will eventually drop rates this autumn? Domestic investors obviously do have a lot of cash to put to work and when you add in the convexity needs of mortgage investors who fear surging refinancing, there are some elements of a self-perpetuation rally already in place. That is, new buyers will force in more new buyers. But the lower yields will also bring in a large number of corporate issuance to add supply in an otherwise quiet environment."
At yesterday's regular weekly Treasury bill auction, rates were down modestly. The three-month bill was awarded at an average rate of 4.97 percent, down from 5.12 percent last week, and the six-month bills awarded at 5.07 percent, down from 5.14 percent.
Tomorrow the Treasury will sell $8 billion of five-year Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIP's as they are called. In when-issued trading yesterday, the new five-year issue was being offered at a price to yield 3.54 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of new three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 		 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.744	97.437	Discounted Rate	4.97%	5.07%	Coupon Yield	5.10%	5.28%	High Price	98.749	97.447	Discounted Rate	4.95%	5.05%	Coupon Yield	5.08%	5.25%	Low Price	98.744	97.437	Discounted Rate	4.97%	5.07%	Coupon Yield	5.10%	5.28%	Accepted at low price	58%	25%	Total applied for	$31,422,644	$29,960,461	Accepted	$5,697,204	$3,695,733	Noncompetitive	$1,341,369	$1,280,443

HEADLINE: The Illegal Home Business: 'Speed' Manufacture

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: BLUE SPRINGS, Mo.

 BODY:
The police officers searching a modest home here on the outskirts of Kansas City late one recent afternoon encountered a perverse vision of Middle American domesticity.
In the living room sat the computer where Dad had just been forging driver's licenses, while in another room Mom kept their towheaded children, 8 and 4 years old, away from the family's sawed-off shotgun and a crude laboratory that turned out methamphetamines from ingredients bought in local stores. Toxic waste from the illegal drug-making had been dumped down the drain. When officers looked in the kitchen, said Dan Cummings, a police detective, "we found several jars of meth in the freezer next to the children's Popsicles." 
 The clandestine methamphetamine laboratory was one of more than 60 seized so far this year by the Jackson County drug task force, whose officers are drawn from seven towns here in the rolling hills of western Missouri.
Indeed, locally made methamphetamine, long popular on the West Coast, has become the small-town Midwest's drug of choice, authorities here say, the kind of scourge that crack cocaine has long been to the inner city. And because it is relatively cheap and easy for small-scale manufacturers to make, some law-enforcement officials express concern that it may not be long before the drug becomes just as popular in the East.
"It's a home-grown product," said Michael P. Shanahan, a retired agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who heads the county drug task force here. "It's American ingenuity at its worst."
The rise in local manufacture of methamphetamine has been extraordinary. Shirley Armstead, spokeswoman for the St. Louis field division of the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration, said that in 1992, the agency closed a total of only six methamphetamine laboratories in a region encompassing Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota and southern Illinois. By 1995 the annual total of seized laboratories had grown to 66, and last year to 303. And even at that, the authorities confess that they are not catching all such labs. (By contrast, the drug agency closed down one methamphetamine lab in New Jersey last year, and none in New York.)
Ms. Armstead described many of the laboratories in the Midwest as mom-and-pop operations that produce less than a pound of methamphetamine at a time.
"We're finding when we bust small labs," she said, "the guys are saying, 'Hey, I was just making enough for beer money.' "
Methamphetamine, a stimulant variously nicknamed meth, crank, ice and speed, has been around for a long time. A quarter-century ago, an anti-drug campaign spread the warning "speed kills." Methamphetamine was made and distributed for years by outlaw motorcycle gangs in California and elsewhere, until Mexican drug traffickers began smuggling it into the United States in the 1990's.
But with the drug spilling into towns and rural areas in the West and the Midwest, the snorters, smokers and injectors of methamphetamine have been learning to make their own.
Within the last couple of years, law-enforcement officials say, homemade methamphetamine has grown rapidly, thanks to recipes circulating on the Internet and peddled among users, who are primarily blue-collar whites. Homemade meth is harder to track down than heroin or cocaine, because there are no imported ingredients or significant trafficking cartels.
After the Government in 1994 restricted the sale of ephedrine, methamphetamine's basic ingredient, bootleggers substituted pseudoephedrine, a related compound extracted from diet pills and nasal decongestants sold over the counter. The switch to that ingredient has turned methamphetamine into a do-it-yourself drug for people who never took a chemistry class, leading to explosions, fires and environmental pollution from the mishandling of volatile chemicals that are also a part of the recipe.
"You're dealing with a 'Beavis and Butthead' mentality," said Mr. Shanahan, the head of the county task force. "These guys have a mind for doing a criminal endeavor. They consume part of the product and then sell to their friends."
Medical experts and some users say methamphetamine delivers a stronger, cheaper psychoactive kick than crack cocaine, unleashing aggression and leading to long binges that end with physical collapse.
"It just gives you a feeling of superiority, like there's nothing you can't do," said Bruce Fowler, a former user who just completed court-mandated treatment in Independence. "Meth just makes you want to go. You go out to mow the lawn and end up manicuring it."
Dr. Herbert D. Kleber, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in Manhattan, said methamphetamine could be more dangerous than cocaine because the high lasts much longer, making paranoia and psychotic behavior more likely.
"It's a drug that's been associated with violence," Dr. Kleber said.
The arrival of methamphetamine in Jackson County, which extends eastward from Kansas City and Independence to smaller towns like Blue Springs and to farmland that shimmers in the summer heat, has been attributed to a California biker who, law-enforcement officials say, rumbled through the county four or five years ago, peddling the recipe for $1,000.
Around here, $25 will keep a user high for a day on a mere quarter gram of methamphetamine. Some users cushion the acute letdown with alcohol, although Ms. Armstead said, "We're finding kids as young as 15 using meth, with some using heroin to come down from the crazy meth high."
Methamphetamine has also emerged as a public health hazard owing to the environmental effects of its homemade manufacture, contaminating soil, water, homes and sewers with volatile or corrosive chemicals like hydrochloric acid and red phosphorous and poisonous byproducts like phosgene gas.
The throat of an Independence police sergeant was scorched by fumes from a laboratory that was raided last year. The county task force's entry team now wears protective suits and masks, and the leader carries a beeper that sounds if there is insufficient oxygen.
Ms. Armstead, the D.E.A. spokeswoman, said it cost $1.5 million to clean up the methamphetamine laboratories seized in her region last year.
Law-enforcement officers may also face booby traps in the laboratories. Detective Cummings told of finding an overhead light bulb in a dark basement laboratory in Independence that was filled with tiny lead pellets and gunpowder, rigged to explode when the switch was flipped on. The task force has also found a couple of pipe bombs and rattlesnakes in labs.
Each makeshift methamphetamine laboratory consists of little more than a glass beaker and a camp stove, with a hose to carry off toxic gases. One Independence couple vented the potentially harmful fumes through a closet of the room where their 5-year-old daughter slept, Detective Cummings said.
Some ingredients, like pulverized diet and decongestant pills, antifreeze, iodine crystals, caustic drain cleaner and muriatic acid, a corrosive acid used to etch concrete, are so commonplace that untrained police officers tend to overlook them in searches. Cooking methamphetamine gives off a distinctive stench, so some bootleggers in Jackson County have moved out to farms to escape notice.
"It doesn't take a brain surgeon to make it," said Steve Cook, an Independence police detective who does undercover methamphetamine purchases. "All you need is a recipe."
Because it takes experienced makers only two to four hours to produce a batch of methamphetamine, "it's hard to hit them when they're cooking," Detective Cummings said.
When laboratory operators try to accelerate the process by excessively heating the chemicals, Detective Cummings said, sometimes "they get sloppy and it blows up." One such explosion burned down a garage in Independence last winter.
Many sets of lab equipment are portable enough to be packed away in picnic coolers or car trunks. One set was left in a shopping cart outside a supermarket near Independence. The police have found others in garages, a car wash, a discount store and motels. The use of motel rooms is particularly alarming, Ms. Armstead said, because chemicals permeate the carpet and the bedding, creating a health risk for subsequent occupants.
In New York and most other Eastern cities, crack cocaine rather than methamphetamine still predominates. A drug dealer interviewed in Brooklyn said he did not see much profit in methamphetamine, because customers disappeared on weeklong binges. "With crack," he said, "they come back every two hours."
But Mr. Shanahan predicted that methamphetamine would eventually reach New York.
When users "find out that it's cheaper and more accessible, crack will fall to the side," he said. "It's a matter of economics."

HEADLINE: A Taste of Democracy in Mexico

 BODY:
Mexico until Sunday was the world's most durable one-party state. The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, dominated Mexico's government and politics for 68 years, using every autocratic weapon to maintain power, including rigged elections. When Mexican voters finally got the chance to express their views in fair elections on Sunday, the PRI monopoly collapsed. For the first time, Mexico has the makings of a multiparty democracy.
Mexico City, until now governed by a presidential appointee, will be run by an elected leader, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano of the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, or P.R.D. Congress, previously controlled by the PRI, will have an opposition majority in the lower house, able to challenge presidential budgets and policies. The conservative National Action Party, known as the PAN, won three additional state governorships, bringing its total to seven. 
 The upheaval was made possible by election law reforms supported by President Ernesto Zedillo and grudgingly approved last year by the ruling party. The changes gave opposition candidates enhanced, if not quite equal, access to the media. An independent authority, rather than a Cabinet appointee, supervised the vote counting, which in past elections was flagrantly manipulated.
Mr. Zedillo will now have to negotiate with Congress over the national budget, and congressional committees will likely hold hearings on PRI misconduct. Mexico City, home to one Mexican in five, may become a showcase for Mr. Cardenas's ideas of populist governance, giving a boost to his expected presidential candidacy in 2000. That race, in which Mr. Zedillo will be ineligible to run for re-election, promises to be Mexico's most competitive of modern times.
The PRI, which remains Mexico's largest and most powerful party, was plainly punished for the economic miseries of the past few years. But it also paid the price for years of arrogance, now symbolized by the 1988-94 rule of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Voters also recognized that ballots cast for opposition parties could lead to political change.
Relations between Mexico and the United States will likely be healthier and more harmonious as a result of the democratization of Mexican political life. The old PRI-dominated system assured Washington of known and predictable partners. Over the past decade, they promoted economic and foreign policies much to the liking of American governments and business, especially the North American Free Trade Agreement. But PRI stability came at a disastrous cost. The party ruled through corrupt alliances with drug dealers and other criminals, opening the way to political influence by major narcotics traffickers. This problem has grown during the Zedillo administration and the links between drug lords and Mexican public officials are now the most troubled aspect of cross-border relations.
What has clearly improved in the last three years is the fairness and transparency of Mexican elections. That three parties now have a fair chance at the presidency and that no single party dominates Congress is an achievement of which all Mexicans, regardless of party, can be proud.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Opportunity At a Price;
For Japan's Women, More Jobs And Longer and Odder Hours

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: OPPAMA, Japan

 BODY:
Fumiko Haneda, one of only 18 women among the 2,200 workers in the Nissan Motor Company's sprawling automobile factory here on the southwestern outskirts of Tokyo says she is "determined not to fall behind the men." Still, the 19-year-old assembly line worker is not sure she really wants to keep up in one respect -- working the 8 P.M. to 5 A.M. shift every other week.
Women have basically been shut out of jobs in Japan's world-beating auto factories. Companies say this is because Japanese law prohibits women from working between 10 P.M. and 5 A.M., preventing them from fitting into the typical job rotation -- a week on a day shift followed by a week on a night shift. 
 Now, as part of a push for equal opportunity, restrictions on late-night and overtime work for women are being lifted. But after years of complaining about their second-class status, some women now fear the price of equality will be schedules as arduous as those of Japan's notoriously overworked men.
"When you see the men after their week on the night shift, their cheeks are sunken in and they look thinner," Ms. Haneda said. "They just look dead."
The relaxation of rules on working hours is but one step in a broad, slow transition in the role of women. And as often happens when women advance in the workplace, there is a conflict between their commitment to equality and the practical impact on their health and family life, and on society.
The concerns will seem familiar to Americans, but they are amplified here. Although about half of all Japanese women are employed, making up 40 percent of the work force, they have traditionally been restricted to rather menial jobs, often part time, and have been expected to quit when they marry or become pregnant. Wives care for the family, while husbands work until midnight and sometimes transfer to distant cities without their families.
But that traditional model has gradually been breaking down. The lifting of restrictions on women's working hours, which was approved by Parliament in June and will take effect in two years, could open more opportunities for women, not only in factories but also in some white-collar jobs, where working until midnight is often required.
"As long as women have the courage and the energy, they can advance," said Yoshie Ota, Director General of the women's bureau at the Ministry of Labor.
But critics, among them many women's advocates, say the new law will result only in new types of exploitation, allowing auto makers and other companies to replace full-time male employees with part-time women workers, who will receive lower wages and benefits and no lifetime employment.
Others say it will be difficult for women to spend more time on the job unless men spend more time on household chores.
"It is impossible to work at the same level as men who have a dish of rice waiting when they come home late," said Tomoko Kawasaki, 33, who works for the Japanese branch of an American bank. "They have wives doing everything for them."
A report by the Prime Minister's office notes that Japanese men spend less than half an hour a day on child-rearing and household chores, even when their wives work. While Japanese women account for only 35 percent of paid working hours, the report said, they shoulder more than half of the total work of society when unpaid housework is included.
There is also concern that longer working hours might further discourage women from having children. Already, mostly because of economic prosperity but also because of the difficulty women face balancing jobs and family, Japan's birthrate has fallen to what the Government sees as an alarmingly low level, with an average woman expected to have fewer than 1.5 babies in her lifetime.
In response, laws were enacted a few years ago to give women a year's maternity leave and to allow women with young children to leave work up to two hours early each day.
Still, some women find working long hours to be a reasonable compromise.
Yasuko Matsuura, 49, a divorced mother of two high school age students, drives a taxi from 8 A.M. until 2 A.M. or even 5 A.M. the next day. (Women taxi drivers were exempted from the prohibition on late-night work in 1985, and since then the number of women drivers has more than tripled. But they still constitute just 2 percent of all drivers.)
After quitting a clerical job to care for her mother-in-law six years ago, Ms. Matsuura could not get a similar job when she tried to re-enter the work force a year ago. About the only jobs available to her, she said, were cleaning buildings or taking care of old people.
"At my age no other job would offer as much salary" as taxi driving, she said. So she has stuck with the job even though it means little time with her children and occasional problems with unruly male passengers.
Harumi Fujishima, 27, drives a truck delivering fish to Tokyo's wholesale fish market. The fishing industry is exempt from the women's labor restrictions, and she said an advantage of her hours -- from 8 P.M. to 5 A.M. -- is that she never has to miss work when there is a problem with her 8-year-old child. Her husband, a carpenter who works days, takes care of the child at night.
The new equal employment opportunity law is intended to strengthen the first such law, enacted in 1985. That law merely urged companies to "endeavor" to provide equal opportunities in hiring and promotion. And there were no penalties for violators.
"After 10 years of enforcement, we realize this law has no teeth," said Hiroko Hayashi, professor of law at Fukuoka University.
For while there has been some improvement, women still earn far less than men. Salaries for full-time women workers rose to an average of 60.2 percent of men's in 1995, up from 56.1 percent in 1985. In the United States, by contrast, the gap has been narrowing at a faster rate and women's wages are now 75 percent of men's. In Japan, even as the ranks of female managers grew slightly, women still represent less than 9 percent of all managers.
Moreover, companies got around the law by creating two types of employees -- management-track employees and general workers, who do clerical work and serve tea and have limited chance of promotion.
While the classification is not officially based on gender, virtually all general workers are women, while men dominate the management track. A few companies are also experimenting with a sort of "mommy track" -- management-track jobs that do not require transfers to other cities but also have lower salaries and promotion opportunities.
The new anti-discrimination law is stronger than the old one in that it requires companies to provide equal opportunity, not merely try to do so. It prohibits discrimination in hiring, meaning that recruitment advertising should no longer specify the gender of the person being sought. Women with grievances will find it somewhat easier to ask for mediation.
Still, the only penalty under the new law is that violators risk having their names made public. "It is improving, but it's nothing like the anti-discrimination law in the United States," said Kaori Takizawa, a Tokyo lawyer who represents women in employment lawsuits.
So women's groups, rather than applauding the new law, are focusing more on the possible harmful effects from the lifting of the ban on late-night work and the ending of the limit of 150 hours of overtime a year, along with separate weekly or monthly limits as well.
To be sure, such restrictions were always something of an excuse for not employing women. In jobs for which women were considered essential, like telephone operators, flight attendants and nurses, the restrictions were lifted either in the 1985 law or at other times. The limits have also been lifted for managers, reporters and editors, and some food processing workers.
Moreover, the ban is sometimes circumvented. Kazumi Matsumoto, 27, a planner at Toyota, said she has to leave work at 10 P.M. or when she reaches her limit on overtime, but she takes her work home to finish -- without pay.
While auto factories do not generally hire women, electronics factories are full of them. At the NEC Corporation's huge semiconductor factory in Kyushu, 1,500 of the 3,600 workers are women. The factory works on three shifts, with women eligible to work two of the shifts.
The difference is that electronics assembly is considered delicate work best performed by women, while auto assembly is considered heavy work for men.
Nissan's Oppama plant is typical of Japanese automobile factories in its low number of women employees. The Honda Motor Company has no women on its automobile assembly lines in Japan. By contrast, women make up about 20 percent of the workers at Nissan's factory in Tennessee and about 30 percent at Honda's factories in Ohio.
When the Oppama plant opened in 1961, several dozen women were hired -- but only to sew seat covers using old-fashioned sewing machines. As sewing became more automated, the job was shifted to men.
But four years ago Nissan began hiring a handful of women to work on the main assembly line. They are full-time employees, paid the same as men with similar experience, but are not assigned to certain jobs requiring heavy lifting.
Takeshi Kitajo, a personnel manager in Oppama, said women add "vitality" to the assembly line. "The workplace becomes more cheerful," he added, saying that men behave better and the factory is cleaner.
Another reason Nissan is hiring some women is concern there will be a shortage of young men in the future. The population of young people in Japan is declining and factory jobs have become less appealing as the nation has grown affluent.
Nonetheless, even after women can work nights, Nissan is likely to go slowly in increasing their number on assembly lines, Mr. Kitajo said.
Ms. Haneda, the assembly line worker, has no regrets about her unconventional choice. "My parents wanted me to become a regular office lady," she said, but she wanted more physical work.
Still, traditional attitudes die hard, and she has doubts whether this will be a lifetime career. A male co-worker, she said, while urging her not to quit when she found the job too rough, added in the next breath that it would be all right for her to quit if she was to marry. "I don't think I can continue to work after marriage," she said.

HEADLINE: MEXICO'S GOVERNING PARTY LOSES CONTROL OF CONGRESS, ENDING 7-DECADE MONOPOLY

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 7

 BODY:
The governing party that controlled Mexican politics for seven decades lost command of the national Congress in elections, official results showed today. Its defeat brought an end to single-party rule in Mexico and ushered in an era of pluralistic give-and-take.
With 84 percent of the ballots from Sunday's vote counted at mid-afternoon today, the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party had gained only 38 percent of the vote for the lower house of the legislature, failing to win a majority for the first time since its founding in 1929. 
 The combined vote for the two main opposition parties gave them 52 percent, the tally showed.
"For the first time we will have a real balance of power," said Enrique Krauze, a leading historian of Mexico's political life. "We will have checks and balances, and the President will be accountable."
The voters, in their wrath against a pandemic of official corruption, also put an end to the impunity that politicians of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, have long had. The lower house of Congress has the power to investigate malfeasance by public officials, and opposition leaders said today that they intended to use that power fully to investigate scandals and punish past and present officials of the Government and its party.
The watershed that resulted from the elections brought both opportunities and perils, political analysts said. The vote tally shows the opposition nearly evenly divided between two parties on different sides of the political spectrum that have shown limited ability in the past to work together.
The big winner was the Party of the Democratic Revolution, which supports a major role for the government in the economy and is skeptical of close relations with the United States. On Sunday the party gained 26 percent of the national vote, after winning barely 17 percent in 1994 presidential elections.
The party's founding leader, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, won a landslide victory in the race for the powerful post of Mayor of Mexico City, with 47 percent of the vote.
But the second-largest force in the Congress and the country, after the Institutional Revolutionary Party, is the conservative National Action Party, known as the PAN. It is a party with strong Catholic influence that opposes statist economic policies and is comfortable with strong political ties with the United States.
The PAN won 27 percent in the lower house of Congress, known as the Chamber of Deputies.
Opposition leaders said they did not expect broad alliances between parties. Instead, they expect to operate through tactical agreements based on the issues at hand.
"We will bargain and agree on the issues," said Porfirio Munoz Ledo, a leading member of the Party of the Democratic Revolution who was elected to the Congress. "We are going to play the parliamentary game."
"This is a velvet revolution," said Amalia Garcia, another party member. "The Mexican people voted to take away the PRI's bulldozer. Never again can the President impose his will on the legislature."
All three parties, as well as President Ernesto Zedillo, are venturing into new terrain for Mexico, that of political negotiation and compromise.
"This election represents a new era in the history of Mexico -- maybe," Octavio Paz, the Nobel Laureate and writer, wrote in a worried essay published today. "The vanquished have to abstain from the politics of resentment and rancor. The victors must not be deaf to adverse views."
But in the widespread euphoria following the first election in modern times that Mexicans believed to be honest, all sides said they were willing to try to work together.
In a gesture that impressed many Mexicans used to imperious presidents, Mr. Zedillo went on national television on Sunday night to congratulate Mr. Cardenas on his victory in the capital and wish him well.
"After this election, no one can call Mexico a one-party state or call the PRI an appendage of the government," Mr. Zedillo said in a speech today. Mr. Zedillo pushed through ambitious reforms that created a new, independent election system and leveled the playing field for the opposition.
The election suddenly brought the Congress to life, after it had performed largely ceremonial functions in a system under which the President made his decisions and told lawmakers about them later. In addition to its investigative power, the Chamber of Deputies also approves the annual federal budget.
Vote results today showed how seriously the PRI was humbled from its nearly unchallenged position.
The election council will not complete the allotment of seats until the vote tally is finished, but based on its showing, the PRI has no chance of winning a majority.
In the powerhouse industrial state of Nuevo Leon, the Governor's post went to the PAN candidate, Fernando Canales Clariond. He is widely believed to have won the Governor's post in a 1985 election that the PRI was accused of stealing by fraud.
In the central state of Queretaro, also home to some of Mexico's biggest companies, one of the PRI's stellar figures, Fernando Ortiz Arana, the Senate majority leader, was unexpectedly trounced by a PAN candidate, Ignacio Loyola.
In the gulf state of Campeche, where the PRI appeared to have won the Governor's race, the candidate of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, Layda Sansores, protested to the federal election commission that there was fraud. She said her party had discovered thousands of burned and defaced ballots.
International investors received the election results with optimism today. The Mexican stock market continued its rapid rise, closing at a record high of 4741.24 points, up 2 percent over Friday's session.
Opposition leaders who will be among the new deputies said they would use their anti-corruption powers to reopen several investigations that the governing party had summarily closed and to start others.
"This will be a period for settling some exemplary accounts," said Francisco Jose Paoli Bolio, who will be one of the leaders of the PAN delegation in the Chamber. "We will not look into every case because there are so many -- it would exhaust us. It will not be a witch hunt into the past, but a way of imposing controls for the future."
Leaders from both parties said they intend to reopen a congressional investigation into the role of Raul Salinas de Gortari, the brother of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of the PRI, in a corruption-riddled federal agency that distributed subsidized corn. They will also press investigations into the federal housing agency and unsolved political assassinations.
For the moment, the challenges awaiting Mr. Cardenas appear to be the most difficult. PRI unions have already shown that they are ready to strike, demonstrate and block highways to undermine and paralyze opposition governments.
Mr. Cardenas's party includes a gamut of often contentious political views, including many hard-liners used to attacking the PRI Government, not bargaining with it. He must contend with huge expectations created among voters in Mexico City, who gave him their support because they want to see a change in the depressed economy, which Mr. Cardenas will not control.

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY DAILY BRIEFING;
Retraining Grant Announced

BYLINE: By KIT ROANE 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
The United States Department of Labor has set aside $2.8 million to help hundreds of unemployed health care workers in Newark find jobs in new fields, officials said yesterday.
The grant, the largest to date for New Jersey under the Federal Job Training Partnership Act, would arrange retraining for 600 health care workers laid off when United Hospital in Newark shut down in March, said Wendy Ellison, a department spokeswoman. "There aren't any more hospitals being built in Newark," she said. 
 Under the grant, the Mayor's Office of Employment and Training will assess workers' skills, offer counseling and arrange retraining in areas like computing, dental technology and automotive and heating repair.

HEADLINE: Time to Get Off The Tenure Track

BYLINE: By Walter Olson; Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, is the author of "The Excuse Factory: How Employment Law Is Paralyzing the American Workplace."

DATELINE: WILTON, Conn.

 BODY:
Last month The Florida Times-Union of Jacksonville reported on the case of a local teacher who officials said had gotten into repeated book-throwing brawls with her students. In rambling letters, the teacher told the authorities that evil spirits had invaded her students' eyes; later she changed her last name to "God."
Yet under teacher-tenure rules it took three years to get her out of the classroom, by which time children had repeatedly been hurt by flying missiles and were cowering beneath desks. (The newspaper said Ms. God "could not be located for comment.") 
 For those alarmed by such accounts, there is good news: the National Education Association, the largest teachers' union, is finally softening its hard line on tenure. On Saturday, at its annual meeting in Atlanta, the union voted to drop its opposition to the practice by which teachers help administrators to identify and, potentially, oust incompetent colleagues -- a step widely viewed as making removals more likely. And in interviews, the union's leaders have been taking a new line: maybe tenure is negotiable after all.
Why the shift? The union is said to be trying to control anti-tenure momentum in state capitals. Last week Oregon lawmakers voted to scrap that state's tenure law in favor of renewable contracts of two years for teachers and three years for administrators. Gov. John Kitzhaber, a Democrat, has pledged to sign the bill.
It is also likely that union members have tired of defending the indefensible: the New Haven teacher who got off with a 30-day suspension after helping her class cheat on the state mastery exam; the North Carolina educator who won his case despite yanking students' hair and other rough behavior that "probably would have been ruled child abuse had he done it to his own children at home," to quote a commentary in The Greensboro News & Record.
New York State lags in the trend toward making it easier to remove bad teachers. When an outcry arose in 1994 over a special education administrator who was still drawing a salary while in prison for drug dealing, Albany lawmakers passed the narrowest corrective measure, as if aiming to get the embarrassment off the front page while affecting as few other cases as possible.
But there is a wider problem: all sorts of employees are digging in these days, with or without explicit tenure rules. New employment laws encourage all of us to feel we "own" our jobs, even if higher-ups would rather we leave. Countless executives, doctors and other affluent professionals now dial their lawyers when threatened with dismissal for cause. "Few who are fired do not have some kind of claim," a Washington lawyer cheerfully assured Consumer Reports in 1991.
The side effects of entrenchment are mounting. Just as school districts offer buyouts to teachers to avoid the huge procedural costs and the risks of removal, so buyouts are fast emerging as the standard for removing managers at big private organizations, especially now that employers have lost the right to set automatic retirement at 65. And big employers, like school systems, now often wait for the chance to conduct mass layoffs -- couched as economically motivated -- rather than oust underperformers one at a time.
Meanwhile, disability-rights law is beginning to rival teacher-tenure laws as a font of outrageous cases. A pilot for Northwest Airlines who flew passengers while drunk emerged from prison and got his job back. A Florida man who stole thousands of dollars from co-workers' desks and purses won a ruling that the "chemical imbalance" in his brain was a handicap entitled to accommodation.
 Would the Americans With Disabilities Act protect Ms. God? Quite possibly. A skilled lawyer might put the school in a tough spot by offering to have her try medication; when she had a relapse, the lawyer could keep the dispute going by arguing that she deserved the chance to adjust her medication or to try a different one.
The shift by the teachers' union may clear the way for a long overdue rethinking of our teacher-tenure laws. But unless we also rethink the way we've been drifting toward a culture of tenure for "regular" employees under "wrongful firing" legal doctrines and enactments like the disabilities act, we may find that problem educators can simply resort to other legal strategies to hold on -- while children pay the price.

HEADLINE: The Ringmaster in Le Cirque 2000's Hectic Dream Kitchen

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS 

 BODY:
"LET'S go here, let's go!" Sottha Khunn was exhorting his troops to cook harder and faster, his voice raised ever so slightly. By 8 P.M. on a Tuesday in late spring, the waiters at Le Cirque 2000 were running, not walking. Sirio Maccioni, the owner, had already been to the kitchen twice, the first time to look for an order that had not arrived quickly enough and the second time to tell Mr. Khunn, in French, to set aside his job as expediter, take to the stove and make a special dish himself.
"You know," said Mr. Maccioni, who spent around $3 million on the kitchen to please Mr. Khunn, his executive chef, "sometimes someone asks for something special, and the cooks don't have time to do it." 
 The kitchen has had little downtime since the relocated Le Cirque opened for business in late April.
But nothing seemed to rattle the quiet intensity of Mr. Khunn, who is cooking in the kitchen of his dreams. Two stunning blue enamel Bonnet stoves with eight ovens are the focal point of this state-of-the-art throwback to a classic French kitchen.
"For me, it is a real kitchen of the 50's and 60's in Europe," said Mr. Khunn, who is 46 and who trained in France after his plans to be a lawyer in his native Cambodia were dashed by the Khmer Rouge's takeover of the country. In return for the perfect place to cook French food, with touches of Southeast Asia like lemon grass and curry, he agreed to take the reins at Le Cirque 2000 after declining the honor for years at the restaurant's old home at the Mayfair Hotel. Now he is in charge at its new home in the New York Palace Hotel, Madison Avenue and 50th Street.
He had always said he was not ready, but now the secret is out: he didn't want to be in charge of Le Cirque's kitchen, he said. It was a kitchen once described by a fellow chef as "a hole in the ground." Although there has been criticism of the new restaurant's over-the-top design, the kitchen has been applauded.
Nothing in Mr. Khunn's background suggested that he would end up catering to the rich and famous patrons of one the world's best-known restaurants. He was born in Phnom Penh into a prominent Cambodian family, whose work, for five generations, had been in service to the royal family. Before he left for France in 1974, he had spent a year studying economics at Phnom Penh University. He left, he said, "so as not to go into the army and die for the stupid war for the Americans or the Communists."
He studied for a year at the University of Rheims, but when the Communists took over Cambodia in 1975, the money his family sent him stopped. His father died in a re-education camp; his mother spent 10 years in one. She and his younger sister and brother still live in Cambodia; two uncles live in France.
"I never knew what kind of life my family lived," he said during an interview in his Upper East Side apartment. "When I call them, I don't ask about the past. I want to go back, but in my heart I can't. All my father's side is gone, and my best friends are gone. I feel as if I lost everything. I am afraid to go back, to see other people living in my house."
Talking as he cooked in the seldom-used kitchen of his Upper East Side apartment, decorated with Cambodian art and silver and filled with blooming orchids, Mr. Khunn said more than he wanted to about his life in Cambodia. But weeks later at the restaurant he was bursting with the news that he would see his mother for the first time in 23 years in Paris, where she was visiting relatives. He is there with her now.
His face was wreathed in smiles as he described how he had found out. On Le Cirque's opening night, he arrived at his apartment at 2 A.M., and the phone was ringing: it was his mother, surprising him with a call from Paris. She had just arrived.
Reticent as he is about his life in Cambodia, he was delighted to talk about the path he took to his current position. If the Khmer Rouge had not seized power, it would have been unheard of for a member of such a distinguished family to work in a kitchen. "To cook in Asia is to be a slave," he said.
When he was 8, he went to live with his grandparents, who were to supervise his education. His grandfather ate French food for supper and Cambodian food for lunch. Every Sunday the family went to a French restaurant. "I used to see my grandmother cook at home," he said, "and sometimes my aunt, who prepared food for the king. I loved to see what the king ate and to taste the food." (Since becoming a chef himself, Mr. Khunn has cooked for potentates from the Pope to presidents and even a couple of kings.)
With the Khmer Rouge in power and no more money for school, he secured through a friend of his mother an apprenticeship at Prunier, the classic Michelin two-star fish restaurant in Paris.
"I forget all my problems when I cook at Prunier," he said. "One day the chef says to me: 'Tomorrow you will turn mushrooms,' " which means fluting the tops with a knife, a technique hardly used today and one that requires considerable practice and skill. As is typical of him, Mr. Khunn wanted to perfect the technique, so he bought a lot of mushrooms and practiced at home.
To learn how to create potatoes for roasting, those that require seven facets, and potatoes for the dish pommes anglaises, which require five facets, Mr. Khunn practiced on pecks and pecks of them.
After working his way up the kitchen ladder from garde-manger to saucier, he went to work for Alain Senderens, the owner of Archestrate, one of the first Michelin three-star nouvelle cuisine restaurants in Paris, where unlike other chefs who expect to rise in a seamless continuum, Mr. Khunn wanted to begin again as garde-manger.
"My family thought there was something wrong with me," he said. He recalled his uncle saying in bewilderment: "You were making 5,000 francs. Now you go back to making 1,000 francs."
That was in 1979, and in three months, he had progressed through all the stations and increased his salary to its former level, only to leave to work with Jean Troisgros in Lyons. "He is my god," said Mr. Khunn, who began in the Troisgros kitchen at 1,000 francs. "Working with Jean Troisgros was working with the maestro."
By 1982, he was the sous-chef for Alain Passard at Le Duc d'Enghien, north of Paris at Enghien-les-Bains, which earned a second Michelin star in its second year. Mr. Passard now owns the three-star Arpege.
Mr. Khunn characteristically turned down the chance to be the chef at Lucas-Carton in Paris. When he was asked to move to the United States in 1984 to be the sous-chef for Daniel Boulud at the Plaza Athenee in Manhattan, he accepted, deciding it was time for a change.
He and Mr. Boulud also worked in the same roles at Le Cirque. When Mr. Boulud left in 1992 to open Daniel, Mr. Maccioni asked Mr. Khunn to be the executive chef. Unlike many culinary school graduates, who think they are ready to start at the top, he declined. "I'm old-fashioned," he said. "I felt I needed 15 to 20 years' experience. Not because I didn't have confidence in myself, but because you need to feel, 'I can do everything, and I can do it very well.' " Something was missing."
What was missing was the right kitchen. "You have your dream to have something -- everything the way you wish to have it," Mr. Khunn said. "I am very happy to wake up and go to the kitchen."
 
Hint of Home
 The Southeast Asian influence in the dishes Sottha Khunn cooks at Le Cirque 2000 is subtler than in the following, which he cooked at home.
 
Poached Black Sea Bass
and Prawns With Tiny Tomatoes, Basil and Mint
 Total time: 50 minutes
 
 2 stalks lemon grass
 2 quarts fish stock
 1 large clove garlic
 3 kaffir lime leaves
 1-inch piece galangal
 1 Thai chili or tiny hot red chili, trimmed, seeded and halved
 1/2 green mango (unripened), cut in small cubes
 1/2 pound blue prawns or jumbo shrimp
 12 ounces sea bass fillets or rockfish fillets
 1 teaspoon fish sauce (nam pla or nuoc mam)
 1/2 pound cherry tomatoes, washed
 1 tablespoon chopped holy basil or regular basil
 1 tablespoon chopped mint.
 
 1. Remove tough layers and bottom stems from stalks of lemon grass. Crush and chop 4 or 6 inches from bottom of 1 stalk. Boil fish stock with lemon grass, garlic, 1 lime leaf and galangal for 15 minutes. Strain and return liquid to pot.
 2. Cut other stalk into 3-inch pieces; add with chili, remaining lime leaves and mango cubes to stock. Simmer 10 to 15 minutes until mango is soft. Break up mango with back of spoon and add prawns to stock. Cook 2 minutes and turn to cook 2 minutes more, until prawns are pink. Remove and set aside.
 3. Wash fish and score skin. Add fish, skin side down, to stock with fish sauce and tomatoes. Cover and simmer 3 minutes. Turn and cook 2 or 3 minutes more, until fish is opaque.
 4. Peel prawns and arrange with fish on platter. Remove lemon grass, lime leaves and chili from sauce. Spoon sauce and tomatoes over fish and sprinkle with basil and mint.
 Yield: 2 servings, with rice.

HEADLINE: Link Found to Spread of AIDS

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 

 BODY:
WHEN men are infected with H.I.V. and another sexually transmitted disease, like gonorrhea, their semen contains about eight times as much AIDS virus as is found in semen of men who who do not have dual infections, a new study has found.
The findings indicate that control measures used in some countries to battle AIDS are worthwhile and suggest that widespread detection and treatment programs for sexually transmitted diseases could help prevent many new H.I.V. infections, said the study's authors, from the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill. 
 The study was carried out in Malawi, a country in southern Africa where an estimated 15 percent of sexually active adults are infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, chiefly from heterosexual intercourse. The study was reported on June 28 in The Lancet, an international medical journal published in London.
The findings are relevant for the United States and other developed countries, said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is one of a number of Federal agencies that paid for the study along with the World Health Organization. Family Health International conducted the study along with the University of North Carolina researchers.
"The study has important economic and public health implications," Dr. Fauci said, "because if you can treat a sexually transmitted disease with a few doses of relatively inexpensive antibiotics, you may prevent a number of H.I.V. infections that would cost a lot more to treat."
For many years, Dr. King K. Holmes of the University of Washington, an international leader in sexually transmitted diseases, has urged that more attention be paid to such infections because of their possible role in the spread of H.I.V. infections. Many experts believe that open sores, like those from herpes and syphilis, can make it easier to transmit H.I.V. or become infected with it.
Also, many experts say that in the absence of a vaccine against AIDS, health workers need to look more to indirect ways to prevent the transmission of H.I.V. Among them are improved treatments for sexually transmitted diseases, the promotion of condom use, counseling about sexual behavior and more needle-exchange programs for intravenous drug users.
Scientists believe that cells infected by sexually transmitted diseases can produce natural substances known as chemokines. One explanation for the increased risk of H.I.V. infection or transmission is that chemokines could ease the entry of H.I.V.-infected cells into semen and speed up the rate of viral replication there.
An earlier epidemiology study from another African country, Tanzania, suggested that treating other sexually transmitted diseases in people infected by H.I.V. could cut the transmission of the virus by 40 percent.
Using laboratory techniques that were developed recently, a team of American, Malawi and Swiss scientists headed by Dr. Myron S. Cohen at the University of North Carolina showed that antibiotic treatment for other sexually transmitted diseases, particularly gonorrhea, in people with H.I.V. greatly lowered the amount of the AIDS virus in the semen of H.I.V.-infected men in Malawi.
"The more virus in semen," Dr. Cohen said, "the greater the chance for transmission to someone else."
The study looked at 135 H.I.V.-infected men. Of this group, 86 suffered from pain on urination because of inflammation caused by other sexually transmitted diseases -- including gonorrhea, syphilis and genital ulcers presumably caused by herpes simplex virus, chlamydia and trichomonas -- and were treated for them. The remaining 49 H.I.V.-infected men did not have other sexually transmitted diseases but were treated for skin conditions.
After a week of treatment, the amount of H.I.V. dropped significantly in the semen of men with other sexually transmitted diseases. After two weeks of treatment, the amount of H.I.V. was similar to the levels seen in men who had been treated only for skin conditions.
Dr. Joseph J. Eron Jr., a co-author, said the study had been conducted in Africa because the higher rates of H.I.V. and sexually transmitted diseases there had allowed his team to get answers more quickly than would have been possible in the United States.
Information from the study suggested that more H.I.V. was present in the semen of men in Africa compared with those in this country. That raised the possibility that differences in the types of H.I.V. might account for differences in the ability of the virus to grow in semen and might help explain why the incidence of AIDS is higher in Africa than in other areas.
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases plans to support studies to answer such questions, said Dr. Penny J. Hitchcock, an expert in sexually transmitted diseases at the institute.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Pound's Strength Lifts Dollar To a 3 1/2-Year High vs. Mark

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose to a three-and-a- half-year high against the German mark yesterday, helped by the British pound's surge against the mark.
The dollar was little changed against the Japanese yen as traders awaited a Government trade report from Tokyo today. 
 The pound rose to a six-year high against the mark after a report showing a pickup in inflation reinforced expectations that the Bank of England would raise interest rates this week. Sterling's strength, combined with speculation that the planned European monetary union would offer a weak currency, lifted the dollar to its highest level against the mark since February 1994.
"The dollar is trading off sterling-mark predominantly, and it's still seen as a safe haven against the euro," said Seth Garrett, chief foreign exchange trader at Credit Suisse First Boston.
The dollar rose as high as 1.7617 marks yesterday before settling in New York at 1.7613 marks, up from 1.7521 late Monday. The dollar edged up to 112.87 yen from 112.77.
The dollar was also helped by the mark's weakness against the yen. Many mark-yen transactions go through the dollar, so the mark's drop to an almost two-year low against the yen helped the dollar against the mark.
The pound rose after the Bank of England reported that its retail price index minus mortgage-interest payments, its main inflation gauge, rose three-tenths of 1 percent in June, for an annual rate of 2.7 percent. A 2.4 percent increase had been forecast. The report "was strong enough to get people convinced that interest rates are going up on Thursday," said Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at the Bank of America in London.
Central bank policy makers meeting today and tomorrow are expected to raise the base lending rate as much as half a point, to 7 percent.
In New York, the pound was quoted at $1.6886, unchanged from Monday.
Also helping the dollar was a report showing that German unemployment rose for the third straight month in June, to 4.374 million. The rise in joblessness could make it more difficult for the Government to cut its budget deficit enough to qualify for the single currency, or euro, analysts said.

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
A study indicates there may be more to travel illness than jet lag and infectious diseases.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
TRAVEL may be broadening, but a recently published study of World Bank employees strongly suggests that travel to foreign lands on business may be hazardous to one's health.
Based on a study of insurance claims filed in 1993 by 4,738 staff members and consultants of the Washington-based bank, Dr. Bernhard Liese, director of the bank's internal health services department, and four other researchers recently found that business travelers file medical claims at a greater rate than stay-at-homes. And for many categories of diseases, but especially infectious diseases and psychological disorders, the rate of claims increases with frequency of travel. 
 "For years and years we've been preparing travelers with vaccinations and immunizations," Dr. Liese said in a telephone interview, "but we never thought about the psychological side. Even at the World Bank, the perception has been that traveling to help people in foreign lands is rejuvenating, but looking at the insurance claims you see a different picture -- you see that travel does take a toll."
At first the researchers thought that the anxiety and adjustment disorders resulted mainly from jet lag. But seeing the same disorientation after flights to and from Latin America, most of which is in approximately the same time zone as Washington, and after subsequent focus group studies, the researchers realized psychological disorder probably had more to do with stress caused by separation from family, as well as language and cultural differences.
Many questions raised by the study remained unanswered, Dr. Liese said. But he said he hoped the broader scientific community built on the findings, which have just been published in the Occupational and Environmental Medicine Journal, a British periodical.
 
Stretching the Truth
Almost like clockwork, within days if not hours after hurricanes roar into the Caribbean, tourist bureaus on islands that have been hard hit often declare that damage is minimal and the island infrastructure practically intact. While gilding the lily is not unknown at tourist destinations in the United States and elsewhere, travel industry officials say that reassurances from the Caribbean tend to stretch the truth a little further, no doubt because the islands' economies are so heavily dependent on tourism.
With the announced intention of bringing more candor to the subject, the Ministry of Tourism of the Bahamas is sponsoring a Weather Conference. It is scheduled for July 17-20 at the Radisson Beach Resort and Casino in Nassau, and invitations have been extended to hurricane specialists, newspaper weather editors and 30 television meteorologists from the United States, Canada and Britain.
The conference, the ministry said, is based on the belief that "an honest" approach will benefit tourists, residents and the media. Vincent Vanderpool-Wallace, the ministry's Director General, said he was especially concerned that the islands of the Bahamas, which are very separate from the Caribbean islands, "are commonly grouped in with its neighbors to the south when a hurricane hits."
But hurricanes do hit the Bahamas, if not as frequently or with the same fury as they usually batter its southern neighbors. And a couple of topics on the conference agenda, including "Media Responsibilities in a Hurricane Crisis Situation," sound like invitations to soft-pedal reportage that might scare away tourists.
But that interpretation might be reading too much into the agenda. And, at the very least, the Bahamas deserves credit for implying that a healthy skepticism might be useful when, in the wake of hurricanes and other natural disasters, tourist boards assure one and all that "everything's fine."
 
The Best From Zagat
Zagat will publish its fifth biennial survey today of United States hotels, resorts and spas, a 500-plus-page listing of more than 2,100 properties, said to be based on the assessments of more than 12,300 travelers.
The winner of best hotel is once again the Mansion on Turtle Creek, in Dallas, followed by the Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles and Sea Containers' Windsor Court in New Orleans. The best hotel chain is the Four Seasons, followed closely by Marriott International's Ritz-Carlton and Relais and Chateaux, the latter a Paris-based association of hotels.
To no one's surprise, perhaps, New York hotels are the most expensive, at an average cost of $187.85 a night. New York is also runner-up to San Francisco as the city respondents say they enjoy visiting the most, followed by Los Angeles. As for cities Zagat respondents least enjoy visiting, Los Angeles is first, New York second and Miami third. Go figure.
 
Airline Update
British Airways said it would operate eight nonstop flights to Britain from Kennedy International Airport today, including two Concorde flights. But because of a three-day strike scheduled to start at 1 A.M. today, New York time, it has canceled four flights tonight -- two from Kennedy to London's Heathrow, one from Kennedy to Gatwick and one from Newark to Heathrow.
