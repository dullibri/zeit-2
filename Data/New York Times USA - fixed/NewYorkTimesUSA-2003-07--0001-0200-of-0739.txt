HEADLINE: New Kirov Home in Golden Glass 

BYLINE:  By SOPHIA KISHKOVSKY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 30 

 BODY:
In St. Petersburg, a city of classical and neoclassical splendor, the Kirov Ballet is to get a starkly modern glass and marble new home designed by Dominique Perrault of France. His design, of black marble covered with golden-hued glass, won a competition to design the new Maryinsky Theater for the Kirov, and the results were announced on Saturday. 
 A jury including Valery Gergiev, the Kirov's conductor and director, chose Mr. Perrault's structure from entries by five Russian and six foreign architects. The architects were promised $30,000 each regardless of the result. 
 German O. Gref, the minister in charge of economic development, said this month that up to $80 million would be allocated for construction.
Mr. Gergiev said he was drawn by the "idea of light" that would flow through the glass cupola envisioned in Mr. Perrault's design for the 2,000-seat theater and by the natural connection with the city's white nights, the summer period when the sky never gets dark.
The new theater is to be across a canal from the old one, built in 1860, which is to be repaired. Mr. Gergiev has said he also wanted to renovate New Holland, a nearby district of striking but rundown military warehouses, and make it a cultural center.
The Maryinsky's Web site says the old theater has only 40 percent of the space it needs and cites such large-scale productions as Prokofiev's "War and Peace" and Wagner's "Ring of the Nibelung." Scenery is still carried around manually.
After the announcement Mr. Perrault, whose designs include the French National Library in Paris, said his idea was not only "to present the theater building as a wonderful instrument for the Maryinsky troupe but to intertwine it into the historical fabric of the city."
The losing entries included one by Eric Owen Moss of California, a variation of one commissioned from him by Mr. Gergiev. It was presented last year as the blueprint for the new building and appeared to have government approval. Some praised it as revolutionary and much needed in a city that is attached to traditional architecture; others said it resembled garbage bags. Denunciations of it led to the competition won by Mr. Perrault.
Grigory Revzin, architecture critic of the Moscow newspaper Kommersant, said that "Moss's original project was wonderful," adding, "It was like a service that clears waste from a territory." But he also noted that the competition had not been coordinated with the city's 300th anniversary celebration in May, indicating that the project had low priority with the national government.
"That it was separated from the 300th shows that there is not great certainty of the authorities that it will be built," he said.

HEADLINE: China Opens a Door to Trade 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, June 30 

 BODY:
Corporate executives and lawyers poring over Sunday's free trade agreement between Hong Kong and mainland China say that Beijing has taken a fairly significant step toward opening the Chinese economy to international competition.
 China effectively opened a back door to its market for many industries by giving greater access to Hong Kong companies and the local subsidiaries of many multinationals. 
 While China limited the scope of its concessions in some industries, it still offered faster access to its markets than it had promised other countries through the World Trade Organization, and it is allowing some foreign investments that it blocked completely during talks with the W.T.O. Big companies like HSBC and Columbia Pictures said today that they expected some benefits from the pact.
"I was very surprised to see how far the mainland has gone in terms of concessions," said James E. Thompson, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce here. "I think anyone looking at this agreement would agree they've given a lot." 
Although Britain handed over Hong Kong to China in 1997, Hong Kong still has separate economic, legal and political systems, and it exists as a separate customs territory with its own trade regulations. Because Hong Kong is already a free port, it made minimal concessions.
Even after 25 years of gradually shifting from a centrally planned economy to a market economy, China still has very high tariffs by international standards.
China also still requires foreign companies to enter many of its industries through joint ventures with local companies instead of through wholly owned subsidiaries. This rule exposes multinationals to the fraud, corruption and overstaffing that are rife in Chinese businesses.
Despite Sunday's signing and unveiling of the agreement, the Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong stock exchange fell 0.83 percent today, or 80.09 points, to close at 9,577.12, as investors worried more about an antigovernment rally, scheduled for Tuesday, than the new trade agreement. Some democracy advocates suggest Beijing is trying to neutralize opposition to stringent new internal security laws here by providing new openings for trade.
Under Sunday's agreement, Hong Kong retailers, wholesalers, distributors, logistics companies and shipping lines will be allowed to set up wholly owned subsidiaries in China sooner, and with fewer restrictions, than Beijing had promised upon entering the W.T.O. in November 2001.
China currently allows only 20 foreign movies a year to enter the country, to the frustration of Hollywood studios that have watched as pirated versions of many other hits are sold anyway. The trade agreement exempts from the quota all Chinese-language movies filmed anywhere in the world by Hong Kong production companies.
Barbara Robinson, the managing director of Columbia Pictures Film Production Asia here, said that the agreement would allow her company to market movies in China without having to compete with its Hollywood parent for the scant quota.
"It looks like some of the hoops we had to jump through, we no longer have to jump through," she said, while adding that Chinese censors would still have to vet each movie.
Columbia Pictures will probably be the main beneficiary among the big studios, as it is the only one that has a full-fledged production company here, although others have distribution operations. Other studios can make films in China through joint ventures, avoiding the quotas as well.
Mr. Thompson said that his business, Crown Worldwide Holdings Ltd., a household moving company that is one of Asia's largest, would benefit because it would be allowed to set up wholly owned subsidiaries in China instead of representative offices. As of now, Mr. Thompson said, "our costs are much higher because of the need to subcontract, and I refuse to enter a joint venture."
The agreement provides fewer but still appreciable benefits for companies providing financial services.
The Hong Kong subsidiaries of big banks like HSBC will be able to start offering commercial loans and other services in Chinese currency as well as in foreign currencies two years after each branch opens in China, instead of three years later. And while China now requires each branch of a foreign bank to become profitable on its own before offering certain basic services in Chinese yuan, the new rules will allow branches to expand services if all of a bank's branches together are profitable -- an easier test.
Aman Mehta, the chief executive of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd., the Asian operations of HSBC Holdings P.L.C., said that the free trade agreement would provide some direct benefit to bankers, but its greater impact would be in increasing business confidence in Hong Kong overall. "The main benefit is for the Hong Kong economy as a whole," he said in a telephone interview.
Stephen Long, the chief executive of the Asian corporate and investment banking operations of Citigroup, also emphasized the broader economic benefits for Hong Kong.
"Any move to increase trade between Hong Kong S.A.R. and China, benefits both economies and therefore benefits Citigroup, as we have established businesses in both China and Hong Kong," he said, referring to Hong Kong's status as a special administrative region.
The minimum assets needed for a bank to enter the Chinese market were reduced to $6 billion from $20 billion, a step aimed at allowing 12 mid-sized Hong Kong banks to enter the Chinese market. J.P. Morgan issued a report today concluding that some foreign banks might try to acquire Hong Kong institutions as a way into the Chinese market, and that some of Hong Kong's small banks may merge so as to exceed the minimum of $6 billion.
The biggest mystery involving the pact concerns how it will affect tariffs. China agreed on Sunday to eliminate on Jan. 1 all tariffs for 273 categories of goods from Hong Kong, which officials here said would encompass 67 percent of Hong Kong's exports to the mainland. But officials in Hong Kong and Beijing are still working out whether a product qualifies if it is made partly from components imported to Hong Kong.
The fine print of those rules could prove very important for New York's fashion industry. China has become a global power in apparel manufacturing, but still charges steep tariffs for imported fabric, so as to encourage garment factories to buy locally produced cloth.
If Hong Kong can import costly, top-quality European fabrics, do a little cutting or sewing and then send them on to low-wage mainland factories while avoiding Chinese tariffs, China could become a more attractive place to produce even the most expensive garments.
Some economists have been skeptical that the agreement, formally known as the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement, will slow the migration of manufacturing from Hong Kong to the mainland. But Danny Po, a China tax partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said that the agreement's provisions were advantageous enough that Hong Kong should receive close study from anyone moving a factory from Southeast Asia to China to tap China's market.
"You better consider seriously having your investment in Hong Kong" because of the agreement, he said.
Hong Kong and Beijing officials negotiated the pact with remarkably little public disclosure, and not even much public interest. This city and much of China were obsessed with severe acute respiratory syndrome through much of the spring; indeed, the disease forced negotiators to hold videoconferences instead of meeting in person.

HEADLINE: Survey Shows The Economy Is a Bit Better In the Midwest 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 30 

 BODY:
Business expanded marginally in the Midwest in June, figures released today show, and there were suggestions that manufacturing was still struggling to find a firm footing. 
 The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago index edged up to 52.5 from 52.2 in May. 
A reading below 50 indicates a contracting regional manufacturing sector, while a reading above 50 signals expansion. 
 Economists had forecast the June index at 53.0, in a range of 50 to 55. 
 "It's a mildly encouraging release, but it's by no means a sign of imminent recovery for manufacturing," said Vincent Boberski, head of fixed-income research and strategy at RBC Dain Rauscher here. 
The index slipped below 50 in March. The pullback aroused some concern about the economic recovery. 
Because Chicago is the economic hub of the Midwest, some interpret the Chicago purchasing report as a gauge of Midwest manufacturing, although both manufacturing and service companies are included in the index. 
Bill O'Grady, vice president and director of futures research at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, termed the report "a little friendly for debt."
"It's still showing expansion" in line with "slow, steady improvement" in the economy, Mr. O'Grady said. 
Two components of the index rose sharply in May, and their progress in June was closely watched. Production fell to 56.5 in June from 60.5 in May. And new orders edged up to 54.8 from 54.6 in May. 
The employment component of the index, consistently soft in recent months, edged up to 43.8 from 43.6. 
Prices paid fell to 49.1 from 53.7. Inventories, which are not used to calculate the index, rose to 48.8 from 42.3.

HEADLINE: Charter Schools Rated as Equal To Public Ones In California 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER 

 BODY:
California's charter schools typically perform as well as their traditional counterparts, despite facing persistent financial obstacles and relying on far more uncertified teachers, according to a state-sponsored study released yesterday.
 Because charter schools enroll a higher percentage of poor and academically troubled students than traditional public schools, their students tend not to do as well on standardized tests, the study found. 
 After controlling for such factors, though, there is only a marginal difference, if any at all, between the test scores of students in charter schools and those in conventional ones. 
Charter schools -- run at public expense as an alternative to public schools -- tend to have greater freedom to dictate their curriculums, staffing and spending.
The study was conducted by the RAND Corporation for the California's Legislative Analyst's Office and was confined to California. But because the sample size is so large -- about a quarter of the nation's 600,000 charter school students live in California, according to RAND -- the researchers said it should shed light on the performance of charter schools nationwide.
"Our results are consistent with many of the charter school studies that have come before it," said Ron Zimmer, an economist for RAND. "When you look at the scores, they're so close, so comparable."
That the scores should be so similar could be considered surprising. Charter schools are much less likely to receive money in at least eight major categories of educational spending, the study found, including federal poverty programs, special education dollars, staff training and efforts to reduce class size. 
And only about 76 percent of teachers in charter schools are fully credentialed, compared with 88 percent in traditional ones.
In a study earlier this year, researchers from the University of California and Stanford University raised the issue of whether the relative inexperience of charter school teachers put their students at a disadvantage. The RAND study did not appear to bear out that concern.

HEADLINE: Public Health vs. Civil Liberties, Hawaiian Style: Rabies Quarantine Eased for Pets 

BYLINE:  By ADAM LIPTAK 

 BODY:
For almost a century, people who brought their pets to Hawaii have had to quarantine them for as long as four months before they could take them home. Yesterday, that requirement, which was intended to ensure that Hawaii remains the only state without rabies, was eased considerably, and many pets will be able to skip quarantine.
 They will want to. 
 The main quarantine center at Aiea, a 10-minute ride from the Honolulu airport, is a hot, desolate place done up in chain link and barbed wire. It could pass for a scale-model medium security prison, but with more barking. 
A grim little convenience store outside the security checkpoint sells soft drinks, Alpo and chew toys.
Elizabeth Conway, a substitute teacher, is still bitter about the 30 days her family's two dogs, Bitty and Chi-Chi, spent here in the summer of 2001.
"My family members were sent to jail," she said. "They thought they had been taken back to the pound."
Last year, 4,681 dogs and cats passed through the quarantine system, which includes satellite facilities on other islands, said Dr. Isaac Maeda, a veterinarian and the manager of the state's rabies quarantine program. Three-quarters of them stayed for 30 days, the rest for four months. Dr. Maeda estimated that about half of the former group would now qualify for a very short stay or immediate release.
Gov. Linda Lingle said the new rules might have a significant economic impact, because people who were reluctant to put their pets through quarantine might now be more likely to visit or move to Hawaii. The new rules also eliminate, she said, what was often a hardship for military families with pets.
"I don't think there's a more popular thing I've done since I've come into office," she said of the changes, which she signed into law last week.
She recalled her own heartache when her pet cockapoo, Spooky, spent 120 days in quarantine in 1975. A cockapoo, the governor said, is a mixture of cocker spaniel and poodle.
Linda Houk, who moved here from Martha's Vineyard in May, was visiting her two cats, Gypsy and Doogie, and her dog Comet on Saturday. She said she came every day.
"It's not a horrible place," she said, unprompted by any question and setting the bar fairly low. But she said she welcomed the new rules.
"I understand the principle of keeping rabies out of Hawaii," she said. "But medicine changes, just as vaccines and testing change."
Dogs at the quarantine facility live in six-foot-wide chain-link kennels under seven-foot-high corrugated metal roofs. Smaller dogs get kennels that are 14 feet long. Larger ones get 25 feet.
Cat kennels are smaller but less spartan. They include platforms and catwalks. The facility has room for about 600 animals, said Carol Miyachi, the operations supervisor at the facility.
Ms. Conway said the quarters were a rude surprise for her family's two dogs.
"These were old ladies," she said, referring to Bitty and Chi-Chi. "They were used to sleeping on our beds."
The pets are confined to their cells for their entire stay, which can give rise to lasting problems.
"Bitty we had to retrain as far as housetraining," Ms. Conway said.
All of this is set up to keep rabies out of Hawaii. The main fear, Dr. Maeda said, is that a rabid pet might bite a wild mongoose.
Ms. Miyachi said she could not recall rabies being discovered in any quarantined pets.
The 30-day option was introduced in 1997, amending rules that had been in place since 1912, when lengthy observation of animals in isolation was the only reliable way to make sure they did not have rabies.
The shorter option, Dr. Maeda said, essentially shifted 90 days of the 120-day observation period to the mainland. To qualify, pets are required to have two rabies vaccinations at least three months apart, a rabies test at least 90 days before arrival and an identification microchip implanted in them.
The new rules, he continued, move the entire period to the mainland. The rabies test must be conducted more than 120 days and less than 18 months before arrival. Depending on when paperwork is delivered and the time of day that pets arrive, pets may be released immediately or in five days or less.
The old program is expensive, which can itself be a hardship for visitors and people who are moving here. A 30-day stay costs owners $655, a 120-day stay, $1,080. The new fees range from $165 to $224.
Ms. Conway, whose father is in the Army, said that many military families would not be able to take advantage of the new rules.
"The average military family does not have a 120-day prearrival warning," she said. That means they often cannot start the vaccination and testing regimen in time to qualify for the shorter quarantines.
Ms. Houk said her pets were largely content at the facility but that she was not.
"It's really harder on the owner," she said, "because you like to see your dog on its favorite chair watching CNN."

HEADLINE: Designs Pour In To Competition For Memorial At Ground Zero 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
For months the talk about the World Trade Center site has concerned office space, building designs, street grids, transit hubs and financing, but yesterday attention turned to what many people first thought of immediately after Sept. 11 -- a memorial to the dead. 
 Yesterday was the last day for entries in the competition to design the memorial to the 3,022 victims of the attacks in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania, and the 1993 trade center bombing. By the 5 p.m. deadline, thousands of proposals, enough to fill a caravan of delivery trucks, had been received at the nondescript, six-story warehouse at 515 West 36th Street in Manhattan. Entries started being accepted on June 9, and the last ones trickled in for more than an hour after the deadline. 
 The contest is expected to be the largest design competition ever, exceeding even the 1,421 designs submitted for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Little more is likely to be heard about the proposals until September, when about five finalists are to be announced.
Entrants are forbidden to discuss their proposals, and the jury will review the submissions anonymously in an attempt, rebuilding officials say, to avoid the kind of political pressure that so infused the selection of Daniel Libeskind's overall design for the site.
While the winning entry, to be selected in October, will serve as the centerpiece of an attraction that is expected to draw millions of visitors each year to Lower Manhattan, it also must resolve several issues that have not become any less pressing with the passing months. 
Among them is whether Mr. Libeskind's setting, with its exposed foundation walls and recessed memorial site, can be reconciled with the wishes of the victims' families, downtown residents, businessmen, architects, developers and politicians. All have tried to shape the site's future to fit their own desires.
"This is a unique process that will bring together all the lessons we learned as a result of the site planning," the president of the development corporation, Kevin Rampe, said in an interview yesterday. "The result will be a function of what we have said our intent was all along, that the memorial will be the centerpiece of all our efforts."
Rebuilding officials have insisted that the winning memorial must be faithful to Mr. Libeskind's plan. Several officials acknowledge privately, though, that the memorial design itself is likely to control many if not most of the decisions about the future of the site's development.
"The whole debate will change in six months," one rebuilding official said. "Once there is a concrete memorial plan, people will expect that to be maintained, and the question facing all of the other developments on the site will be, 'Does it work in relation to the memorial?' "
That may be why many insiders predicted that even though the contest for the overall design caused emotional upheaval and political jockeying, the difficulties would only increase as the memorial decision drew closer.
That process has already started. Entrants in the memorial competition were encouraged by jury members to think broadly, and several people who entered the competition said privately that they hoped to undo elements of the Libeskind plan.
Relatives of Sept. 11 victims, believed to be speaking with one voice soon after the attacks, have splintered into several groups. Relatives and friends of firefighters dominated a recent public hearing on the memorial with their insistence that rescue workers get separate recognition in a memorial.
Another group of family members has campaigned for the preservation, "from bedrock to infinity," of all of the area within the trade center's foundation walls. That would exclude new development from more than half the site's 16 acres, not only at the surface but also underground, where much of the transportation system is already being rebuilt. 
That group, known as the Coalition of 9/11 Families, which wants the federal government to take over the memorial development, also enlisted former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to lobby for its case.
Downtown residents and businessmen, including two directors of the development corporation, have pushed for moving the memorial from 30 feet below ground level, where Mr. Libeskind would have it, to ground level. That would allow residents and downtown workers to cross the site easily to reach the planned transportation hub, retail stores and office buildings.
Larry A. Silverstein, the leaseholder on the planned commercial space at the site, has publicly said he intends to work with Mr. Libeskind, but behind the scenes he has aggressively pushed to alter Mr. Libeskind's design and has proposed moving around some elements of the site plan, including the 1,776-foot tower that is its dominant element. Although construction of those buildings will not be completed for years, their locations must be settled soon to provide for the completion of underground structures, like concourses to move passengers around the transportation complex.
Broader questions also continue to hang over the site. Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who have agreed on little in recent months, have resumed a public dispute over which entity will have jurisdiction over the site, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the property, or the city, whose economic future will be greatly influenced by the rebuilding effort.
What rebuilding officials fear most, they say, is that when the finalists are presented to the public in the fall, the public will spurn them all, much as occurred a year ago when six initial site plans for the trade center property were rejected as unimaginative.
The problem is compounded by the requirements of the competition. Entrants were restricted to displaying their design concepts in two-dimensional images on a single, rectangular piece of presentation board, measuring about 30 inches by 40 inches. 
Whether such simple drawings will capture what it will be like to stand within the 4.7-acre memorial site is a very real question. The development corporation official overseeing the competition, Anita Contini, has spoken frequently about the breathtakingly simple drawings used by Maya Lin in her winning entry for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and the difficulty that many people had translating them into an understanding of what the memorial would become.

When I lived in China, I periodically wrote scathingly about its Communist housing system and state-controlled rents. But China has had the courage to turn increasingly to a market economy for housing. 
 Now there's hope that New York will do the same. 
 At a time when New York City is grappling with a fiscal crisis that is forcing it to close fire stations and cut library hours, you'd think it might consider eliminating rent restrictions. After all, William Tucker, who has written a couple of books on the issue, estimates that rent regulation costs the city at least $2.3 billion a year in lost property tax receipts and extra spending. 
Now the New York State Legislature is imposing a plan that will lead over the next eight years to the deregulation of many thousands of apartments as their rents exceed $2,000 a month. That's a step in the right direction, toward capitalism.
Everybody has a favorite rent control story. Most involve widows rattling around five-bedroom Central Park West apartments that they can't afford to leave because they're paying only $500 a month. Mine goes back many years to when I was single: a live-in boyfriend and girlfriend split up acrimoniously, but continued to share a bedroom because neither would give up their wonderful rent-controlled deal. I had designs on the young woman, but it was entirely too awkward to date her with her ex glowering a few feet away.
Supporters of rent regulation have their hearts in the right place, and they make an impassioned plea:
There may be inefficiencies in rent regulations, but what about the inefficiency of lifting them and forcing hundreds of thousands of poor and middle-income families out of the city? Kids will be forced to change schools, adults will be forced to look for new jobs or face long commutes, and the entire character of the city will change. Artists, musicians and starving actors cannot afford the $10,000 a month that an unregulated Manhattan apartment can rent for, so the city will become a dull dormitory for pasty-white investment bankers. 
This kind of argument rests on two false assumptions.
First, it's not true that the beneficiaries of rent control are disproportionately poor. The winners are not the poor but those who have rented the same apartment for decades; the biggest losers are those starving actors who move to New York and try to find a place to live, because vacancy rates of under 3 percent are far below the national average of 9.4 percent.
Second, if all rents were freed, they would not rise to the $10,000-a-month level. On the contrary, research suggests that currently unregulated rents would actually drop.
Right now, rents for unregulated apartments are high because they make up only one-third of the market, so they are bid up to artificial levels. If prices were freed, then retirees who spent most of their time in Florida would give up their artificially cheap three-bedroom apartments, and there would be a surge of both vacancies and new construction. Because of regulations, the average rent in New York City is only $706, and that would rise, but the real rents that people actually pay when they find new apartments would fall.
"Detailed research and analysis," says Peter Salins's study for the Manhattan Institute, reveals "the extent to which these interventions harm, rather than protect, New Yorkers."
So New York is roughly in the position of China a decade ago: everyone knows the socialist housing model is lousy, but people worry about the transition to a market economy. 
But that concern, while legitimate, may be overblown. I used to live in Cambridge, Mass., which lifted rent controls in 1994 amid dire warnings of hardship. In fact, Cambridge enjoyed a housing boom that improved the quality and availability of housing. Henry Pollakowski, a housing economist at M.I.T. and editor of The Journal of Housing Economics (soon to be a major motion picture), found that freeing rents led to a 20 percent increase in housing investment.
"Such an increase represents a considerable potential boon to the city's residents, and should draw serious consideration from New York City policy makers," he observed.
Yes, it should, and it's reassuring that the state has prodded the city toward decontrol of some rents. I'm glad that New York is showing almost as much commitment to capitalist reforms as China.

HEADLINE: Rescuing Liberia 

 BODY:
The United States cannot send troops to pacify every international conflict or relieve every humanitarian emergency. But the United Nations' secretary general, Kofi Annan, makes a compelling case for dispatching an American-led international force to Liberia. Washington is the appropriate leader for any international effort to rescue Liberia, a troubled West African nation that was founded by freed American slaves and has longstanding economic and political links to the United States. The Bush administration is divided over the issue, and a decision by President Bush is expected imminently. He should respond positively to Mr. Annan's plea. 
 The case for an armed international rescue mission is humanitarian and geopolitical. A million frightened refugees are crammed into Liberia's capital, Monrovia. Accommodating them has strained basic services, and the city is experiencing cholera outbreaks. Liberia's turmoil also has a regional dimension. Continued mayhem there will feed further instability in neighboring Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast and Guinea. If the world fails to act now, the region's problems will probably grow worse, requiring more extensive, and expensive, intervention later. A multinational military force will provide no instant cure. But it can buy time for more lasting political solutions. 
 What is needed is a multinational contingent of about 5,000 soldiers, authorized by the Security Council to use force to safeguard civilians, protect relief supplies and impose a lasting cease-fire. It should be under American command and should include up to 800 American ground troops. Once a cease-fire was firmly established, the American-led contingent would be replaced by a more conventional U.N. peacekeeping force. The United States should sign on to the idea of an American-led force before Mr. Bush departs for Africa on Monday. That would let him use his trip to press for African military and political participation in rescuing Liberia's longer-term future. 
One of his stops, Nigeria, will be crucial. Nigeria has been deeply involved in West African efforts to negotiate a cease-fire. It is likely to be a major contributor to the multinational force and the peacekeeping force that would succeed it. Help will also be needed from Nigeria, Ghana and other interested neighbors in establishing a new transitional Liberian government. Liberia's current president, Charles Taylor, has been indicted by a U.N.-backed tribunal for war crimes in Sierra Leone, and must depart. Unfortunately, all of his armed rivals for power are thuggish and ill suited to replace him. Rebuilding Liberia's institutions could take many years. The first step is an effective cease-fire, and an American-led force can make that happen.

HEADLINE: Golf Club Maker Adds Top-Flite to Its Bag 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Two of the biggest names in golf are becoming one.
 The Callaway Golf Company, the nation's biggest maker of golf clubs and the developer of the popular Big Bertha driver, said yesterday that it would acquire the Top-Flite Golf Company, one of the largest makers of golf balls, for about $125 million. 
 The deal between Callaway, a big publicly traded company, and Top-Flite, a private company that was once part of the Spalding Company, is expected to create a golfing giant with close to $1 billion in revenue. The deal could also produce an even stronger competitor to Titleist, the golf unit of Fortune Brands. 
By buying Top-Flite, the nation's No. 2 maker of golf balls, Callaway moved to shore up its own golf ball division.
Ronald A. Drapeau, the chief executive of Callaway, said in a statement that the deal was a solution to the "profitability drain that has dogged our golf ball business since start-up."
The deal comes at a time when profits are harder to come by for suppliers of golf equipment, industry experts say.
Despite players like Tiger Woods, Annika Sorenstam and 13-year-old Michelle Wie, the popularity of golf has softened some, and leisure golf activity has declined over the last few years because of a weak economy, poor weather and other factors, according to industry experts.
Wall Street analysts cheered the deal, saying the industry needed to find ways to wring out bigger profits in a mature business.
"This is a very positive development," said Alexander Paris Sr., an analyst at Barrington Research in Chicago. "The industry needs to consolidate, and they had been saying that they were going to do something about their golf ball division, and this is it, this is the solution."
The Callaway announcement came after the stock market closed and soon after Top-Flite filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors. Shares of Callaway closed yesterday at $13.22, down 12 cents.
Callaway said it would take a $70 million charge against earnings because of the deal.
Top-Flite had been struggling under a huge debt load. Callaway agreed to acquire the company's assets, which include the Strata and Ben Hogan brands, as well as all the company's trademarks, patents and manufacturing centers. Callaway will not take on any new debt.
The deal is subject to the approval of the United States Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., and may only be completed after the Top-Flite assets are put up for auction, the company said.
Jim Craigie, the chief executive of Top-Flite, said the deal permitted the Top-Flite brand to survive as part of a stronger company.
"By becoming part of Callaway Golf, we can increase marketing support behind our well-known brands and innovative technology, as proven by recent wins at the United States Open, the Senior PGA Championship and the British Masters," Mr. Craigie said in a statement. "We have the ultimate respect for Callaway Golf's brand, market position, management team and financial performance."
Callaway, which was known as Hickory Stick before the entrepreneur Ely Callaway took over the company in 1982, has seen its fortunes soften in recent years because of intense competition in the market and slowing growth.
Top-Flite was one of the divisions at Spalding, which also sold basketball, athletic gear and other sporting goods.
But most of the company's units were sold off over the last few years, leaving Top-Flite as a standalone golf supplies unit.
Analysts say the two companies needed each other. "It's a mature industry, so it's not a surprise to see consolidation," said Tim Conder, an analyst at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis. "The number of golf rounds played has been down the last couple of years. And it's down again this year."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
StockPrices Posted Their Best Quarter Since Late in 1998

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER with FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The stock market has posted its best quarterly performance since the end of 1998, producing the most encouraging rally since the long slide began in 2000.
 Although the market slipped slightly yesterday and has been drifting lower since mid-June, an overall climb of 14.9 percent in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index for the three months ended yesterday was the eighth-best quarterly performance since World War II. The Dow Jones industrials and the Nasdaq composite index had their best quarters since the last three months of 2001. 
 Although technology stocks led the way, the breadth of the rebound was enormous, with 470 of the 500 stocks in the Standard & Poor's index up for the quarter. All 10 industry sectors in the index rose in the quarter. 
It is that kind of broad market rally that has instilled confidence in many retail investors, who have been coming back into the market, and in some analysts that the trend can continue. Investors have seemed to be anticipating a strengthening of the economy, though the evidence for that is not concrete yet.
While the rally has been encouraging, some analysts also noted that the quarterly run, including a 12.4 percent rise in the Dow and a 21 percent gain in the Nasdaq, is still viewed skeptically by some investors because they have seen other rallies since 2000 come and go.
"I can't say there is any predictability to it," said James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management. "While I am still bullish, I think there is a wall of worry for this rally."
With the financial-reporting season to begin in two weeks, corporate earnings for the second quarter may have a big impact on sentiment. Right now, analysts expect slower growth in earnings than the 11.7 percent rate in the first quarter.
"We have lost momentum in the second quarter," said Chuck Hill, director of research at Thomson First Call. "The question now is, do we get this big pickup in the second half that has been expected?"
As earnings momentum faded, stock gains also slowed. In the first two months of the quarter, stocks rose briskly as the news from the war in Iraq improved and investors hoped that the door to an economic recovery had been opened. But the rally lost some steam last month, as some investors seemed to conclude that the rally had gone too far without more confirmation that the economy had surely turned around.
In some ways, the market seemed almost ideal during the quarter. Stocks also did very well abroad, with many countries outpacing the gains in the United States. Those gains look even bigger for American investors when adjusted for the decline in the value of the dollar in the last three months, including a 5 percent fall against the euro. Most of the benchmark market indexes in Continental Europe were up more than the Dow and the S.& P. 500 even before factoring in exchange rates.
In the United States, almost everything seemed to advance in the last three months, with surprisingly little volatility. "It's dartboard technology; everything goes up," said Howard Silverblatt, quantitative analyst at S.& P. Using one method of measuring volatility, the standard deviation of the changes in daily percentage returns, the S.& P. 500 turned in its least volatile quarter in three years, while the Nasdaq showed its lowest volatility in five years.
Some of the biggest gains for the quarter were turned in by companies that had fallen sharply in the bear market. The three best performers in the S.& P. 500 -- Avaya, Allegheny Technologies and McDermott International -- all more than doubled after beginning the quarter with stock prices under $3.
Of the 470 stocks that rose, the average increase was 23.4 percent. Of the 30 that fell, the average decline was 7.6 percent, S.& P showed.
Another indication of the pervasiveness of the rally was that of the 10 industry sectors that make up the S.& P. 500, even the worst performer, energy stocks, advanced 6.4 percent. Never since the S.& P. 500 was subdivided into sectors in 1989 had all of them managed a gain of at least 5 percent in one quarter. The best performer in the latest period, telecommunications, was up 20.5 percent.
But as the rally weakened near the end of the quarter, the S.& P. rose just 1.1 percent in June and the number of stocks that were up declined to 269 for the month. This weak ending, with the S.& P. retreating 3.7 percent from its peak on June 17, came when long-term interest rates began to edge up after falling to their lowest levels in decades. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which reached a bottom of 3.11 percent on June 13, ended the period at 3.52 percent.
Especially strong quarters seldom mark the end of market advances. For the S.& P. 500, since World War II there were 27 quarters before the latest one when the index gained at least 10 percent; in 22 of those cases, it continued to rise the next time. Only once did a double-digit quarterly decline come after a strong period -- in the third quarter of 1975, when a powerful rebound off the lows of the 1973-74 bear market was temporarily interrupted.
What happens from here will depend a great deal on two factors: whether and by how much economic growth rebounds, and whether and how soon a lot of the investors who are still sitting on the sidelines decide to jump back into stocks.
In trading yesterday, the three major indexes were slightly lower: the Dow fell 3.61 points, or 0.04 percent, to 8,985.44; the S.& P. 500 declined 1.72 points, or 0.18 percent, to 974.50; and the Nasdaq slipped 2.46 points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,622.80.
While economic indicators have improved during the quarter, helping to drive the rally, economic growth and job growth both remain lackluster. Through May, the number of workers on private payrolls was still declining. Consumer confidence, though sharply improved, is still below where it was a year ago. And manufacturing is still weak.
Whether the war in Iraq has in fact ended may seem debatable to many investors, as the killing of American soldiers continues to make headlines.
But at the same time, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark short-term interest rate last week to the lowest level in more than four decades, and has indicated it is ready to cut further if economic growth does not pick up. Though longer-term rates have risen since the Fed's cut, in general they are still near their lowest levels since the 1950's. These low rates are helping keep the housing market strong and are encouraging consumers to refinance mortgages, giving them money to spend.
Figures for the flow of funds into domestic stock mutual funds show that many investors made their leap back into stocks in the second quarter. According to AMG Data Services, there were net inflows of $32.4 billion through June 25, the latest date for which figures are available. This inflow followed three quarters of net withdrawals from domestic stock funds. But last quarter's inflow was still smaller than the $57.9 billion in the first quarter of 2002.
Analysts say the strongest arguments for getting back into stocks are that other investments, like in the bond market and money market funds, are less attractive and that waiting until stronger growth is confirmed could mean missing a rally.
"Most stocks today are selling at reasonable valuations relative to alternative investments such as cash bonds and real estate," said Robert Morris, director of equity investments at Lord Abbett, an investment management firm. "Investors should overcome their reluctance and buy stocks."
The fact that so many stocks rose in the quarter, Mr. Paulsen said, is a sign that retail investors are getting back in. And they should not wait, he added, because "by the time jobs are back and by the time confidence is back, most of this may be over."

HEADLINE: Reason to Avoid Shutdown: Elections 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 30 

 BODY:
As New Jersey lurched to the brink of a government shutdown in the past week, officials from both sides of the aisle railed about the long-term damage various tax and spending proposals might cause the state's economy.
 But the $23.9 billion budget that lawmakers tentatively agreed on tonight was also shaped by a far more pressing concern: November's elections, when all 120 seats of the State Legislature are up for election. 
 Faced with a second year of decreased revenue, Gov. James E. McGreevey tried to bolster the re-election prospects of his Democratic allies by reminding voters that he inherited a fiscal mess from Republicans. Mr. McGreevey also tried to devise an austerity budget that the average New Jersey resident could live with: modest spending cuts and an increase in taxes on cigarettes, casinos and billboard companies, but no broad sales or income tax increase. 
With the State Senate evenly divided between the parties and the Democrats holding a 42-37 majority in the Assembly, leaders of the state's historically moderate Republican Party seized on that plan to shift to the right, positioning themselves as the taxpayers' only line of defense.
John O. Bennett, the Republican co-president of the Senate whose own re-election campaign is clouded by questions about his law firm's billing, was particularly vocal in denouncing the new taxes, but eventually agreed to support most of them.
By evening, the disagreement between the two sides had been whittled to $250 million, little more than a rounding error in a budget of $24 billion. But the political symbolism of the dispute -- the Republican opposition to taxes on telephone service and real estate transfers -- had already been reduced to a battle cry to save "homes and phones."
As the deadline moved closer, however, and lawmakers had made little progress, they were pressured by the prospect of a government shutdown. While missed budget deadlines have become an annual political ritual in Albany, the New Jersey Constitution requires a balanced budget by the beginning of the fiscal year. So even as lawmakers used the threat of a shutdown as a club in negotiations, they also acknowledged that a shutdown might bring vengeance from voters.
When the two sides finally reached a tentative agreement about 7 p.m., Republicans and Democrats said they were relieved. The Democrats agreed to drop the telephone tax and reduce the real estate transfer tax, while Republicans signed off on additional cuts for arts groups and several other agencies and an additional $50 reduction in the New Jersey Saver property rebate program.
'This is the first time in three days I have been able to breathe easily," said Senator Wayne Bryant, a Democrat of Camden.
The results of all the political maneuvering will not be clear until Nov. 4, when voters render their judgment on their lawmakers. But in the short term, Mr. Bennett and Mr. McGreevey appear to have enhanced their standing. After being overshadowed by restive Democratic lawmakers and power brokers in last year's budget process, Mr. McGreevey appeared to be a far more assertive leader this year, pushing legislators into a special session over the weekend and winning support for the casino tax despite a withering campaign of radio advertisements that criticized him in personal terms.
Mr. Bennett's newfound persona as a tax avenger appears to have solidified his status in the Republican Party at a crucial moment when he faces a serious re-election fight.
One lawmaker disappointed by the deal was Senator William L. Gormley, Republican of Atlantic County and the state's most outspoken advocate for the casino industry. When the casino tax was proposed, the combative Mr. Gormley declared it dead on arrival. Democrats eventually outflanked him and labeled him "dead man walking."
But the relief over the budget deal is likely to be short-lived because, barring a dramatic economic turnaround, next year's budget process is likely to require even tougher decisions. This year state leaders sought to balance the budget using more than $2 billion that will not be available next year: $1.6 billion in bonds against the tobacco settlement and $500 million in federal aid.
Wall Street analysts say that the revenue estimates in this year's budget are too rosy and that the state still has not addressed its structural deficit, the annual gap between expected income and spending. After pushing the legislative process to the edge of a meltdown, however, lawmakers said those long-term issues could wait until after Election Day.
"We'll worry about next year next year," said Senator Barbara Buono, a Democrat of Metuchen.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: NORTHERN IRAQ; 
Trying to Set Up Democracy in a Divided Kurdish Region

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: SULAIMANIYA, Iraq 

 BODY:
Shortly after the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991, the newly semi-autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq held a rare democratic election. The region-wide election, however, provoked a civil war. There has not been another since. 
 The war broke the region, which calls itself Kurdistan, into two zones, each dominated by a single political party. Neither party tolerates political pluralism. Both have used torture, killings and kidnappings to achieve their political goals, many people here say. 
 As American authorities consider how to build democracy in Iraq, they have repeatedly held up this region as a model. In a message to the Kurdish parliament, L. Paul Bremer III, the American in charge of administration in Iraq, said, "I am confident that the example you set, with free elections, will be an inspiration for the rest of the country."
There is little doubt that the Kurdish political system has been less repressive than Saddam Hussein's. But a look at the Kurds' faltering experiment with democracy, where patronage and tribal allegiances crowd out the rule of law, shows how difficult it will be to establish a pluralistic political system in Iraq. 
"Compared to the rest of Iraq, Kurdistan is fantastic," said David McDowall, author of "A Modern History of Kurds" (St. Martin's Press, 2000). "But it's a long way short of democracy as we know it in the Western world. It's incredibly important that Americans understand that democracy is in no way coming tomorrow." 
Conditions in the Kurdish region were hardly ripe for building a democracy. It was under constant military pressure from Mr. Hussein, whose government killed an estimated 180,000 Kurds during the 1980's. The Iraqi Kurds are surrounded on the other sides by Iran, Turkey and Syria -- countries intent on dividing and weakening the Kurds to keep their own Kurdish populations from making a move for independence. 
The parties are not new. The revered Kurdish leader, Mustafa Barzani, formedthe Kurdish Democratic Party in 1946. Thirty years later, a headstrong young Kurd, Jalal Talabani, quit the party and formed his own -- the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. After a bitter war for power in the 1990's, the two parties agreed to an American-brokered peace in 1998, and recently began looking for ways to share power. 
The region's main economic activity is trade, much of it only partly legal because of the unclear status of the region. It could not forge formal relations with other countries and was too unstable to attract foreign investors.
The Kurdish parties have cemented their power through a near-monopoly on the economy. The lack of clear laws for the region left much room for financial maneuvering. Politicians grew rich off the proceeds of sanction-busting trade with Baghdad, Iran and Turkey. Now political elites zoom around in shiny S.U.V.'s, the most conspicuously wealthy in a region where the average salary is $100 a month.
"Before 1991, senior leaders in both political parties were working in Iran picking apples," said Farhan Sharafani, a tribal leader here who ran the Kurdistan Democratic Party's office in London from 1978 to 1991 but quit in 1994 because of what he now says was corruption. "Now they are rich," he added. "They are hungry for money." 
Political leaders bristle at questions about corruption. The party leader, Mr. Talabani, when interviewed, said angrily that "only enemies and propagandists" would raise questions about conflicts of interest in his party.
The ultimate instrument of party control over people's lives is a vast system of political patronage. Party control extends down to the lowest-level government jobs. A 33-year-old nurse in a Sulaimaniya hospital, who would identify himself only by his first name, Salih, was one of a very few health workers who refused to join the union sponsored by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, the dominant party in this part of the Kurdish region. As a result, he said, his wages were cut by one-third. 
Party supporters acknowledge that the Patriotic Union wields significant control because it is so popular. Heavy-handedness, they say, is simply a function of the fact that the area is new at democracy. 
"We started as a resistance movement," Barham Salih, the prime minister of the part of this region controlled by this party, said in an interview. "We have developed more and more democratically, but there is still a lot more to do." 
Some party officials privately acknowledge the parties' excesses, though. 
"Saddam was the defining factor for all parties in Iraq, including for Kurds," one senior official said. "But the victim has acquired the characteristics of the tyrant." 
Kurds who have come into conflict with one of the two governing parties describe often violent tactics. 
In Erbil, the capital of the zone run by the Kurdistan Democratic Party, three journalists were arrested last August after writing articles that explored the lack of opportunities for local youth and raised questions about party finances. They were later released, but one, Nuradin Waisi, said he had received a death threat from a senior party official. He fled to Syria, where he remains.
Goran Salih, 31, another of the three, said party officials had made their position clear. "They said I will see much trouble in my life if I keep writing in that direction," he said in an interview. 
Fawsi Hariri, a party spokesman, said he had no information about the incident.
Both sides seized hundreds of prisoners during the civil war. People who were jailed described being tortured. Oneformer prisoner of war who gave only his first name, Sabir, said he was tortured with electric shocks and beaten with a heavy wire in a Kurdistan Democratic Party jail in 1996. 
Mr. Hariri, the party spokesman, said, "We do not condone violence or torture in any of our correction facilities as we have suffered from it ourselves over many years." 
Things have changed since the American-led war here. Kurdistan's revenues collapsed after allied forces banned the parties from levying their own duties. Facing an uncertain future, politicians in both parties have been trying to redefine their role. They have even made plans for a merger, which would have been unthinkable a year ago. 
Ordinary Kurds, who still live in fear of offending the political parties, have gradually begun to talk about them. 
"The parties had their historical role in preventing the destruction of the Kurdish people," said Faiq M. Golpy, a former member of parliament for the Patriotic Union. "But they did not make a democracy." 
The real test, however, will be whether the parties are ready to concede defeat in a political race. Mr. McDowall, the author, contends that will not happen until Iraq has an independent middle class. 
"Across Iraq, people who have bits of power are now working like crazy to create their own networks," he said. "It's happening invisibly. They will not surrender that power willingly. No one ever does."

Miami Leaves, Opting For Sports Safety Net

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

DATELINE: CORAL GABLES, FLA. 

 BODY:
DONNA E. SHALALA, the president of the University of Miami, announced yesterday that the Hurricanes were leaving the Big East and joining the Atlantic Coast Conference. The announcement ended a month of scurrilous accusations -- mostly from other conference members -- backroom maneuvers and intense negotiations between the Big East and Miami, a member since 1991.
 Universities sometimes switch conferences, but there has never been a battle quite like this: former conference allies suing a member institution for simply thinking of leaving. Miami and Shalala were accused of conspiracy and lack of integrity. At one level this break exposed the raw emotion of one of our nation's most unique institutions, intercollegiate athletics. This is where academics, sports and fierce school loyalty converge to form a powerful emotional tempest. 
 In an interview yesterday morning, Shalala described the last two months as "wild, goofy, bizarre," and she quoted her mentor, Wallace Sayre, who taught political science at Columbia: "The meanest, dirtiest form of politics is the politics of high education, because the stakes are so low."
Miami's exodus from the Big East was the most significant facelift in intercollegiate athletics since Penn State joined the Big Ten in 1993, and Arkansas left the Southwest Conference for the Southeastern Conference. The S.W.C. folded in 1994. 
Football interest was the driving force in each move, but in Miami's case Shalala used a successful program to move her university into a prestigious conference that will provide long-term security for the athletic department and the academic prestige the university desperately sought.
Like any longstanding relationship with deep emotions, there was no way this could have had a happy ending. Eighteen months ago, Shalala made a verbal commitment to stay in the Big East. "They were accurate at the time," she said. "I obviously didn't say forever. Things change. That's our point. Things do change and opportunities come forward."
A lawsuit filed by a group of Big East schools claimed, among other things, that at least one university committed itself to building a new stadium, anticipating that Miami would be around to help fill the seats. 
I agree with Miami's position: it was tired of being the economic engine that pulled Big East football.
Shalala's strategy is to make Miami one of the nation's prestigious academic institutions. There will come a day when the football team may not be the engine it is now. When that day comes, Shalala wants Miami to have a safety net. That net is the A.C.C.
"In the Big East you get rewarded by your success," Shalala said. "In the A.C.C. everybody gets the same amount of money. For a school like Miami, if we had a few rebuilding years, the A.C.C. is a better place for us. It takes some of the pressure off of you having to win to balance the budget."
The Big East's counterproposal was heavy on money and success. 
"To me, being the engine that drove the financial distribution was scary and it put a lot of pressure on us.
"Everything everybody's written about what's wrong with the college athletics was rightthere in front of our eyes," she said referring to the Big East proposal. "The A.C.C. offered something different, and as messy as the process, as bizarre or goofy as it was, at the end of the day, what the crazy process allowed us to do is actually be more thoughtful. 
"If you could insulate yourself from the kind of bullying that was taking place then you actually can make a thoughtful decision that was good for your institution."
Shalala said that Miami's departure may not have any sweeping implication for the college football industry. 
"It may mean nothing," she said. "It may mean just a good institution making a good decision for itself."
The Miami football and basketball coaches were consulted by Shalala. In another time and place, football coaches could have roared their disapproval of switching conferences. More likely, the university would have stayed. Shalala is symbolic of a time when presidents are doing the roaring. 
 Throughout this protracted battle Miami officials insisted that the war of words, the lawsuits, the accusations, would not have prevented the Hurricanes return to the Big East. 
Shalala admitted that even for even for someone like herself -- a former chancellor at the University of Wisconsin and a member of the Clinton Cabinet -- this infighting was unprecedented. "Those of us who have spent our career in higher education are well aware that there is a kind of edge tour politics, but this was beyond even any of our experiences," she said.
The Big East offered a lucrative short-term package -- $9.5 million in addition to a travel supplement -- but Miami wisely chose the long haul. The Big East was never a full-fledged conference but a federation of mismatched universities with an interest in basketball and television money.
In the final analysis, Miami had to make a decision between whether it was going to get a short-term gain, which is what the Big East was offering, or long-term security. 
"It was a choice between having more money where we are," Shalala said, "or betting on the future." I kept saying 'This is really a close call,' but when we finally sat down, Paul and I, and looked at the whole thing, it wasn't as close a call because we're betting on the future. 
"I don't want to oversell this," Shalala added. " I don't want to pretend that in the long run we won't be better off financially. I just think it's far more complex and far more counterintuitive than everybody started out thinking."
Instead of responding with a coherent strategy for retaining Miami, the Big East responded with bullying tactics that, in the end, didn't work. Now Miami and the Big East have to spend a final lame-duck season together.
"We're pros," Shalala said. "The decision has been made. Will there be a little bit more competitiveness? Maybe. But that's always good. And the University of Miami can always step up to that."
That's the problem: the university did, the Big East did not.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Church's Chicken tried a new approach and disappointed franchise owners.

BYLINE:  By Sean Mehegan 

 BODY:
ABOUT a year ago, Church's Chicken made a daring decision: The chain moved to scrap the advertising slogan it had used for 50 years, "Big Pieces, Little Prices," in favor of a less-direct, more thematic approach. But the new tagline, "Full Flavor, Full Pockets, Full Life," and its accompanying cartoon characters, confounded consumers and left franchisees with falling sales. 
 Now, Church's has reassigned most of the creative work handled by BaylessCronin in Atlanta, owned by a division of the Omnicom Group, to the South African shop Gecko Motion. The TV ads have already been altered, including the look of the cartoon characters, and more changes are likely, down to a new tagline. 
 "I'm evaluating this campaign head to toe," the president of Church's, Hala Moddelmog, said.
The changes come as Church's and its parent company are struggling. AFC Enterprises, which owns the more than 1,500 Church's restaurants, reported earnings of $36.9 million on sales of about $900 million in 2001. More recent figures are not available because AFC has not filed its annual report for 2002, a result of an accounting fiasco that is expected to force it to lower its reported earnings for 2000 and 2001.
While AFC tries to get its financial house in order, its brands -- Church's, Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits, Cinnabon and Seattle's Best Coffee -- are fighting their own battles. Comparable sales declined at all four chains in the first quarter. AFC has agreed to sell Seattle's Best to Starbucks and recently fired Popeyes' ad agency, Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston, owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, after seven years.
"I'm not quick to jump to change an agency when things aren't moving well, or change a campaign, but in this case I think it's called for," Frank J. Belatti, AFC's chief executive, told analysts at an investment conference recently, referring to changes at Church's and Popeyes.
Church's fortunes over the last year mirror those of many fast-food chains. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 5 percent in the first quarter, a result, executives say, of discounting to match competitors and higher unemployment rates among blacks and Hispanics, who make up about two-thirds of Church's customer base.
But marketing also seems to be an issue, franchisees say. A year ago, before the new slogan was introduced, Church's sales were rising on a year-over-year basis. After the cartoon characters made their debut, sales began to fall at stores open at least a year.
David Davoudpour, president and chief executive of the Royal Capital Corporation which operates 118 Church's restaurants, said the sales figures spoke for themselves. "Could they be doing a better job with advertising? Yes," he said.
When it introduced its new campaign, Church's goal was to take its long-time strategy of focusing on value and introduce other elements. The originalads featured two cartoon characters named Full Flavor and Full Pockets, with rotund bodies and no faces. Beige dots instead of heads floated above their torsos.
The ads show the characters in various states of aggravation, then turning to Church's products to alleviate their stress. 
The original tagline for the campaign was "Full Flavor, Full Pockets, Full Life," but this has since been shortened to "Full Flavor, Full Pockets."
"The campaign was designed to do a couple of things for us," Ms. Moddelmog said. "One was to give us some icons that you could associate with the Church's brand. Church's has a wonderful brand history and a fabulous dynamic logo, but it didn't have icons we could hang our hat on."
Church's also wanted consumers to establish an emotional bond with the Full Flavor and Full Pockets characters, Ms. Moddelmog said.
But some franchisees questioned the execution of the campaign, especially the characters' practically headless bodies.
"It indicates that you don't have to have a brain to come out to Church's," Mr. Davoudpour said.
" 'Big Pieces, Little Prices' worked," he added. "Why change it? You had to build on that theme instead of taking it in a new direction."
Ms. Moddelmog stopped short of calling the new campaign a failure, but said, "We thought the animation would stand out among the clutter better than it did at the end of the day."
Not all franchisees felt the campaign was a flop.
"When I first saw it, I didn't like it at all," said Lloyd Speck, who operates 17 Church's outlets in South Florida. "You're looking at characters with no heads. It was like, huh? But the more I saw it, the more I liked it. It didn't have a person's head, so you can put your own character in there." He also applauded the colorful quality of the campaign.
"I think it's a good campaign, but every campaign can be improved upon," said Tom Gresham, a Church's franchisee with stores in Mississippi and Arkansas.
Church's is trying to do just that with the current tagline and cartoon characters, at least temporarily. It has revamped the spots to place Full Flavor and Full Pockets alongside flesh-and-blood characters. It has also slimmed down the once portly physiques of its cartoon icons.
In one new TV ad, scheduled to appear shortly, Full Flavor rides a roller coaster alongside human actors. While the other riders scream and throw their arms in the air, Full Flavor calmly munches on boneless chicken.
"They felt they needed to get some real people in the commercials," Gresham said. "We've got to make sure Church's customers can understand and relate to the advertising."

HEADLINE: Afghanistan's Future, Lost in the Shuffle 

BYLINE:  By Sarah Chayes; Sarah Chayes, a former NPR reporter, is field director of Afghans for Civil Society, an organization that sponsors democracy initiatives.

DATELINE: KANDAHAR, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
Ten miles outside this dust-blown city, the historical capital of Afghanistan, gunmen belonging to the local warlord guard the airport, which American forces use as a base. The hefty fee the guards get from the United States has allowed them to build a marble-faced barracks nearby. 
 Kandaharis, baffled, keep asking me, "Why are the Americans helping President Hamid Karzai and helping his enemies, the warlords, too?" To them the problem with this practice is clear: United States policy is in danger of failing because America won't stop hedging its bets. At stake is not just the future of Afghanistan, but a whole region's hopes of escaping a 30-year nightmare. And ultimately, what happens in Afghanistan will shape relations between the Muslim world and the West. 
 The hedging of bets has taken many forms since the fall of the Taliban a year and a half ago: a dizzying succession of officers at the United State Embassy for the first six months; the lack of any reconstruction projects outside Kabul until after the grand council chose Mr. Karzai as transitional president; and later, international donors' obsession with quick-impact projects, known as quips, that didn't cost much and wouldn't be much of a loss if they failed. 
Afghans, meanwhile, have been waiting for major reconstruction that would make a real difference. The Kabul-Kandahar road, on which work has only just begun, has become a cause celebre. What was once a six-hour trip to the capital to deliver, say, Kandahar grapes, and the exquisitely fragrant raisins they dry into, is now a three-day trek -- and 72 hours on the road means grape mash. A good road to Kabul would make all the difference to Kandahar's merchants, and jumpstart a whole region's economy.
And what about other projects that would substantially improve Afghan lives? There's the road to Urozgan, an isolated town that is easy prey to Islamic extremists and is at minimum a nine-hour drive from Kandahar along a ribbon of iron-hard dirt. The Helmand Province irrigation system, built by American engineers in the late 1950's, now lies crippled after years of neglect and Soviet sabotage. Donors, however, are loath to commit their money to big projects like these.
But the most dangerous form of bet-hedging has been American support for local strongmen. Eager for Afghan forces to help fight the Taliban, the United States brought these warlords back from exile after 9/11. What began as a relationship of convenience was cemented in a brotherhood of arms, as United States troops fraternized with the exotic fighters they had bivouacked with. Because they had reaped weapons and cash in the bargain, the warlords were able to impose themselves as provincial governors, despite being reviled by the Afghan people, as every conversation I've had and study I've done demonstrates.
Their positions have been reinforced by international donors who, for convenience's sake, distribute much of their reconstruction assistance through the warlords. The donors' reasoning sounds plausible: "So-and-so is the governor," numerous United States officials have told me. "The day President Karzai removes him, we will support that decision. But until then, we have to work with him." It's a bit disingenuous, since this explanation ignores the way these men became governors.
It also begs the truth. In late May, President Karzai summoned to Kabul the 12 governors who control Afghanistan's strategic borders. For the previous fortnight, Afghan and international officials say, he had been preparing to dismiss the most egregious offenders: four or five governors who are running their provinces like personal fiefs, who withhold vast customs revenue from the central government, who truck with meddlesome foreign governments, who oppress their people, who turn a blind eye to extremist activities while trumpeting their anti-Taliban bona fides. United States officials, saying they were taken aback by the scope of the Afghan government's plan, discouraged him. The plan was scrapped, and the Afghan government made do with an agreement in which the recalcitrant governors promised to hand over customs revenue owed the central government.
Washington, in other words, wouldn't stop hedging its bets. The United States backs Mr. Karzai, but it can't relinquish its alliances with the enemies of all he stands for.
But President Karzai bears part of the blame. He, too, has been hedging his bets. His endlessly polite interactions with his predator governors are confusing his constituents. Although Washington thought firing half a dozen governors was too much, it would have supported the dismissal of one or two, and Mr. Karzai wasted a golden opportunity by refusing to do that.
The problem is, no matter what they say, these warlords aren't going to behave. They are not reformable, because it is not in their interest to reform. The warlords' livelihood depends on extremism and lawlessness. That's how they draw their pay; that's what allows them to rule by the gun in an unofficial martial law, looting villages under the pretext of mopping-up operations, extracting taxes and bribes, crushing opponents.
The American alliance with warlords also discourages ordinary Afghans from helping rebuild their country. And without the people, the process is doomed. Afghans I have met and worked with share a fierce desire to live in a normal country. They have demonstrated that desire. In the face of tremendous adversity, they have managed to open schools, clean irrigation ditches, plant trees and dig sewers. But seeing warlords regain power is making people waver. I have found in my work that more and more Afghans are withdrawing to the sidelines, subtracting their life force from the battle to reconstruct Afghanistan.
They are also increasingly wary about the elections next year. At a recent meeting here with representatives from the commission that's drafting a new constitution, a nursing student asked, "How can we freely elect our representatives with warlords controlling the countryside?"
Despite American officials' misgivings, it would not be so difficult to remove the warlord-governors. Their lack of popular support means no one would fly to their defense were they dismissed. The mere display of American backing for a plan to oust them would be enough to cow their paid liegemen. In the interest of offering Afghanistan a chance at a future, and opening the door to a new kind of relationship with the Muslim world, the United States should back any future decision to remove the warlord-governors.
For despite the rocky start to reconstructing postwar Afghanistan, an ember of hope for the country's future is still burning. Several high-caliber diplomats are now at the American embassy. American military commanders, who by training focus on battle plans, have begun to realize that their activities can have unintended political consequences if they do not have intimate knowledge of the people they are dealing with. These officers have grown more alert to the ways in which local warlords may be using them. In Kandahar, the base commander has begun meeting with tribal elders to forge links with the population. In other words, the United States is finally positioned to do a good job here.
When President Bush decided to invade Iraq, he promised that Afghanistan would not be forgotten. If that promise is to mean anything, America's accumulated experience in Afghanistan must be acted upon, unequivocally. It's time to stop hedging bets.

HEADLINE: City's Top Earners Will Soon See Larger Tax Bite in Paychecks 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
The income tax increase on New York City's top earners that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg signed into law yesterday should start to be reflected in their paychecks within the next two or three weeks, city officials said. 
 The increase will affect about 5 percent of the city's taxpayers, they said: individual taxpayers earning more than $100,000 and married couples earning more than $150,000 in taxable income. It will raise an estimated $644 million for the city this year. 
 The increase raises the top income-tax rate to 4.25 percent from 3.648 percent on single people earning more than $100,000 and on married couples earning more than $150,000. The top rate will go to 4.45 percent for all residents with taxable incomes above $500,000. 
Because the tax increase is retroactive to Jan. 1, city officials said, the amount withheld each week through the end of the year will be effectively doubled, to make up for the first six months of this year when the extra tax was not withheld.
The ceremony at City Hall where Mayor Bloomberg signed the bill into law was somewhat lonely by bill-signing standards. 
Unlike most such ceremonies -- where City Council members vie to get into the photographs whether they are prime sponsors of the bill, or co-sponsors, or perhaps merely voted for it -- this one featured a lone Councilman, David I. Weprin of Queens, who is the chairman of the Council's finance committee.
And those in the audience did not exactly scramble to get their hands on the ceremonial pens that Mayor Bloomberg used to sign the bill, as is customary. But the mayor did take the opportunity to give his version of "How a Bill Becomes a Law." 
"For those of you who have never been to a bill signing before, this is a bill signing," he said. "What happens is the mayor reads a carefully scripted set of remarks, which in theory describes the bill. The sponsors from the City Council show up, although in this case, since it's a tax increase, there is only one, Councilman Weprin, who I will say at least has the guts to show. Congratulations."
The income tax increase will be slowly phased out over the next two years and is set to disappear after 2005, officials said. 
Mayor Bloomberg, who ran on an anti-tax platform but was then confronted with back-to-back multibillion-dollar deficits, thanked the State Legislature and the City Council for approving the tax increase, and explained why it is needed.
"I think that the City Council should be commended for having the courage to stand up and to pass a law which was necessary," he said, "if we were going to keep the streets of this city safe, if we were going to make sure that people didn't sleep on the streets, if we were going to make sure that all the services the public needs were provided." 
Mr. Bloomberg said he hoped that other taxes could be lowered over the next few years if the economy recovered and the city could afford it.

 Mr. Messier, the ousted French chief executive of Vivendi Universal, won a ruling yesterday from a three-member arbitration panel in New York forcing his former employer to pay him the $23.4 million in severance that he said he had been granted before his departure last year. 
 For Mr. Messier, who engineered the transformation of Vivendi from a water utility into a global media conglomerate that nearly went bankrupt, the severance ruling may finally put him in the group he sought to join as he eschewed France's business establishment in an effort to become an American capitalist.
Indeed, Mr. Messier, 46, was a near-facsimile of many American chief executives now out of work: He lived in a $17.5 million apartment on Park Avenue, flew around the world in a fleet of private jets and spoke of "synergies" and "convergence" with zeal.
His $34 billion acquisition of Seagram and its Universal music and film businesses in 2000 was his attempt to become a media mogul. He wanted to build a global media empire that rivaled the likes of AOL Time Warner and Walt Disney. The severance agreement may put Vivendi in league with Disney: it, too, paid what many saw as an outsized severance package -- $100 million -- to Michael Ovitz, its former president. It is now being sued by shareholders for that decision.
Still, Mr. Messier's severance package is particularly notable because he had derided such packages in his autobiography. "These special payments -- the golden parachutes that we hear so much about -- cannot be justified for executive directors. My contract has no such clause. I promise my board never to negotiate one," he wrote in his book "J6M.com: Who's Afraid of the New Economy?" in 2000. The title referred to his nickname, which, in French, stands for "Jean-Marie Messier, myself, master of the world."
Vivendi, which is now dismantling much of Mr. Messier's creation by auctioning off its United States entertainment assets, said it "intends to challenge this decision through all available legal actions, both in France and in the United States." It said the company's board planned to discuss its options today as it also reviews the progress of its auction.
Vivendi contended that its board never voted to approve Mr. Messier's severance package. According to an account in the coming book "The Man Who Tried to Buy the World: Jean-Marie Messier and Vivendi Universal" (Portfolio), Mr. Messier coerced Edgar Bronfman Jr. and other board members to sign off on the severance package.
"His attitude was, 'Unless I get my money, I'm not going to call a board meeting,' " the book says Mr. Bronfman said of Mr. Messier. "It was blackmail, and any agreement negotiated under duress would, of course, not be valid. But it was my duty to agree."
Mr. Bronfman declined to comment yesterday, but his spokesman said he did not dispute his remarks in the book.
Mr. Messier's lawyer, Michael J. Malone, said in a statement: "Any appeal of this well-reasoned, unanimous decision by three of the leading arbitrators in the U.S. would be frivolous. If Vivendi nevertheless prefers to prolong these proceedings by pursuing such an appeal, we are quite confident Mr. Messier will prevail in that forum, as well."
It is unclear what legal recourse Vivendi might have to a binding arbitration ruling.
Mr. Messier was the second-highest-paid executive in France last year, with a package valued at 5.6 million euros ($6.4 million), behind Lindsay Owen-Jones, the chief executive of L'Oreal, the shampoo and beauty products group, who was paid 6.3 million euros. Their salaries helped make France the top payer of chief executives in Europe, according to the European Corporate Governance Institute in Brussels.
Healthy American companies rarely balk at paying severance terms outlined in contracts with ousted chief executives. One exception was Linda Wachner, the former chief executive of the Warnaco Group. After her dismissal, Ms. Warnaco demanded $25.1 million in severance, but eventually settled for a package of stock and cash that the company said was worth just $452,000.

HEADLINE: Democrats Protest Changes to Overtime Rules 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Forty-two Democratic senators and more than 100 Democratic House members urged the Bush administration yesterday to withdraw proposed regulations that they said would eliminate overtime pay for millions of workers.
 The lawmakers made their plea on the final day of a 90-day comment period in which the administration received tens of thousands of criticisms of its proposals, which are the first effort to update overtime regulations since 1975. 
 "Our citizens are working longer hours than ever before -- longer than in any other industrial nation," the senators wrote to Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao. "At least one in five employees now has a workweek that exceeds 50 hours. Protecting the 40-hour workweek is vital to balancing work responsibilities and family needs." 
When the administration proposed the rule changes in March, it called them an evenhanded effort that would exempt an additional 640,000 white-collar workers from overtime coverage while adding 1.3 million low-paid workers to the group that automatically qualifies for overtime pay.
Many business groups praised the proposals, calling them a needed effort to modernize what they said was a thicket of confusing, obsolete rules. 
"On balance, the proposed regulations do a very good job bringing our workplace regulations into the 21st century," Katherine Lugar, vice president for legislative affairs at the National Retail Federation, said yesterday at a news conference.
The Democratic lawmakers joined labor unions in opposing the rule changes, asserting that they would reduce take-home pay and free time for many workers.
"Millions of workers who receive time and a half for their overtime work today will be required to work longer hours for less money under the proposal," the House members wrote to Ms. Chao. "Millions more who have long depended upon overtime work to help make ends meet will face effective pay cuts."
Richard Trumka, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s secretary-treasurer, who led a protest rally yesterday at the Labor Department, said: "It's outrageous that their proposals would deny overtime pay to 8 million more workers. It's particularly outrageous for them to do this when they haven't even held a single public hearing."
Critics of the proposals have relied heavily on a study by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group, that concluded that the proposals would exempt an additional 8 million executive, administrative and professional workers from qualifying for overtime when they worked more than 40 hours a week. The institute faulted the administration's estimate that 640,000 more workers would be exempt.
The proposals would alter the criteria for determining which white-collar employees cannot receive overtime.
Under the new rules, anyone earning less than $22,100 a year would automatically qualify for overtime, while under existing rules only workers earning less than $8,060 a year automatically qualify. As a result, under existing regulations, assistant managers of fast-food restaurants who earn $18,000 a year often do not qualify for overtime because they are considered managers.
Tammy D. McCutchen, the administrator of the wage and hour division at the Labor Department, said the lawmakers should not rely on the Economic Policy Institute study, asserting that it was flawed and misinterpreted current rules.
"A lot of the 8 million figure that the senators and congressmen are citing relies on misinformation," Ms. McCutchen said. "If you compare how executive employees become exempt today and how they will become exempt under our proposals, it will become harder for employers to exempt those employees."

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT: OVERVIEW; 
In a Momentous Term, Justices Remake the Law, and the Court

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court term that ended last week will leave as big an imprint as any in recent memory -- not only on the country, but on the court itself in ways few could have expected when the term began.
 Not only are the justices, whose average age is near 70, now involved in an unanticipated dialogue about the nature of human sexuality, they have displayed a new attentiveness to legal developments in the rest of the world and to the court's role in keeping the United States in step with them. 
 In an amazing final week, the court preserved affirmative action in university admissions, providing a safe harbor for a policy that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's majority opinion described not as something to be grudgingly tolerated but as close to a moral imperative. Then the court found in the Constitution's due process guarantee a demand for gay men and lesbians to be accorded dignity and respect for their private sexual behavior.
These rulings followed by several weeks a decision that was in many ways equally surprising, opening states to lawsuits for violations of the federal Family and Medical Leave Act. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist described that law as an appropriate exercise of Congressional power to combat stereotypes about female workers' domestic responsibilities and "thereby dismantle persisting gender-based barriers" facing women in the workplace. 
Each of the three cases "addressed a rather new but rather widely supported cultural development and gave it constitutional legitimacy," Professor Paul Gewirtz of Yale Law School said. To some extent the court was leading the country, and to some extent it was playing catch-up, but the most significant aspect of the term, Professor Gewirtz said in an interview, was the court's role in "consolidating cultural developments," legitimizing them and translating them into "binding legal principle."
Justice Antonin Scalia, in a bitter dissenting opinion in the gay rights case, accused the court of having "taken sides in the culture war," and there was little dispute that, to some degree, at least, he was right. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's majority opinion in Lawrence v. Texas provided much for Justice Scalia to regret, not least its embrace of the right-to-privacy line of cases that began with a birth control decision in 1965 and culminated 30 years ago in the abortion decision, Roe v. Wade.
And Justice Kennedy's citation of a 1981 gay rights opinion by the European Court of Human Rights, the first time a decision of that court has been invoked by a majority of the Supreme Court, marked a stinging defeat for Justice Scalia, who has tried to hold back the court's steadily growing interest in foreign legal developments. Justice Scalia criticized the majority's use of that decision, which Justice Kennedy cited as evidence of a Western consensus on sexual privacy, as "meaningless" and "dangerous," saying the court should not impose foreign views on American constitutional law.
The voting patterns this term gave Justice Scalia ample cause for disaffection. Thirty of 71 cases decided by published opinions were unanimous, leaving 41 contested cases. In these, Justices Scalia and Clarence Thomas were the court's most frequent dissenters, with 16 and 21 dissenting votes respectively. This was a change from recent terms, when Justice John Paul Stevens, the court's most liberal member, was consistently the most frequent dissenter.
Justice Stevens dissented 15 times this term, as did Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The fewest dissenting votes, as usual, were cast by Justice O'Connor, with eight, followed by Chief Justice Rehnquist, with nine -- making the indisputably conservative chief justice appear almost a centrist in the court's current spectrum.
In fact, "this term suggested a split between two kinds of conservative Republicans," Walter Dellinger, a former acting solicitor general and longtime student of the court, said in an interview. Justices Kennedy and O'Connor "share the sensibilities of corporate Republicans, who often have a bit of a libertarian streak in them," he said, while on social issues, "Scalia and Thomas represent the Moral Majority strain, which is vocal but not necessarily dominant."
Chief Justice Rehnquist, Mr. Dellinger said, often occupies a middle position between the two groups.
The voting record in the court's most closely divided cases demonstrates Justice O'Connor's pivotal role. There were 14 cases decided by 5-to-4 votes, accounting for 20 percent, compared with 28 percent last year. In the 2000-1 term, the fractious year of the Bush v. Gore election decision, fully one-third of the court's cases were decided, as that one was, on 5-to-4 votes.
Justice O'Connor was in the majority this term in all but 2 of the 14 5-to-4 decisions. In five of those, including two that upheld California's three-strikes sentencing law, she cast her vote with her more conservative colleagues. In four others, including the Michigan law school case and a case that preserved a nationwide program that provides money for legal services for the poor, she voted with Justices Stevens, Ginsburg, David H. Souter and Stephen G. Breyer.
That leaves five of the 5-to-4 decisions that fit no particular pattern. That is an unusually high proportion for the members of this court, who have now served together for nine years, a modern record. "Maybe the stability is leading them to act more like individuals and less as blocs," said Richard Lazarus, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center and faculty director of its Supreme Court Institute. "To the extent that's true, the conservatives lose, because they are the ones with the potential to win through bloc voting."
It is a court that in recent years has displayed a notable institutional self-confidence, striking down federal statutes at near-record rates. That pace slowed this term, but the muscles the justices have been exercising were put to use in both the affirmative action and the gay rights decisions. The outcome in neither case was particularly surprising. It was the breadth of the majority decisions that was startling.
But those rulings, like many Supreme Court decisions, are part of an ongoing constitutional conversation that involves the court, the various branches and levels of government, and the public. In the gay rights case, "the court has initiated a dialogue with the country," said Prof. Robert Post of the University of California's law school at Berkeley. "Now the court will probably wait to see what the country says back."
The 2002-3 term, which began Oct. 7 and ended June 26, was notable for what it did not include as well as for what it did. All speculation and preparation to the contrary, there were no retirements.
These were the term's major rulings. The court's Web site, www.supremecourtus.gov, provides the full text of all decisions.

Equality
In striking down criminal sodomy laws in a case from Texas, the court issued a stunning declaration of constitutional liberty for gay men and lesbians. While the political, social and legal ramifications of the 6-to-3 decision may take years to play out, there was no doubt that Lawrence v. Texas, No. 02-102, was a constitutional watershed.
Justice Kennedy's majority opinion, overturning the court's 1986 decision in Bowers v. Hardwick and declaring that gays are "entitled to respect for their private lives" as a matter of constitutional due process, was joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer. Justice O'Connor concurred separately in an opinion based on the guarantee of equal protection. Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Thomas dissented.
The court preserved affirmative action in university admissions, upholding by a 5-to-4 vote the "holistic" and "individualized" approach used by the University of Michigan Law School. Justice O'Connor's majority opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger, No. 02-241, found that the program, both in its operation and in its diversity rationale, comported with the controlling opinion by Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. in the Bakke case 25 years ago. The majority expressed the expectation that affirmative action would no longer be needed 25 years from now. Chief Justice Rehnquist dissented, along with Justices Kennedy, Scalia, and Thomas.
The University of Michigan's affirmative action program for its undergraduate college was unconstitutional, the court ruled by a 6-to-3 vote, because its awarding of 20 points on a 150-point admissions scale to black, Hispanic and American-Indian applicants was too mechanistic and quota-like. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote for the majority in Gratz v. Bollinger, No. 02-516, joined by Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, Scalia and Thomas. Justice Breyer concurred separately. Justices Ginsburg and Souter, who dissented, would have upheld the policy, while the third dissenter, Justice Stevens, said only that he believed the court lacked jurisdiction over the case.
In an important voting rights case, the court endorsed a new approach to racial redistricting, permitting consideration of overall minority influence in the political process, beyond the actual number of minority voters in a particular district. The 5-to-4 decision in a case from Georgia gave ammunition to Democrats who, in alliances between black and white politicians, are trying to "unpack" black voters from districts with black super-majorities in order to give Democrats a better chance of recapturing suburban districts that Republicans drew in the 1990's for the purpose of electing white Republicans.
Justice O'Connor wrote the majority opinion in Georgia v. Ashcroft, No. 02-182, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia, Kennedy and Thomas. The dissenters agreed with the majority in principle but warned in an opinion by Justice Souter that the majority opinion could prove insufficiently protective of black voting power. 
A unanimous decision made it easier for workers to win discrimination suits against employers in cases where race, sex, religion or national origin is one factor among others in a dismissal or other adverse job action. Direct evidence of discrimination is not necessary in these so-called "mixed motive" cases, and circumstantial evidence is sufficient to show that discrimination was a "motivating factor," Justice Thomas wrote for the court in Desert Palace v. Costa, No. 02-679.

Criminal Law
A pair of decisions upheld California's three-strikes law that imposes long sentences for a third offense, even a nonviolent property crime. The defendant in Ewing v. California, No. 01-6978, received 25 years without parole for stealing two golf clubs, while the defendant in Lockyer v. Andrade, No. 01-1127, received 50 years without parole for shoplifting children's videos on two occasions, a total of $150 worth of merchandise. By a 5-to-4 majority in both cases, the court rejected the argument that the sentences were so disproportionate to the crimes as to violate the Eighth Amendment's bar against cruel and unusual punishment. Justice O'Connor wrote the majority opinions. The dissenters were Justices Breyer, Souter, Stevens, and Ginsburg.
In two death penalty cases, a majority expressed concern that the lower federal courts were not monitoring with sufficient vigilance the quality of justice being meted out by state courts. By a vote of 8 to 1, with Justice Thomas dissenting, the court ordered the federal appeals court to grant a habeas corpus hearing to a Texas death row inmate, Thomas Miller-El, who said the selection of his jury had been infected by racial bias. Writing for the court in Miller-El v. Cockrell, No. 01-7662, Justice Kennedy said that in order to qualify for a hearing, an inmate needed to present only a plausible case and not, at that preliminary stage, a winning one.
In the second case, the court ruled that a federal appeals court should have granted a writ of habeas corpus to a Maryland death row inmate, Kevin Wiggins, on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. The 7-to-2 majority overturned the death sentence on the ground that the defense lawyers' failure to investigate and inform the jury of the childhood abuse Mr. Wiggins suffered fell below the minimum constitutional standards of competence. Justice O'Connor wrote the majority opinion in Wiggins v. Smith, No. 02-311. Justices Scalia and Thomas dissented.
The court placed strict limits on the government's ability to force mentally ill defendants to accept medication in order to become competent to stand trial. Under the court's new guidelines, forcible antipsychotic medication for a mentally ill defendant accused of anonviolent crime -- in this case, a dentist, Dr. Charles T. Sell, charged with Medicaid and mail fraud -- "may be rare," Justice Breyer wrote for the 6-to-3 majority in Sell v. United States, No. 02-5664. Justices Scalia, O'Connor and Thomas dissented.
The court rejected two constitutional challenges to the Megan's Law sex offender notification and registration statutes that all 50 states have enacted in the last decade.
In one case, the court held by a vote of 9 to 0 that Connecticut did not need to provide offenders with individual hearings before posting their photographs and information on its Internet registry. A federal appeals court had ruled that the offenders had a due process right to hearings at which they could try to show that they did not present a threat to the community. But Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote for the court in Connecticut v. Doe, No. 01-1231, that rather than predicting dangerousness, the registry simply listed offenders and their conviction records and did not raise a due process issue.
The court also ruled 6 to 3 that Alaska's application of its Megan's Law to those whose convictions for sex crimes predated the law's passage did not violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto legislation. The Ex Post Facto Clause bars retroactive punishments, but Megan's Laws impose not punishment but a "civil, nonpunitive regime," Justice Kennedy wrote for the court in Smith v. Doe, No. 01-729. The dissenters were Justices Stevens, Ginsburg and Breyer.
The court addressed the ex post facto prohibition in a second case, ruling that the government cannot retroactively apply a newly extended statute of limitations to those for whom the original statute -- and any prospect of legal liability -- had already expired. The 5-to-4 decision, Stogner v. California, No. 01-1757, limited a California law that sought to revive liability for long-ago sex crimes and could have nationwide impact on child molestation cases. Justice Breyer wrote the majority opinion and Justices Kennedy, Scalia, Thomas and Chief Justice Rehnquist dissented.
The court voted 9 to 0 to uphold restrictions imposed by the Michigan prison system on the right of inmates to receive visits from family members and acquaintances. An inmate who commits two violations of the prison's drug or alcohol rules loses all family visiting privileges for at least two years. Justice Kennedy wrote for the court in Overton v. Bazzetta, No. 02-94, that the restrictions were rationally related to prison administration needs.
In a unanimous interpretation of a federal law that makes it a crime for a convicted felon to own a gun, the court held that federal judges do not have authority to restore the right to gun ownership. Congress had stripped that authority from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms after finding abuses 11 years ago, and the question in United States v. Bean, No. 01-704, was whether sympathetic judges could do an end run around the ban by granting relief themselves. Justice Thomas wrote the opinion.
The court overturned a federal racketeering judgment against a coalition of anti-abortion groups that conducted a campaign of disrupting and blockading abortion clinics in the 1980's. The National Organization for Women and two abortion clinics had brought a successful suit for damages and an injunction based on the Hobbs Act, which outlaws obstructing commerce "by robbery or extortion."
But by an 8-to-1 vote, the court said that while the protesters' behavior might well have amounted to coercion, which the Hobbs Act does not cover, it didnot fit the legal definition of extortion, which requires actually obtaining another's property by force or threat. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote for the court in Scheidler v. National Organization for Women, No. 01-1118, while Justice Stevens dissented.

Federal Authority
In an unexpected turn in the court's federalism revolution, the court ruled that states can be sued for violating their employees' federally guaranteed right to take time off for family emergencies. With an opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, the court voted 6 to 3 to reject Nevada's claim of constitutional immunity from suit under the Family and Medical Leave Act. The dissenters in Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs, No. 01-1368, were Justices Kennedy, Scalia, and Thomas.
The court upheld the mandatory detention provisions of a 1996 immigration law, ruling by a vote of 5 to 4 that the government can imprison immigrants it is seeking to deport without first giving them a chance to show that they present neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community. The case, Demore v. Kim, No. 01-1491, did not deal with terrorism but rather with a category of lawful permanent residents convicted of drug offenses and other "aggravated" offenses. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion, joined by Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, Scalia and Thomas.
The court overturned a California law that required insurance companies doing business in the state to produce the names of policyholders who bought coverage from the insurers' Europe-based parent companies between 1920 and 1945. The law was intended to help Holocaust survivors and their descendants receive payment on the policies. 
The 5-to-4 decision in American Insurance Association v. Garamendi, No. 02-722, held that the state law conflicted with the federal government's authority to conduct foreign policy. The government has been encouraging negotiation rather than litigation to resolve the Holocaust-era insurance problem. Justice Souter wrote the majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and by Justices O'Connor, Kennedy and Breyer.

Business
In a significant term for business cases, the most important decision for many businesses was probably one that placed new limits on punitive damages. On a 6-to-3 vote, the court overturned the $145 million in punitive damages awarded by a Utah jury against the State Farm insurance company, which had exposed a policyholder to personal liability by initially refusing to settle a claim in an automobile accident case.
The jury also awarded $1 million in compensatory damages. Justice Kennedy's majority opinion, finding the 145:1 ratio "irrational and arbitrary," set new guidelines for punitive damages: neither a defendant's wealth nor its conduct outside the state's borders should ordinarily be considered, and there should be only a small ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages, perhaps as low as 1:1. Justices Scalia, Thomas and Ginsburg dissented in State Farm v. Campbell, No. 01-1289. 
It was also an important term for intellectual property. The court upheld the 20-year extension that Congress granted in 1998 to all existing copyrights, ruling 7 to 2 that while the Copyright Term Extension Act might not be good public policy, it came within Congress's explicit constitutional authority. The 7-to-2 decision in Eldred v. Ashcroft, No. 01-618, with a majority opinion by Justice Ginsburg, was a major victory for Hollywood studios and other big corporate copyright holders. Justices Stevens and Breyer dissented.
A trademark dispute between the Victoria's Secret retail empire and Victor's Little Secret, a Kentucky shop selling sex toys, produced the court's first interpretation of a new law intended to protect famous brand names from copycat uses that dilute their impact in the marketplace. The court ruled unanimously that while the famous trademark owner does not have to show actual economic damage in order to win a case under the Federal Trademark Dilution Act, it does have to prove some form of current harm, such as a blurring of a distinctive identity. Justice Stevens wrote the opinion in Mosely v. V Secret Catalogue Inc., No. 01-1015.
A ruling on managed health care unanimously upheld Kentucky's "any willing provider" law that requires managed care plans to accept any qualified doctor who wants to be a participating provider. About half the states have such laws, which the court in Kentucky Association of Health Plans v. Miller, No. 00-1471, found were not pre-empted by the federal law that regulates employer benefit plans.
In another health care case, the court gave qualified approval to Maine's innovative effort to reduce prescription drug prices for uninsured state residents. The 6-to-3 decision lifted an injunction against the Maine Rx program, under which the state assumes the role of a pharmacy benefits manager and presses drug manufacturers to grant price rebates. In a splintered set of opinions, Justice Stevens wrote for the court on most aspects of the issue in Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America v. Walsh, No. 01-188. Justices O'Connor and Kennedy, along with Chief Justice Rehnquist, filed a partial dissent.
In a decision at the intersection of bankruptcy and telecommunications law, the court ruled 8 to 1 that the Federal Communications Commission had improperly canceled the valuable wireless communications licenses that a bankrupt company had won at auction and then could not pay for. It was a huge victory for a startup company, NextWave Telecom, which got back the licenses for which it had initially agreed to pay $4.74 billion before defaulting after an initial $500 million downpayment. 
The decision, Federal Communications Commission v. NextWave Personal Communications Inc., No. 01-653, held that the company should have been given a chance to work out a new payment schedule under federal bankruptcy protection. Justice Scalia wrote the majority opinion and Justice Breyer dissented.
In a decision on employers' liability for damages for workers' exposure to asbestos, the court ruled 5 to 4 that some workers who have developed asbestos-related but noncancerous disease can recover damages based on their "genuine and serious" fear of eventually developing cancer.
The decision, Norfolk & Western Railway Co. v. Ayers, No. 01-963, was a disappointment to a broad swath of businesses that had expected to enlist the court in addressing the asbestos liability issue. In an unusual alignment, Justice Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion, joined by Justices Stevens, Scalia, Souter, and Thomas. Justice Kennedy dissented, joined by Justices O'Connor and Breyer and by Chief Justice Rehnquist.

Free Speech
The justices decided five First Amendment cases and -- unusually for this speech-protective court -- rejected the constitutional claim in all five.
By a vote of 6 to 3, the court upheld the Children's Internet Protection Act, which requires public libraries to install antipornography filters on all computers providing Internet access, as a condition of receiving federal subsidies and grants. Librarians may unblock certain sites at the request of adult patrons, but because the law had been blocked from taking effect, it is unclear how it will work in practice. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote a plurality opinion for himself and Justices O'Connor, Thomas and Scalia, while Justices Kennedy and Breyer concurred on narrower grounds. Justices Stevens, Souter and Ginsburg dissented in United States v. American Library Association, No. 02-361.
In striking down a Virginia cross-burning statute, the court ruled that states may make it a crime to burn a cross as long as the law clearly gives prosecutors the burden of proving that the act was intended as a threat and not as a form of symbolic expression. The First Amendment permits the government to single out cross-burning as a "particularly virulent form of intimidation," Justice O'Connor wrote for the court in Virginia v. Black, No. 01-1107. The dissenters, Justices Souter, Ginsburg and Kennedy, objected that the decision permitted the state to single out one especially potent symbol for criminal treatment.
In a campaign finance case, the court upheld the longstanding ban on direct corporate contributions to candidates in federal elections. The 7-to-2 majority refused to create an exception permitting unlimited contributions by corporations organized for the purpose of ideological advocacy. While the ruling was not directly related to the major new campaign finance law, the constitutionality of which will be argued before the court in a special session on Sept. 8, some of the new law's supporters were encouraged by the decision in Federal Election Commission v. Beaumont, No. 02-403. Justice Souter wrote the majority opinion while Justices Thomas and Scalia dissented.
The court rejected a telemarketer's First Amendment challenge to a state consumer-fraud prosecution, ruling unanimously that charitable solicitations that include deliberate misrepresentations about what proportion of the money raised will actually go to the charity can be prosecuted as fraud. But wrongdoing cannot be inferred from the bare fact of high fund-raising costs, Justice Ginsburg said for the court in Illinois v. Telemarketing Associates, Inc., No. 01-1806.
The court ruled unanimously that a policy limiting access to a public housing project in Richmond, Va., was not unconstitutional on its face just because it had the potential for chilling free speech on the premises by nonresidents. Justice Scalia wrote for the court in Virginia v. Hicks, No. 02-371, that someone whose speech was actually restricted by the policy could challenge it in a subsequent lawsuit.
Finally, an important commercial speech case fizzled unexpectedly on the final day of the term when the court dismissed Nike's appeal in a California case imposing potential liability on the company for supposed misstatements in support of its overseas employment practices. The fact that the suit against Nike had not yet gone to trial evidently persuaded the court that the case, Nike v. Kasky, No. 02-575, was not yet appropriate for decision. Justices Breyer, O'Connor, and Kennedy dissented from the dismissal.

Property Rights
The court upheld a nationwide program that channels millions of dollars every year to legal services for the poor by pooling the interest earned on short-term deposits that lawyers hold in trust for their clients. Every state has a local version of the Interest on Lawyers' Trust Accounts program, known as Iolta, long a target of a conservative legal group here, the Washington Legal Foundation, which argued that the program amounted to an unconstitutional "taking" of clients' private property. The 5-to-4 decision found there was no taking because individual clients could not earn net interest on such small short-term deposits. Justice Stevens wrote the majority opinion in Brown v. Legal Foundation of Washington, No. 02-1325. Justices Scalia, Thomas, Kennedy, and Chief Justice Rehnquist dissented.

HEADLINE: Court Halts a Bid by Intel to Stop E-Mail 

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
The California Supreme Court ruled yesterday that a former employee of Intel was free to send e-mail messages to current company employees, overturning a lower court's injunction. The court rejected Intel's argument that the messages represented illegal trespassing to its computer systems.
 That argument is increasingly used by companies and Internet service providers in the fight against spam, or unsolicited commercial e-mail. 
 "Everyone is trying to figure out ways to solve the spam problem, and this ruling doesn't help," said Jeffrey D. Neuburger, a technology lawyer with Brown Raysman Millstein Felder & Steiner in New York. "This is going to require lawyers to come up with other ways to deal with the issue." 
The case also attracted the attention of those interested in free-speech rights of current and former corporate employees. But the California court ultimately ruled only on the trespass issue.
The case involved Kenneth Hamidi, a former Intel engineer, who had been fired after a dispute related to workers' compensation. He sent six e-mail messages from 1996 to 1998 to a list of Intel employees, criticizing the company and encouraging the employees to visit a Web site he created (faceintel.com) with information critical of Intel.
In 1998, Intel received an injunction barring Mr. Hamidi, who now works for the State of California, from sending more messages to Intel employees. The injunction was upheld by an appeals court in 2001. Intel's argument rests on a little used doctrine of common law called trespass to chattels, which allows someone to sue for damages resulting from the inappropriate use of personal property, as distinct from the more common case of trespass to real estate. The doctrine was applied to e-mail messages in a landmark federal ruling in 1977, CompuServe Inc. v. Cyber Promotions, which held that spam could be considered trespass because it misappropriated the company's computer system.
In a 4-to-3 ruling, the California Supreme Court said that doctrine did not apply to Mr. Hamidi's e-mail messages because they did not damage its computers or impose a significant cost on the company.
Mr. Hamidi "no more invaded Intel's property than does a protester holding a sign or shouting through a bullhorn outside corporate headquarters, posting a letter through the mail, or telephoning to complain of a corporate practice," wrote Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar, in the majority opinion.
In a dissent, Justice Janice Rogers Brown wrote that "Intel suffered not merely an affront to its dignitary interest in ownership but tangible economic loss," especially to its employees' time. "Even if it takes little time to determine the author of a message and then delete it, this process, multiplied hundreds of thousands of times, amounts to a substantial loss of employee time," she wrote.
William M. McSwain, a lawyer in the Philadelphia office of Dechert, who argued on behalf of Mr. Hamidi, said the case did not impede the fight against spam.
"Spam needs a legislative approach," he said. "And Congress and half the state legislatures are hard at work finding one. What spam doesn't need is to have the courts create a new tort doctrine in a way that has unintended consequences."
But the ruling does preserve what he called an important right of one person to send an unsolicited e-mail message to another person.
"It reaffirms the principle that an unsolicited message, sent by a business or an individual, is not presumptively a trespass simply because the recipient doesn't want to receive the message," he said.
Because the California court did not address the constitutional free speech issues that had been raised, the case is not likely to be appealed into the federal courts.
Chuck Mulloy, an Intel spokesman, said the company was "evaluating the ruling to determine what steps we will take should Mr. Hamidi start spamming again."
Mr. McSwain said he did not know whether Mr. Hamidi intended to send more e-mail messages to Intel employees. Mr. Hamidi's site remains active. 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 9, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on July 1 about a California Supreme Court ruling on the right of a former Intel employee to send unsolicited e-mail to current employees misstated the date of a federal court ruling on spam, CompuServe Inc. v. Cyber Promotions. It was 1997, not 1977.

HEADLINE: THE CHEF: CHRIS SCHLESINGER; 
Barbecue? You Could Do It in Your Sleep

BYLINE:  By SAM SIFTON

DATELINE: WESTPORT, Mass. 

 BODY:
CHRIS SCHLESINGER was snoring softly on the couch. This was in the living room of his sprawling ranch house here in southeastern Massachusetts, nestled high above a pebbly beach. A Bill Murray movie was playing on the television in the corner, and the cool breeze sliding off Buzzards Bay had dampened the room, covering the warmth of the day. Outside on the sweeping deck, in a giant ovoid kettle grill, three pork butts sat in the smoky braise of a small oak fire, glistening, ruddy, plump. It was well after midnight. Seven hours' cooking done. Seven hours to go.
 The snoring came to an abrupt stop as someone in the room moved to open a sliding door and go check the fire. 
 "Barbecue Man may appear to be asleep," Mr. Schlesinger roared, climbing off the couch. "But Barbecue Man is always awake and in control!" 
He padded barefoot to the deck and placed his palm on the covered grill. "Barbecue is such a typical guy thing to do," he said. "Much ado about nothing." He lifted the kettle top and a cloud of fragrant, oaky smoke engulfed him. He laughed from within it. "But it is intense."
Mr. Schlesinger, 47, is the chef and an owner of the East Coast Grill in Cambridge, Mass., which he opened in 1985. He is also the author, with John Willoughby, of six cookbooks that relate somehow to the pleasures of fire. (Two others celebrate pickles and lettuce, respectively.) 
Their latest, "Let the Flames Begin" (Norton), was published in 2002 and rereleased this year. There is an electric stove in his kitchen, which he rarely uses. He prefers to cook outside.
The plan was to make an American holiday meal, or at least the part that could be made on a grill, overnight, for lunchtime celebration the following day. The menu: North Carolina-style pulled pork sandwiches, with their characteristic vinegary sauce, on cheap hamburger buns. You might accompany these with a simple preparation of coleslaw or some salad (Mark Bittman offers some recipes with his column, The Minimalist, on Page 3) and a load of cut watermelon.
To make the sandwiches, you simply pull -- or tear, really -- shreds of meat from slow-roasted shoulder of hog, which is known among butchers and barbecue aficionados as pork butt, and place these on a bun with some sauce. (A hog's rear quarters are called, conversely and somewhat more attractively, hams.) The cooking time for the pork may exceed 12 hours, but you could start after work tomorrow and easily be done in time for a Fourth of July lunch with little effort beyond getting up a few times in the night to tend the fire. (For those leery of sleeping while fire burns bright, the meat could be cooked throughout the day and enjoyed as a late dinner about the same time the holiday fireworks wrap up, or even refrigerated until the following day, to be reheated in the oven.)
Mr. Schlesinger's fire started slowly. About 6 p.m., he poured a pile of hardwood charcoal about the size of a large box of cereal into the front of the grill's firebox and added to it a generous, unapologetic spray of lighter fluid. "I don't have a problem with this stuff," he said. "I want to get my fire going." When gray ash began to appear on the edges of the charcoal, he placed on it a large piece of dry oak, which popped and crackled in the heat.
Mr. Schlesinger's grill is a Weber Ranch kettle a yard across. Behind the fire was almost two feetof open grill space, plenty for the three pork butts he planned to cook. (A conventional grill has less space, but plenty for a single butt.) The meat would cook slowly in heat that would not often, Mr. Schlesinger estimated, exceed 212 degrees. "You want to melt the fat into the meat," he said. "You don't want to incinerate it."
To protect the butts during the cooking, Mr. Schlesinger used a dry rub of spices that adhered to the pork and seized up in the heat, creating a flavorful crust. To make it, he mixed generous amounts of brown sugar, dry mustard, ground coriander, cumin, cayenne, paprika, chili pepper, freshly ground black pepper and sea salt in a bowl.
When he was finished he set the rub aside and pulled the pork from his refrigerator.
"There's no extra benefit in letting this meat come to room temperature before cooking it," he said. "I don't like to take chances with bacteria." He cut the butts out of their packaging with a small knife and rinsed the meat in the kitchen sink. "Likewise," he explained.
Outside, the charcoal fire was dying down and the oak smoking furiously. Mr. Schlesinger placed the three butts in a large disposable aluminum-foil pan on a table next to the grill and, using his hands, slathered them with the dry rub.
"It's O.K. if it's a little wet," he said. "It gets pasty, and that helps spread the rub around." 
One by one he placed the butts on the grill, fatty side down, well away from the fire. "I'll turn them later," he said. "In about eight hours." He slid the kettle top onto the grill and adjusted the top vents. Smoke rose into the air from them in a steady stream. 
"It's running a little hot," Mr. Schlesinger said. "But the one time you're not going to be overcooking a butt is now, at the beginning." He looked down at the smoke for a while, silently watching it rise.
"Let's get some dinner," he said.
Mr. Schlesinger checked his fire again at 9:30 p.m., adding another piece of oak, and then retreated to the living room with a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon to watch television. "Groundhog Day," the 1993 movie in which Mr. Murray experiences the same day over and over, had started on TBS at 8 o'clock. This morphed, at 10:20, into "Ghostbusters" (1984), in which Mr. Murray plays a parapsychology professor with a ghost-removal business. (Mr. Schlesinger added another log to the fire at 11:40.) "Stripes," the 1981 movie in which an unemployed Mr. Murray joins the Army to meet girls and have a good time, got under way at 12:35 a.m. An hour later, Mr. Schlesinger reluctantly abandoned the narrative to add more charcoal to the fire, at which point he turned the butts over. More charcoal went on just after 3 a.m. On the television, "Ghostbusters" was playing again.
Between these chores, Mr. Schlesinger said, it only appeared that he was dozing.
At 8 a.m., with the sun beginning to dry the dew that had gathered on the deck during the night, Mr. Schlesinger declared the cooking complete, 14 hours after it had begun. "Feel that," he said, pressing his finger into one of the butts. It felt like a ripe peach, or a late-summer tomato. "Done," he said. 
With tongs in his left hand and using his right hand for balance, moving carefully so as not to tear the skin, he pulled the butts, which now had the color and texture of redwood logs, off the grill and placed them back in the disposable aluminum-foil pan, which he had cleaned the night before.
"We'll let those rest," he said, and went to the kitchen to get the sauce: a cup of white vinegar, a cup of cider vinegar, a tablespoon of sugar and a not inconsiderable dash of Tabasco sauce, mixed together in a bowl.
"We'll let those butts rest all morning," Mr. Schlesinger continued. "They'll be perfect for lunch."
But he soon pulled some hamburger buns out of a plastic bag and moved back to the porch. With his tongs, he picked up the largest of the butts by one end. It tore under its own weight, releasing a small cloud of steam. The smell was incomparable: sweet, smoky and fine.
He tore off a sliver of meat and tasted it, then smiled.
"I was a little nervous," Mr. Schlesinger said. "You always get nervous, even when you know it's going to be good." 
He pulled some more meat off the butt and placed it on a bun. Breakfast was served.

HEADLINE: Fear of Recession Fading In Japan Business Survey 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 1 

 BODY:
Pessimism about the Japanese economy is slowly fading, a central bank survey of business executives showed today, as manufacturers prepare for an increase in orders from overseas for their cars, electronics and machinery.
 The Bank of Japan's quarterly "tankan" report suggests that concerns about the world's second-largest economy sliding into recession are overblown. Though the large manufacturers that typically drive economic recoveries here remain wary, they are quietly raising their profit and capital spending goals. 
 The poll's index of major manufacturers rose five points to minus 5, which means pessimists still outnumbered optimists but by a smaller margin. The companies' financial outlooks were stronger than the predictions of private economists, who expected confidence to slip.
The improvement, however mild, comes as disruptions from the SARS virus and the war in Iraq fade, while oil prices slide and stock prices extend a two-month rally. The United States economy is also improving, good news for exporters like Honda Motor, the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company and other companies that earn most of their profits overseas.
While corporate managers expect no improvement in confidence by the time of the next survey in September, manufacturers raised their pretax profit forecasts for the fiscal year that began in April. Some of that progress comes as companies reduce their payrolls, close factories and streamline balance sheets.
But manufacturers are also preparing for new sales by planning to invest more in factories and operations. Large manufacturers, for instance, expect their capital spending to increase 11.5 percent this year.
"The economy is still at the mercy of exports," said Ryo Hino, an economist at J. P. Morgan Securities in Tokyo. "But the numbers suggest that the momentum is stronger than we thought."
Japan's chief financial regulator, Heizo Takenaka, said the survey's results were within expectations, while the finance minister, Masajuro Shiokawa, saidthe improvement at large manufacturers was "an honest reflection" of their restructuring efforts.
Investors viewed today's news as a bullish sign for the economy. The Nikkei 225 stock index rose 2.2 percent to 9,278, a nine-month high. The dollar slipped against the yen after the report was released, but later recouped its losses.
The tankan's optimism was seconded by a separate report that showed new car sales rising 2.6 percent in June, the ninth gain in 10 months.
Though Japan's $4.2 trillion economy is showing signs of life, the recovery is far from robust. Domestic sales remain sluggish, and residents face a difficult job market, falling incomes and higher taxes.
The main culprit is deflation, or falling prices. While price declines help consumers in search of cheaper goods, they hurt the companies that make those products. 
To compensate, companies must reduce hiring and cut other fixed costs.
The worst-hit companies are those that compete with low-cost producers from China, South Korea and other Asian countries. While demand for cellphones, personal digital assistants and other electronics are strong, the prices of the components packed into these machines remain weak.
"I don't think prices will improve this year because of the macroeconomy," said Yoshihide Fujii, executive vice president in charge of semiconductors at Toshiba, Japan's largest chipmaker. "We have only one choice: To cut costs to cope with this."
Though the government has put together several antideflation spending packages and the Bank of Japan has followed an ultra-loose monetary policy for several years, prices are locked in their fifth year of decline.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
Theater's Promise? Look Off Broadway

BYLINE:  By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
With all its grandeur and extravagance, "La Boheme" closed out its Broadway run on Sunday, making an early exit after all the hoopla attending its arrival last fall. Oh, well. Everybody knows what a crapshoot Broadway is. You can't make a living, but you can make a killing. So there won't be another opera staged as a big-budget musical for a while.
 But out of the spotlight -- that is, Off Broadway -- another musical closed on Sunday, after barely more than a three-month run. The show cost its producer, Jack Dalgleish, only $1 million or so (only!), about a sixth of the loss accrued by "La Boheme." But its short life and recent death, not to mention its almost certain resurrection -- in New York, elsewhere or both -- says a great deal about the future of American theater. 
 You may not have even heard of the show. It was "Zanna, Don't!," a candy-flavored and fizzy but surprisingly nutritious work about a fantasy high school where being gay is the norm, and heterosexuals are a closeted minority. It is an entirely original work; its score, book and lyrics were written by a young man named Tim Acito. And it was emblematic of an Off Broadway season that may have been financially calamitous but was artistically the best I've seen in 10 years of covering theater. 
Its weekly expenses were $60,000 -- about a tenth of what it cost to run "La Boheme" -- in the 287-seat John Houseman Theater. And like other original Off Broadway shows with strong reviews that will also close over the next few weeks -- "The Last Sunday in June," "Our Lady of 121st Street" and "Hank Williams: Lost Highway" -- "Zanna" hemorrhaged cash. 
"We were losing $10,000 to $40,000 a week from the beginning," Mr. Dalgleish said. "We never had a break-even week." 
His conclusion? 
"There's not really an Off Broadway audience anymore. Off Broadway is broken, and no one knows how to fix it."
Is this fair? Well, there's a grain of salt to take with Mr. Dalgleish's remark. For one thing, it seems safe to say that in the long history of the theater, no producer of any kind -- Broadway, Off Broadway or regional; commercial or nonprofit -- has ever conceded that economic conditions were favorable for putting on a show. For another thing, Off Broadway is where almost all the promising work was in New York this season. 
On Broadway, led by a few megahits like "Mamma Mia!," "Hairspray" and "The Lion King," total box office receipts were more than $700 million for the first time. But the total of new American plays was five, and that's only if you consider "Say Goodnight Gracie" an American play, given that it's about George Burns, even though it was written by a Briton, Rupert Holmes; and only if you count "Enchanted April" as an original play, even though it was adapted from both a novel and a film. The only play of any literary consequence was Richard Greenberg's "Take Me Out," which appeared first at the Joseph Papp Public Theater: Off Broadway.
New musicals were sparse and lame. After "Hairspray" last August, the drop-off was precipitous. Seven other new musicals opened on Broadway, which included three without original scores, not to mention "Dance of the Vampires."
Off Broadway meanwhile teemed with invention. Partly this has to do with economic reality; it simply costs less to put on a show Off Broadway, so the risks are smaller and the fund-raising is less onerous. For example, one veteran producer, Robert Cole, who has a new play, "Omnium Gatherum" by Theresa Rebeck and Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros, opening at the Variety Arts in the early fall, said it would cost him about $800,000 to put the show on. In a Broadway theater, he said, with the same cast of eight, the cost would rise to $1.8 million to $2 million. 
But partly it's also about sheer creative energy. There are no real records kept as far as number of shows opened, how long they ran or how much money they made. A feeble umbrella organization, the League of Off Broadway Theaters and Producers, has no permanent staff or office space and a membership that reflects the shoestring quality of the business as a whole.
Besides, as the league's volunteer president, Marc Routh, explained, producers have a collective bargaining agreement with only 3 of the 17 unions that the Broadway league must deal with. He also said that the availability of more extensive data could well lead to labor complications, so there was a disincentive to find the money to keep such records.
It's also true that what constitutes Broadway is easy to delineate; it's a universe of 39 specified theaters, which all have at least 500 seats. Off Broadway is generally considered to comprise theaters from 99 to 499 seats (anything less is thought of as Off Off), which ostensibly determines the union contracts for actors, directors and press agents. But given the variety of auditoriums around the city and the companies that perform in them, that distinction is neither entirely fair nor useful. What is fair to say is that hundreds of professional shows are produced every year in New York City somewhere other than Broadway. 
Though I'm probably as attentive as anyone, I've seen only a fraction of them. Even so, a list I compiled of shows that opened since last fall Off Broadway and that I would recommend to anyone has 26 names on it, including "Zanna, Don't!," 4 other new musicals and 15 new plays, as well as 7 revivals of dusted-over gems like "The Blacks" by Jean Genet (produced by the Classical Theater of Harlem), "The Daughter-in-Law" by D. H. Lawrence (Mint Theater) and "High Priest of California" by Charles Willeford (29th Street Rep) that would no doubt otherwise be lost to New Yorkers.
And yet, as Mr. Dalgleish, Mr. Routh and several other commercial producers said, everyone lost money. (With charitable giving down in a diminished economy, nonprofit theaters have their own set of complaints.)
"It's been a loss of basically everything," said Ted Snowden, the producer of "The Last Sunday in June," a shrewd and funny play about gay attitudes and stereotypes that is set in Greenwich Village on the day of the annual gay pride parade. Mr. Snowden has kept the show open an extra week, through Saturday, he said, because he couldn't bear to close it on the last Sunday in June. 
In April he moved the show from the tiny Rattlestick Theater to the Century Center and tried to make it a commercial success.
"We really did bring it in under budget, and we had a large reserve," Mr. Snowden said, estimating his losses at $650,000. "We had good reviews. We had good word of mouth. Things were climbing in April but took a dive in May. I really don't know why."
The glass-half-empty interpretation of all this is that new plays and musicals are doomed, that even good work produced in theaters with a reduced risk factor is not being supported by the public, that there's no sufficient audience. 
I prefer to subscribe to the glass-half-full interpretation: isn't it amazing how much good theater is being produced under such economic constraints? Artists do, in fact, perform beautifully under duress. 
And for all their moaning, producers are essentially believers, with the persistent outlook that there are more worthy shows out there than places to put them. Otherwise how do you explain the current construction of new Off Broadway theaters on West 50th Street by Dodger Theatricals and on West 37th Street by Alan Schuster? How do you explain that Mr. Dalgleish, who has a reasonable expectation of earning his money back in licensing agreements and other ancillary income streams like CD sales, is seriously considering the idea of moving "Zanna, Don't!" to Broadway, at an additional cost of some $6 million or $7 million?
"Optimism is a necessity in this business," said Mr. Routh, whose last Off Broadway venture was "My Old Lady," a three-character play by Israel Horovitz that cost $900,000 to produce at the Promenade Theater and didn't earn it back. "Otherwise you just want to shoot yourself."
It wouldn't hurt if city leaders, in addition to encouraging tourists to visit Broadway, would occasionally steer them elsewhere and also remind New Yorkers of the more affordable theater available in their own neighborhoods. 
But even operating in what sometimes seems like a self-contained bubble, theater people, I've discovered, are the cockroaches of the entertainment business. I say this with all admiration and affection; you can't kill them off. They endure. And happily they even thrive. 

So Who Needs Big Budgets?

HEADLINE: 2 Artists Follow Muses to Success in Argentina 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, July 1 

 BODY:
When the singer and songwriter Kevin Johansen moved back here in 2000 after living for a decade in New York, all his Argentine friends were aghast. "Why are you here?" he recalls them asking incredulously. "Are you crazy?"
 True, it would be another year before the economy here would collapse and five presidents would hold office during two weeks of political chaos. But the warning signs were already discernible, and Argentines were leaving the country in search of opportunities abroad, not returning to settle down. 
 "Talk about timing," Mr. Johansen, 39, says now. "But I needed a breather from New York, I am married to an Argentine and I realized that I can write songs anywhere, so I thought, 'Let's try it and see what happens.' " 
Three years later Mr. Johansen, an American, has a hit CD in Argentina called "Sur o No Sur." He is being singled out by critics here for his inventive lyrics, and he has just finished a successful national tour that culminated in a sold-out show at a theater on what he calls "the Broadway of Buenos Aires." On Thursday he is scheduled to perform a solo set at CB's 313 Gallery, at 313 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, next to CBGB in the East Village, and then he is to join his band, the Nada, later this month to tour in Spain.
To his utter surprise that CD's most popular track is a quirky pop ballad in English, "Down With My Baby," which he describes as "Barry White and Leonard Cohen meet Nirvana." Chosen as the love theme for "Resistire," or "I Will Resist," a popular prime-time soap opera here, his song is played constantly on the radio and in nightclubs, and when he played it at his recent Buenos Aires show, audience members sang along.
Mr. Johansen is not the only American enjoying artistic success here after having cast his lot with this country in crisis. A highly praised novel published in Argentina recently is "Flores de un Solo Dia," or "Flowers of a Single Day," by Anna Kazumi Stahl, a Louisiana native, also 39, who first arrived here 15 years ago not speaking a word of Spanish, and now, like Mr. Johansen, writes in that language.
Even more curious is that though Mr. Johansen and Ms. Stahl do not know each other, their work addresses many of the same issues. Both, as might be expected of emigres working in a country and a language not initially their own, are fascinated by what Ms. Stahl describes as "the experience and sensation of national identity and belonging."
"Flores de un Solo Dia" is the story of Aimee Levrier, who owns a flower shop here, and her mother, a Japanese-born ikebana artist who is mute. Their orderly, settled life is thrown into confusion when Aimee is notified of an inheritance, which forces her to go to New Orleans to confront the carefully hidden secrets of her family's dark, tangled past.
Writing in La Razon, a national newspaper, the critic Luis de la Pena said that Ms. Stahl "shows herself to be an extraordinary narrator in Spanish." The novelist and critic Ricardo Piglia compared her to Vladimir Nabokov, commending her for having achieved "the feat of being transparent and mysterious" and showing a "mastery of the poetics of estrangement."
Ms. Stahl teaches American and world literature for a joint program with Lincoln University College and Gen. San Martin National University here and has worked as a translator. "I guess that what I'm trying to talk about more than anything else is the question of the components of identity and how we end up putting them together," she said. "I'm interested in the stories of people who choose to leave and install themselves somewhere else -- how you do that, why you do it and whether you can do it."
Mr. Johansen, born in Alaska to an American father and an Argentine mother, addresses those same issues directly in the title track of "Sur o no Sur," a pun derived from Hamlet's soliloquy that Mr. Johansen translates as "To South or not to South." As a violin plays mournfully in the background, he sings of displacement and longing:
I leave because I can't make it here
I come back because there is no hope
I leave because here they take advantage of me
I come back because there they throw me out
I'd like to stay here at home
But I no longer know what that is.
Mr. Johansen's parents divorced before he was in grade school, and he lived with his mother, a literature teacher, in San Francisco in the early 1970's. But he spent his teenage years here with his mother during the brutal military dictatorship, and after high school he played in a series of rock 'n' roll bands before leaving for the United States "to reconnect with my North American roots."
During the decade he spent in New York, Mr. Johansen worked as a movie video salesman, a bartender and waiter, a bilingual tour guide at the United Nations and as a doorman at a Manhattan tango club. Like many musicians before him, he also found a home at CBGB.
Ms. Stahl's background is equally complicated, though without family ties to Argentina. Born in Shreveport, La., she grew up in New Orleans, where she spoke Japanese at home with her mother, an immigrant from Japan, and English with her father, an architect of German descent, while always "feeling slightly outside the loop" as she and her brothers shuttled from Roman Catholic school to ikebana classes to the high school track team.
"I never felt like theUnited States was 100 percent my home," she said. 
She came here in 1988 to research a graduate school thesis about writers in exile. Urged by a Spanish-language instructor to write short stories in that language, she ended up winning second place in a student competition here and was spotted by a publishing house literary evaluator. That led to "Catastrofes Naturales," her collection of short stories published in 1997.
Critics have traditionally argued that Spanish, more so than English, lends itself to a florid vocabulary and to ornate sentences. But Ms. Stahl said she finds it to be exactly the opposite: "Perhaps because I am a Southern writer" in English, she said, she is more direct and disciplined and less flamboyant, "cautious, with short sentences," when she switches to Spanish.
"Like any good Southerner, I get attached to the words and all the resonances and so everything gets a little bit embroidered," she said.
Writing in Spanish, on the other hand, "took everything away from me except primary colors," she explained, adding, "It's not that I was necessarily working on a smaller canvas than in English, but I was working with fewer elements, and therefore every stroke had to be a stroke that counted."
"Flowers of a Single Day," her first novel, was nominated for the Romulo Gallegos Prize, one the most prestigious for Spanish-language literature, and is to be published in Ms. Stahl's English translation by Harcourt next year.
Mr. Johansen, in contrast, considers himself truly bilingual and writes lyrics in English and Spanish, sometimes bouncing from one language to the other in the same song and tossing off puns as if they were party favors. But he finds it difficult to explain how he decides to pair a song with a language. 
"Usually a melody or a line of a lyric will come," he said, "but beyond that I really don't know how it happens. I always say that some day I'd like to learn a foreign language, like French or Portuguese, because the two languages, English and Spanish, are really just one for me."
Musically, Mr. Johansen also likes to mix genres, describing himself with tongue in cheek as a musical "degenreate." He has released two albums since returning here, and both are world music, with individual songs that mix Spanish flamenco with Colombian cumbia or Dominican bachata with Argentine milonga, but which also contain traces of tango, American folk music and even reggae.
Despite the severity of Argentina's national crisis, Mr. Johansen and Ms. Stahl say they intend to stay on. Mr. Johansen says he has enough songs written to make another record, and Ms. Stahl has begun a second novel, also set here, with a character who is a translator working with Japanese material.
"I didn't come down for material or economic reasons, so my project is more alive than it was before," she said. "My experience of this place is that there is always flux, and as a writer that is inspiring and energizing."

HEADLINE: WINE TALK; 
With Head Held High, Mondavi, at 90, Faces a Storm

BYLINE:  By FRANK J. PRIAL

 BODY:
HE uses a cane now, his hearing is poor and he tends to repeat himself when he's excited. But the high-pitched voice is as strong as it ever was, and the face, surely sketched from a Roman coin, still radiates the vigor and determination it must have shown half a century ago. 
 At a party for his 90th birthday at the family's winery in Oakville, Calif., last month, speaker after speaker extolled him as the founder of the fine wine business in this country, and hyperbole aside, they were right. Wine came to America with the conquistadors, but it was Robert Mondavi who first made it part of the American good life. 
 As emeritus chairman of the company that bears his name, Robert Mondavi can bask in the accolades coming his way these days, but in fact the company, unlike him, is far less vigorous than it may appear to be. Sales are down, earnings are off, wine reviews have been lukewarm, wineries and vineyards have been sold off or are for sale and workers have been let go. 
Mondavi lost $1.6 million in the third quarter, compared with net earnings of $7.6 million a year earlier. Revenues dropped 12 percent to $92.2 million in the same period. It has sold 10 percent of its vineyards and laid off 10 percent of its workers.
Michael Mondavi, Robert's son and chairman of the company, cites the weakened economy and an extraordinary glut of wine and grapes as the sources of Mondavi's problems, as they are causing problems for the entire wine industry. But the Mondavi malaise goes deeper, to longstanding family differences over the very wines they make and how they sell them. 
In unguarded moments, Robert has criticized his own sons, Michael, 59, and Tim, 51, who is vice chairman, for emphasizing the inexpensive Mondavi line, Woodbridge, over the premium wines. Woodbridge wines, which account for some 60 percent of the company's income, sell for $5 to $7, competing with wines like Charles Shaw's Two-Buck Chuck line, which sells for $2 or $3 a bottle. Mondavi's premium wines sell for up to $150 a bottle. A mid-priced range, called Robert Mondavi Coastal, has been discontinued. 
"We concentrated too much on Coastal and Woodbridge," Robert Mondavi said in a telephone interview yesterday, from Paris, were he is on vacation, "and now we're known for wines at $7 and $9 a bottle." In the mid to late 1990's, the wines were available in fine restaurants. Now, Mr. Mondavi said, it is difficult to get restaurants to offer them. "We've got to get our image back, and that's going to take time," he said. 
"We made mistakes in our public relations and marketing," he said, "but now we know the problem, we understand it and we're correcting it." But last December, in an interview with The St. Helena Star, a Napa Valley newspaper, he was more direct about who the "we" were and what their motivation was. His sons, he said, "were interested in making money, and they forgot to promote Robert Mondavi Napa Valley wines. We have to protect our tradition."
The Mondavis were particularly stung by comments about their top-of-the-line 1998 and 1999 wines by the influential critic Robert M. Parker Jr. He called them "uninspiring." From his earliest days, Mr. Mondavi strove to emulate the lean, elegant, understated wines of Bordeaux. But California is not France, and over the years a new style developed here; rich, full-bodied, easy-to-drink wines, high in alcohol and tannins. Praised by critics, especially Mr. Parker, this style has become popular worldwide, even in Bordeaux, where vintners who have adopted it are said to have been "Parkerized." 
Mondavi has resisted changing over. "We want wines that are gentle, more harmonious with food," Mr. Mondavi said in an interview at the winery before his birthday party. "Wines that Mr. Parker does not always review kindly." In fact, Mr. Parker was impressed with Mondavi's 2000 and 2001 vintages, both from a new winemaking cellar at the Oakville winery. With the 2000 vintage, Mr. Parker wrote, "this estate has come through with flying colors."
In 2001, the Mondavis engaged Mr. Parker's favorite oenologist, Michel Rolland, to advise. Mr. Rolland, based in Pomerol, in the Bordeaux region, espouses fuller, more flavorful wines. Marcia Mondavi, Mr. Mondavi's daughter and a vice president of the company, insisted that Mr. Rolland's presence was not a capitulation to the so-called California style. "He was only hired for the merlots," she said.
That a great winery must be a family winery is part of the Mondavi mantra. But family values are sharply discounted in the marketplace, and since 1993 Mondavi has been a publicly traded company. Mondavi stock, which hit a seven-year low of $18.53 after release of figures for the quarter that ended March 31, closed yesterday at $24.85.
Indifferent to Robert Mondavi the nonagenarian, Wall Street has decreed Robert Mondavi the wine business to be ripe for a takeover. In the bars at Mustard's and Tra Vigne along Route 29, Napa Valley old-timers wonder which faceless conglomerate will make the first bid. 
"The stock is selling well below book value," said Bud Leedom, who follows the wine industry for Wells Fargo Securities in San Francisco, "and their assets are formidable."
Mondavi owns six wineries and some 9,500 acres of vineyards in California. 
Since the Mondavis own some 60 percent of the stock, Mr. Leedom said, any takeover is unlikely so long as Bob Mondavi is alive. 
Good times or bad, some things never change at Robert Mondavi. Nowhere else would an interview over lunch involve six wines, culminating in a 1994 Mondavi Napa Valley Reserve cabernet. 
The lunch was served in one of the winery's reception halls, with astonished tourists looking in and wandering past the table. Some stopped to ask for autographs. "People should see what the good life is," Mr. Mondavi said, signing happily. 
There had been economic problems before, he said in the interview, in 1974 and again in the mid-1980's. He brushed them aside. "We got over that," he said. "We will again."
"We've got to get the world to realize the elegance of the wines we have here, and we have to do a better job of winemaking," he said. "We have to concentrate on our best wines because they are our tradition."
Forty years ago, Mr. Mondavi brought a level of sophistication and worldliness to the dusty Napa Valley that changed it forever. But at heart the Mondavis live by the values his parents carried here from the rugged Marches region of Central Italy. Alla famiglia is no empty toast; it's a way of life. But the dark side of familial solidarity is familial dissent, and the Mondavis have had their share of operatic "Dynasty"-style clashes.
The Robert Mondavi winery was founded in 1966 in the aftermath of a bitter dispute between Mr. Mondavi and his mother, Rosa, and brother Peter over the future of the Charles Krug winery, which the family owned. Robert Mondavi was ousted from Charles Krug and spent the next decade fighting, successfully, for his share of that business. 
Mr. Mondavi's father, Cesare, moved to the United States in 1906 to work in the iron mines of Minnesota. He returned to Italy two years later and came back with a bride. They opened a tavern and boarding house, and eventually Cesare began traveling to California for grapes to make wine for his guests and Italian neighbors. The grape business -- and California -- looked better than the iron mines, so he moved his family to Lodi, where Robert grew up. Robert played football for Lodi High and rugby at Stanford, from which he graduated in 1937. 
When Cesare bought a small winery in the Napa Valley, Sunny St. Helena, he let Robert run it. In those post-Prohibition days, it prospered. In 1943, the family bought the Charles Krug winery, just up the road from where the Robert Mondavi winery is now. Krug prospered, too, but contention in the family mounted until the split in 1965. A year later, when he was 53, Mr. Mondavi opened his own winery, the first full-scale winery built in the Napa Valley since the repeal of Prohibition. Around the same time, he changed the pronunciation of his name from mon-DAY-vee to mon-DAH-vee. 
The impact of the new building on the sleepy, still rural valley was electric. With its wide verandas and terraces and spectacular views of vineyards and mountains, nothing like it had ever been seen in the Valley. 
Nearly every veteran of those early days can recall some bit of generosity -- a crusher part, some extra barrels, or just good advice -- on Mr. Mondavi's part. "He wanted everyone to make it," the late Andre Tchelistcheff, Beaulieu Vineyard's winemaker, once said. "He wanted all California wines to be world class."
Before the Robert Mondavi Winery was built, the symbol of excellence in the Napa Valley had been John Daniel's Inglenook. It had recently been bought by United Vintners and turned into a producer of mostly cheap wines. "Everyone was depressed," said Warren Winiarski, who worked briefly at Mondavi and later founded Stag's Leap Wine Cellars, "but Bob's passion for quality, his enthusiasm and that beautiful winery restored everyone's spirits. We wanted him to succeed."
Mr. Mondavi brought to his new operation his two sons, a mountain of debt and a handful of employees, including his assistant at Charles Krug, Margrit Biever. Swiss-born, multilingual and worldly, she made herself invaluable at the new winery. When Mr. Mondavi traveled to Europe, she was at his side, counseling and translating. Out of those trips came Opus One, the joint venture with Chateau Mouton-Rothschild of Bordeaux.
A food and wine program she set up at the winery in the late 1960's became the Great Chefs program in 1976. She was the first to propose what would become the famous Napa Valley Wine Auction and has had a guiding hand in Mr. Mondavi's considerable charitable gifts including, in 2001, $35 million to the University of California at Davis for an arts center and an institute for wine and food science. In 1980, she also became the second Mrs. Robert Mondavi.
"Bob deserves the praise he's getting now," said John DeLuca, the longtime president of Wine Institute, the industry's promotional arm, "but someone should note Margrit Biever's role in his success."
But is his success the company's success as well? Some critics say that time has passed Mondavi by and that small "cult" wineries have taken the spotlight with their bigger, bolder wines. Some say the Mondavi decline began with its going public in 1993. 
Michael Mondavi was quick to admit that the company had made wrong turns. "The 90's were the halcyon years," he said. "Bad decisions were hidden by our spectacular growth. At the moment, we have nothing to mask our errors.
"We were the first major wine company to go public, and that put us in a fishbowl. Other big drinks companies have beer or spirits to even out their numbers; we don't."
Mr. Leedom said there was a good chance that the Mondavis would recover. "The glut of grapes and the economic downturn will end," he said, "and a lot of their problems were brought on by those two factors."
And while he is upset over family discord, Robert Mondavi is as optimistic as ever about the future. He is convinced that the winery will regain what he calls its "lost image." And when it does, he said in the interview at the winery, he will "let go completely and just clip coupons on the side."
No one believes that for a minute. 

A Sampling of Bottles
ROBERT MONDAVI is right. Retailers tend to take his wines for granted. Some have few or none on their shelves. But there are some good ones around, and at reasonable prices. Among them, with approximate prices:

1999 CHARDONNAY, $17
1999 RESERVE CHARDONNAY, $40
2001 FUME BLANC, $18
1999 CABERNET SAUVIGNON, $30
2000 PINOT NOIR, $23
1999 RESERVE CABERNET, $115
The heralded 2000 Reserve is not yet available in stores. It will probably sell for $150 to $175 depending on demand. But anyone seeking Mondavi greatness might consider a six-liter bottle of the 1985 Reserve Cabernet, which I found in one New York shop for $1,200. Or for true hedonism, there are a few six-liter bottles of the 1994 Opus One, the Mondavi-Chateau Mouton-Rothschild collaboration, to be found at around $2,800. A great year, 1994. FRANK J. PRIAL

HEADLINE: A Teacher Who Helps the Many Become One 

BYLINE:  By SOL HURWITZ

 BODY:
Suzanna McNamara has backpacked in Patagonia and worked at a Wyoming hunting camp and aboard a trawler in the Bering Sea. But she has found the ultimate challenge at a new alternative high school in the Bronx, where she is teaching English to teenage immigrants.
 Ms. McNamara is a literacy teacher at Bronx International High School, a public school for newcomers to the United States who are learning English for the first time. The school's 144 ninth- and 10th-grade students come from 30 countries in Africa, Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe and speak 22 different languages. Most are refugees whose education has been upset by wars, family upheaval or economic turmoil. 
 Ms. McNamara, 29, said that a stint tutoring Spanish-speaking inmates in a New Mexico prison opened her eyes "to the plight of people who are marginalized by language problems" and inspired her to pursue her current career.
She joined Bronx International's faculty early last year, attracted by "the newness and smallness" of the school and by the challenge of teaching teenagers who are often illiterate in their native language.
"You don't take a job like this knowing it's a piece of cake," she said. "I could have taught on Long Island for a lot more money where things would be easier. Everybody here has a mountain to climb."
Bronx International is one of four high schools created within Morris High School, a Gothic revival landmark in the borough's Morrisania section. The new school opened in 2001 with 75 ninth graders and is adding a grade each year; it will become a four-year high school with 300 students in 2004. Morris will be phased out as part of a citywide initiative to transform large comprehensive high schools into smaller schools intended to raise academic achievement.
Bronx International receives more than $200,000 in annual grants from private foundations and nonprofit school reform organizations, and maintains partnerships with the International Rescue Committee, a New York-based refugee relief organization, and the Bronx Museum of the Arts.
Since there is no template for teaching English to older students who lack native-language literacy, Ms. McNamara is creating her own curriculum.
"Students acquire English when they are forced to use it in an authentic way -- to fill some kind of information gap," she said. "I start by asking them to interview their classmates. Then they write out their replies and read them to the class: 'You're from this country, you're from that country; you're this religion, you're that religion.' It's a way to discover the differences and the connections they share."
"Connections," in fact, is the unifying theme of her evolving curriculum. Her classroom, which doubles as a computer lab, includes brightly colored posters asking: "Who are the people connected to you?" and "How do connections change us?"
Showing how strangers become friends, she offered her students a true story from O, Oprah Winfrey's magazine, about Beverly, a white woman from New Mexico, who was moved to correspond by e-mail with Adelina, a black woman from South Africa, after reading that Adelina's husband had been dragged behind a pickup truck and murdered by his white boss. Ms. McNamara also showed a television segment from "The Oprah Winfrey Show" in which the two women meet.
"What followed," she said, "was rich journal writing and a discussion about racism, culminating in the students' writing letters to the two women. Some had never written a letter before."
Ms. McNamara knew she had succeeded when Haja Sidibey, a ninth grader from Sierra Leone who had often resisted writing, worked before and after school on a letter to Adelina, which revealed her own father's murder by rebel forces during Sierra Leone's civil war. "Now we are fine," Haja wrote. "But we always think of him."
Ms. McNamara was raised in suburban Middletown, N.J., by middle-class parents: her father worked for J. P. Morgan Chase; her mother is a nurse. She received a bachelor's degree in psychology from the University of Pennsylvania and a master's degree from Queens College in applied linguistics and teaching English as a second language.
Shael Polakow-Suransky, 31, Bronx International's founding principal, hopes the school's approach to language development will become a national model. "Our kids come to us with dramatically different levels of English literacy and academic achievement," he said. The school's goal, he said, is to prepare all the students "to be independent learners who will succeed in college."
Ms. McNamara teaches three 70-minute classes a day: two intensive English literacy classes with eight students each and, paired with another teacher, a math class of 24 students.
She tutors students in phonics three times a week before school and works one-on-one with students after school. She is part of a team that teaches English, global studies, science and math courses in which English is spoken, written and read. She often shadows their classes to identify strategies that will strengthen her students' achievement in those subjects. Some days she eats lunch as late as 3 p.m.
Ms. McNamara, who once sold her own ink-and-watercolor sketches as a street vendor in Brooklyn, helped students create a mural for the school's fourth-floor corridor with ceramic tiles depicting such themes as community, family and peace.
"It's an opportunity to define our space as a new school in a building shared by others," she said.
Ms. McNamara admits that creating a new curriculum for her students is "a work in progress." But she leaves no doubt about her commitment. She is constantly studying the latest research, taking after-school and weekend courses, and visiting other schools to gain new insights. "I'm obsessed," she says with a laugh. "I'm always thinking about school. Everything I watch, everything I read, I'm, like, wow, I can use that."
Her students are also her teachers, she says. "They've taught me about their lives, their countries and their dreams. I feel a special connection to them."

HEADLINE: LETTER FROM EUROPE; 
Modern German Duty: The Obligation to Play

BYLINE:  By Richard Bernstein 

DATELINE: BERLIN, July 1 

 BODY:
This capital city, as leafy and uncongested a great world capital as you're likely to find, is like a vast continuous sidewalk cafe these days of summer, when darkness doesn't descend until 10 p.m. or so, and from staid Charlottenburg in the old West to trendy Prenzlauerberg in the East everybody seems to be breakfasting, lunching and dining outdoors.
 It's very nice, a great summer pleasure in Berlin, and not only ordinary people enjoy it. The story of this week in Germany was the announcement of the Socialist government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder that it was moving up by a year a planned tax break aimed at stimulating the country's sluggish economy. 
 But it was not just the news about the tax cut that was striking. Just as notable was the scene carefully stage-managed for news photographers and reproduced on front-page headlines from Schleswig-Holstein to Bavaria. It showed the men and women who run this country discussing tax reform while sitting under Renoiresque dappled sunlight at a table set, it seemed, more for an alfresco Italian wedding than a serious conversation about the future of Europe's most powerful economy. 
The not-so-subliminal message, of course, was the one that cigarette makers learned long ago: it is, in the version that appeared in Germany this week, that your government and the good life are one and the same. But somewhat strangely, that image of the country's leaders mixing business with pleasure comes at a moment when an unaccustomed question is being asked here. Put politely, it is whether the Germans have become too addicted to leisure time for their own good. More rudely expressed, as it has been by some commentators, the question is this: are the Germans lazy?
No less a person that the minister for labor and economics, Wolfgang Clement, seemed to be suggesting a couple of weeks ago that they were; he told journalists from Stern, the picture weekly, that the Germans, who get 6 weeks off each year, plus another 9 to 12 single-day holidays, ought to work more and vacation less.
His remarks prompted gleeful headlines in the German papers like: "Amusement Park Germany" and "Germany in the Hammock," and there was a spate of stories about a survey done by the Institute for German Economics in Cologne showing, surprisingly, that Germans actually work fewer hours per year than anybody else in the advanced industrial world -- 1,557 hours a year in the former West Germany, compared with 1,605 for France, 1,693 for Britain and more than 1,900 for the United States, which was at the top of the list.
The Germans are not lazy, of course. Still, the leisure time question does highlight something that is true of Germans and, in fact, of virtually all Europeans. It's not just that they like to have a good time; everybody does, after all. It is more that they experience the idea of vacation with a political and psychological intensity that, at least according to some students of their character, makes not only for a cultural trait but for a difference in attitude with America as big in its way as the recent political disagreement about the war in Iraq.
Every summer, Germans hit the road, exercising what they see as an inalienable right to their six weeks of vacation. "Thorstein Veblen would have had a great time describing the German people conspicuously vacationing," Michael Werz, a philosopher from Hanover University said, referring to the great Amercan economist who saw the link between discretionary spending and social prestige.
Why conspicuously? In many European places, there is an element of class vengeance in vacation, a sense of a victory won over the economic enemy that has, as a matter almost of principle, to be enjoyed. In France, for example, mandatory vacations were among the great victories of the working class in its bitter struggle with capital, finally won when Leon Blum's Popular Front government came to power, briefly, in 1936. The magazines of that era show extraordinary photographs of hundreds of thousands of workers clogging the roads for what might have been the first of that country's monumental vacation-time traffic jams, as they headed off to enjoy the fruits of their political victory.
Vacations in Germany also start with traffic jams that go on for hours but, as Mr. Werz explained, there is a difference from France. In this country, there was no battle for leisure time. Vacation was handed down from above, initially by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck himself in the 19th century. Later it was the Nazis who made vacations for the working class a part of the national program. 
The point is that vacation became an integral part of life, ordained by higher authority who wanted everybody to believe that everything was all right, life was good. After World War II, when Germany enjoyed its economic miracle and became a very rich country, vacation took on an element of mass denial of the recent past; it enabled everybody, as Mr. Werz puts it, "to pretend that everything was nice and smooth and great again." 
Here, perhaps, is the difference with Americans, who also like their vacations. Many Americans, who have no recent history of labor struggles or national traumas, simply see work as a good in itself; they don't believe deep inside that they have an inalienable right to an idle August and take pride in postponing retirement, or taking on a second career. But for many Europeans, leisure time is not just a break from work; it is the goal of it.

HEADLINE: As California Borrows Time, Other States Scrape Together Some Budget Solutions 

BYLINE:  By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 1 

 BODY:
California began its new fiscal year today living on borrowed time and borrowed money as state officials remained locked in a seemingly unending dispute over how to resolve a record $38 billion deficit.
 For the 17th time in the past 25 years, California's Legislature failed to pass a budget by the constitutional deadline of June 30. Lawmakers and statewide elected officials will receive no paychecks until a budget is signed into law, and some payments for community colleges, local street repairs and the university systems will be delayed. The state will continue to operate as long as it can on a dwindling balance of $5 billion from the June sale of revenue anticipation notes, a pool that will run dry sometime in August, budget officials said. 
 California's problem remained the most intractable in the nation as other states staggered across their budget deadlines with stopgap solutions, short-term spending plans and continued debate over the most contentious budget items. 
Legislatures in New Hampshire and Oregon passed short-term budgets, while the governors of Massachusetts and North Carolina signed last-minute budgets on Monday, the last day of the fiscal year. Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut signed an executive order on Monday to keep the state government operating for a week. 
Even though the final details of several state budgets have yet to be completed, it is clear that spending at the state level will fall in absolute terms for the first time in 20 years, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers.
"That is a very, very unusual occurrence and it shows that the fiscal crisis is much worse than we anticipated," said Scott Pattison, executive director of the group.
Mr. Pattison noted that in 2000, the states had a cumulative $48.8 billion in reserves or "rainy day" funds. At the end of June, all but about $6 billion of that had been spent, a level well below what is considered an acceptable fiscal cushion.
To address these problems, governors in 29 states are seeking to raise revenues, although most have shied away from broad-based taxes on income and sales because of their political unpopularity.
New York, bucking the trend, raised both income and sales taxes to help close an $11.5 billion deficit. The state also relied on a variety of one-time revenues and borrowed $4.2 billion against expected payments from the nationwide settlement with tobacco companies.
The fiscal year that just ended brought deep spending cuts in 28 states, in many cases with additional reductions imposed in the middle of the year. That pattern is likely to be repeated in the next year unless the economy improves, according to Ray Scheppach, executive director of the National Governors Association.
"In the last two years, you saw midyear cutting of $12 billion to $14 billion," Mr. Scheppach said. "I would expect another $5 billion to $10 billion this year."
Even if the economy rebounds, he added, the rapid rise in Medicaid costs -- now roughly 8 percent a year -- would swallow virtually all the new revenue. "Education will be competing with health care in the shark pen," he said. "The long run doesn't look pretty."
Budget woes have been exacerbated by disputes over the taxes-versus-spending conflict that has stalled solutions, most notably in California, where Republicans are refusing to consider any plan that includes new taxes. As a result, states are raising money in inventive ways.
Fees will rise on studded tires in Alaska, mobile-home inspections in Florida, traffic fines in Iowa, birth certificates in New York and filing lawsuits in Vermont, according to the governors association. Illinois is increasing taxes on admission to riverboat casinos, Utah is raising fees on hazardous waste storage and Virginia has imposed new fees for serving subpoenas. Smokers will pay higher taxes in a dozen states, and drinkers will pay more for liquor in a half-dozen. Fuel taxes will rise in Alaska and Michigan.
Still, no state governments shut down at the stroke of midnight today.
Gov. Kenny Guinn of Nevada went to court at 12:01 a.m. today to sue the State Assembly for failing to pass a budget by the Monday deadline. The Legislature in that historically tax-averse state is divided over how to finance public education for the next two years. The governor asked the State Supreme Court to circumvent the Legislature and raise as much as $1.65 billion to finance the state's fast-growing school districts.
Lawmakers in New Jersey reached a tentative agreement late Monday to raise $600 million to $700 million in new or increased taxes to balance the state's $24 billion budget. The agreement includes a steep rise in cigarette taxes, new hotel taxes and an increase in fees on real estate transactions. The budget slashes property-tax rebates to homeowners and reduces aid to colleges and universities, arts groups and state operations.
In Massachusetts, Gov. Mitt Romney signed a $22 billion budget and then vetoed $201 million in spending items approved by the Legislature. The budget tries to address a $3 billion deficit, imposing deep cuts on colleges and universities, education and local governments. The final plan includes about $500 million in new fees but no across-the-board tax increases. 
In Oregon, where revenues have dropped sharply in recent years, resulting in substantial program cuts, state officials approved a continuing budget resolution on Monday that allowed the government to operate as legislators worked on a biennial budget for 2003 through 2005. Legislators are considering a variety of options for restoring money to programs, including enacting a state sales tax for the first time.
 The Pennsylvania Legislature, which passed a budget in record time in March, has still not completed work on a proposal by Gov. Ed Rendell to raise the state's income tax by $2.2 billion to pay for education and property tax relief. So while the state has an overall spending plan in place, none of the bills required to finance state operations have been enacted, said the governor's press secretary, Kate Philips.
New Hampshire adopted a continuing resolution on Monday, allowing the state to keep operating for three months as lawmakers and the governor wrangle over the state's proposed $8.8 billion two-year budget. The state, which has been somewhat insulated from the recent economic recession because it does not rely on taxes from income, sales or capital gains, is in a dispute over how to treat one-time revenues. Gov. Craig Benson vetoed the budget over its treatment of the disposition of income from the federal government and savings from self-insuring state workers.
California, with an estimated $38 billion two-year budget deficit, remains the nation's fiscal basket case.
Gov. Gray Davis announced today that he was extending a statewide hiring freeze and eliminating as many as 20,000 vacant state positions for an immediate savings of $250 million, which would pay about one day's operating expenses.
He pleaded with lawmakers to put aside their partisan differences and pass a budget by the end of the week. Last year, the budget impasse was not resolved until the end of August -- and the stakes were considerably lower then.
"I urge both parties to redouble their efforts to find common ground," Mr. Davis said as he signed the order to cut jobs. "That is what people elected us to do."

HEADLINE: Employers Seek To Shift Costs Of Drugs to U.S. 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
The bills to provide drug benefits through Medicare that were passed by the House and the Senate last week offer some of the country's largest employers a long-sought prize: shifting at least some of their burden of soaring drug costs to the federal government.
 With billions of dollars at stake, those companies are lobbying hard to make sure that those gains survive in the final version of the law. 
 The effort is being led by a shrinking number of companies that pay for health coverage for millions of retired workers -- notably General Motors, Ford, Verizon, SBC Communications, I.B.M. and Caterpillar.
Last week's bills would let them shift some costs by creating Medicare-subsidized managed care organizations that offered drug benefits and subsidies for employers that maintained their drug coverage. Indeed, one of the sharpest debates to come, as the legislation heads into a murky period of House-Senate negotiations, is over how to discourage companies from dropping retiree health benefits altogether. 
The bills would cost a total of $400 billion over 10 years. Part of that would ultimately save money for employers, but the Congressional Budget Office has not yet calculated how much. By some accounts, Ford alone could save $50 million a year.
Employers are not the only ones with big money at stake. The health insurance industry is already lobbying Congress for significant changes in the bills that would divert more of the money to it.
Some conservatives who want to shrink the government and reduce taxes are attacking the Medicare bills as corporate welfare. But Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton University, argues that the bills are "really a supply-side measure that would lift a burden of social insurance" from employers and release spending for capital investment and dividends.
The 28,000 employers who provide drug benefits to retirees are spending $22.5 billion this year for their former employees' prescriptions, according to a study by Hewitt Associates, a consulting firm, and the Kaiser Family Foundation. 
These hard-lobbying companies, most with unions that put a priority on health benefits for retirees, represent a smaller and smaller group of employers. About one in 3 big employers offered retiree health benefits in 2002. And many of those plan to drop the benefit for future retirees within three years, another survey by Hewitt and Kaiser found. 
Both the Senate and House bills would establish a limited Medicare-subsidized drug benefit with premiums and deductibles. It would be offered by an array of preferred provider organizations and health maintenance organizations, and with traditional fee-for-service Medicare.
Most employer drug plans are much more generous: they have no separate deductibles or premiums. But employers could add advantages by covering the premium and/or deductible for their workers and still save part of their average cost of $1,500 for each retiree. 
For employers who stick with their current drug plans, the House bill would offer a sliding subsidy equivalent to 28 percent of the actual cost of drugs purchased, but only after the first $250 for each retiree, with a $5,000 ceiling. The Senate bill offers a direct annual subsidy to these employers of $840 a retiree.
But most employers have already eliminated health benefits for retirees, if they ever had them, and the Medicare legislation will probably accelerate that trend, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It forecast that 37 percent of retirees, or 4.4 million people, would lose drug coverage under the Senate bill and 31 percent under the House version. 
Most companies that still have drug benefits say they will continue them for current retirees, though often with dollar ceilings as drug costs soar. 
But employers are leery of promising medical care to workers who have not yet retired. Motorola, for example, "expects to continue retiree medical coverage, but only for employees who retired before 2002," said Randy Johnson, a human resources director. Motorola has also said it will limit the amount of expenses it covers.
A quarter of the companies surveyed by Hewitt are already reaching these ceilings and requiring retirees to pay a greater share of drug costs.
"It is clear that employers will react by scaling back their drug coverage for retirees," said Jonathan Gruber, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The question is how many will do it and when. It is already happening, he said, adding that the legislation "will hasten the trend."
Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a health policy expert and managing director at the Carlyle Group of international investors, said, "Corporate America is probably very happy to see the government go into the pharmaceutical insurance business." 
First introduced by unions bargaining with employers in the 1960's, retiree health benefits reached a peak in 1988 as many companies used them to enrich early-retirement packages. The percentage of large companies covering retirees' health care dropped sharply in 1991 after a new accounting rule required companies, in their annual reports, to estimate the cost of future obligations and reduce profits accordingly.
Spending on drugs -- generally not covered by Medicare -- is at least 40 percent of retiree medical costs, and they have risen 15 to 20 percent annually, even as profit increases slowed in a sluggish economy. 
For some old-line companies, the benefits represent a heavy burden -- one, they point out, that their less generous competitors, and newer companies with far fewer retirees, do not have to bear. Sixty-seven of the country's largest companies have promised more than $1 billion each, $332 billion in total, to current and future retirees for health care, according to the Watson Wyatt benefits-consulting firm.
Under an accounting rule, Financial Accounting Standard 106, the Detroit automakers and the regional Bell telecommunications giants had to reduce their reported profits by hundreds of millions of dollars last year, on top of enormous current bills for retirees' medicine.
Ford's prospective savings of $50 million or more -- 17 to 20 percent of current spending on retiree drugs -- might be augmented by a reduction of $40 million more in its annual accounting estimate of future spending for retirees if the changes in Medicare are enacted. 
Companies like Ford would probably coordinate their health coverage with the new Medicare benefit. They would not be likely to drop retiree health benefits except under dire economic conditions, health policy experts said.
"Someday, if these car companies are skidding near bankruptcy, they're going to have to break the deal," Professor Reinhardt said. Unlike with pensions, no money has been set aside for future retirees' health benefits, he said, adding, "F.A.S. 106 is all unfunded."
Edward J. Kaleta, chairman of the Employers Coalition on Medicare, including three dozen big companies, said, "We want to make sure that we continue to stay in the game, and control escalating double-digit increases in our drug costs." 
And Dr. Vincent Kerr, director of health care management at Ford, noted that employers would be paying for the new program through payroll and other taxes. "Employers hope we will get to participate in that system we support with our dollars," he said. 
The Business Roundtable, an association of chief executives of corporations with millions of employees in total and $3.7 trillion in annual revenue, hailed the passage of the Senate and House bills.
The organization said it would now concentrate on the conference committee, where, away from public scrutiny, lobbyists for business and other interest groups typically press for language that advances their interests.
Glen Barton, chief executive of Caterpillar and chairman of the Business Roundtable's health and retirement task force, said the group "pledges to work with conferees to develop and pass legislation" that provides options for employers to "coordinate" their benefits with Medicare.

HEADLINE: Factory Index, Expected to Rise, Shrinks Instead 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Manufacturing contracted in June for a fourth consecutive month as factories kept inventories low until demand strengthens, an industry report showed yesterday. The report, the Institute for Supply Management's factory index, was surprising; economists had expected improvement instead. 
 The factory index registered 49.8 in June compared with 49.4 in May. A reading below 50 signals contraction. A survey of 68 economists forecast that the gauge would rise to 51. 
 Inventories shrank the most since March 2002, pulling down the index and suggesting that any increases in manufacturing would be gradual.
Still, there were signs that demand was starting to strengthen, with orders, production and exports accelerating. The economy is forecast to grow 3.2 percent at an annual pace in the third quarter, a notable rise from early in the year. 
A separate report from the Commerce Department showed that construction spending in May unexpectedly declined by the most in a year as wet weather led to drops in housing and in public and private construction. Spending on big public works projects fell markedly, and building over all dropped 1.7 percent, to $869.8 billion at an annual pace, after falling 0.6 percent in April. The decline was the third in a row and the largest since 1.7 percent in May 2002. 
Automakers continued to discount vehicles in June to try to maintain sales. Based on daily selling rates, auto sales by General Motors rose 1.3 percent in June from June 2002 and were off 0.1 percent at Ford as the two big producers, increasing incentive spending from May, fell short of analysts' forecasts. 
The Institute for Supply Management, based in Tempe, Ariz., surveys more than 400 companies in 20 industries, including clothing, printing, plastics, transportation and furniture. Manufacturing accounts for about one-seventh of the economy. The institute's index averaged 49.2 over the first six months of the year. 
The index of inventories fell to 41.3 from 46.1, suggesting that production would increase in coming months if demand accelerated.
The institute's employment index rose to 46.2 from 43, a sign factories were laying off fewer workers. 
The report's new orders component, which accounts for about a third of the overall index and is considered an indicator of future production, rose to 52.2 from 51.9 in May. The production index, a gauge of work being performed, increased to 52.9 in June from 51.5. 
An index on the backlog of orders fell to 50 from 51. Another, on new export orders, rose to 54.4 from 50.8. Supplier deliveries fell to 50 after a reading of 51.3 in May.

HEADLINE: Record Number of Homeless, But City Says It's Prepared 

BYLINE:  By ANDREA ELLIOTT

 BODY:
With every summer season comes a surge in family homelessness in New York City. Landlords are emboldened to evict people. School is out. The good will of relatives providing shelter wears thin.
 This year the city faces a record number of homeless families -- more than 9,000 -- and lingering criticism over the way it handled the overflow last summer, when families slept on the floor of an intake office and in a vacant Bronx jail, practices that led to lawsuits. 
 But with 700 additional shelter units available and increased legal powers to move families into permanent housing more quickly, officials of the Department of Homeless Services say the city is ready to cope with an influx. The city has not ruled out using the vacant jail again in an emergency, although that would surely lead to another fight in court with advocates for the homeless. 
The seasonal surge of homeless families is accompanied this year by a floundering economy and the highest number of homeless people in shelters -- more than 38,000 -- since the city began tracking numbers in the early 1980's, with roughly double the number of homeless children and families compared with five years ago.
A total of 9,249 families, including more than 16,500 children, are currently sheltered in city facilities, according to the department. 
The numbers of homeless tend to set records with every economic downturn, homeless service officials said. New York City's economy has been sluggish for the last three years. 
But this year, as a result of a legal settlement, the city has the ability to move families into permanent housing more quickly. Under the agreement, families must accept the first appropriate apartment shown to them instead of waiting to choose among several.
As a result, the rate at which families are placed in homes has increased considerably. In the first three weeks of June this year, the city placed 435 families in homes, compared with 271 families placed in the same time period last year, for an increase of 61 percent. 
Until this year, the percentage of people placed in permanent housing had dropped steadily year to year for the most part since 1994, with one spike in 1998.
"We're turning around a 10-year trend," said Maryanne Schretzman, the deputy commissioner of policy and planning for the Department of Homeless Services. "Families are beginning to make the better choice of taking that apartment."
If these steps are not enough to stem an overflow of homeless people, Dr. Schretzman said, the city will again house people in a vacant wing of the the Bronx House of Detention for Men. Lead-based paint -- a major point of objection last year -- has been removed from the jail, said Linda Gibbs, the commissioner of homeless services. 
Dr. Schretzman said: "Ideally, no one wants to use this or any other emergency facility. At the end of the day, however, prudence requires that we have a contingency plan, and that's what this represents. We just don't want families sleeping on floors in city offices." 
Nevertheless, advocates promised to go to court if the jail is used again. "Children would be harmed by going to jail," said Steven Banks, a lawyer representing the homeless for the Legal Aid Society. "The problem with barracks-style centers like the one in the Bronx is that contagious diseases spread rapidly in that kind of environment, and children with medical problems don't have their needs met."
Still, Mr. Banks and other advocates say the city seems to be better prepared this year for what has become a predictable trend. The number of homeless families tends to rise every summer, partly because school is out and families who have doubled up with relatives are asked to leave at the end of the school year, say people who work with the homeless.
"They burn out that support system," said Lauri Cole, executive director of the Council on Homeless Policies and Services, an umbrella organization of nonprofit agencies that serve the homeless.
The weak New York economy has also played a role. A shortage of low-wage jobs and low-cost housing has fueled the surge in the homeless, said city officials and advocates for the homeless.
"We're at a crisis level," said Patrick Markee, a senior policy analyst with the Coalition for the Homeless. "You see more households who never thought they would have experienced homelessness. Bike messengers, waitresses, clerical staff, dishwashers -- these were people living month to month making the rent, and losing their hours is the kind of thing that can lead to homelessness."
The surge has meant longer lines at the Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen, on Ninth Avenue at 28th Street, and a 25 percent increase in food demand since 2001, said Clyde Kuemmerle, the programs coordinator for the church.
Soup kitchens and shelters have also seen an increasing number of working people become homeless, Mr. Markee said. One in 5 homeless families now has a working head of the household, compared with one in 10 during the 1980's, he said.
"A majority are families on public assistance," he said, "but there is a growing group that were working and continue to work and have just gotten trapped in homelessness." 
Robinson Baez, 29, never thought it could happen to him. He was earning $13.40 an hour as a meat shipper at Hunts Point in the Bronx when he lost his job in February 2002. He searched for another job and borrowed from friends. But he and his wife, Cynthia, were evicted from their $400-a-month one-bedroom apartment in the Bronx the following July. 
"I honestly never saw this happening," Mr. Baez said. "I've always been at the top of my game. I've never had to deal with unemployment."
In September 2002, the couple were placed in a transitional shelter in the Bronx. Mrs. Baez gave birth to a daughter, Naomi, the following December. Their sole source of income is $134 in welfare checks every two weeks, which mostly goes to paying for diapers and baby formula. 
The couple were approved for government-subsidized housing of up to $980 a month for the next two years, but the hard part is finding a landlord willing to take a family on welfare, Mr. Baez said.
"They say, 'We don't deal with those types of programs,' " he said. It is also hard for the couple to pay the transportation expenses involved in apartment hunting.
"I can't go by myself because they want to see the entire family," Mr. Baez said. "For me and her to go take a ride to view an apartment, that's going to cost $8."
Luckily, Yaneli Ochoa Hinojosa has a car. She uses it to take her two children from the shelter they are staying in to a baby sitter every day, and then drives to her job as a Spanish translator for a law firm on the Upper West Side. They have been homeless since April, when she fled a husband she said was abusive. 
She must wait three months before she can apply for permanent housing, but has started looking for something she can afford on her own. Still, with a weekly salary of $287, she can hardly afford the $1,300 in rent she sees advertised for one and two bedrooms.
"Even a studio is just $1,100, and they ask you for a deposit, another fee and two months' rent," said Ms. Ochoa Hinojosa, 24. "Right now I am trying to get a nighttime job so I can afford an apartment."

HEADLINE: Travel Industry Fears New Rules Could Deter Visits to U.S. 

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1 

 BODY:
The Travel Industry Association of America warned today that several new security measures intended to prevent terrorists from entering the United States would also quite likely deter foreign tourists' visits.
 The rules, to go into effect in coming months, require interviews of nearly all tourists who seek visas, as well as computer-readable passports from Europeans and others who do not need visas to travel to the United States. By January, the government plans to put into effect a rigorous tracking system for foreign visitors, which will include fingerprints and photographs. Officials say the changes are necessary to protect against terrorist attacks. 
 But executives at the travel association, which represents the largest airlines, hotels, cruise lines and car rental companies, said the measures could further weaken an industry that has been reeling since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. 
The representatives of the association are calling on the government to delay the regulations, which they say will cause unnecessary delays and confusion for foreign travelers.
This week, the executives wrote to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans to express their concerns. The executives are widely expected to testify to Congress next week. 
"Each of these three decisions, in our judgment, could have a very significant negative impact on inbound international tourism and travel to the United States," the president of the group, William S. Norman, said today at a news conference.
"We strongly support secure borders," Mr. Norman said. "However, we also need government policies that facilitate the visitation of legitimate low-risk international visitors to the United States. "We want a balance between homeland security and the economy. The government is trying to do too much too soon with too little."
Many of the rules will sharply increase the demands on American diplomats abroad and customs inspectors at airports and border crossings. Officials say they have slightly increased staffing at some embassies and consulates, but added that they expected diplomats to use their existing resources creatively to cope with the mounting workload. 
Travel executives say they fear that tourists will visit other countries rather than face the delays and confusion that may accompany the changes. 
The number of international travelers here has dipped nearly 20 percent since the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, a decline attributed to fears of terrorism and the softening world economy. International travelers contribute $88 billion a year to the economy, the travel association said.
Congress recently allotted $50 million to promote the United States as a tourist destination. Government officials say they are trying to balance their desire for international tourism and national security. 
"We are aware of the concerns," a spokesman for the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Stuart E. Patt, said. "It's not our intention to discourage tourists to the U.S. Quite the contrary. 
"We believe in the policy of open doors, secure borders. We want to keep the door open, but we have to do what we can to keep our borders safe." 
Officials expect the stricter regulations to be instituted in waves over six months. 
Starting next month, diplomats in embassies and consulates around the world will begin interviewing nearly all tourists who seek visas, a shift that is expected to create significant delays for people hoping to visit the United States. In the past, consular officials had the option of allowing tourists who did not present security risks or seem likely to overstay their visas to apply for visas by mail. 
In countries considered likely sources of of terrorists or illegal aliens, consular officials already routinely conduct interviews for visas. 
In other places like South Korea they do not. Executives at the Travel Industry Association said 27 percent of the South Korean visa applicants were typically interviewed in Seoul. If that figure surges to 90 percent, diplomats in Seoul will process just 200,000 visas a year, down from 500,000, the executives said.
Perhaps even more worrisome, the executives added, is the change that will affect the 27 countries, mostly in Europe, whose citizens are not required to apply for visas. About two-thirds of the foreign tourists are from those countries, and they will be required to produce computer-readable passports starting in October.
The travel executives said most British and Japanese visitors already carried such passports. But they said they worried about travelers from France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland, who do not routinely carry such passports.

To the Editor:
William Safire asks ("The Bedroom Door," column, June 30): "Why do too many Americans derogate as losers those parents who put family ahead of career?" Why do we turn "to movie porn and violence for sex and thrills, to the Internet for companionship, to the restaurant for Thanksgiving dinner?" 
 Surely part of the answer is that the unrestrained free-market system that America has developed forces workers to relocate often to find and keep jobs. 
 The resulting mobility -- Americans move, on average, once every five years or so -- makes it difficult to sustain the kinds of communities in which families flourish. 
"Old Europe" does a much better job at balancing economic growth and community.

HEADLINE: A Last-Minute Budget Deal Is Now Final: No Shutdown, but Higher Taxes 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 1 

 BODY:
Exhausted from a weekend of budget negotiations and an all-night bargaining session that ended after sunup this morning, New Jersey legislators narrowly averted a government shutdown today by approving a $24.1 billion state budget that increases an assortment of taxes.
 The budget calls for $700 million more in spending than last year's approved budget, but cuts money to arts groups, universities and health care for poor families. 
 Gov. James E. McGreevey, a Democrat, upheld his pledge not to raise sales and income taxes, but he did impose tax increases on cigarettes, real estate transactions, billboards and casinos, and reduce property tax rebates to $250 per homeowner from $500. 
Republicans railed against the tax increases for weeks and withheld their support for the plan until late Monday, when Democrats agreed to reduce the tax increases by $200 million and abandon a proposal for a new tax on telephone service.
Even so, the plan encountered major last-minute obstacles. The administration spent the night bargaining with representatives of the billboard, real estate and casino industries before the evenly divided State Senate was presented with a budget bill, which passed this afternoon with a single Republican vote.
Later, when the budget reached the General Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats, Republicans threatened to try to block a vote, and Assembly Speaker Albio Sires vowed to keep lawmakers in the chambers until the next voting session, on Thursday. The bill was passed on a strict party-line vote.
Governor McGreevey, who had called lawmakers into special session over the weekend, signed the measure this afternoon and was clearly relieved that the partisan war of nerves had been resolved. He had warned Republicans that the State Constitution required a balanced budget in place by the start of the new fiscal year, 12:01 this morning, and that failure to reach an agreement could force a government shutdown that would close parks, motor vehicle offices, beaches and casinos.
"Clearly this budget process had some difficult and arguably tense moments, but we have an agreement today," Mr. McGreevey said. "Government is open today." 
Since the entire Legislature is up for re-election this year, the plan became a bitter political battleground, and as harried lawmakers shuffled around the State House today they were already distilling their budget positions into campaign slogans. Democrats congratulated themselves for weathering the second straight year of austerity measures without resorting to broad-based tax increases or crippling service cuts.
"Democrats fought to keep the heart in a budget that was pared down to its bones by economic necessity," said Senator Bernard F. Kenny Jr., of Hudson, a member of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee.
Republicans were quick to take credit for reducing the proposed tax increases and to link the current Legislature to Mr. McGreevey, who has had low approval ratings in recent polls.
"After two years and nearly $2 billion in tax increases, the people of New Jersey cannot afford a Democrat Legislature that provides a rubber stamp to Governor McGreevey's dangerous fiscal policies," said Senator Joseph M. Kyrillos Jr., the state Republican chairman. "With the governor's approval ratings at record lows, New Jersey voters have made it clear they are fed up with the flawed leadership and fiscal mismanagement that characterizes the McGreevey regime."
Wall Street analysts, who are to review the plan with the state treasurer next week, said that in the two years since Mr. McGreevey had taken office, the state had reduced its reliance on borrowing, mostly by creating a variety of new taxes on businesses.
But the budget approved today relies on more than $1.5 billion in revenue from tobacco bonds and federal grants that will not be available next year, so some analysts say the state is likely to face more difficult choices next year.
"They've made a lot of progress, but we don't know how much they've eliminated the structural deficit or whether they are still relying too heavily on nonrecurring sources of revenue," said Robert A. Kurtter, a senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service. "New Jersey's budget problems are not yet behind them."
Mr. McGreevey was clearly buoyed by his success in winning approval of most of his initiatives, especially the first tax increase on the state's casinos in a quarter-century.
When the governor first proposed $135 million in new taxes on casinos in February, legislators from both parties were bitterly opposed, and later a radio advertising campaign attacked him personally for endangering the economy of all South Jersey.
After reducing his demand to $90 million and winning the backing of others in his party, Mr. McGreevey found himself in a protracted and highly personal showdown with Senator William L. Gormley, a Republican of Atlantic County, that did not end until this morning.
The governor said that despite the pain the spending cutsand new taxes would bring, he was gratified that New Jersey did not have to resort to some of the austerity measures that other fiscally troubled states have taken, including cuts in school funds and early release of prison inmates.
"This is a budget that will keep New Jersey moving in the right direction," Mr. McGreevey said.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS; 
I.O.C. Will Vote Today On Host for 2010 Games

BYLINE:  By RICHARD SANDOMIR

DATELINE: PRAGUE, July 1 

 BODY:
It is always preferable to have bid to play host to the Olympics and won than to be 24 hours from the International Olympic Committee's vote on which bid will win. Just ask Valentino Castellani, who was mayor of Turin, Italy, in 1999, when his city won the right to stage the 2006 Winter Games. 
 As three cities (Salzburg, Austria; Vancouver, British Columbia; and Pyeongchang, South Korea) completed their preparations for the selection of the 2010 Winter Olympics host on Wednesday, Castellani stood contentedly today under an office building awning across the street from the Hilton Hotel, the I.O.C.'s headquarters here, waiting for a rainstorm to pass. "It's a lot more relaxing than it was four years ago," he said, "just watching from the outside." 
 Vancouver commemorated Canada Day today with a subdued news conference at another hotel, where an apparently sleep-deprived Wayne Gretzky, who had been out the night before with Jaromir Jagr and Petr Nedved, described his support for that city's bid. 
Gretzky will play a role timed at 2 minutes 43 seconds in Vancouver's presentation to the I.O.C. on Wednesday. Vancouver will be the first of the three cities to explain to the full membership, for the first and final time, why it should win the vote.
"I'm an ex-Olympian who believes in the Olympic spirit and the Olympic Games,and more importantly, I'm a proud Canadian," said Gretzky, a part-owner of the Phoenix Coyotes who was the general manager of the gold-medal-winning Canadian hockey team at the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City. 
"The Olympics are special in our country," he said. "My role is to show how proud I am to be a Canadian."
"I'm not a good flier," he added. "I didn't fly here for something I didn't believe in."
John Furlong, president of the Vancouver bid committee, did not display any nervousness heading into the final day of an effort that has lasted years to win the 2010 Winter Games. He said the national holiday made his mood serene.
Furlong calmly dismissed the geopolitics of his bid; namely, if Vancouver wins, are New York City's chances of winning the 2012 Summer Games damaged, because the I.O.C. has customarily varied consecutive Games' sites among continents?
"We spend no time on that scenario," Furlong said. "It's important to be focused on Vancouver and only Vancouver. We never set out to win this at the expense of other cities."
Daniel L. Doctoroff, who initiated NYC2012, New York's Olympic bid, arrived today to assess the dynamics of the biennial host election. Doctoroff, who is the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, may talk to I.O.C. members, but he may not push his bid against its rivals, which include those from London, Paris, Madrid, Leipzig, Moscow, Havana and Istanbul. He may not boast about the ferry and rail network that NYC2012 has developed to move athletes and spectators, but he is permitted to answer an I.O.C. member's questions about it.
"People don't want to focus on 2012," Doctoroff said. "They're focused on 2010. The last thing we want to do is intrude. Everybody recognizes that in these bidding processes, two years is an eternity.
"The process is dynamic and unpredictable. Sometimes the conventional wisdom is wrong."
The International Olympic Committee will meet in Singapore in July 2005 to choose the host city for the 2012 Summer Games.
Doctoroff is one of three official New York partisans visible in the Hilton lobby and restaurant, speaking to Olympic officials gathered under an enormous glass atrium that has been likened to a greenhouse for the heat it generates on the floor. Jay Kriegel, executive director of NYC2012, is here, as is Harvey Schiller, a former executive director of the United States Olympic Committee who is chairman of NYC2012's management committee. 
The leaders of five other organizations vying for the 2012 Olympics have shown up, the newest one being Barbara Cassani, who was named to run the nascent London bid two weeks ago. Cassani, who grew up in Boston and San Francisco, has worked in England for most of the past 17 years.
But the New York contingent is the most prominent, while attempting to hide in plain sight. One representative from each of the would-be 2012 hosts will be able to watch the 45-minute multimedia presentations by Salzburg, Vancouver and Pyeongchang.
"There's a lot of uncertainty, whether the presentations will make a difference to the members who haven't made up their mind," Doctoroff said.
Charlie Battle, who was managing director of international relations for Atlanta's 1996 Summer Olympic organizing committee, said, "The old mantra is you won't win it on your presentation, but you could lose it."
Battle, who is expected to be named an adviser to the United States Olympic Committee, will help guide New York through the international political thicket. He helped Vancouver prepare for a visit this year from the I.O.C.'s evaluation commission, which assessed the qualifications of the competing cities and issued a report that took the place of visits by individual Olympic committee members. Such visits were banned in 1999.
"Atlanta wouldn't have succeeded in this environment," he said. "Atlanta needed people to come to Atlanta." Pyeongchang is in a similar position; it is a little-known Korean city that wants to develop itself as the hub of Asian winter sports. 
"It's hard for Pyeongchang," Battle said. "You have no frame of reference." 
Sometime after the decision is made on Wednesday, Battle said, he hopes to debrief officials from the three cities, "to see what's effective."
"Things have changed," he said. "I told New York it's a long race, with a lot of history and learning."

HEADLINE: 4% Rise in Auto Sales in June Fuels Optimism at the Big Three 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 1 

 BODY:
Nationwide auto sales rose in June, but the domestic industry continued to lose ground to foreign competitors like Toyota despite spending heavily on consumer purchase incentives. 
 General Motors and the Ford Motor Company were upbeat in conference calls today, though, saying that they saw positive signs for industry sales in the second half of the year. 
 "We believe the president's tax cut and lower interest rates will support stronger economic growth and higher auto sales in the second half," Jim O'Connor, Ford's group vice president of North American marketing, sales and service, said in a press release.
The companies also said they continued to see customers moving away from typical passenger cars and into far more profitable luxury vehicles and sport utilities. Even some of the largest S.U.V.'s, like the Chevrolet Suburban, appear to be rebounding from weakness early in the year. Suburban sales rose 19 percent last month. 
But significant spending by Ford and G.M., as well as the Chrysler Group, on incentives like customer rebates and long-term interest-free financing is continuing to strain the profitability of the Big Three. At the same time, Toyota, Honda Motor and Nissan Motor are all gaining in market share with far lower incentives.
Overall, auto sales rose 4 percent from June 2002, to a seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate of 16.4 million cars and trucks, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank, a data tracking service in Southfield, Mich. 
G.M. sales rose 1.3 percent from June a year earlier, based on daily selling rates, according to Autodata Corp. (Last month had two fewer selling days than June 2002.) Sales at Ford fell 0.1 percent, while sales at DaimlerChrysler, parent of the Chrysler Group, rose 7 percent. 
Toyota sales rose 10.9 percent, helped by the company's redesigned Sienna minivan, while American Honda sales rose 8.7 percent in June. Nissan sales were up 21.5 percent last month. 
Both Toyota and Honda also reported record sales for the first half of the year, while combined sales for the Big Three fell to 60.6 percent of the market, down from 62 percent in the first half of last year. 
Many analysts expect that trend to continue as foreign automakers keep invading the market for light trucks -- sport utilities, pickups and minivans. Even the last redoubt of Detroit, the full-size pickup truck -- is under renewed attack as the rollout of Nissan's first, the Titan, is planned for later this year. 
"The Japanese are taking share, and I don't expect that to change," said Efraim Levy, an auto analyst at Standard & Poor's. "Now they're successfully attacking the light truck market and that's even more important than sedans, because that's where the Big Three gets their profits."
All this is happening against the backdrop of a price war in Detroit that started in 2001 after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and has yet to abate. 
In May, the latest month for which figures are available, G.M. led the industry by spending $3,827 a vehicle in incentives, which include free financing deals for up to five years and rebates as high as $3,000. Chrysler spent $3,624 and Ford $3,427, according to Autodata. 
By comparison, Japanese automakers averaged $1,197 and Honda spent only $487 a vehicle. 
"Dog days for the domestics and Christmas for the foreigners," said Michael Wujciak, vice president of global automotive consulting for Cap Gemini Ernst & Young, adding that Japanese automakers have helped themselves by quickening their pace of product development. 
"There's incentive fatigue out there now," he said. "The only thing that's going to bring the consumer in is some new, exciting metal."
George Pipas, Ford's chief industry sales analyst, said the problem was that foreign competitors were growing into markets already occupied by the Big Three. 
"As the foreign manufacturers expand their product lines and retail outlets, it's going to happen," he said. "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out."
He also said, however, that incentives had not lost their effectiveness, as many analysts have argued but had been masked by the weak economy. 
"What has happened is that we've had had very weak income growth in that period we've been in," he said. "Incentives are still working. But they don't appear to be working because household incomes are not growing at anything like the level they grew at in the mid- to late 90's."
One trend the domestic manufacturers like is the continuing move of consumers to luxury vehicles and sport utilities, which, aside from pickup trucks, is where Detroit makes its money. 
At Ford, for instance, sales of the Lincoln Navigator -- a luxury S.U.V. that was redesigned a year ago -- were up 26.3 percent last month and 39 percent for the first half of the year. Sales have been helped in recent months by Ford's offering interest-free financing for as long as five years on the Navigator. 
Identifying luxury vehicles has become harder as makers of luxury cars build cheaper offerings -- a BMW can be had for less than $30,000 now -- and domestic automakers load their S.U.V.'s with creature comforts. Paul Ballew, G.M.'s chief industry sales analyst, said his company's Chevrolet brand now had the largest market share of vehicles over $35,000. 
"We think what's most important going forward is that you win in this category," he said, referring to the luxury market.
"The growth in this industry is biased in that direction," he said. "The statistic I would always throw out is that so far this year almost one-third of all vehicles sold in the U.S. are above $30,000."
Full-size pickup trucks also had a strong month, with Chevrolet Avalanche sales up 40.3 percent and Chevrolet Silverado sales up 18 percent. Chrysler's Dodge Ram pickup sales gained 31 percent. Sales of the Ford F-Series pickup -- soon to be replaced with a redesigned model -- were flat.
Overall, the passenger car, which commanded about 80 percent of the American vehicle market in 1980, fell to just under 47 percent last month.

HEADLINE: City Eases The Pain In Budget For Arts 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
Despite the worst New York City budget deficit since the 1970's fiscal crisis, the specter of closed museum galleries, canceled performances and staff cuts at the city's cultural institutions diminished with the budget agreed upon last week.
 While the arts budget will be cut by more than $11 million, another $16.2 million in planned cuts was restored, leaving cultural institutions surprised and relieved. 
 The Department of Cultural Affairs said Albany aid enabled Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the City Council to avoid deeper cuts. 
"It's a significant restoration," said Ellen Futter, president of the Museum of Natural History. "It will prevent us from having to do things like charging New York City school groups, closing galleries and closing days." 
Some organizations will still have to reduce hours or staff and postpone events to save money. But for the 34 institutions owned by the city or on city land known as the Cultural Institutions Group, the damage is nowhere near what was expected. 
"A trustee asked me, 'Is this good enough to break out the Champagne?' " said Alan J. Friedman, director of the New York Hall of Science in Queens. "I said, 'No, but if you've got a bottle of beer, that would be appropriate.' "
"It's still the largest cut in our 20-year history," Mr. Friedman said. "So that's why it's sort of a beer celebration."
The cultural budget for fiscal year 2004 provides $118.8 million in expense funds , down from the $130.4 million initially budgeted last fiscal year. (Ultimately, $120.4 million of that was allocated.) 
City agencies often predict doom and gloom to engender support only to have the situation turn out better than anticipated. Because of the city's dire economic condition, however, this time arts groups believed the threat was more real. 
Cultural groups cautioned that there was still the annual November budget review ahead, when all of these gains could be undone. And the economy remains tough for cultural institutions, given that foreign tourists have yet to return in typical numbers since the terrorist attacks. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, for example, will see its city financing reduced by about $1.5 million under the new budget from its 2003 level of $ ll.8 million. "It's still not good in a period of rising costs and low attendance," said David E. McKinney, president of the museum. "The city is still a shrinking portion of our allocation."
"Still I'm relieved," he added. "I thought it could be a lot worse."
The Hall of Science will have its appropriation cut by $230,000, to $1.4 million -- a significant reduction but a marked improvement over the $580,000 decline required by the mayor's executive budget. Instead of eliminating 21 positions, the hall is likely to eliminate about 11 positions, Mr. Friedman said. 
Given that the city was trying to close a deficit estimated at $6.4 billion, cultural institutions said they had faced an especially difficult battle for their own interests.
"Making the case for the cultural institutions is always really tough," said Karen Brooks Hopkins, chairwoman of the Cultural Institutions Group and president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. 
"They can't really be measured against other city services," she said. "It's not about having garbage picked up or streets cleaned. It's like asking, 'Would you rather eat or see a play?' One is sustenance, the other is substance. They exist on a different level."
The restorations to the cultural budget were striking not only for the economic climate but also because they marked a new chapter in the political dance between Mayor Bloomberg and the City Council. Under the previous administration, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani cut the cultural budget and the Council put the money back. 
This time the mayor decided to restore $9.7 million to the cultural budget even before the Council put back $6.5 million. The result was a cut of about 9 percent over all from the amount budgeted last year.
This may have been because of the pressure brought to bear on the mayor by Council members and cultural groups. The mayor initially proposed cuts of 18 percent in January, which increased to 28 percent in April. 
But ultimately, Mr. Bloomberg restored money to the arts before being forced to, which at least some arts executives attribute to his longstanding commitment to culture as a private citizen and as he continues to give millions of dollars to institutions ranging from the Israel Museum to Lincoln Center.
"He came into office understanding the essential value of cultural institutions andartistic activity," said Randall Bourscheidt, president of the Alliance for the Arts, an advocacy group.
Cultural organizations say the mayor pushed them to lean on their private donors more heavily during the city's economic downturn. Mr. McKinney of the Met said this effort was based on the erroneous assumption that other people could contribute at the level of Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire. "Very few have his resources," Mr. McKinney said. "Many of our trustees have stepped up to a degree we appreciate. But it's difficult to raise money for straight operating expenses."
Ms. Hopkins said the mayor had come to realize that philanthropic dollars in a contracting market could not necessarily make up for a loss in city financing. 
"The part he had to be persuaded on was that we weren't going to pick it up with private donations," she said. "That finally got across."
Ms. Hopkins said the Council speaker, Gifford Miller, was also a key ally, "a champion for us." 
In an interview Mr. Miller said he was struck by the level of support for the arts among Council members, many new to their positions. 
"All members of the City Council feel very strongly about the importance of investing in the arts from an economic point of view and from a spiritual point of view," he said. "As a result, it remained a priority for everyone."

HEADLINE: Trade Pact With Pakistan Reflects Politics, Not Economics, Critics Say 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
When he took office two years ago, Robert B. Zoellick, the nation's top trade official, envisioned a ladder of trade agreements for countries interested in doing business with the United States. As a country improved its trading rules and showed a willingness to open its markets, it would step up to reduced tariffs and more intense economic relations.
 The Trade and Investment Framework Agreement that was signed last month with Pakistan was intended as the bottom rung. Yet it came into being largely as a result of political expediency, rather than the familiar economic motivation that trade helps both sides. Indeed, in the short term Pakistan may realize few tangible benefits, and its further progress up the ladder could depend more on politics than on economics. 
 To some analysts, the Bush administration's actions follow a clear pattern of putting political back-scratching ahead of economic considerations in the trade arena. 
"They have done a fairly good job of not giving away freebies without getting something in return," said Robert C. Fauver, a former economic adviser to the State Department who is now president of Fauver Associates, a consulting firm. "They wanted to really see how the president helped out in the search for Al Qaeda folks," he said, referring to Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the president of Pakistan.
As a result, said Vinod K. Aggarwal, director of the Berkeley Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Study Center at the University of California at Berkeley, politically motivated bilateral trade pacts may grab the spotlight away from the traditional focus of the United States -- the global trading system. "Favored countries get better treatment," he said, "and it doesn't really depend on your economic situation."
The framework agreement came with a promise from President Bush to seek $3 billion in aid for Pakistan from Congress. Yet the White House did not give away much on the trade front. The deal did not offer concessions to Pakistan's textile makers, which account for the majority of the country's exports to the United States. In fact, it only sets up annual talks that may or may not lead to freer trade.
"It's really a dialogue," said Richard Mills, a spokesman for Mr. Zoellick. "Sometimes you can have a TIFA with a country, and it can just lapse," he said, using the acronym for the agreement. "It is not in itself a demonstrator of further moves."
Two months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the United States pledged $600 million in economic assistance to Pakistan. The White House and Congress lifted trade sanctions that had been imposed in response to Pakistan's testing of nuclear weapons and the coup that brought its military government to power. But while the European Union quickly cut tariffs and raised quotas for Pakistan's textiles -- the country's main manufacturing output -- the United States waited, leaving many Pakistanis embittered.
Last February, the United States gave Pakistan a three-year package of trade bonuses, including the relaxation of quotas on certain textile imports. But many of the breaks affected products that Pakistan did not produce in substantial volume. Three weeks ago, Pakistan's commerce minister, Humayun Akhtar Khan, said that only about $20 million out of $143 million in potential benefits actually appeared in the first year.
The new framework agreement will have little effect on the well-being of the average Pakistani, said Teresita C. Schaffer, a former United States ambassador to Sri Lanka who is director of the South Asia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonpartisan research group. "The only thing that's going to make this agreement worth more than paper is private economic transactions."
Given the minimal scope ofthe agreement -- its articles take up just over a page -- why did it take so long to sign? Again, the experts said, the answer is in the politics. In addition to monitoring Pakistan's cooperation in rounding up members of Al Qaeda, Mr. Fauver said, the United States had to gauge how reaching out to Pakistan would affect relations with India, Pakistan's neighbor and constant adversary in territorial disputes.
Politics at home might also have contributed to the delay, especially with respect to trade in textiles. The White House may have viewed the negotiation of a more comprehensive deal with Pakistan as an unnecessary bother, Ms. Schaffer said. In 2005, quotas for textile imports by members of the World Trade Organization, including the United States and Pakistan, will disappear. "Giving up important political chips to liberalize textile exports gives you one, maybe two years of benefits," she said.
A senior United States trade official, who spoke by phone yesterday on condition of anonymity, also threw cold water on the idea of a substantial trade agreement with Pakistan, including textiles, before 2005.
"I don't rule it out completely, but I doubt it," the official said. "We have a textile industry ourselves that is in some peril, and we want to do nothing to put it into further peril. Pakistan is a friend of the U.S. So are many other countries that are textile exporters. I think it would be very unlikely that we would offer special benefits to Pakistan that we would not be prepared to offer other countries."
Yet, even in the Carolinas, where the textile industry is most entrenched, political analysts say, President Bush might have little to lose by doing Pakistan's economy a big favor.
"His support in North Carolina, and I'm sure it's even more so in South Carolina, is so rock solid that he could do anything to textiles and it would have no impact on it," said David Lowery, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Professor Lowery said that the White House also faced little formidable opposition from local senators. "You've got a freshman Republican senator sitting there, and you've got two Democrats," he said. "Bush doesn't need to worry about what any of them are going to do."
Yet in terms of monetary political contributions, the textile industry is not so far behind the steel producers, which received controversial protection from the administration last year. In the last electoral cycle, textile companies and workers gave $1.5 million to candidates and political parties (63 percent of that to Republicans), while the steel industry gave about $2.1 million (64 percent to Republicans), according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit research group. A bipartisan group of members of Congress also supports the industry through a textile caucus. 
Regardless of the political consequences at home, some issues have clearly moved off the table, at least with regard to trade. The sanctions the United States imposed on Pakistan in the past were meant to quell its nuclear ambitions and to ensure the return of a democratic, civilian government. Now, movement toward open markets may have little do do with those issues, given Pakistan's importance as an ally in the war on terror.
"I doubt the administration will want to link it to progress towards democracy," Ms. Schaffer said. "I don't think this administration is too committed to those policy goals in Pakistan." Even though Pakistan has failed to meet its self-imposed goals for democratization, she said, American officials "are inclined to let themselves be persuaded that what is happening is O.K."
And Professor Aggarwal pointed out that about half of the latest package of economic aid would arrive in the form of military hardware, which would not stimulate Pakistan's economy. "The approach the administration is taking doesn't make a lot of sense," he said. The military aid is "essentially propping up someone else who's not democratically elected."

HEADLINE: Judges Reject Suits Blaming Analysts For Losses 

BYLINE:  By LANDON THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
A federal judge said in a ruling announced yesterday that investors eager to take on risk were to blame for their own stock market losses and dismissed two class-action suits against Merrill Lynch that cited tainted research.
 A similar suit was also dismissed by another judge against Credit Suisse First Boston, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. 
 The ruling in favor of Merrill Lynch, with strong words from Judge Milton Pollack in Federal District Court in Manhattan, is likely to serve as a favorable precedent for investment banks in class-action suits that have been filed by individual investors. The banks are accused of having issued overly optimistic research reports to win investment banking business from the companies they covered. 
The ruling, dated Monday and announced yesterday, is likely to curb the increase in class-action suits against Wall Street firms and cause bruised investors to take their claims to arbitration panels, where the legal standard for proving that research contributed to their losses is lower.
In a blistering 43-page decision, Judge Pollack rejected the plaintiffs' arguments that Merrill Lynch was liable for their losses on stocks like 24/7 Media and Interliant because Merrill analysts may have been more concerned about maintaining banking ties with these companies than providing objective research. 
Lawyers for the investors contended that these banking ties, together with e-mail messages that showed analysts disparaging stocks they wrote of positively, were never disclosed. Consequently, Merrill's research should be regarded as fraudulent and directly responsible for the investors' losses, they said.
In Judge Pollack's view, however, it was the stock market crash that caused the losses. Investors who dabbled in speculative Internet stocks should have been aware of the risks involved, he said, and given the fact that these plaintiffs were not Merrill clients, they had no legal ground to bring suit.
"The record clearly reveals that plaintiffs were among the high-risk speculators who now hope to twist securities laws into a scheme of cost-free speculators insurance," Judge Pollack said in his decision. "Seeking to lay the blame for the enormous Internet bubble solely at the feet of Merrill Lynch, plaintiffs would have this court conclude that the federal securities laws were meant to underwrite, subsidize and encourage their rash speculation in joining a freewheeling casino that lured thousands obsessed with the fantasy of Olympian riches."
Interliant and 24/7 were two Internet stocks that Henry S. Blodget, then Merrill Lynch's Internet analyst, rated a "buy." They later fell more than 98 percent from their peaks. In April, Mr. Blodget was banned from the securities industry for issuing research reports that regulators said were tainted by investment banking concerns.
After the $1.4 billion settlement between banks and regulators over conflicts between research and investment banking, there has been a parade of arbitration cases and class-action suits by individual investors who said they were defrauded by tainted research.
Judge Pollack's decision is important in several respects: Not only did he say that Mr. Blodget's research failed to cause their losses, he said that Merrill Lynch had explicitly warned investors in its written research about the speculative nature of these investments.
Judge Pollack's decision also throws cold water on the strategy of using the e-mail messages made public during the investigation by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, to support their contention that Merrill Lynch analysts caused investor losses. 
Judge Pollack said that these messages were submitted as an affidavit to compel Merrill to release more documents and that they were never meant to be a judgment that the firm's clients lost money because of Mr. Blodget's research.
The fact that the decision came from Judge Pollack was also important. Judge Pollack, who is 96, has more than 40 years of experience in securities law. In 2001, he dismissed a similar class-action suit against Mary Meeker, Morgan Stanley's Internet analyst. 
He now has 25 similar class-action suits before him, all of which involve Internet research at Merrill Lynch. 
Some analysts think that these suits will be withdrawn and that the language used by Judge Pollack in his decision will make it more difficult for arbitration and class-action lawyers to win their cases.
"We believe research misrepresentation claims were more conspiracy theory than intelligent fact-based claims," David Trone, a securities analysts at Prudential Securities, said in a research report. "The plaintiffs had it backward -- Henry Blodget did not create 'the bubble,' 'the bubble' created Henry Blodget."
Arbitration lawyers contend that the decision will not affect their cases and that it was dismissed for good reason: the plaintiffs were not Merrill Lynch clients and never claimed to have actually read and relied on Mr. Blodget's research in making their decisions.
"These guys were jumping on the bandwagon," said Jacob Zamansky, an arbitration lawyer. "You have to show reliance, that's where the battle will be fought."
In the other case, another federal judge in Manhattan, Harold Baer Jr., dismissed a class-action suit brought against Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse First Boston and Goldman Sachs that contended that investors were misled by research issued by these banks on Covad, an Internet service provider. Plaintiffs said that positive research on the company was issued to attract banking business for the firms.
Judge Baer ruled that the investors failed to show sufficient evidence that losses in Covad were tied directly to misleading research. Nor were investors able to prove that research analysts for Covad were pressured by investment bankers to issue optimistic reports. Consequently, he said, the assertion that investors were misled by the analysts' recommendations on Covad was flawed.
The two decisions give a powerful psychological lift to Merrill Lynch and other investment banks whose research has been blamed for investor losses during the bear market. 
"This is clearly a victory," said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor of securities law at Columbia University. "Judge Pollack has the view that what caused the decline in shares for investors was the collapse of the bubble, not the research itself. He has raised a number of obstacles for plaintiffs in these types of suits."

HEADLINE: SHARON AND ABBAS STAND SIDE BY SIDE, THEN BEGIN TALKS 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 1 

 BODY:
Appearing side by side before meeting here this evening, the Israeli and Palestinian prime ministers declared mutual respect and expressed hopes for peace, while Israeli forces prepared to withdraw Wednesday from the West Bank town of Bethlehem.
 Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel said he envisioned a joint "future of hope and prospects, which seems to be -- perhaps now more than ever -- within reach." His Palestinian counterpart, Mahmoud Abbas, said it was time to "put the past behind us" and declared: "Each life that is lost is a human tragedy. No more suffering, no more death, no more pain." 
 Then, with their top advisers, the prime ministers sat down for more than two hours in what a senior Israeli official called "one of the most important confidence-building meetings between the Israelis and Palestinians." 
It was the fourth meeting between the two -- including one with President Bush at a summit meeting last month in Aqaba, Jordan -- but it was the first time that they chose to appear publicly together, on their own. The intense pressure from Americans, Europeans and others that has brought them to this point was invisible today, in contrast to the Aqaba meeting.
The imagery, broadcast live on Israeli and Palestinian television, was of two leaders in business suits, each patiently waiting for his remarks to be translated into the other's language, and intently listening to his counterpart. 
Speaking outside his office here in the mellowing light of late afternoon, Mr. Sharon directed some of his comments to Palestinians, just as Mr. Abbas directed some of his to Israelis. Each said his goal was a life in peace, side by side. 
"Our struggle is a political struggle, which we will end through diplomatic means," Mr. Abbas said. "We have no hostility toward the Israeli people, and we have no interest in continuing the struggle with you."
Then, with no mediators to draw them together, the two men stepped toward each other and, smiling, shook hands with apparent warmth. 
It was a striking moment for Israelis and Palestinians who suffered through the violence of the last 33 months -- the suicide bombings on Israeli buses and the smashing of Palestinian homes -- and witnessed the chasm it opened between the two sides. As they stood close together, Mr. Abbas drew back his head and appeared to chuckle at a joke by Mr. Sharon, characterized for years by Palestinians as "the butcher."
Although out of sight today, American pressure was present nonetheless, according to some officials on its receiving end. They said Bush administration officials had urged them to sound more positive about their encounters.
During the meeting, Mr. Abbas again asked Israel to permit Yasir Arafat, the pre-eminent Palestinian leader, to travel freely. Mr. Sharon replied that Israel would permit Mr. Arafat to travel only one way from the West Bank city of Ramallah, where he has been trapped for a year, to Gaza City, in the Gaza Strip, officials on both sides said. Mr. Sharon made the same proposal in April 2002 in an interview with The New York Times.
But Mr. Sharon indicated new flexibility on another matter, the release of some 5,000 Palestinian prisoners now in Israeli jails. When pressed about that matter, a top priority for Palestinians but not an aspect of a new American-backed peace plan, Mr. Sharon replied that he had asked Israel's internal security agency to determine which prisoners could be safely freed. Israel intends to hold onto those with "blood on their hands," Israeli officials said.
A Palestinian official said Muhammed Dahlan, the Palestinian minister of security, warned that the issue of prisoners was "undermining the Palestinian Authority and whittling away Palestinian support."
To gauge progress under the peace plan, known as the road map, the two prime ministers agreed to establish joint committees, with American participation, to monitor four areas, including security, economic growth, incitement to violence and legal and political differences, Israeli officials said.
Raanan Gissin, Mr. Sharon's spokesman, called the meeting "very positive" and "businesslike," free of the recriminations of past sessions.
"I think there is a basic understanding on both sides: 'Let's make less declarations and more troop withdrawals and troop deployments,' " he said, referring to Israel's gradual return of policing responsibility to Palestinian officers for what by previous agreement are Palestinian-controlled areas of the West Bank and Gaza.
Before the leaders met, violence flared again today, as what the Israeli army described as a lone Palestinian gunman attacked an Israeli roadblock near the West Bank city of Tulkarm. 
Soldiers returned fire and killed the man, the army said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades, an offshoot of Mr. Abbas' Fatah movement, is highly active in the area. It was that group that took responsibility for the sniper killing on Monday of a foreign worker driving an Israeli truck through the West Bank. 
The three leading Palestinian factions -- Fatah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad -- announced on Sunday that they were suspending attacks against Israelis.
The pleasant words this evening disguised deep disagreements between the two sides over the peace plan, including the future of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. Yet progress was made on the plan today. 
On Sunday night and Monday, Israeli forces released their hold on most Palestinian-controlled areas of the Gaza Strip. 
Today, workers in the northern Gaza town of Beit Hanun labored in clouds of dust to repair sewer lines crushed by Israeli armor, as heavy machinery cleared away the debris choking streets. 
In Bethlehem, just south of Jerusalem, Israeli trucks carted away some equipment in preparation for the broader withdrawal. Israeli troops will continue to ring Bethlehem, maintaining checkpoints at its exits.
Israel has also dug ditches and strung barbed wire partly around Bethlehem over the last year in what it calls a bulwark against terrorist attacks.

HEADLINE: Bush Team Says It's Weighing Intervention in Liberia's Torment 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said today that it was considering whether to intervene to halt fierce fighting in Liberia between rebel groups and the government of President Charles Taylor. The White House also declared that it had not ruled out sending in American troops as part of an international peacekeeping force.
 President Bush discussed the issue this morning at a meeting of the National Security Council after several days of intense discussions involving the Pentagon and the State Department, administration officials said. 
 The White House later directed the Pentagon to refine the proposals being discussed, especially the possibility of having the United States lead a peacekeeping force that would also draw from a number of African countries, military officials said. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell spoke about Liberia today with Kofi Annan, the secretary general of the United Nations, the State Department said. 
Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said the administration was "actively discussing what the next step should be" to help end the fighting in Liberia, a West African country that has had close ties to the United States since its founding by freed American slaves in 1847.
"The president is determined to help the people of Liberia find a path to peace," Mr. Fleischer said. "The exact steps that could be taken are still under review."
Asked if he would rule out American troops going to Liberia, Mr. Fleischer replied, "I'm not ruling it out."
The United States has come under increasing pressure from the United Nations, Britain, France and West African countries to take a more active role in quelling the unrest. Last week Mr. Bush called on Mr. Taylor to make good on a promise to step aside as part of a cease-fire agreed to last month.
Nigeria was considering offering Mr. Taylor asylum if he agreed to step down, though the terms of his possible departure were sure to be complicated by his indictment last month on war crimes charges by a court run by the United Nations and neighboring Sierra Leone.
American officials signaled that they would be unenthusiastic about a deal that let Mr. Taylor escape prosecution. 
"We support the court," said Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman.
In London, a member of Mr. Taylor's government told reporters that the Liberian leader, who was elected in 1997 after leading a long rebellion against the previous government, would only agree to step aside after a comprehensive peace deal was worked out.
"You won't have Charles Taylor to kick around any more," the government official, Samuel Jackson, Liberia's minister of state for economic and financial affairs, said in a report by Reuters. "We look forward to working out details of an orderly exit of our government."
Secretary General Annan told reporters in Switzerland that the situation demanded "a country with military capacity that can deploy a robust force -- it doesn't have to be very large -- that can make a difference on the ground and team up with West African forces."
With Mr. Bush scheduled to visit Africa next week for the first time as president, the administration appeared eager to avoid having him portrayed as standing by while Liberia degenerated further into violence.
Yet former administration officials said there was reluctance at the Pentagon to get involved in a complex and violent dispute that does not involve a compelling issue of national security for the United States, especially when American troops are already deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan.
On Monday, Ambassador James B. Cunningham, Washington's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, told colleagues that the United States could send troops in the event of a peaceful negotiated settlement supported by other countries and on condition that President Taylor step down and turn himself over to the special court in Sierra Leone.
In Abidjan, Ivory Coast, the British ambassador to the United Nations, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, told reporters that the Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo, was considering an offer of asylum to Mr. Taylor but had yet to announce a decision publicly. 
"It is his decision to make public in his own time," Sir Jeremy said. "We understand that is something he is considering."
He said Nigeria does not have a law that would allow it to extradite Mr. Taylor to Sierra Leone to face the war crimes tribunal. The prosecutor for the special court unsealed the indictment against Mr. Taylor last month while the Liberian president was in Ghana for a regional conference on ending the violence. 
"I thought the timing was problematic," one West African diplomat at the United Nations said today. "Now he's a man with his back against the wall."
Rather than face trial, the diplomat said, Mr. Taylor might revert to his former role as a rebel commander, leading a guerrilla fight against whatever government replaces his.
At the State Department, Mr. Boucher said that Monrovia, the Liberian capital, was calm today and that an international team made up primarily of representatives from West African countries and a retired American military officer would travel to Liberia on Wednesday to begin implementing the cease-fire. 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 4, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about the possibility of American involvement in an international peacekeeping force in Liberia misstated the nature of the special court in neighboring Sierra Leone that is investigating war crimes there and has charged the leader of Liberia, Charles Taylor, with crimes against humanity. The court was created through an agreement between the government of Sierra Leone and the United Nations. But it is independent of both institutions, and staffed by both foreigners and citizens of Sierra Leone.
A related article on Wednesday included a United States diplomat's erroneous account of the position laid out on Monday by James B. Cunningham, the deputy representative at the United Nations, during a closed session of the Security Council. American officials now say Mr. Cunningham did not make American intervention contingent upon the surrender of Charles Taylor to the court in Sierra Leone.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: THE PRESIDENT; 
Bush Says Attacks on U.S. Forces Won't Deter Him From the Rebuilding of Iraq

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1 

 BODY:
President Bush vowed today to stay with the job of stabilizing and rebuilding Iraq, saying continued attacks on United States forces there would not deter him from what he cast as a lengthy mission to reduce threats from the Middle East.
 "The rise of Iraq as an example of moderation and democracy and prosperity is a massive and long-term undertaking," Mr. Bush said in a speech to military personnel at the White House. "And the restoration of that country is critical to the defeat of terror and radicalism throughout the Middle East." 
 Mr. Bush's comments came on another day of violence in Iraq, including attacks that left at least six American soldiers injured. His speech appeared intended both to raise military morale in the face of difficult conditions and to address questions from Congress and other nations about how the United States will deal with the persistent violence and lawlessness that have marred the battlefield victory over Saddam Hussein's forces.
Mr. Bush did not say how long he expected American forces to remain in Iraq, or in what numbers, and he did not mention his administration's efforts to persuade other nations to send troops to Iraq. He said his goal remained "a swift transition to Iraqi control of their own affairs," and he cited progress in rebuilding the country and moving toward the establishment of an Iraqi government.
But he also sent a clear signal that the attacks, which he attributed to Saddam Hussein loyalists and terrorist groups, would not lead him to cut and run.
"The looting and random violence that began in the immediate aftermath of the war remains a challenge in some places," Mr. Bush said in his address, delivered in the East Room to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the all-volunteer armed forces.
"A greater challenge comes from former Baath Party and security officials who will stop at nothing to regain their power and their privilege," he said. "But there will be no return to tyranny in Iraq. And those who threaten the order and stability of that country will face ruin, just as surely as the regime they once served."
Without providing new evidence, the president also reiterated that terrorist groups continued to operate in Iraq. He pointed in particular to Ansar al-Islam, which he said was "now active in the Sunni heartland of the country," and to terrorists associated with Abu Masab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian identified by the United States as a lieutenant of Osama bin Laden.
"These groups believe they have found an opportunity to harm America, to shake our resolve in the war on terror and to cause us to leave Iraq before freedom is fully established," Mr. Bush said. "They are wrong, and they will not succeed."
Mr. Bush also used the speech to lay out the progress of the broader war against terrorists. He said 65 percent of Al Qaeda's leaders and operational managers had been killed or captured since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, and he cited recent successes by Saudi Arabia in hunting down terrorists on its soil.
As Mr. Bush and his top advisers voice assurances that the difficult postwar mission is on track, Defense and State Department officials are pressing to increase allied contributions to the overwhelmingly American occupation force.
There are practical, diplomatic and political reasons for changing the complexion of that force, which now consists of 146,000 Americans and about 12,000 allied troops.
A more international force in Iraq would allow increasingly weary American troops to go home and slash the expense of an operation that is costing the Pentagon $3 billion a month. Some soldiers in the Army's Third Infantry Division have been deployed for more than a year, and are publicly criticizing their mission.
Additional allied forces would allow Washington to claim broader international support, and would bring in lighter forces that in some cases would be better suited for urban peacekeeping.
"It would put a more international flavor on what's going on, and those forces are generally lighter than our mechanized and armor units," Jay Garner, a retired Army lieutenant general who initially led the reconstruction effort in Iraq, said in an interview.
Under the Pentagon's current plans, there would be at least two and possibly three divisions of allied forces, each made up of 10,000 to 14,000 troops.
Britain would lead one division, which would include troops from countries like Denmark and the Netherlands. Poland, with logistical and training help from NATO, would lead a second division. The Pentagon is also negotiating with India to send several thousand troops and lead a third division.
Senators Richard Lugar, Republican of Indiana, and Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, have urged the administration to settle their differences with allies like France, Germany and Turkey, which opposed the Iraq war, and seek their help. So far, however, only the Turks have been contacted, diplomats said.
The administration is also coming under growing pressure from Republicans and Democrats in Congress to share the burdens of the complex mission, and to acknowledge that rebuilding Iraq will require a lengthy commitment of American troops, treasure and political will.
"We need to involve the world, the globe, because we're talking about freedom," Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, said Sunday on the ABC News program "This Week." 
Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, a Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, offered a grim assessment after visiting Basra and Baghdad this week.
"It's a race against time," Mr. Reed said in a telephone interview today from Kuwait. "We have to re-establish security and reinvigorate the economy before this insurgent, irregular force gets more organized and taps into regular Iraqis' discontent."
Pentagon officials say 24 countries, including Italy, Ukraine, Honduras and Denmark, have promised to provide ground troops in Iraq. American officials are negotiating with 12 other countries, including India and Pakistan, for their support.
"I don't know how anyone can internationalize it more than that," Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld told reporters on Monday.
But translating promises into troops on the ground who fit the needs of a complex and dangerous operation is difficult, military officials said.
"People are queuing up, and it's not a simple thing to do," Mr. Rumsfeld said. "They've got to figure out what it is they've got to contribute, what it is we need, how they might fit in, what kinds of equipment they need, when they might be able to do it, how long they might be able to stay. It's a very complicated thing."

HEADLINE: Boeing Wins AirTran Deal Over Airbus For 56 Planes 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
AirTran Airways said yesterday that it had completed a deal with the Boeing Company to add six 717's to its fleet and take delivery of 50 737's by 2008. The order will allow AirTran to add more transcontinental routes and possibly start service to Mexico, Canada and the Caribbean, its executives said.
 The plane order is among the largest of the year and one that Boeing and Airbus, based in France, competed ferociously to win. 
 AirTran, a low-cost airline based in Orlando, Fla., has the option to order 50 more 737's and four more 717's. It also has the option to convert planes in its initial order of 737-700's to 737-800's, as long as executives notify Boeing at least 15 months before delivery, Joe Leonard, the chief executive of AirTran, said in a phone interview.
The book value of the six 717's is $225 million, said Trish York, a Boeing spokeswoman. The value of 50 737-700's is $2.5 billion. If all of those were converted to 737-800's, the value would be $3 billion. But aircraft are almost always sold at a discount, and many industry experts say buyers have a lot of negotiating leverage right now because the big airlines are shrinking their fleets.
Of the 50 definite orders for 737's, only 28 will be reported as new orders by Boeing. The rest will be leased from GE Capital and are already accounted for in that company's backlog of orders, said Eric Jones, a spokesman for GE Capital. He added that the first leased plane would be delivered to AirTran in September 2004 straight from Boeing's assembly line.
The six 717's count as new orders. That means Boeing will have 34 new orders from the deal. The sales are sorely needed by Boeing, which has been surpassed by Airbus in the number of orders in recent years.
On Monday, All Nippon Airways, based in Japan, said it was purchasing 45 737-700's from Boeing. That announcement was widely expected.
Mr. Leonard, the AirTran chief executive, said his airline had one month to work out seat configurations and a delivery schedule. Boeing, based in Chicago, will deliver about one 737 a month. The first 717 could arrive within the first three months of next year, he said.
AirTran will configure the 737-700's to have 12 seats in business class and about 135 seats in economy class, Mr. Leonard said. The 737-800's will have about 160 seats in economy class.
AirTran now has 64 717's in its fleet and is taking delivery of several more this year. Mr. Leonard said clauses in earlier contracts with Boeing for those 717's helped sway the decision toward Boeing on the latest order. He added that GE Capital and Boeing together were able to offer a more attractive financial package than Airbus and the International Lease Finance Corporation, which is based in Los Angeles and competes in the leasing business with GE Capital.

HEADLINE: Fiat Will Sell Aerospace Division for $1.7 Billion 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SYLVERS 

DATELINE: MILAN, July 2 

 BODY:
The Italian conglomerate Fiat took another step today in its efforts to turn itself around and return to profitability when it agreed to sell its aerospace components business, FiatAvio, for about 1.5 billion euros, or $1.73 billion.
 Finmeccanica, Italy's government-controlled defense company, and the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm in the United States, will make the purchase through a specially created acquisition company, Avio Holding. Finmeccanica will own 30 percent of Avio Holding and Carlyle will own the rest. 
 The sale comes less than a week after Fiat announced a share sale of almost 2 billion euros and a turnaround plan for its money-losing auto unit that includes cost cuts and large investments as the company tries to regain market share. Fiat is also laying off more than 12,000 employees, mostly outside of its carmaking business, after already having let go 8,100 people in the last year.
The turnaround plan is dependent on money raised in various asset sales, including FiatAvio and Fiat's insurance unit, Toro Assicurazioni, which was sold earlier this year. Analysts and credit-rating agencies have questioned Fiat's decision to sell profitable businesses, like Toro and FiatAvio, to invest in the car unit, which is not forecast to return to the black until 2007. Fiat forecasts that on a consolidated basis it will become profitable in 2006.
FiatAvio, which builds engines for commercial and military aircraft, has 14 factories and more than 5,000 employees. Last year, the company earned 116 million euros on sales of 1.5 billion euros, less than 3 percent of Fiat's total revenue. The automaking unit provides more than half of the company's total sales.
A group of banks, including Banca Intesa, Lehman Brothers, Citigroup and Goldman, Sachs, will provide an unspecified amount of the financing for the acquisition. Finmeccanica said that the 150 million euros that it would contribute would come from cash on hand.
With the proceeds, Fiat said it would be able to slice 1.4 billion euros, or $1.62 billion, off its debt. Fiat's 6.2 billion euro debt load has become a flash point for investors since the two major credit-rating agencies, Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, cut the company's standing to below investment grade. That has forced Fiat to turn to the equity market rather than the bond market. It will offer 1.84 billion euros in shares next week.
Giuseppe Morchio, who took over as chief executive in February and is the fourth person to hold the post in the past year, said last week that he thought that Fiat could regain its investment-grade rating by 2006. Mr. Morchio has his hands full as he tries to grapple with Fiat's worst-ever financial crisis. In addition to trying to return the car unit to profitability, Mr. Morchio has creditors to worry about. Major creditors, which include Italy's largest banks, gave Fiat a 3-billion-euro loan last year that is convertible into stock.
If Fiat cannot repay the loan and the banks convert their debt into shares, the Agnelli family, which has owned Fiat since its founding more than 100 years ago and still controls 30 percent of the stock, would lose its grip on the company.
The sale of FiatAvio still requires the approval of antitrust authorities and is expected to be concluded by the end of the year. Goldman, Sachs and Lehman Brothers advised Carlyle on the acquisition while Mediobanca advised Finmeccanica. Fiat had been in talks to sell FiatAvio since at least February.

HEADLINE: TURF; 
For Home Buyers, Fear of Commitment

BYLINE:  By MOTOKO RICH 

 BODY:
LAST year, Jeff Holthaus, a 36-year-old engineer in Chicago, decided he was ready to settle down. But he had a commitment problem. Sure, he had his reasons. First, he had to figure out what he wanted. Then his company decided to move to Michigan, so he had to find a new job. And it wasn't always about him, either. In one case, he was the one who was rejected.
 Then, in April, he thought he had found The One, until, at the last minute, he backed out of it: a two-bedroom condo in Bucktown, an up-and-coming neighborhood in Chicago. For Connie Grunwaldt, Mr. Holthaus's real estate agent, it was like watching a bridegroom run away from the altar. 
 "He sent me over the edge," said Ms. Grunwaldt, who said she had showed Mr. Holthaus 92 apartments over the previous year. 
Mr. Holthaus, who finally signed a contract in May and moved into a two-bedroom, $271,000 apartment in the Old Town section of Chicago last weekend, said that because it was his first time buying a home, he was "somewhat apprehensive and worried about having buyer's remorse." And having just gone through a job change, "there was some nervousness due to the economy and the instability of the future."
He may be extreme, but Mr. Holthaus is not unique. According to Ms. Grunwaldt, buyers with the jitters are on the increase -- so much so that she is now writing up two contracts for every buyer, on average, compared with just one at the same time last year. The faltering is most evident, she said, among first-time buyers. "They're thrilled with the fact that interest rates are low, and they're jumping on without thinking it through," she said. "Then when they get into the process, they realize, 'Whoa!' "
Although interest rates are at 45-year lows and the housing market continues to zip along, real estate agents in many cities have noted the emergence of cold feet. Buyers are becoming confused by contradictory economic signals and worry that the housing market may have hit its peak.
For sellers, the hesitation can be more than irksome. David Lew, a 40-year-old investment banker in Manhattan, said that five different times since April, he thought he had sold his one-bedroom co-op apartment in Murray Hill. Each time, he accepted an offer and sent out a contract.
Mr. Lew, who has already moved with his wife to a two-bedroom Midtown apartment they bought last summer, has been surprised by all the stumbles. "It's contrary to what I had heard before I put my apartment on the market," he said.
"I was reading that the one-bedroom market is holding up" because of low interest rates, he added. "But it's the intangibles, like 8 percent unemployment in New York and the economic uncertainty that has led to what's going on now. It's frustrating with all this last-minute disappointment." Mr. Lew said he had accepted the fifth offer a week ago, but yesterday his real estate agent, Daniel Ruiz of Brown Harris Stevens in Manhattan, said the buyer had backed out.
Mr. Ruiz said in an earlier interview that buyers are starting to perceive a shift in the market. "There's this sense that people can walk away from things and there is plenty of other stuff on the market," he said. In May, he said, out of 14 accepted offers that his office handled, only 7 went to closing; in June, 8 out of 17 deals fell apart.
In the San Francisco region, some real estate agents report a rise in the number of buyers pulling out of deals. Jeff Sterley, a broker with Pacific Union Residential Brokerage in suburban Greenbrae, Calif., said that 30 percent of accepted offers are now being broken, up from 20 percent a year ago and 10 percent three years ago.
And in New Jersey, Jay Schweppe, chief executive of Schweppe & Company Realtors of Montclair, the number of deals that fall apart is up 50 percent since last year. "When you put the pressure of a six-year run of appreciation, all of a sudden people are asking, 'Am I buying at the top of the marketplace?' " Mr. Schweppe said.
In some cases, it's not the buyers who are pulling out, but their bankers. In Brockton, Mass., near Boston, Stephen Damon, office manager of Jack Conway Real Estate, said three of his deals had fallen apart in the past month because the lenders decided at the last minute that the buyers' finances did not qualify them for a mortgage. "When it comes down to the nitty-gritty, sundry things happen, and they're denied," Mr. Damon said. By now, the low interest rates have drawn most of the financially stable buyers into the market, and some with shakier credit histories are trying to sign up for mortgages.
In New York, another deal-breaking factor is the co-op board. While many buyers can get a mortgage, they may not have the wherewithal to pass stringent board requirements.
Carol Shainswit, a broker in the Midtown office of the Corcoran Group, said she is representing the seller of a three-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side who has had to turn away three offers because the buyers were unlikely to pass muster in the building.
Indeed, many brokers report that co-op boards have gotten tougher over the past year or two and that rejections are up. "Buildings pull up the gangplank when they're worried that the financial environment is touchy," said Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Associates in Manhattan.
Some boards are asking for liquid assets that are two or three times the purchase price of the apartment. Evelyn Cole, a broker at Stribling & Associates, said that some Upper West Side buildings were raising their requirements for the cash portion of a deal to 35 percent, from 25.
The real estate markets are by no means collapsing. In May, the last month for which figures are available, sales of existing homes rose to 5.92 million units, 4.4 percent more than in May of last year, according to the National Association of Realtors in Washington. Historically low mortgage rates continue to drive the market, and in many areas, properties favored by entry-level buyers are still generating bidding wars.
But while many first-time buyers are driven by the attractive trade-off between rents and mortgage payments, buyers hoping to move to larger homes are frightened by the shaky economic recovery.
Late last month, for example, the owners of a three-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side thought they had sold the unit for $2.7 million when the buyers, a couple with three children who wanted a bigger place, decided to pull out. Peter Marra, president of the William B. May real estate agency, said the husband called and said: "You know what, a couple of guys in my department were let go, and I'm concerned. This is a big commitment, so I'm just going to stay where I am for a while."
Jon Hyde, a 61-year-old retired advertising executive in northern California, said such jitteriness nearly drove him mad when he sold his family's home recently. By the time he moved out of the house this week, three separate would-be buyers had tied it up in escrow for several weeks each before pulling out of the deals.
Each time he received an offer for the place, a three-bedroom secluded wood house in the San Rafael hills that he had owned for 19 years, he asked to meet the buyers and show them around the property.
"It was a pleasure for me to meet the next owner of my house," Mr. Hyde said. But after three failed deals, he said, "it got to the point where I would have sold it to bin Laden."
"Of course," he added, "I would have turned him in."
In the end, Mr. Hyde sold the house to a divorced man for $1.18 million, down from an original asking price of $1.25 million. This time, Mr. Hyde stayed out of the process. As he put it, "I felt I was in a position where I had to lower the price, be flexible, keep my mouth shut and stay out of the way."

HEADLINE: Gucci's Earnings Decline 97% As Tourism Slump Hurts Stores 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SYLVERS 

DATELINE: MILAN, July 2 

 BODY:
The Gucci Group said today that its first-quarter earnings plunged 97 percent as the company suffered through the effects of the war in Iraq, an epidemic in Asia and a strengthening euro.
 Much of the shopping at Gucci's biggest stores around the world is done by tourists who tend to spend more when they are on vacation. But fears of terrorism and severe acute respiratory syndrome kept many tourists at home this spring. Fewer travelers also meant lower sales at Gucci's duty-free shops in airports. 
 And with consumer confidence sagging, Gucci and its rivals are struggling to persuade shoppers to spend hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars for their shoes and bags.
"They had many things working against them in the quarter, and there was not much more they could have done," said Patrizio Pazzaglia, the head of asset management in Italy for Bank Insinger de Beaufort, a Dutch bank. "We will see the same story repeated when other luxury-goods companies report in the coming weeks."
Gucci earned 1.2 million euros ($1.4 million) in the three months ended April 30, compared with 35.5 million euros in the same period last year. Revenue declined about 7 percent, and the company reported its first operating loss since it first sold shares to the public eight years ago.
The strength of the euro, which has risen about 15 percent this year against the dollar, also hurt Gucci's results. The Italian company, which is registered in the Netherlands, has less profit when it converts earnings made in dollars, yen and other currencies into euros.
In addition to selling clothing, shoes, jewelry and bags under its own name, Gucci owns the Yves Saint Laurent, Stella McCartney, Alexander McQueen and Bottega Veneta brands. The French retailer Pinault-Printemps-Redoute owns a majority of Gucci's shares and has agreed to buy the remaining 36 percent by the end of next year.
In an interview with Reuters, the chief executive of Gucci, Domenico de Sole, called the combination of factors that hurt tourism and the economy a "perfect storm." 
But he was upbeat about the rest of the year, saying there were indications that the current quarter would be "dramatically different" from the first quarter. "I expect a significant improvement," he told Reuters. "The only areas that remain soft are Italy and France, because tourism is not back." 
American depository shares of Gucci rose 61 cents today, to $98.71, on the New York Stock Exchange. When the world's $60 billion luxury-goods industry does make a comeback -- and some analysts say that might not happen until at least the beginning of next year -- and when Americans and Japanese again visit Europe in droves, Gucci will be in a good position to benefit, Mr. Pazzaglia of Bank Insinger de Beaufort said. 
"Gucci is hurting now because of a lot of factors outside of its control, but it remains a brand with worldwide recognition that people are willing to pay a premium for," he said.

HEADLINE: New Overtime Rules 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Democrats Protest Changes to Overtime Rules" (news article, July 1), you note that our institute finds that under the proposed new rules, millions more workers would become ineligible for overtime pay than is estimated by the Bush administration. 
 The reason for this disparity is critical to evaluating the administration's proposal. Its claim that only 640,000 workers would be shifted from hourly to salaried status (and thus lose overtime pay) comes from an analysis that considers only those workers currently working overtime. But if the new rules become law, employers will have a huge financial incentive -- one that does not currently exist -- to reclassify more than five million hourly workers as salaried. 
 The administration's estimate completely ignores this new incentive, leading to a vastly misleading undercount of the impact of the proposed change.

HEADLINE: Investor Suit Against Merrill Lynch Is Dismissed 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A federal judge yesterday dismissed a lawsuit that said a conflict of interest at Merrill Lynch caused the sharp drop in a technology-stock mutual fund after the dot-com bubble burst three years ago.
 Investors had contended that Merrill's Global Technology Fund invested in stocks whose prices had been pumped up by misleading positive research reports from Merrill analysts in hopes of luring investment banking business. 
 But Judge Milton Pollack of Federal District Court in Manhattan, who dismissed two similar suits earlier in the week, ruled that the Merrill fund was separate from Merrill's brokerage and investment banking arms. 
Even if there was an apparent conflict of interest, the judge ruled, the conflict was public knowledge long before the market for technology stocks peaked in 2000 and began its steep decline.
Judge Pollack also noted that news reports had warned investors about the appearance of a conflict "for years before the amazing boom of the market initially rewarded those who disregarded such caveats."
The fund traded at more than $32 in March 2000, when the market peaked. It declined to $7.63 in early April 2002 and has been trading at $6.25 this week.
A spokesman for Merrill Lynch said the firm was reviewing the decision and had no immediate comment. Daniel W. Krasner, a lead lawyer representing the investors, also said he had no immediate comment.
In a ruling announced on Tuesday, Judge Pollack dismissed two suits that contended tainted Merrill research was responsible for their losses in two Internet companies after the bubble burst.
In that decision, Judge Pollack wrote that some Internet-stock investors were no more than "high-risk speculators" who never would have sued if they had made money in their stocks rather than losing it.
The judge wrote that "plaintiffs would have this court conclude that the federal securities laws were meant to underwrite, subsidize and encourage their rash speculation in joining a freewheeling casino that lured thousands obsessed with the fantasy of Olympian riches."
Judge Pollack is overseeing at least two dozen other similar suits against Merrill.

Factory Orders and Computer Sector Lead Shares Higher

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday after Merrill Lynch told investors to buy shares of Microsoft, spurring a rally in computer-related companies.
 The Nasdaq composite index jumped 38.60 points, or 2.4 percent, to 1,678.73, its highest point since May 2002. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 11.43 points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 993.75, and the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 101.89 points, or 1.1 percent, to 9,142.84. 
 Stocks rose after government figures showed an unexpected increase in factory orders in May. Some investors predicted that the lowest interest rates in 45 years and a $350 billion package of federal tax cuts would spur spending by consumers and businesses. 
"Everything's in place to continue the rally into the third quarter," said Dan Lewis, who helps manage $2 billion at Trusco Capital Management in Orlando, Fla. "The tax cuts are in place and interest rates are low. All eyes will be focused on second-quarter earnings," he said, for evidence that profit growth is accelerating.
Microsoft, which was added to Merrill's "Focus One List," rose 73 cents, to $26.88. It surpassed General Electric as the world's largest company by market value.
An analyst, Jason Maynard, raised his Microsoft rating to buy from neutral, citing better personal computer sales and expectations that the company may increase its annual dividend to as much as 26 cents from 8 cents. The stock will reach $30 in 12 months, Mr. Maynard predicted. He also increased his 2004 profit forecast to $1.09 a share from $1.04. 
Wal-Mart Stores gained $1.38, to $55.73, after it was also added to the list of favorite stocks at Merrill. Daniel Barry, another analyst, said Wal-Mart's sales growth would accelerate.
Factory orders rose for the second month in the last three. Orders gained 0.4 percent, to $320.6 billion, the Commerce Department said, more than the $320 billion expected by economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Investors will get more data on the economy this morning. A government report will probably show no change in payroll employment for June after the loss of 342,000 jobs in the previous six months, according to a survey of economists.
The nation's stock exchanges will close at 1 p.m. today and will remain closed on Friday for Independence Day.

Treasury Prices Increase
By Reuters
The price of Treasuries rose yesterday, reversing early losses as traders adjusted their portfolios ahead of today's June jobs report.
In defiance of a technology-led rally in stocks, bonds cast off a morning rout to march into positive ground amid talk in the market that a large bidder for five-year notes had triggered the buying spree.
Bonds were hurt earlier by optimism in global markets, based partly on a rosy reading of this week's mixed bag of economic figures. The cheery mood had lifted European and Japanese equities and carried forward into Wall Street's trading session.
Treasuries have bounced back and forth in a tight range over the last few days, and yesterday was no different.
The potential for terrorist warnings over the weekend as Americans prepare for the Independence Day holiday was a possible driver of the bid for safe-haven government debt, said Vincent Verterano, head government bond trader at Nomura Securities International.
He added that while there was more room for selling in Treasuries over the coming weeks, bonds would be attractive for a while since "the economy is going nowhere quick."
The 10-year Treasury note increased 4/32, to a price of 100 24/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, decreased to 3.53 percent from 3.55 percent on Tuesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond gained 3/32, to 112 12/32. The bond's yield declined to 4.58 percent from 4.59 percent on Tuesday.
There was widespread suspicion in the markets that last week's quarter of a point rate cut in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve was the last in the cycle, which prevented bonds from climbing any higher.
"The last few years have seen the best bull market for bonds ever, and now with the Fed sidelined, investors are wondering what else can drag yields lower," said Jack Malvey, global fixed-income strategist at Lehman Brothers.
Frustration that the Fed did not deliver a larger rate cut prompted a sharp sell-off and has relegated bonds to a tight range, with yields well above the historic lows hit in the run-up to the central bank's meeting.

HEADLINE: Finance Chief Is Resigning at Troubled Advertising Company 

BYLINE:  By NAT IVES 

 BODY:
The Interpublic Group of Companies said yesterday that Sean F. Orr, the chief financial officer during its recent troubles, would step down, effective at the end of August.
 Mr. Orr, 48, who is also an executive vice president at Interpublic, the big advertising agency company, became chief financial officer four years ago. For almost a year, he has endured setbacks and surprises as Interpublic, which owns agencies like Campbell-Ewald, Deutsch and McCann-Erickson, suffered through accounting irregularities that eventually totaled $181.3 million; steep losses at a motor sports division; earnings shortfalls and restatements; the suspension of its dividend; and investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service. 
 Christopher J. Coughlin, 50, who joined Interpublic two months ago in the new post of chief operating officer as part of the company's efforts to right itself, will assume Mr. Orr's title and duties.
The hiring of Mr. Coughlin, who had been chief financial officer at companies like Pharmacia, renewed widespread speculation that Mr. Orr might soon become the second top executive at Interpublic to step down since February.
Since the initial discovery of the accounting irregularities in August, Mr. Orr has overseen a vigorous audit by outsiders that led to several earnings restatements and the dismissal of finance executives at the company's agencies. He also recently helped to renegotiate Interpublic's debt with a consortium of banks and helped arrange the sale of a research division, the NFO WorldGroup, to Taylor Nelson Sofres in London for $435 million. Interpublic expects that deal to close in two weeks.
"The heavy lifting has already been done, so you don't need both of them in there," Alan J. Gottesman, of West End Communications/Consulting in New York, said, referring to Mr. Orr and Mr. Coughlin. "Sean already did it, and left Chris a pretty clean plate."
In a telephone interview, Mr. Orr said Mr. Coughlin was best suited to help Interpublic take its next steps. "Most of the corporate financial challenges of the company have been addressed," Mr. Orr said, "so rightfully the company is turning the attention to operations, which is Chris's long suit."
The decision to leave was his own, Mr. Orr said. That was endorsed by David Bell, who became chairman and chief executive in February, succeeding John J. Dooner Jr., Mr. Orr's former executive suite partner, who returned to the McCann-Erickson World Group division of Interpublic.
"Sean's decision is just that, his decision," Mr. Bell wrote in a memo to Interpublic employees.
In a phone interview, Mr. Bell said: "Sean contributed to the gathering of a strong financial team to help us drive through some financial storms and balance-sheet issues. Moving forward, with that behind us, we'll shift to a very strong operational focus."

PERSON: Bernard A. Goldhirsh 

HEADLINE: Bernard Goldhirsh, 63, Magazine Innovator Who Started Inc. 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Bernard A. Goldhirsh, who started a newsletter-publishing business in his basement that grew into Inc. magazine, one of the first publications to profit by aiming at owners of small businesses, died on Sunday in Boston. He was 63.
 The cause was complications from a brain tumor, The Associated Press reported. 
 Mr. Goldhirsh's success in magazines began with Sail,devoted to the practical interests of owners of small sailboats, and quickly grew to include other nautical periodicals. But he found that his passion for sailing was not enough to deal with the business problems he encountered. 
It dawned on him that other business people faced similar challenges, from bank financing to obtaining office supplies, and he started Inc. in 1979 to help them. Its success was evident from the imitators who have addressed the same market.
His intended readers were more broadly defined than those of many other start-up magazines of the time, which went after distinct groups like joggers, apartment dwellers or roller skaters. Also, small businesses were growing as a proportion of the overall economy.
"He found exactly the right niche and exploited it beautifully," Robert Gardner, senior vice president of the Magazine Publishers Association at the time, told The Christian Science Monitor in 1980.
Mr. Goldhirsh was born in Brooklyn on March 22, 1940. He graduated in 1961 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he learned to sail on the Charles River. He taught at a private school in Cambridge, Mass., before leading a group of 12 paying students on a sailing expedition in the Caribbean.
He then worked as an inventor for Northrup Aviation and Polaroid, and taught celestial navigation to sailors. He noticed that sailors had little practical information on their sport, and in 1967 he began publishing an annual directory comparing various sailboat designs, The New York Times reported in 1979.
He also began publishing 16-page booklets dealing with practical questions like how to handle a boat in a storm. The publications were popular, and within two years advertisers were knocking on his door, The Times reported.
By January 1970, Mr. Goldhirsh had borrowed $20,000 from friends and put out the first issue of Sail. In 1973, he introduced Motorboat, a how-to magazine for boat owners. In 1978, he started Marine Business, a trade journal for boat-equipment makers.
"I had no publishing background, and it was all 'figure it out as you go,' " Mr. Goldhirsh said in an interview with The Associated Press in 1985. "I found myself managing a small, growing company. I didn't know anything about managing a company."
So he decided to publish the kind of how-to business magazine he felt he needed. That magazine, Inc., was aimed at owners of companies with annual sales of $1 million to $25 million.
Bolstered by a survey of business people that suggested there would be interest, he sold his nautical magazines for more than $10 million to start it.
Within two years, Inc. was profitable, and by 2000, when he sold it for an estimated $200 million, circulation was around 650,000. He gave 10 percent of the proceeds to his employees, to whom he had also freely lent his yacht. His easy personal style emerged, among other ways, through his penchant for going sockless and hiding in the shadows even at banquets at which he was being honored.
In 1981, he published High Technology, which he sold in 1987. In 1986, he bought Dun's Review, said to be the nation's oldest continuously published business publication, and renamed it Business Month. It closed in 1990. He also started, bought, sold and closed other magazines.
Mr. Goldhirsh's wife, Wendy Jo, died in 1999. The Boston Globe reported that he is survived by one daughter, Elizabeth; one son, Benjamin, both of Manchester-by-the-Sea, Mass.; two brothers, Stewart and Neil, both of Boston; and his parents, Leonard and Sylvia of Boston.

HEADLINE: Korea's Golden Unwedding 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
On July 27, the free, prosperous people of South Korea and the oppressed, starving people of North Korea will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the armistice. 
 Some truce. The Northern Communist dictatorship looks southward with hatred born of envy; the democracy of South Korea looks across the 38th parallel in fear of a regime that sees its survival only in building nukes and missiles to blackmail the world. 
 This week, David Sanger of The New York Times revealed exclusively a C.I.A. belief that at a nuclear testing site known as Youngdoktong the North is developing nuclear warheads small enough to be placed atop its already advanced missiles. Say what you like about our satellite surveillance, but this estimate was treated with great seriousness by the North's vulnerable neighbors. 
Yesterday, officials from three of those neighbors -- China, Japan and South Korea -- were in Washington to work out a way to stop the North from becoming a nuclear missile Wal-Mart for terrorists. Their presence may show progress in the Bush go-it-together approach, instead of acceding to the North's divide-and-conquer demand that the U.S. alone negotiate another fruitless payoff.
Bush's refusal to be suckered as Clinton was has led to some harsh words: Pyongyang warns that any U.S.-led economic sanctions would cause it to "nullify" the 1953 cease-fire, a nice golden anniversary present. As the U.S. enlists world support for our Proliferation Security Initiative -- including the interdiction of North Korean ships carrying destructive contraband -- Pyongyang escalates with a threat of "merciless" retaliation.
But the quiet move that produced the first sign of the North's willingness to stretch bi- to multi- -- a touch-fingertips meeting with the U.S. last month under Beijing's auspices -- came after Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld spoke of redeploying the vulnerable 37,000 U.S. troops now along the North-South border. Moving them south or to Japan would take them out of range of the North's artillery, freeing our Air Force, in a worst case, to take out its nuclear and missile facilities. 
It needn't come to that. The key to achieving a peaceful resolution through multilateral negotiation is China, the North's oil and food lifeline. Wang Yi, 49, China's vice foreign minister, is here for these oh-so-informal talks.
He is surely aware of the danger to China's strategic interests of a nuclear North Korea. A pre-emptive strike ending the threat would assert American dominance in Asia. Even if Bush blinked, a nuclear North would cause an antimissile defense to be built, with U.S. help, in Japan, followed by a Japanese nuclear deterrent (not to mention similar defense in Taiwan). That would end China's military dominance in East Asia -- a disaster for the untested new leader, Hu Jintao.
But the Chinese pride themselves on diplomatic subtlety and may delay putting the economic squeeze on their Communist ally until it's too late. Besides, cutting off food and fuel invites a flood of North Korean refugees into China. 
Therefore, in addition to our resolute, strictly multilateral, no-payoff-to-blackmail approach -- which seems to be slowly working -- we should suggest that all parties raise their eyes to a larger goal.
Whatever became of the ideal of the reunification of the Korean peninsula? Koreans are, after all, one people, united in their interest in China and distaste for Japan, divided only by an outdated ideological conflict. After a half-century apart, Germans reunited -- why not Koreans? The dream is often expressed on both sides.
The problem is this: the Northern leaders are willing provided they dominate, and the South is waiting for the Northern dictatorship to collapse as deprivation deepens. But the free South won't buy dictatorship and isn't too eager to take up the economic burden, while the always-collapsing North won't finally collapse for years, maybe decades. 
A face-saver all around, especially for the nervous North and for the conflicted Chinese, would be to treat the coming multilateral talks about a non-nuclear Korean peninsula as the first stage in a national reunification process. Hungry refugees should be repatriated by China to South Korea, which should accept them. 
As big thinkers say, the best way to solve an intractable problem is to enlarge it. In the land of negotiation, context is king.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Ads against drunken driving are aimed at a specific group and a specific weekend.

BYLINE:  By Danny Hakim 

 BODY:
FEDERAL regulators are trying to curb the nation's backsliding drunken driving problem with an advertising and enforcement campaign that takes aim at the Fourth of July weekend, historically one of the worst periods for alcohol-related accidents.
 The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has coordinated many law enforcement efforts to single out troublesome times of the year, but it has never had the financing to simultaneously conduct a paid advertising campaign. This year, Congress approved $11 million for advertisements aimed at young male drivers, who are most likely to drink and drive. Half of the money will go to 13 states, including several with either the highest alcohol-related fatality rates or the highest number of fatalities. 
 In case you thought the book on drunken driving was closed in the Nancy Reagan era, some of the progress made in the 1980's has been undone of late. Last year, just under 18,000 people died in alcohol-related accidents. 
It was the greatest number since 1992 and a sharp spike from the 16,572 who died in 1999. The highest number of fatalities related to drunken driving over the last several decades was in 1982, when about 25,000 people were killed.
According to the highway safety agency, in 2001, the most recent year for which detailed figures are available, 14,933 of 17,448 alcohol-related deaths involved someone with a blood-alcohol content over 0.08. Fifty-six percent of those killed were drunken drivers, 22 percent were passengers and 12 percent -- nearly 1,800 people -- were drunken pedestrians or bicyclists. Another 4 percent were pedestrians or bicyclists who were not drunk. Seven percent of the dead -- more than 1,000 people -- were sober drivers of other vehicles.
"Impaired driving is at epidemic proportions," said Dr. Jeffrey W. Runge, administrator of the agency, said in a statement, adding, "losing the equivalent of a fully loaded airliner every other day clearly is not acceptable." 
Otis Cox, the deputy director of the agency, said "we went through a period of time where MADD, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, was active." Moreover, he said, SADD, Students Against Drunk Driving, also helped to get the word out. 
"The American public was getting a message constantly," he added. "After years of decline, progress started to level out, and in the mid-90's, things started going in the other direction. In the past three years, impaired driving deaths have really increased."
Most states have recently moved toward a 0.08 blood alcohol limit -- equivalent to four drinks in an hour for a 170 pound man, according to MADD -- since Congress passed a measure in 2000 that threatened to withhold highway funding if they did not.
Wendy Hamilton, the president of MADD, said one of the biggest challenges is getting people to remember there is an issue at all, or, as she said, "get MADD again." 
If the group gained a burst of publicity in the years after its 1980 founding, these days it is harder to be noticed. 
"We get bored in this country," she said. "We're concerned about a lot of things, the economy, H.I.V., SARS, and then we took time to stop and grieve after Sept. 11."
Jay A. Winsten, director for the Center for Health Communication at the Harvard School of Public Health -- which was instrumental in importing the designated driver concept to this country from Scandinavia -- said some of the rise could be related to other trends, like the fact that rollovers of sport utility vehicles are an increasing problem. 
But he added that "there are also larger, longer-term trends."
"The more media attention directed at drunk driving," Mr. Winsten said, "the more the numbers improve. When the media gets bored, or turns away, we see the absence of progress and the curve reverses directions."
The new ad from the traffic safety agency started running on June 27 and will continue through July 13. "Crackdown," as it is called, was made by GMMB, part of the Fleishman-Hillard unit of the Omnicom Group, in both English and Spanish. It will run during shows watched by 21- to 34-year-old men, including UPN's "WWE Smackdown!," ESPN's "SportsCenter," NBC's "Fear Factor" and Fox's "Stupid Behavior". It will also appear on Telemundo. 
The message of the 30-second ad is fairly simple: If you drink and drive, a flashlight-brandishing cop is going to show up and ask you if you've been drinking. You're going to be freaked out. You're going to mumble out an explanation. "Not really" says one driver while another tries "one or two" and a third offers up the always dependable "just a few."
The ad -- which has "you drink, you drive, you lose" as its tagline -- continues with an authoritative sounding voice that says "across the country, cops are cracking down. No matter where you drive, if you drive impaired, you will be arrested. It's simple."
We see someone taking a Breathalyzer test and another man being escorted into a police cruiser. Then the three drivers are shown having their mug shots taken, looking like they had still fail a Breathalyzer. 
The lock-'em-up message is coordinated with enforcement efforts, like sobriety checkpoints, as well as saturation patrols that have a large number of officers cruising trouble spots. 
Thirteen states will receive about half of the $11 million to single out local media, while the other half will be used for national media buys. The states are Alaska, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and West Virginia. 
Mr. Winsten, who has not seen the ad, said one problem with aiming at young men is that the heaviest drinkers often do not choose to hear the message. Sometimes, he added, it is more effective to single out the people around them who can take keys out of their hands. 
"We did focus groups with high risk groups, young men who use heavy drinking for social bonding, and they would tell us that sometimes they would realize they had too much to drink when they grazed parked cars on their way home."
"Then, the next weekend, they would do it all over again," he added. "It's tough to get through to them."
"The key to making a difference will be a long-term sustained effort," he said. "A weekend blitz by itself can't have much of a lasting impact."

HEADLINE: Picking Workers' Pockets 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
When I started in the newspaper business I made so little money I had to work part time in my father's upholstery shop to make ends meet. So I'd spend the days chasing stories and struggling with deadlines, and the nights wrestling with beat-up sofas and chairs.
 Then the editors at The Star-Ledger in Newark began asking me to work overtime on the copy desk, dreaming up headlines and doing some editing. The extra time-and-a-half pay was just enough to keep me solvent and out of the upholstery shop. And the copy desk experience was invaluable. 
 Now suppose the editors had been able to tell me to work the extra hours on the copy desk without paying me overtime. I couldn't have afforded to do it, and might have left the paper.
The Bush administration, which has the very bad habit of smiling at working people while siphoning money from their pockets, is trying to change the federal Fair Labor Standards Act in a way that could cause millions of workers to lose their right to overtime pay.
The act, one of the last major domestic reform measures of the New Deal, gave Americans the 40-hour workweek and a minimum wage (which began at 25 cents an hour in the late 1930's). It wiped out grueling 12-hour days for many workers and prohibited the use of child labor in interstate commerce.
The act's overtime regulations have not been updated since 1975, and part of what the administration is proposing makes sense. Under existing rules only workers earning less than $8,060 a year automatically qualify for overtime. That would be raised to $22,100 a year.
But then comes the bad news. Nearly 80 percent of all workers are in jobs that qualify them for overtime pay, which is time-and-a-half for each hour that is worked beyond the normal 40-hour week. The administration wants to make it easier for employers to exempt many of those workers from overtime protection by classifying them as administrative, professional or executive personnel.
The quickest way to determine who is getting the better of this deal is to note that business groups are applauding the proposed changes while the A.F.L.-C.I.O. held a protest rally outside the Labor Department on Monday.
But this is an administration that could figure out a way to sell sunblock to a night crawler. So the rules changes are being spun as a boon to working people.
"By recognizing the professional status of skilled employees, the proposed regulation will provide them a guaranteed salary and flexible hours," said Tammy McCutchen, the Labor Department's wage and hour administrator.
All spinning aside, I wonder how many Americans really think that working longer hours for less money is a good thing.
A more helpful approach to the issue was offered by the Economic Policy Institute, which found that the proposed changes could ultimately eliminate the right to overtime for eight million people. That represents an awful lot of cash that would be drawn away from working families.
Unfortunately, this is the kind of thing the Bush administration is committed to -- undermining a hard-won initiative of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's that has helped many millions of working Americans for more than six decades. It ain't broke, but George Bush is busy fixin' it.
You would think that an administration that has presided over the loss of millions of jobs might want to strengthen the protections of workers fortunate enough to still be employed. But that's not what this administration is about.
Jared Bernstein, a co-author of the study by the Economic Policy Institute, said, "The new rules are structured in such a way as to create a very strong incentive for employers to exempt workers from overtime protection, primarily by converting hourly workers to salaried workers."
One of the workers who joined Monday's protest at the Labor Department was Bob Adams, a bakery manager at a supermarket chain in Minneapolis and St. Paul.
When I asked him why he had traveled to Washington for the demonstration, he said: "Because I think we have to put a stop to this. There seems to be a systematic assault on the rights of workers by this administration, and this is a perfect example of it. They tried to push this through as quietly as they could."

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Names Chicago Professor to Post 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2 

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund said today that it would appoint a professor of the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, Raghuram Rajan, as chief economist, succeeding Kenneth Rogoff, who leaves in the fall. 
 "Mr. 
Rajan has been at the forefront of work on banking and financial sector issues," the fund's managing director, Horst Koehler, said. 
 Mr. Rajan, 40, an Indian citizen, has published extensively on economic and financial matters, and held professorships at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Northwestern University and the Stockholm School of Economics before becoming a professor at the University of Chicago. 
He has also been a consultant to the Federal Reserve Board, the World Bank and the I.M.F. 
Mr. Rogoff, who was named to the post in June 2001, said in April he would return to Harvard after the fund's annual meetings in Dubai in September. 
Mr. Rajan recently co-wrote a book titled "Saving Capitalism From the Capitalists."

HEADLINE: Development in a Historic District: New Life on a Street Left for Dead 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
"These are the very streets that Melville wrote about," said Richard A. Cook of Cook + Fox Architects. "A land that time forgot."
 Not just time. One developer after another has forgotten a pungent, poignant stretch of Front Street in Lower Manhattan, rather than try to weave new buildings among landmark 19th-century brick counting houses. 
 Undaunted, a group including Frank J. Sciame Jr. of Sciame Development, an experienced builder in the South Street Seaport Historic District, and F. Anthony Zunino III and Richard S. Berry of Zuberry Associates, bought the properties last week and closed on a $46.3 million Liberty Bond.
They plan to rehabilitate 11 historical buildings on Front Street and Peck Slip and construct three new buildings, creating 96 rental apartments, 18,750 square feet of small-scale retail space and a 3,500-square foot maritime center. 
The new buildings will rise on what are now vacant lots. Work will begin this month and should be finished in less than a year and a half, Mr. Sciame said. 
Through abstract references, the new buildings are meant to pay homage to the maritime past. A shallow V-shaped roof atop 213 Front Street will conjure a whale fluke. Timber slats at 24 and 36 Peck Slip will evoke the ships that moored there when the slip was a waterfront berth.
"We talked a lot about things that were relevant but no longer tangible," Mr. Cook said, describing the existing buildings, some of which date to the early 1800's, as being in "a romantic state of collapse."
To which Mr. Berry, so drained by the closing earlier that day that he could no longer legibly form his own signature, said, "How romantic is that?"
Actually, romantic enough that historical layers will be preserved. "This will be like no other place to live," Mr. Zunino said. Exhibit A: even after renovation, 225 Front Street will still be encrusted with the fading remnants of hand-painted signs for "House of Fillet," "Mild Cure" and "Salmon."
Rents are expected to range from $2,000 to $2,500 a month for one-bedroom apartments with 648 to 975 square feet of space, and $3,500 to $4,000 a month for two-bedroom units with 989 to 1,218 square feet. Interest on the bonds, issued by the state's Housing Finance Agency, are exempt from taxes under the $8 billion Liberty Bond program for redeveloping Lower Manhattan.
Andrew M. Alper, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, which sold the properties for $5 million, said through a spokeswoman that the developers had "extensive experience in completing similar challenging projects," noting Mr. Sciame's rehabilitation of 247 and 273 Water Street. Since their tentative designation last summer, Sciame and Zuberry have been joined by the Durst Organization.
The developers have chosen to build considerably less floor area -- 147,383 square feet in total -- than zoning rules would have allowed. 
That was one reason Community Board 1 was "thrilled" by the project, said its chairwoman, Madelyn Wils. "It needed to be a labor of love more than a labor for profit," she said. "These buildings have fallen apart over the last 15 years."
The Landmarks Preservation Commission approved the project in April after a single hearing. Reflecting on the years of stop-and-go projects, Roberta Brandes Gratz, a commission member, said: "Sometimes delay works for the better. I can't imagine a better plan."

HEADLINE: Macho America Storms Europe's Runways 

BYLINE:  By CATHY HORYN 

DATELINE: PARIS, July 2 

 BODY:
A remarkable reversal of sentiment and symbolism has occurred in the five months since designers here and in Milan and London, the site of fervent antiwar rallies, displayed peace flags and, in one instance, staged a love-in that featured a couple in a bed. At that time, European opposition to President Bush's position on Iraq ran so high that Tom Ford, the creative director of Gucci and a fellow Texan, told reporters after his women's show in February, "I'm embarrassed to be an American."
 But last week in Milan, on the same runway where he had criticized the president, Mr. Ford struck an image that symbolized the virile Texas cowboy in boots and broad hat. Other tried-and-true symbols of American strength and power appeared at Prada, as correct displays of 1950's country-club attire; at Jean Paul Gaultier, as waistcoats inspired by James West, the 1960's television cowboy version of James Bond; at Junya Watanabe, as battle jackets and cartridge belts fashioned from banker's broadcloth; and at Louis Vuitton, as well-scrubbed young men in tennis whites and navy blazers. 
 As a backdrop for the Vuitton show, its designer, Marc Jacobs, had an imposing wall of marble erected, to heighten the sense of power evoked by gray double-breasted suits, which to his design staff, Mr. Jacobs said, were reminiscent of the actor Christian Bale's grooming-obsessed Wall Street character in "American Psycho." And in what was surely the first fashion show to treat combat as performance art, Bernhard Willhelm, a designer from Belgium, had beefy models in commando gear scramble over tabletops and explode balloons.
"I enjoyed the reaction of people," said Mr. Willhelm, who had opposed the Iraq war. "They said, 'These guys really look like they could take Saddam's palaces.' "
Why so many designers of differing styles and nationalities chose these largely positive American themes and why now, when in Europe there is still deep distrust of America's foreign policy, is puzzling. 
Stefano Tonchi, the fashion creative director of Esquire magazine, who attended the shows, suggested that in periods of gloom and doubt, American symbols "are still the strongest security blanket."
Designers, who plan their collections months in advance, rarely set out to make overt references to current events, and as often as not have their heads buried in history books or articles of vintage clothing. They typically explain that when fashion and politics collide, it is accidental and not intended as commentary. 
Though Mr. Watanabe called his show "Lovely Army" and played the theme song from "The Bridge on the River Kwai," a movie depicting the harsh treatment of British soldiers in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp, he insisted in a telephone interview from his office in Tokyo that he was not making an antiwar statement. Rather, he was fascinated by the construction of military uniforms. 
Designers may be armchair tourists when it comes to politics, but perhaps they protest too much. They are constantly bombarded by images, and are themselves astute image-makers. So while they may not be able or willing to articulate their feelings about world events, they are nonetheless, at some level, tapping into the zeitgeist.
"Whether you believe in America's power and hegemony, you can't help but be affected by it, even subconsciously," said Adrian Joffe, the Paris managing director of Comme des Garcons, which produces Mr. Watanabe's label.
The timing of the men's shows was in a way fortuitous: had designers been showing women's clothes, the symbols would have been radically different, and might not have revealed this collision between politics and fashion. But cowboy clothes and combat fatigues are intrinsically masculine. They are also uniforms, connoting a high degree of function. And their return was not accidental, said Aileen Ribeiro, chief of the history of dress department at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London. 
Since the 18th century, "the uniform as a fashion statement has followed the progress of successful military campaigns," Ms. Ribeiro said. The "least glorious war," World War I, she added, produced perhaps the most practical fashion, the Burberry trench coat. "What we've got with the early 21st century, with America's 'successful' war, is that everyone wants to be part of the action," she said. "And that means things like camouflage, which all the boys in London are wearing."
Mr. Willhelm, who watched the war on television, said he was fascinated by the technical aspects of the combat uniform, and aside from being influenced by its shape and the number of pockets, wanted to create a camouflage that served an urban landscape. Ms. Ribeiro noted that designers and their young followers are drawn to G.I. uniforms, rather than to officer styles, because they reflect more casual fashion.
In their collective reach for unambiguous symbols of masculinity, designers including Mr. Ford also project a longing for clear rules and gender lines. "For Tom, the western theme is about going back to his roots," Mr. Tonchi said. But, he added, "with cowboys, there is also less gender confusion. Cowboys are not girly." From the stream of news images of virile-looking soldiers on their Bradleys, you would have no trouble making the same conclusion.
Inevitably, clothes that depict a sense of order are nostalgic and comforting. As Mr. Ford said, "People want a positive world." And Mr. Tonchi noted that DSquared, a Milan label, presented its collection in a make-believe 1950's diner, complete with muscle cars. "It's 'Happy Days,' " he said, referring to the popular sitcom. "Or happier days."
For many fashion houses, which have seen profits significantly squeezed by the economy, there may be pragmatic reasons to offer classic styles like blazers and cowboy shirts that men can readily accept. Gucci, the world's third-largest luxury group, reported today that its first-quarter earnings for 2003 slid 97 percent, which Domenico De Sole, president and chief executive, attributed to a weaker dollar and a decline in tourism caused by the war and the SARS epidemic. Sales were strong in May and June, he said.
American retailers were encouraged by the direction of the shows. Looking at Mr. Watanabe's cotton striped battle tunics on Tuesday, Wanda Colon, a vice president for men's fashion at Barneys New York, said, "I don't think customers will react negatively."
People in the rest of the world may react sharply to America's political and cultural reach. And even in fashion, it can often be appallingly insidious. Martin Margiela, a designer in Belgium, makes high-priced fashion recycled from old denim and polyester that American mills, looking for cheap outlets, once sold to countries in the former Soviet bloc. "Now it comes back to Barneys," Mr. Tonchi said. "It's a long, long trip."
What goes down a runway, of course, is not going to change real sentiment. But, as Francois Heisbourg, a political analyst here, said: "Anti-Americanism, whether it's French, German or Italian, is essentially political. It's about the Bush administration. We don't trust the guy. But there's nothing particularly personal or emotional about it. People have not stopped buying hamburgers."

HEADLINE: Expectations Are High, but Vast Problems Confront Boston's New Archbishop 

BYLINE:  By LAURIE GOODSTEIN 

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 2 

 BODY:
After more than a year of mounting anger and disillusionment, Boston's Roman Catholics appear to be swept off their feet by their new archbishop, Sean P. O'Malley, who made his debut here on Tuesday at a news conference carried live on television and radio.
 "I think expectations are sky-high right now," said Stephen J. Pope, associate professor of theology at Boston College. "He looks like Santa Claus dressed up as St. Francis. He had all those qualities of compassion, charisma and dedication. Hollywood couldn't create a guy as attractive as he was yesterday." 
 But the new archbishop's honeymoon may not last long, church analysts and leaders here said in interviews today. He will immediately confront a host of institutional obstacles that could impede his progress in rebuilding an archdiocese shattered by last year's disclosures that its leaders had permitted a generation of sexually abusive priests to molest young people. 
While Archbishop-elect O'Malley proclaimed his desire on Tuesday to settle lawsuits brought by victims of abuse, he will have to reckon with lawyers and insurance companies that so far have been at an impasse. Although he spoke of the importance of listening to laypeople, he will have to contend with an organized movement of laypeople known as Voice of the Faithful, who are demanding a share of decision-making.
And while he signaled his intention to set a new tone of humility, he inherits a chancery headquartered on a lavish suburban estate and run by the appointees of his predecessor, Cardinal Bernard F. Law. 
The archdiocese announced today that Bishop O'Malley would be installed as archbishop of Boston at a Mass on July 30 here at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross.
The new archbishop's most pressing priority will be to resolve the lawsuits brought by about 500 sexual abuse victims, a step that some experts estimate could cost the archdiocese as much as $100 million.
"The question now is, Will Sean O'Malley's personal charisma and dedication and compassion translate into the political skill it will take to convince the insurers to fully meet the archdiocese's financial obligations to the victims?" Professor Pope said.
Whatever the answer, with fund-raising falling short because of weakness in the economy and the sexual abuse scandal, the new archbishop could be forced to sell off church properties. Even before the abuse scandal broke, the archdiocese was burdened with schools that had declining enrollments and churches with few parishioners.
"There's no way out of this without making decisions that are going to be very painful," said Philip F. Lawler, former editor of Boston's archdiocesan newspaper. "Signing a very big check is obviously, as we all know, painful."
Mr. Lawler, now editor of Catholic World Report, a newsmagazine, said the archbishop would gradually have to make new appointments to an "ossified and bureaucratic" administration in the chancery. "The sexual abuse problem didn't just happen by mistake," he said. "There's a culture, a pattern of management in the chancery, that desperately needs to be changed."
New bishops, known as ordinaries, often bring in their own associates, church experts noted. But even if the new archbishop wanted to, he would be unable to remove any of the auxiliary -- or assistant -- bishops appointed by Cardinal Law until the pope assigned them as ordinaries to dioceses of their own. 
One of Bishop O'Malley's most closely watched early decisions will also be perhaps the most mundane: where should he live? The residence used by Cardinal Law and his predecessors is a stone mansion in the suburb of Brighton, adjacent to the campus of Boston College. 
The property, which also includes the chancery offices, has been assessed at more than $28 million, and Boston College has expressed interest in buying it. Some Catholic leaders have encouraged the archdiocese to sell it, to help pay for settlements with victims. 
The new archbishop is a Capuchin friar, who, as a member of that Franciscan order, has taken a vow of poverty. Asked at the news conference on Tuesday about his housing plans, he said thathe did not yet know the "lay of the land" in Boston but that "as a Franciscan brother, I prefer to have the simplest of quarters." 
David L. Castaldi, a member of the executive committee of Voice of the Faithful, said many Catholics hoped that their new leader shunned the imperial trappings. "Catholics in Boston," he said, "have an image that that property is a magnificent residence that is not befitting a man who is a humble servant of God."
The new archbishop comes here having served as bishop in two dioceses -- Fall River, Mass., and Palm Beach, Fla. -- that were wounded by sexual abuse scandals of their own. But church experts say Boston will pose challenges he has never seen before. There are organized lobbies of priests and laypeople pressing for changes in the hierarchical, top-down management style. And there is also a larger and more mobilized group of sexual abuse victims than he has ever contended with before.
Bishop O'Malley said on Tuesday that he hoped not only to settle with these victims but also to bring back to the church those Catholics who have fallen away. Many of the victims, however, say they feel so wounded and betrayed that they will never again set foot in a church. Bill Gately, New England co-coordinator of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, said the widespread exulting over the new archbishop left him concerned that ultimately the victims would be abandoned not only by the church but by their lay supporters as well.
"I don't want to come across as the skunk at the lawn party," Mr. Gately said, "because we need to continue to draw on the support of Catholics that are outraged. And today there aren't any, because they're so excited about this change."
"There's all this euphoria," he said, "and not that I'm looking to drag it down, but there is a whole group of traumatized people out there who are saying today, 'What about us?' " 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 10, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A news analysis article on July 3 about problems facing Archbishop-designate Sean P. O'Malley of Boston misidentified the religious authority who appointed the auxiliary bishops now serving there and misstated the definition of their potential role as ordinaries. Auxiliary bishops are appointed by the pope; these were not named by Cardinal Bernard Law. Ordinaries are holders of certain church offices, like diocesan bishops or the heads of pontifical clerical institutes. The term does not denote a new bishop.

HEADLINE: Telecommuter Loses Case For Benefits 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 2 

 BODY:
A woman who used a laptop computer and a phone line to work in Florida for a financial information company on Long Island is ineligible for New York's unemployment benefits, the state's highest court ruled today.
 In issuing a 6-to-0 decision, the Court of Appeals weighed in on the new legal front of telecommuting. The judges delivered what they called the nation's first interpretation of where employees in the virtual workplace should turn when they lose their jobs. The court ruled that people should seek unemployment benefits from the state where they work, not from the state where their employer is. 
 The opinion could have wide implications in a world where employees increasingly use the tools of the Internet to perform work for employers based far away from them. But it left the plaintiff, Maxine E. Allen, a former technical specialist with Reuters America Inc., deeply disappointed.
"I had fought so long and honestly believed I was right," Ms. Allen, 38, said in a telephone interview today. "But we will abide by our country's rules and laws; that is what makes us great."
Ms. Allen, who served as her own lawyer, said she would not appeal the decision to the United States Supreme Court, saying she simply did not know how to do so. Though she lost, she said she was impressed by the way the court system worked. She lives with her husband and children in Maitland, Fla., just outside Orlando.
For now, the ruling caps a long legal struggle for Ms. Allen, one with many twists. She lived in North Babylon, N.Y., and she worked for the company at its Hauppauge offices from October 1996 until she moved to Orlando, Fla., in July 1997, when her husband changed jobs, according to a court summary of the case.
Once there, she set up an office in her new home. Reuters paid for a phone line and gave her a laptop computer, software and the security clearance needed to log on to the company's mainframe computer in New York. But the company ended that arrangement in March 1999 and offered her a job back in New York, which she turned down, resigning.
On April 5, she filed for unemployment insurance coverage in Florida, where her claim was processed, and where payments were $275 a week. Reuters objected to the Florida authorities, contending that she had voluntarily quit her job without good cause, the court papers said. Employers bear some of the costs of unemployment insurance, which is drawn from payroll taxes.
Florida labor officials told Ms. Allen that she might qualify for New York's benefits, at a weekly rate of $365, and Ms. Allen filled out an interstate claim form with New York in May while her claim was still being reviewed in Florida. In June, Florida found that she was not eligible for unemployment benefits there.
In October, the labor commissioner in New York determined that Ms. Allen was not eligible for benefits because she had performed her work in Florida, and directed her to pay back $8,395 she had received in benefits from April to October of 1999.
Ms. Allen won an appeal before an administrative law judge in New York who decided she was eligible for state benefits because her work had been directed and controlled from New York. Reuters supervised her schedule as if she were based in New York. That decision was overturned by the State Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board, a ruling affirmed by the State Appellate Division, Third Department.
The Court of Appeals heard the argument on June 4. In ruling that Ms. Allen was ineligible for New York State benefits, it shut the door on her claim in New York. It left open the question of whether she would appeal the denial of her Florida benefits, something she said she did not foresee doing. The court sustained the outcome of the administrative proceeding, requiring Ms. Allen to repay most of the New York benefits she had received.
"Because claimant was regularly physically present in Florida when she worked for her employer in New York, her work was localized in one state -- Florida," Judge Susan Phillips Read wrote in the nine-page decision. Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye and four other judges concurred.
Robert M. Lillpopp, a New York State Labor Department spokesman, said each unemployment case is handled individually.
The court's decision did not address the issue of income taxes, said Thomas M. Bergin, a spokesman for the State Department of Taxation and Finance. But generally, he said, someone who works for a company based in New York but does not set foot in New York pays income tax in the state where he legally resides.
Ms. Allen said she paid New York income tax from the time she moved to Florida through the remainder of 1997. In the next year, on the advice of her accountant, she filed tax returns in Florida.
Rebecca A. Smith, a staff lawyer for the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit advocacy group for low-wage workers and the unemployed, said the ruling was short-sighted. The unemployment insurance system was created in 1935, long before the trend of telecommuting. "The court seems to have interpreted the law in a way that fails to accommodate the needs of the changing work force," she said.

HEADLINE: New Body for a Seaport's Soul; 
At Maritime Museum's Remade Home, Old Walls Talk

BYLINE:  By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
Call it the city's original world trade center. 
 Nearly two centuries ago, the merchant Peter Schermerhorn began constructing a row of commercial buildings in a speculative Fulton Street development that was to house Manhattan's first collection of traders, importers and countinghouses only steps away from the city's busiest piers. 
 Now those original Federal-style brick commercial buildings of Schermerhorn Row -- as well as tantalizing, venerable remnants of the thriving businesses that inhabited them -- are being reclaimed as components of a $21 million new South Street Seaport Museum complex. Construction crews are toiling to make the buildings' hidden spaces and artifacts visible to the public for the first time when the museum opens this fall. 
Peter Neill, president of the museum, said it would display "not only firsthand evidence of the maritime enterprise that built American trade, but also the acculturation process for immigrants, which established the diversity of our population." 
Thomas Bender, professor of history at New York University, said that in the early 1800's, the seaport was nothing less than "the heart of a worldwide trading empire," adding, "It's fair to say that New York's economy was born there." 
The riverward wharves of Schermerhorn Row were not only important to New York, but also the nation, because in those pre-income-tax days, Professor Bender said, the customs tariffs paid at New York's port were "supplying 70 percent of the national income by the time of the Civil War."
The new museum space, between Front and South Streets on Fulton Street, will offer salt-scented breezes and views of the harbor, and more important, walls and windows that were witnesses to the city's vibrant maritime saga. 
Only yards from the Schermerhorn buildings, with their handmade bricks and raked slate roofs, the first American ships sailed to China to open trade. Whalers and packets arrived, as did boatloads of coffee, tea, molasses and, yes, immigrants.
Professor Bender said the Seaport was the place "where immigrants got off the boat, and found employment, and even the most unskilled could get their shot." That influx of new Americans, and the way of life of the working people of the wharves, will also be a focus of the new museum.
"We don't have the great collections of the historical societies uptown," Mr. Neill said, "which are basically the heirlooms of the great families that no one wanted to keep. This museum is about the working people -- downtown, where the value was created. This is the beginning of the story. The uptown museums are the end of the story." 
Schermerhorn Row was saved after a group of spirited citizens fought for years against its demolition. They created the museum, which was chartered in 1967. The row and its block were declared landmarks in 1968 and incorporated, along with the museum, in the mall created by the Rouse Company in the 1980's. 
John H. Beyer, the partner in charge of the museum project for the architectural firm Beyer Blinder Belle, which also renovated Ellis Island and Grand Central Terminal, said the Seaport Museum "has never had a real gallery presence." The museum, which has a full-time staff of 39 and 300 volunteers, has exhibition space in three small galleries on Water Street to display its collection of nautical memorabilia. It also has exhibitions in three of its classic restored ships at Pier 16. 
After entering at 12 Fulton Street (or 165 John Street at the other side of the museum), visitors will tread a newly installed corridor of greenish Louisiana bluestone on their way to the admissions desk, and ascend via an escalator to an atrium revealing the original buildings' backyard. Then visitors will tour a warren of lofts, storerooms and offices in what Mr. Beyer said were "the mercantile high-rise buildings of their day." 
Mr. Neill said the goal was not to tear out the soul of the old structures to create exhibition space. "Like our sailing ships, the buildings themselves are artifacts," he said, "and we didn't want to turn them into white boxes." 
The museum's circuitous exhibition route on upper floors was the answer to a real-estate conundrum. The arrangement of the Rouse Company with New York City gave the developer the rights to the retail space in most of the Seaport's ground floors and second floors, so the museum was carved out above. 
The museum raised money for the new galleries from donors like the Starr Foundation, the J. Aron Charitable Foundation, Goldman Sachs and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and won a $5.3 million construction grant from the New York City Economic Development Corporation. The museum is also raising an additional $20 million for an eventual six-story extension adjacent to the museum at the corner of South and John Streets. 
In the congeries of rooms in the new museum -- at points the space is barely seven feet high -- visitors will be able to see original mercantile offices, lofts and warehouses. Hoists and elevators have been preserved. Charred beams and scorched ceilings will serve as lessons on the prevalence of fire in early maritime businesses. 
Visitors will also be able to see the original chimneys, door frames, plaster walls and wallpaper -- all of it greatly decomposed by time -- of the Fulton Ferry Hotel, the one made famous in Joseph Mitchell's "Up in the Old Hotel," first written for The New Yorker. 
"We're leaving this as a ruin," Mr. Neill said, "leaving it inhabited by the ghosts of immigrants and sailors and young women just off the boat." 
In the hotel, visitors will be able to view rooms where generations of immigrant girls attended to the laundry, and witness some startling examples of workingmen's graffiti, like the signature of one William Sinclair from Sept. 16, 1847. 
But the Lascaux cave of Schermerhorn graffiti is a 10-foot-wide by 8-foot-tall relic in the former Bennett & Becker tea and coffee importing company. Under old wallboard, workers found 130-year-old graffiti written in Gaelic, displaying the words to a popular revolutionary song, the drawing of a Gaelic harp and a caricature of the owner, James P. Bennett. 
"This is quite a discovery," Mr. Neill said, "because we've so far been unable to find any actual portrait of Bennett for our exhibition." 
A crucial element of the reconstruction has been the replacement of original rotted floors. More than 20,000 square feet of ancient pine boards rescued in Massachusetts by the Mountain Lumber Company of Ruckersville, Va., are being installed. "It contributes to the museum's authenticity, replicating the original flooring," said Willie Drake, the company's president. 
Not unlike the immigrants who originally worked in the same warehouse room, one of the floor installers, Terence Chow, is also a new American -- he arrived from Burma in 1972. The installation of the boards is challenging because "the floor is so uneven," he said on a recent afternoon, pointing to the eccentrically settled old walls.
"It makes you seasick just looking at it," he added, smiling. "The original workers had it easier."

HEADLINE: For an Ailing Retina, Instant Diagnosis From Afar 

BYLINE:  By ROY FURCHGOTT 

 BODY:
AN eight-foot satellite dish stands outside the double-wide mobile home where Tyrone McElveen works, making it, as he observed, "just like every other trailer in South Carolina."
 But his dish is different: it is not intended to receive television signals. Instead, it was recently used in a three-month trial program to transmit digitized photographs of people's eyes to an ophthalmologist more than 100 miles away. In those three months, four people were saved from blindness. 
 The trial put Dr. McElveen in the vanguard of telemedicine, a coinage for remote medical diagnosis and treatment. Using a special digital camera, he produced highly detailed color images of the retinas of patients he treats at a rural clinic in the parking lot of a shuttered hospital in Ridgeland, S.C. Then, relying on the satellite dish just outside the clinic, he sent the images to ophthalmologists a two-hour drive away in Columbia, S.C. 
 Such technology can be used not only to screen for potentially serious problems in people far from doctors' offices, but also to reduce the cost of retinal exams by using doctors' time more efficiently. What's more, it enables health care providers to build a photographic record for each patient, making it easier to catch degenerative conditions.
 The cameras also spare patients the inconvenience of having their pupils dilated, a procedure that is customary in conventional ophthalmological examinations and results in a few hours of light sensitivity and blurry vision.
 Neither photographing retinas nor the concept of telemedicine is new. Doctors sometimes record pictures of retinas on film for diagnostic use, although processing and storing them can be time-consuming and expensive. Many doctors instead make hand-drawn diagrams, which are less accurate.
 Doctors at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston began experimenting with digital images for diagnosis about 10 years ago, according to Lloyd Paul Aiello, the assistant director of the center's Beetham Eye Institute, but the specialized equipment was too expensive for most clinics. Beyond the expense, rigorous testing was needed to determine whether the digital images were as reliable as color slides made with film cameras, which clinical trials had shown to be effective.
 Then the scientific, technical and economic planets began to come into alignment.
 In 2001, research papers began presenting evidence that digital cameras could be reliable screening tools. A 2002 study underwritten by Kaiser Permanente, the big health care company, bolstered the case for using black-and-white digital photos for actual diagnosis. 
 "We were able to show our ability to detect retinopathy was equal to or better than a doctor's exam," said one of the study's authors, Mark S. Blumenkranz, chairman of the department of ophthalmology at Stanford University.
 At the same time, improvements in digital cameras were yielding better-quality images, and prices were dropping. Until recently, digital cameras capable of producing images detailed enough to make diagnosis possible were too expensive to be practical. 
 The recent introduction of six-megapixel cameras for as little as $1,500 and 10-megapixel cameras for $5,000 to $8,000, and a sharp drop in the prices of high-definition monitors have aided the cause. "Up until 18 months ago, the technology didn't support this in a diagnostically significant way," said W. Lloyd Clark, a specialist in retinal diseases at the Columbia Eye Clinic in Columbia. Dr. Clark evaluated the pictures sent from Dr. McElveen's clinic, run by Beaufort-Jasper-Hampton Comprehensive Health Services. 
 The new specialized devices, nonmidriatic fundus cameras, can produce a photograph of a patient's retina in about three minutes. Thousands of patient photo records can be archived on a CD, a DVD or a computer hard drive. 
 Several camera companies are now producing fundus cameras as ready-to-go systems for doctors. "There is no question that companies are coming in and packaging systems that are economically feasible and user-friendly," said Ronald Weinstein, a doctor who is president of the American Telemedicine Association. Specialty manufacturers like Nidek and Topcon are making fundus cameras (some of which still require that pupils be dilated), and mainstream camera makers like Canon and Carl Zeiss are doing so as well. Systems range in price from $16,000 to $90,000.
 Another technological hurdle must be overcome before fundus cameras can be widely used in rural areas. Rural clinics often lack access to high-speed Internet service through phone lines, and the retinal images are so large that it is impractical to transmit them with a slow modem. 
 In the three-month test at Dr. McElveen's clinic, the problem was solved with a high-speed connection on the Hughes Network Systems Direcway satellite system. Dr. McElveen was able to transmit four two-megabit photographs each in less than five minutes while simultaneously holding a live video conference with the distant doctor. Hughes plans to offer a faster satellite Internet system in 2004 that may be even more suitable for telemedicine, said Glenn Mossy, a Hughes engineer who worked on the South Carolina test.
 In the meantime, urban clinics with high-speed Internet service are getting involved in remote examinations. The Arizona Foundation for the Eye, a nonprofit organization that finances optical care, has established an ophthalmologic telemedicine center at the Mountain Park Health Center, a community health center in Phoenix that annually serves some 22,000 largely under- or uninsured, high-risk patients. In its first year of operation, which ended in April, the clinic screened nearly 1,000 patients; roughly 350 were found to have previously undetected eye problems and were referred to specialists for care.
 The problems uncovered by the camera system can often be overlooked at clinics that lack staff ophthalmologists. "Eye problems are usually triaged to the bottom of the totem pole because it's not life-threatening," says Abby B. Guiver, president of the Arizona Foundation for the Eye. 
 A leading problem that the camera succeeds in catching is diabetic retinopathy, a condition which may threaten any of the nation's 17 million diabetics. The disease, which causes a slow enlargement of blood vessels in the retina, shows no evident symptoms until the vessels leak or new ones grow in areas that obscure vision.
 According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in people ages 20 to 74. The association estimates that 12,000 to 24,000 are blinded by diabetes annually. But with early detection, loss of vision can be avoided in more than 90 percent of the cases.
 The cameras can be used to identify other eye diseases as well, including macular degeneration, glaucoma, and retinopathy of prematurity, found in newborn infants. "All of those are blinding conditions," said Dr. Blumenkranz of Stanford. "They are all treatable if caught, and early detection makes a difference." 
 At this point the cameras are being used mostly for screening. When they reveal problems, the patients are sent to ophthalmologists for examination and treatment.
 The new color cameras are beginning to find their way into private practice. But Dr. Aiello warned that until scientific tests establish the precise limits of digital fundus photography, it will be useful chiefly for screening. 
 Still, tests are under way, and the early results are encouraging, Dr. Aiello said, adding, "These systems are going to be the way to go."

 Australia's central bank left interest rates unchanged, signaling that the central bank governor, Ian Macfarlane, was more concerned about increasing housing prices than a slowing economy or the currency's biggest quarterly gain in 20 years. The Australian dollar rose to a five-year high after Mr. Macfarlane left the overnight cash rate at 4.75 percent, dashing the expectation of many economists that he would follow the lead of the Federal Reserve in the United States and cut borrowing costs a quarter percentage point.

DUANE READE REDUCES SECOND-QUARTER FORECAST

BYLINE:  Dow Jones/AP 

 BODY:
 The drugstore chain Duane Reade Inc. lowered its second-quarter earnings forecast yesterday, citing the weather and the weak economy. 
Duane Reade, which is based in New York, said it expected operating income of 20 cents or 21 cents a share for the quarter, down from its previous forecast of 27 cents to 32 cents. Wall Street had expected earnings to be 24 cents a share. Duane Reade's lowered earnings forecast excludes an additional tax provision of about $1 million for the effect of New York's recent tax legislation. It lowered its second-quarter sales outlook by $5 million to $12 million. Duane Reade's stock fell 18 cents, to $14.46 a share.

Vancouver Wins 2010 Winter Olympics by 3-Vote Margin

BYLINE:  By RICHARD SANDOMIR

DATELINE: PRAGUE, July 2 

 BODY:
Vancouver was selected as the site of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games today in a vote by the International Olympic Committee, defeating Pyeongchang, South Korea, and Salzburg, Austria, to bring the Games to Canada for the third time.
 "It was a photo finish," Jean Chretien, the prime minister of Canada, said at a news conference after the vote at the Hilton Hotel here. "That's what's great about sport, but winning is winning." 
 It took two rounds of balloting to determine the outcome. In the first round, Pyeongchang topped Vancouver, 51 to 40; Salzburg received 16 votes, eliminating it from the competition. Because the 51 votes for Pyeongchang were not a majority, the I.O.C. went to a second round, with Vancouver defeating Pyeongchang, 56 to 53. 
 "Ahead doesn't matter unless you win," said Un Yong Kim, an influential I.O.C. member from South Korea. "But we did our best. We did very well."
 The selection of Vancouver could hinder New York City's chances of winning the 2012 Summer Games if the I.O.C. proves reluctant to award the Games twice in a row to a North American city, although it did so before (Montreal in 1976 followed by Lake Placid, N.Y., in 1980, and Los Angeles in 1984 followed by Calgary, Alberta, in 1988). In 1932 both the Winter (Lake Placid) and Summer (Los Angeles) Games were held in the United States.
 Dr. Jacques Rogge, the I.O.C.'s president, has discounted the notion of an unofficial geographic rotation. 
 New York's deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, Daniel L. Doctoroff, was part of the city's three-member delegation here. "We were agnostic about the outcome of the vote," he said. "It's not a negative from our perspective. I do believe the Olympic movement makes its decisions based on which cities will host the best Games, and which city will best advance its ideals and values."
 Standing in the sweltering hotel lobby, swarming with contingents from all three 2010 bid cities, he said, "It's a little intimidating to know that in two years this will be us."
 The selection of Vancouver pleased NBC Sports, which agreed last month to pay $820 million for the rights to the 2010 Winter Games and nearly $1.2 billion for the 2012 Summer Games. A North American Games means much of the competition will be carried live in the United States, nearly guaranteeing higher ratings than a mostly taped European or Asian Games.
 "I just felt Vancouver would win it," Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports, said. 
 "Did I think it would be three votes?" he said, referring to the margin of victory. "Absolutely not." 
 The strong support for Pyeongchang stunned some I.O.C. members. "Most important was that first round," Ottavio Cinquanta, a member from Italy, said. "There was no race with Salzburg."
 The voting in the early rounds tends to be volatile. Sydney, Australia, trailed in three of the first four rounds in the voting for the site of the 2000 Summer Games, eventually beating out Beijing by two votes. Vancouver entered the balloting today widely viewed as the favorite, but its margin of victory was surprisingly small over Pyeongchang, a little-known city that is only 60 miles from the demilitarized zone and whose supporters had argued that winning the Olympic bid would help reunify the Koreas.
 Even though the balloting was secret, some members said the final result combined several factors: the fundamental strengths of Vancouver's bid; the powerful European voting bloc, the largest in the I.O.C., which may have wanted to wait for the selection of the site for the 2012 Games to designate another European city; and some weaknesses in Salzburg's bid, including some unmet guarantees in its budget and accommodations.
 Richard W. Pound, one of three I.O.C. members from Canada, said: "The Europeans voted strategically. A whole bunch of European capitals want it in 2012, so they didn't want to go for it in 2010."
 Thomas Bach, a German delegate, said, "It was clear Salzburg was No. 3, and it was confirmed by the evaluation commission report." 
 The 14-member evaluation commission, which assessed the qualifications of the cities bidding for the 2010 Games, did not explicitly rank the three cities, but it clearly had the fewest misgivings about Vancouver.
 The five European cities lining up to bid for the 2012 Summer Games are London, Paris, Moscow, Madrid and Leipzig, Germany. Other challengers, in addition to New York, include Istanbul and Brazil's entry of Rio de Janeiro or Sao Paolo.
 London, Paris and Moscow have all been sites of Olympic Games, most recently the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow, which suffered an American-led boycott because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
 By Olympic standards, Pyeongchang is a small town, having more in common with Lillehammer and Albertville than Salt Lake City, Vancouver or Turin. Government and bid officials from South Korea recognized that their biggest disadvantage was the city's lack of a world reputation.
 The Koreans were thrilled that the evaluation commission had refused to rank the three cities, and with ecstatic fervor pitched themselves as the equal of Vancouver or of Salzburg, the home of Mozart, with its annual music festival and the downhill skier Hermann Maier.
 Each of the contending cities made presentations to the members of the I.O.C. before the balloting. When it was the turn of Pyeongchang, the last of the cities to make a multimedia presentation, Kim pleaded to the delegates, "I now humbly appeal to you to give an opportunity to Pyeongchang."
 Gong Ro Myun, chairman of the city's bid committee, added, "Please try something different this time," a suggestion that it was time to move off the traditional North American-European axis for the Winter Games. The only Asian hosts of the Winter Games have been Nagano, Japan, in 1998, and Sapporo, Japan, in 1972.
 Pyeongchang's pitch that the I.O.C. explore the city's "hidden treasure" and help it establish itself as the Asian winter sports paradise nearly worked.
 Gerhard Heiberg, the chairman of the evaluation commission, said that before his group traveled to Pyeongchang earlier this year, he thought the city was trailing Vancouver and Salzburg. "But we were very pleasantly surprised," he said during a news conference after the vote. "You had a feeling this is a serious contender."
 Rogge said, "Pyeongchang is now on the map, and that was not the case before."
 But some I.O.C. delegates said that the strengths of Vancouver's bid, from its security plans to its facilities to its athletes' villages, ultimately provided the edge that led to its selection.
 Pyeongchang expects to bid again for the 2014 Winter Games.
 "It was based on sport," Roland Baar, an I.O.C. member from Germany, said. "The Austrian bid was cultural, and the Korean bid was too political." 
 Baar said of Vancouver's selection: "I think it was a good choice. They were the most sports-related bid."
 Kevan Gosper, an I.O.C. member from Australia, said, "Vancouver's bid was deserving, and Pyeongchang was outstanding and very much a surprise."
 The 2010 Games will take place in two areas: within Vancouver and at the Whistler ski area. For the first time, the opening and closing ceremonies will be held indoors, at B.C. Place Stadium.
 Vancouver received a financial bonus in the price that NBC will pay to televise the games. "It exceeded our budget estimate," Jack Poole, chairman of the Vancouver bid committee, said. "We're likely to overachieve on our budget."
 The rapid dispatch of Salzburg seemed to disappoint that city's contingent deeply. Salzburg's Alpine winter sports Mecca is in a compact geographic area, and its plan required the building of the fewest new facilities. Salzburg made an enthusiastic, yet eccentric, presentation to the I.O.C., led by a high-spirited opera singer, Annely Peebo, and ending with another, Grace Bumbry, singing "Climb Ev'ry Mountain" from "The Sound of Music."
 "There are no silver and bronze medals for us," Wolfgang Schussel, Austria's prime minister, said. "We lost. Our revenge in 2010 will be that our men and women athletes will win many medals."

HEADLINE: Italian's Sharp Tongue Punctures Image of United Europe 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

DATELINE: BERLIN, July 2 

 BODY:
Stung by criticism, the Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, suggested today to a German member of the European Parliament that he would make an excellent leader of a Nazi concentration camp.
 The remark, made on the day after Mr. Berlusconi took over the rotating presidency of the European Union, enraged the German Socialist, Martin Schulz, set off a diplomatic furor and suggested that the swashbuckling Italian leader might produce more division than reconciliation in a Europe grappling with several difficult issues. 
 Those issues include adoption of a new constitution as the 15-member union expands next year to 25 members, and relations with the United States, which were frayed by the bitter debates leading up to the Iraq war. Mr. Berlusconi has stood far closer to President Bush than the German and French leaders. 
Mr. Berlusconi, whose combative, bristling style and control of much of the Italian media have made him a controversial figure across the Continent, was giving a routine inaugural policy speech today to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, when Mr. Schulz questioned his suitability for his new post.
The German legislator specifically raised Mr. Berlusconi's sponsorship of a new immunity law in Italy at a time when he is on trial in Milan on bribery charges.
"Mr. Schulz," Mr. Berlusconi said in reply, cocking his head to one side and smiling, "I know there is a man in Italy producing a film on the Nazi concentration camps. I would like to suggest you for the role of leader. You would be perfect."
In response, Mr. Schulz said: "Mr. Berlusconi, if I understood him correctly, invited me to appear as the commandant of a concentration camp." He went on to say it was very hard for him to accept that someone capable of such a remark should lead the European Union.
Italy's ambassador in Berlin and Germany's ambassador in Rome were summoned by their host governments to receive formal protests. Germany quickly issued a statement labeling Mr. Berlusconi's remark unacceptable. 
But for the European Union, the deeper significance may be as an augury of what lies ahead during the six months of Mr. Berlusconi's presidency.
"The incident and resulting breakdown hang in the air," the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung commented as news of Mr. Berlusconi's exchange with Mr. Schulz began rocketing through Europe. "If the coming months are only occupied with dumb provocations and vain character assassination, it is going to be difficult to move forward the European project. Being reasonable is not everybody's thing."
The greeting Mr. Berlusconi got in the parliamentary hall even before the exchange with Mr. Schulz presaged the polarizing effect many believe he will have. 
Placards held aloft by leftist legislators read, in several languages, "Nobody is above the law" and "No Godfather for Europe."
Even before the session, Mr. Berlusconi's assumption of the union presidency had received enormous media attention in Europe, most of it unfavorable.
The most persistent charge, made for years, has to do with conflict of interest. As Italy's biggest media entrepreneur -- he owns the country's biggest publishing house and three national television stations -- Mr. Berlusconi has been widely accused in his own country of using his political power to favor legislation beneficial to his business interests.
Two weeks ago, Mr. Berlusconi's political allies in the Italian Parliament passed a law that exempts the top five serving government officials, including the prime minister, from criminal prosecution. The adoption of the law put a stop to the trial of Mr. Berlusconi, already under way in Milan, though the court holding the trial has challenged the constitutionality of the legislation.
In addition to being the first sitting Italian prime minister to testify as a defendant in a criminal case, Mr. Berlusconi has aroused the ire of the European left by his open admiration for President Bush and by his support of the Iraq war. His relations with some European leaders, particularly Gerhard Schroder of Germany and Jacques Chirac of France, are said to be very tense.
But while in the past Mr. Berlusconi has mostly been an issue for Italians, who have twice elected him prime minister, the prospect of Italy's presidency of the European Union sharply ratcheted up the negative views in the European press.
The cover story in Der Spiegel on Monday showed a picture of Mr. Berlusconi with the caption, "The Godfather," and contained this comment: "At home he dismantles justice, subjugates television and has laws tailored to his needs, and now he will represent Europe."
The Economist, which before his electoral victory in Italy two years ago ran an article titled, "Unfit to Lead Italy," more recently ran another with the headline, "Unfit to Lead Europe."
To counter the negative attention he has been getting, Mr. Berlusconi published a letter today in four newspapers in Italy, Germany, France and Spain in which he shot back at his critics. "No one is in a position to give lessons in morality to a government elected by the Italians," he wrote.
Mr. Berlusconi refused to retract his comment to Mr. Schulz, saying it was meant in an ironic way.
"It was the way in which he spoke," Mr. Berlusconi later said of Mr. Schulz. "It was his gestures. He attacked me and was extremely offensive about me and my country. I replied to his insults ironically with a joke."

PERSON: Ivan Allen Jr. 

HEADLINE: Ivan Allen Jr., 92, Dies; Led Atlanta as Beacon of Change 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Ivan Allen Jr., who as mayor of Atlanta led racial integration efforts in the 1960's at a time when other Southern cities were erupting in violence, died yesterday in Atlanta. He was 92.
 Mr. Allen, the grandson of a Confederate cavalryman, came from a wealthy and distinguished Georgia family and overcame his original segregationist beliefs. This personal transformation allowed him to lead Atlanta to integrate schools, its municipal work force and its businesses with such deftness that the city gained a national reputation for racial tolerance during his service as mayor, from 1962 to 1970. 
 "Over the turbulent waters of the 1960's, Ivan Allen was the human bridge from the old South to the new in Atlanta," said Gary M. Pomerantz, author of "Where Peachtree Meets Sweet Auburn" (Scribner, 1996), which chronicles the Allen family history.
"Literally on his own back, he carried the city's white establishment to a more enlightened day," Mr. Pomerantz continued at the interview yesterday.
The trajectory of the journey of Mr. Allen and his city is suggested by the fact that in his first Democratic mayoral primary, his opponent was Lester Maddox, the segregationist who died last week. The second mayor to succeed him, only four years after he served, was Maynard H. Jackson Jr., the city's first black mayor, who received strong backing from blacks and whites alike. Mr. Jackson also died last week.
As Mr. Allen desegregated swimming pools and hired Atlanta's first black fireman, among many similar moves, he presented his actions as necessary to preserve the city's reputation for moderation. He told Mr. Pomerantz that "business pragmatism" was how he cast his racial message.
The surging 1960's Atlanta economy, reflected by the soaring atriums of the local architect John Portman, was the pleasant backdrop to Mr. Allen's two four-year terms. The mayor used the city's glossy image to attract professional baseball, football and basketball teams to the city.
But his friendship with prominent blacks, particularly the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., became an increasingly important part of his life. The dinner he held in 1964 to honor Dr. King for his Nobel Peace Prize, attended by the city's elite, was seen as a pivotal moment for race relations in the city.
Ivan Earnest Allen Jr. was born in Atlanta on March 15, 1911, and was the only son of the owner of a successful office-supply company. The older Mr. Allen served as a state senator.
Ivan Jr. joined the family company in 1933 after graduating from the Georgia Institute of Technology, and in 1936 began his public service by serving as a treasurer of the state's Housing Authority. In World War II, he served in the Army Quartermaster Corps in the United States.
In 1946, he became president of the family company, and its sales increased to $8 million from $1.3 million in five years. He found time in 1945 and 1946 to serve as executive assistant to Gov. Ellis Arnall, a political moderate.
In 1957 Mr. Allen ran for governor as a segregationist, but dropped out because of lack of support. He became president of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, which worked closely with William B. Hartsfield, mayor of Atlanta for 25 years, to smooth racial tensions and portray the city to outsiders as more progressive than the rest of the South.
In March 1961, as chamber president, Mr. Allen brokered an agreement between white merchants and black leaders for the desegregation of the city's lunch counters at the same time schools were to be integrated, starting in the fall. 
Mr. Allen won almost all of the black votes in the mayoral election, enough to overcome Mr. Maddox's majority of white voters, Mr. Pomerantz said. In his first term, in December 1962, blacks and liberal whites criticized him for erecting a fence between a black and a white neighborhood, but he refused to back down until forced to do so by court order. Blacks also criticized his demolition of a black neighborhood to make way for a sports stadium.
That same December, an air crash in Paris killed 200 Atlanta cultural leaders. Mr. Allen flew to France to help identify bodies.
"This was my generation," he said. "My friends."
In 1963, Mr. Allen appeared before the Senate Commerce Committee to testify in favor of the Kennedy administration's civil rights bill, the only major Southern politician to do so.
The mayor was swayed to speak in favor of the bill by a call from President John F. Kennedy, whom he admired so much that his office chairs were modeled after Kennedy's famous rocker.
"It will not only not defeat you, but it will help you get re-elected," Kennedy said of Mr. Allen's appearance.
Mr. Allen won a second term with majorities of voters of both races. In 1966, he walked into a racial riot in Atlanta's Summerhill section. He chatted with the rioters, even asking one for a cigarette. The policemen were wearing helmets, but he refused one.
"Cover up all this gray hair?" he said.
After his second term, Mr. Allen returned to his business and many civic pursuits, including Boy Scouts. He is survived by his wife, Louise Richardson Allen, and two sons, Hugh Inman and Beaumont. His eldest son, Ivan III, died in 1992. 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 8, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Thursday about Ivan Allen, mayor of Atlanta from 1962 to 1970, misstated the date and the number of casualties for the 1962 Paris plane crash that killed many Atlanta cultural leaders, whom he flew to Paris to help identify. It occurred on June 3, 1962, not in December; 130 people (not 200) died, including 124 members of the Atlanta Art Association.

HEADLINE: Bush's Record on Jobs: Risking Comparison To a Republican Ghost 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
For George W. Bush, the race has begun to escape comparisons to Herbert Hoover.
 With more than two million jobs having disappeared since Mr. Bush took office in January 2001, he finds himself in danger of becoming the first president since Hoover to oversee a decline in the country's employment. Economists disagree on how much blame, if any, Mr. Bush deserves for the long slump, but even White House aides view the economy as one of the only big threats to his re-election campaign. 
 Now, a turning point could be approaching. The Labor Department will release its jobs report for June this morning, and some forecasters are predicting that it will mark the beginning of a rebound. An increase in the nation's payrolls -- the odds of which are roughly even, Wall Street economists say -- would be the first since January.
Then the real test for the Bush administration will start. Mr. Bush has called the recently passed tax cut the main reason for economic optimism, and administration officials have repeatedly referred to it as the "jobs and growth" plan, part of its official name, to emphasize its goal.
"Listen, I'm interested in one thing," the president said during a rally last month in Fridley, Minn., to promote the tax cut. "I'm interested in helping people find work."
According to the White House's forecast, the increased consumer spending and business investment from the tax cut, combined with the economy's underlying growth, will easily push Mr. Bush's jobs record into positive figures. Even if the economy merely adds jobs at the average rate of the last 50 years, he will rank roughly in the middle of modern-era Republican presidents, who have held office during weaker periods of job growth than Democrats. 
But the length of this economic slowdown has surprised almost all economists, and some have begun to say there is a significant chance that the economy will not erase the jobs deficit by the end of 2004. Among the three best-known forecasting firms in the United States, Economy.com puts the chances around 33 percent, Global Insight at 25 percent and Macroeconomic Advisers at about 20 percent. Employment gains would have to average about 120,000 a month for the American work force to return by the end of next year to its size in January 2001.
While the difference between positive and negative numbers can be somewhat arbitrary, statistics are likely to play a central role in the speeches of the 2004 campaign, political strategists and economists say.
Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, has begun summarizing Mr. Bush's economic record as "$3 trillion deeper in debt, 3 million fewer jobs." (While private-sector payrolls have fallen by more than 3 million, the overall decline has been 2.4 million because of government hiring.) 
Democratic presidential candidates have made a practice of mentioning job losses during Mr. Bush's term. And the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group financed by unions and foundations, plans to grade Mr. Bush each month on how well the job market lives up to the White House forecast.
The tax cut "was presented as if it were a jobs plan," said Lawrence Mishel, the group's president. "It should be judged as such."
Republicans largely agree. 
"There's no reason why we should be satisfied with 6 percent unemployment," said N. Gregory Mankiw, chairman of the White House Council of Economics Advisers. He added that the economy's plight was worse than the jobless rate suggested, but that the tax cut was likely to help reduce unemployment by end of this year.
The $350 billion plan reduces taxes on all households that make enough money to pay income taxes, among other measures. The benefits go mainly to high-income people, who pay most taxes. 
Still, Mr. Mankiw said that this summer, when the White House releases its next official forecast, it will probably reduce predicted job growth over the next year and a half from the 5.5 million it forecast early this year. Economic growth has been slower in the last few months than officials expected, and companies typically hire new workers only after executives are convinced that a healthy recovery has taken hold.
Administration officials have attributed the economic torpor to the 1990's bubble in stock prices and business investment, the accounting scandals in corporate America and the uncertainty caused by the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. Outside economists overwhelmingly agree that the hiring slump, which is the worst in 20 years and the longest since before World War II, is not chiefly Mr. Bush's fault.
"He was unlucky," said John H. Makin, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group in Washington. "And I would say I don't think the bubble was the fault of Democrats. People got overexcited. It just started to unravel in the fall of 2000."
The main argument is whether Mr. Bush has done all he could to mitigate the slowdown. 
His aides say that without the three tax cuts passed since early 2001, the jobs decline would have been even worse. By reducing taxes on capital gains and dividends, the latest measure will also increase investment, encouraging companies to expand, the aides add.
Many Democrats argue that there are more effective ways to stimulate the economy than tax cuts focused on the wealthy. They have suggested sending money to state governments, which are now cutting programs to close deep budget deficits of their own, and giving larger tax cuts to middle-class and poor families. 
Similar measures are one reason -- along with chance -- that the six presidents with the best records of job creation since 1933 are all Democrats, some people in the party say.
"It seems to me that we should be putting money into the hands of people who will spend it immediately," said Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California and a member of the Joint Economic Committee. "The worst part is creating this huge deficit and giving it to the 1 or 2 percent of Americans who won't do anything but increase their wealth with it."
People from both parties agree, though, that Mr. Bush's re-election chances will be improved if his record on jobs falls somewhere between Gerald R. Ford's and Ronald Reagan's, and well away from Herbert Hoover's.

PERSON: Najeeb E. Halaby 

HEADLINE: Najeeb E. Halaby, Former Airline Executive, Dies at 87 

BYLINE:  By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2 

 BODY:
Najeeb E. Halaby, who was once a leader in the airline industry and was known more recently as the father of Queen Noor of Jordan, died today at his home in McLean, Va. He was 87.
 Mr. Halaby, formerly of Alpine, N.J., had lived in McLean in recent years. He also had a home on Martha's Vineyard, Mass. 
 At various times in his life, Mr. Halaby was a skydiver, test pilot, lawyer and businessman, most notably at Pan American World Airways. He started as a senior vice president at Pan Am in 1965, became president in 1968, chief executive in 1969 and then chairman the next year.
In 1972, he was forced to resign as chairman and chief executive when the board blamed him for the line's worsening financial crisis. Mr. Halaby's tenure coincided with one of the worst slumps in the airline industry, compounded by a general recession, inflation, increased competition and the high cost of introducing the Boeing747. 
Mr. Halaby had championed the jumbo jet, predicting correctly that it would become a mainstay of air travel. "A chief executive likes to leave a company better than when he found it," Mr. Halaby said upon his departure. "I believe I have."
After leaving Pan Am, Mr. Halaby wrote a book, "Crosswinds: an Airman's Memoir" (Doubleday, 1978), ran an international law practice and headed a company that provided aviation technology to Arab countries.
Mr. Halaby became the father-in-law to royalty in 1978, when his daughter Lisa wed King Hussein and became Queen Noor al-Hussein. Ms. Halaby had studied architecture at Princeton University and had met the king a year earlier, at a ceremony in Amman marking the delivery of the Jordanian airline's first Boeing 747.
At 42, the king was 16 years older than his bride. Mr. Halaby later acknowledged some initial unease over the romance. But he said the king's vigor, directness and charm had won him over.
Mr. Halaby first became well known when President John F. Kennedy named him administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration in 1961. News reports of the era called him the first Arab-American to rise so high in government. In fact, he was already a veteran of government service, having been a foreign affairs adviser to the Pentagon and then a deputy assistant secretary of defense from 1948 to 1952.
Nor did the term "Arab-American" fit Mr. Halaby neatly. "I have always wanted to be an American, not a hyphenated," Mr. Halaby said in a 1979 interview. His father, Najeeb Elias Halaby, was a Lebanese-Syrian who came to the United States as a youth. His mother, Laura, was a native of Texas.
Najeeb Halaby, often called Jeeb, was born in Dallas on Nov. 19, 1915, an only child. After his father's death in 1928, he lived in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, Calif. He spoke a little Arabic as a boy, but "lost it" after his father died, he recalled later. 
Mr. Halaby was an indifferent student at Stanford University, where he was active in debating, acting and golf. He graduated in 1937 and attended the University of Michigan and Yale law schools, graduating from Yale in 1940. 
An avid flyer since he was a teen-ager, Mr. Halaby was a Navy test pilot in World War II. "I had a really fascinating war," he said jokingly years later. "Instead of slugging it out at Guadalcanal with the Marines, I was at Patuxent, Md., slugging it out with the elements, with aerodynamics and thermodynamics."
His 1946 marriage, to Doris Carlquist, ended in divorce in 1977. In 1980, he married Jane Coates, who died in 1996. In 1997, he married Libby Cater, who survives. In addition to Queen Noor, he is survived by a son, Christian, of Atherton, Calif., a daughter, Alexa, of Washington, and 10 grandchildren.
Mr. Halaby was, rather atypically for many businessmen of his era, an avowed liberal. He was outspoken about his political and philosophical leanings. He pressed for equal treatment for air crews of Hispanic descent and other minorities, including crew assignments on flights to South Africa.
Mr. Halaby's old airline, Pan Am, is no more. A prediction he made in 1971, while president of Pan Am, has not come true. "We know that worldwide supersonic flight will become as commonplace in the decades ahead as jet travel is today," he wrote. The Concorde supersonic transport is now in its final days of flight.
But Mr. Halaby was more prescient in other ways. In September 1970, after a wave of airplane hijackings by Arab commando groups, Mr. Halaby said Pan Am would cooperate with stricter security requirements, including armed guards aboard planes if necessary.

 CORRECTION:
An obituary yesterday about Najeeb E. Halaby, the former airline executive and federal aviation official, misstated the name of the agency he was named to lead in 1961. It was the Federal Aviation Agency; it later adopted the name Federal Aviation Administration.

HEADLINE: Brazil Ponders Nestle's Acquisition of Competitor 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, July 2 

 BODY:
When it finally comes to the crunch, a $230 million acquisition by Swiss multinational Nestle of Garoto, the maker of some of Brazil's favorite chocolates, promises to be the toughest test yet for the country's fledgling antitrust authorities.
 Brazil's monopoly watchdog, known by its acronym CADE, is expected to rule in the coming weeks on the purchase, sealed over a year ago by Nestle Brazil's chairman Ivan Zurita in a campaign to overtake Kraft Foods as market leader in this country of 175 million people, who eat about $1.1 billion in chocolate a year. 
 The sale would give the new company a 56 percent market share and a near monopoly in some sectors. Kraft and Cadbury Schweppes, which lost out to Nestle in the bidding for Garoto, petitioned CADE to block the deal. 
The justice and finance ministries, which also have a say in antitrust policy, have opposed the merger. Nestle was forced to sign an agreement that would allow the merger to be undone if CADE, a Portuguese acronym for the Administrative Council for Economic Defense, deemed it necessary.
If approved, the purchase of the country's third-largest chocolate maker by its second-largest will certainly have been a bold move by Mr. Zurita, who returned home to Brazil in 2001 after doubling Nestle's sales in Mexico. The acquisition would mean that Nestle would overtake Kraft's local operations. Kraft had bought Lacta, Brazil's most popular chocolate brand, in 1996.
Since then, Nestle had only managed to increase its market share to 32 percent from 30 percent, although national chocolate production had risen by 14 percent, to nearly 340,000 tons a year.
So Garoto, a company with a modern factory, strong domestic sales and a solid export base, was an interesting target, and an easy one, because at least 19 of the heirs of the Meyerfreund family, which owned Garoto, were squabbling over its future. Since then, four family members have made a big investment in a real estate project promoted by Donald Trump in the state of Sao Paulo.
CADE officials declined to comment before reaching a decision. 
Many industry insiders and market analysts are becoming increasingly vocal in their criticism of the deal.
"This merger should not be approved," said Genilson Fernandes Santana, a partner at MCM Consultores Associados in Sao Paulo. 
"The consumer will definitely suffer," he said, "because there will be less competition and, as a result, serious price hikes."
Projections made by MCM, using a model based on that used by the United States Justice Department, show prices rising by more than 21 percent for blocks of chocolate, nearly 17 percent for boxes of candies and almost 32 percent for solid confectioners' chocolate. In liquid confectioners' chocolate, the merged company would have a monopoly, allowing it to raise prices at will.
Caio Tomazelli, chief executive of Chocolates Prawer, an independent manufacturer from the southern city of Gramado that currently buys its raw materials from Garoto and Nestle, said the merger would mean "hyperconcentration in the supply chain."
"Short-term, we are going to be completely dependent on them if the merger goes through," he said. Mr. Tomazelli is already looking across the border in Argentina for alternative suppliers, but he predicted that it could take the sector more than five years to readjust.
Cadbury Schweppes, which was outbid by Nestle for Garoto, is complaining that Nestle's domination will make it virtually impossible for newcomers to enter the market. "Cadbury believes that Nestle simply wants to close the market," said Tito Amaral de Andrade of Machado, Meyer, Sendacz e Opice, a lawyer for Cadbury.
Despite what many consider to be obvious reasons for the antitrust agency to block the sale, neither Mr. Tomazelli nor Mr. Santana expects the regulator to do so. Founded in 1962, the agency only started to gain real power with new antitrust legislation in 1994.
Although it has started to flex its muscles, with trust-busting actions against the local steel industry, supermarkets and gas stations, and imposing conditions in Brazil on the 1995 acquisition by Colgate Palmolive of Kolynos, it has frequently been stymied by politicians when it came to bigger deals.
In 1999, under intense government pressure, CADE allowed Brazil's two largest beverage companies, Brahma and Antartica, to form AmBev, now one of the world's largest brewers.
And in the next months, its seven-member council is widely expected to bend again to the government's will and approve the merger of the country's two top airlines, Varig and TAM. The government has said the merger is the only way to save debt-ridden Varig, one of Brazil's most prestigious brand names.
In both those instances, the creation of a "national champion" has been used as a reason to justify the mergers. But in the Nestle-Garoto case, the winner would be a foreign multinational.
While the new, left-leaning government might be more willing than its predecessor to use anti-big-business rhetoric, analysts say that Nestle's total assets in Brazil, worth 2.6 billion reais ($940 million) in 2001, may ultimately be what count.
"Brazil is still under a lot of pressure to be seen to be receptive to foreign investment," said Mr. Santana. "The impact of a Nestle openly criticizing Brazil's investment climate at a time like this would be very damaging."
Some think it is more likely that the agency would impose restrictions on the sale rather than overturn it. Mr. Santana said the agency could veto the deal in certain sectors of the market where concentration would be particularly high, like raw chocolate supplied to confectioners. Alternatively, Nestle could be asked to spin off some of Garoto's big brands. Mr. Santana added that he did not expect any tough measures to be taken, but would like to be surprised.
"Time is playing in Nestle's favor," he added. "The more time passes, the more difficult it will be to undo the deal. The two companies have been under the same command for over a year now."
Nestle has signed a "reversibility" deal with CADE, meaning it cannot touch the managerial structure of Garoto until it receives antitrust approval. But some Garoto distributors are already preparing court cases against Nestle, saying they are being forced to cut their margins from 17 percent to 10 percent to 14 percent, said Oldemar Delgado, a lawyer representing a large distributor.
The former head of CADE, economist Gesner Oliveira, says the risks to competition are serious.
"A cold, technical analysis of the facts," he said, "would recommend a non-approval."
Then again, it was on Mr. Oliveira's watch that CADE approved the AmBev merger.

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums children under 12 and museum members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays (and most galleries and museums are closed today), but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

* "ART OF THE FIRST CITIES: THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN TO THE INDUS," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Aug. 17). The most timely exhibition in years, as well as diplomatically dexterous and beautiful. It surveys the culture of the third millennium B.C., mainly centered in Mesopotamia, the crucible of Sumerian civilization, where art, architecture, law and writing developed with the rise of the earliest cities. The beginnings of a cosmopolitan art are in tiny cylinder seals and in figurines. The show is full of small objects that are monumental in concept. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $7, students and 65+ (Michael Kimmelman).

* MAX BECKMANN, Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 45-20 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400 (through Sept. 29). Like Beckmann, this retrospective of that German genius is dense, frequently revelatory and exhausting -- all that heavy-handed symbolism and claustrophobia. Beckmann can seem like a truculent master, glaring balefully at us from his self-portraits, disappointed by our moral turpitude. It is easy to get bogged down in the miasma of his obscure allusions. But he also puts brush to canvas with surprising tenderness. Color is luxurious, not garish. The humor is sly and black. Finally, he is unavoidably compelling. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m; to 7:45 p.m. on Fridays. Admission: $12; $8.50 for students and 65+ (Kimmelman).

"CONTEMPORARY ART/RECENT ACQUISITIONS," the Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 423-3200 (through July 27). Eighteen new acquisitions, made over the last two years, demonstrate the Jewish Museum's commitment to a program of acquiring with-it current works. All created since 1975, the objects include -- besides painting, sculpture and photography --examples of video and installation art. The artists, who hail from Canada, Germany, Israel and South Africa as well as the United States, include Nan Goldin, Robert Longo, Nancy Spero, Fred Wilson, William Kentridge and Michael Lombardi, among others. Their contributions range from film projections by Mr. Kentridge dealing with the troubles of his native South Africa as reflected in the lives of two fictional Jewish nonheroes, to a video film by the Americans Sanford Biggers and Jennifer Zackin that juxtaposes home movies made in the middle-class milieus of their respective black and white families. The new additions fit well into the complex picture of Jewish identity offered by the museum. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m.; Fridays, to 3 p.m. Admission: $10; $7.50, students and 65+ (Grace Glueck).

"DRAWN HOME: FRITZ VOGT'S RURAL AMERICA," American Folk Art Museum, 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 265-1040 (through Sept. 21). During the last decade of the 19th century, Vogt, a German immigrant, supported himself by making portraits of homes in upstate New York. A homeless itinerant who preferred to sleep in his patrons' barns, Vogt made wonderfully lucid, formally ingenious drawings of farms with multiple outbuildings and of elaborately decorated Victorian showpieces with manicured grounds. The 26 drawings here tap into an American ethos that elevated domestic prosperity to something like a national religion. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Admission: $9; $7, students and 62+ (Ken Johnson).

* "DREAMING IN PICTURES: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF LEWIS CARROLL," International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 857-0000 (through Aug. 31). A photograph is at least as much a looking glass as it is a window. We see in it our own reflections and obsessions. A post-Freudian world has inevitably come to see C. L. Dodgson's photographs through the looking glass of his alter ego, Lewis Carroll. This provocative show tries to put Dodgson's pictures back in their context, to stress that we have lost touch with Victorian conventions, which Dodgson largely obeyed when he photographed little girls. Childhood to Victorians represented, as the show's curator puts it, an "alternate reality, a metaphysical state of preknowledge." Dodgson, he adds "could pose his charges in adult roles, give them guns, daggers and exotic costumes, even portray them as odalisques and half-dressed waifs, because he and most of his audience believed so emphatically in their total insulation from the implications of such postures. These presentations do not so much underscore the latent sexuality of the child (as we post-Freudians would have it) as they do an obvious lack of it." Hours and admission: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7, students and 62+ (Kimmelman).

* "LANDSCAPE OF MEMORY: THE ART OF MU XIN," Asia Society and Museum, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400 (through Sept. 7.) The artist and writer Mu Xin, born into a wealthy aristocratic family in China, received a classical scholar's education and early exposure to Western culture. Targeted as a dissident during the Cultural Revolution, he was held in solitary confinement for 18 months, and he secretly wrote a series of first-person meditations now called "Prison Notes," which he carried out of jail sewn in his clothes. Under house arrest several years later, he executed a remarkable series of small landscape paintings in which traditional Chinese themes and Leonardo da Vinci meet. The paintings and some of "Prison Notes" are brought together in this lean, penumbral exhibition, organized by the Yale University Art Gallery and the David and Alfred Smart Museum of Art at the University of Chicago. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays to 9 p.m. Admission: $7; $5, students and 65+ (Holland Cotter).

"MATERIAL DIFFERENCES: ART AND IDENTITY IN AFRICA," Museum for African Art, 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-7700 (through October). Part Art Methods 101, part Advanced Connoisseurship, this handsome, thoughtful show examines the potent connection between matter and meaning in diverse African cultures and shows them to be organically connected. The material is spiritual in these cultures, and the show's 130 mostly ceremonial objects, arranged strictly according to materials and techniques, reflect the power of that belief. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students and 65+ (Roberta Smith).

"ELIE NADELMAN: SCULPTOR OF MODERN LIFE," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through July 20). Despite the clarion title, this exhibition is too monotonous, stiffly installed and short on drawings to do full justice to the erudite, polymorphous achievement of the Polish-born American sculptor Elie Nadelman (1882-1946). Still, don't miss this opportunity to see his work in quantity, especially the streamlined wood figures from the 1920's and the small, truculent plaster figurines, which were found in his studio after his death. Their suave economy, ineffable stillness, delicate gestures and seamless blend of historical and popular sources place them among the most complex, fully visual sculptures in Western art. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+ (Smith).

"NOGUCHI -- THE BOLLINGEN JOURNEY: PHOTOGRAPHS AND DRAWINGS, 1949-1956," Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum (temporary space), 36-01 43rd Avenue, Sunnyside, Queens, (718) 204-7088 (through Oct. 13). More than 100 photographs and drawings recreate Noguchi's travels from 1949 to 1956, on a grant from the Bollingen Foundation. The project was for an ambitious book (never completed) on the spaces and structures -- religious, monumental, classical and communal -- of familiar as well as less-documented societies. Besides providing an elegant travelogue, the photographs give some idea of the many sources that Noguchi drew on for his work. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for students and 65+ (Glueck)

* "THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF CHARLES SHEELER," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Aug. 17). This majestic progression of 90 vintage prints will cause some ripples in the big familiar pond of American Modernism, within which Sheeler is known foremost as one of the chief instigators of Precisionist painting. But his most profound, original response to Cubism came through the camera, in tautly composed photographs of Pennsylvania farmhouses and barns, New York skyscrapers and Ford's River Rouge factory. Their confident fusion of abstraction and fact, reverence and scrutiny, puts them among the most radical art of their time; and they are an important precursor, at least in spirit, to Pop and Minimalism. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).

"PULP ART: VAMPS, VILLAINS AND VICTORS FROM THE ROBERT LESSER COLLECTION," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Aug. 31). This murky exhibition showcases the small, gaudy, largely unappreciated paintings commissioned for the covers of the pulp magazines that ruled the newsstands between the wars. While ultimately a bit repetitious, their overheated depictions of sharp-jawed heroes, compromised heroines and various human and nonhuman villains highlight talents like George Rozen and Paul R. Frank. They also give vent to the dark, violent, libidinous underbelly of the American psyche, to the same degree that Norman Rockwell's paintings bless its wholesome, repressed, preternaturally sunny side. The show is essential viewing for anyone interested in popular culture past or present. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; $3 for students and 62+ (Smith).

"ANDY WARHOL: SCREEN TESTS," Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 45-20 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400 (through Sept. 1). From 1964 to 1966, Warhol shot 500 short, silent, black-and-white films of artists, musicians, actors, writers, filmmakers, models, curators, celebrities and hangers-on at the Factory. The Modern has restored 277 of these screen tests, representing about 34 hours of watching time, and now 28 are being shown continuously on six screens. The subjects include Baby Jane Holzer, Salvador Dali, James Rosenquist, Dennis Hopper, Cass Elliott and Susan Sontag -- but they are of variable interest. By shooting the films at one speed and playing them more slowly, Warhol exposed the mechanics of discomposure and charisma. Some people are fascinating as they lose charisma; others are not. It has nothing to do with handsomeness, histrionics, coolness, slimness, trying or giving up. The typology of charisma is as elusive as the typology of criminality. Hours and admission: See above (Sarah Boxer).

* "WHISTLER, WOMEN AND FASHION," Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700 (through July 13). A dandy, a wit and a social butterfly who cultivated his image as a star aesthete, James McNeill Whistler (1834-1903) had a lifelong interest in fashion and women's clothes. This show honors the centenary of that painter's death by exploring his intense, unabashed involvement with fashion. He obsessed over what his female sitters wore, choosing the clothes they posed in and in some cases actually designing them himself. For Mrs. Frances Leyland, the fashionable subject of one of his most smashing pictures, "Symphony in Flesh Color and Pink" (1871-1874), he created an elegant, loose-fitting tea gown of diaphanous pink chiffon worn over a white underdress. The display includes many major images of women in their finery. It is a fitting tribute to a bravura brush. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays to 9 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $12; $5 for students; $8 for 62+ (Glueck).

"YARD," Socrates Sculpture Park, Vernon Boulevard at Broadway, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 956-1819 (through Aug. 3). This lively theme show stretches one of the most resonant of four-letter words (for American suburbanites, at least) from the domestic to the environmental, encompassing notions of family, nature, design and devastation. Oscillating between the real and the surreal, the work on hand also expands the sculptural medium to include photography, video and a large painting-based mural that epitomizes the blight that is American domestic architecture. Other works make similar points, especially Andrea Bowers's sadly telling video documentary about a tree-sitter trying to save a 400-year-old oak from an oncoming thruway. Hours: daily, 10 a.m. to sunset. Admission: free (Smith).

Galleries: Uptown

* CY TWOMBLY, "A Gathering of Time," Gagosian, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313 (through July 12). Mr. Twombly is celebrating his 75th birthday with a suite of six new paintings and one Roman-candlelike sculpture. With the help of a skylight, they create one of the most beautiful sights, and immersive experiences, of the summer art season. Washes of pale aqua swabbed with turpentine to create drifting, dripping blooms of white have a festive and aqueous effect and push Mr. Twombly's longtime obsessions with walls, wounds, graphic vandalism and ecstatic marks toward Monet's "Waterlilies" (Smith).

"PUERTO RICAN LIGHT: JENNIFER ALLORA AND GUILLERMO CALZADILLA," Americas Society Gallery, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212) 249-8950 (through July 20). Ms. Allora and Mr. Calzadilla are young conceptual artist and collaborators who divide their time between Puerto Rico and New York, and this show brings both places together. The centerpiece is a 1965 fluorescent sculpture by Dan Flavin titled "Puerto Rican Light (to Jeanie Blake)," which derives its illuminating power from solar energy gathered in San Juan and stored in batteries in the gallery (Cotter).

ALES VESELY, "Infinite Point," Carosso Fine Art, 42 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-5400 (through July 30). Mr. Vesely, a Czech sculptor, thinks in monumental terms. His materials are nature-made boulders and even mountains, combined with steel structures. Fortunately, he is a strong draftsman, drawing his projects -- built or unbuilt -- with such flair that even in two dimensions they have a vivid presence. Most impressive, among the projects here are drawings for "Mountain of Mountains," a sheer-sided peak rising from a "sculptural landscape" of desert rocks and mesas, and serving perhaps as a site for reflection on the balance between human and cosmic (Glueck).

Galleries: 57th Street

"MARIKO MORI: WAVE U.F.O.," atrium at 590 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 980-4575 (through July 31). This Japanese artist, whose past work blended science fiction, fashion and esoteric Buddhism, has been designing interactive spiritual hardware, and this podlike container is her most ambitious piece so far. It accommodates three electrode-wired participants at a time, and they are treated to a son-et-lumiere projection of their brain waves, followed by an eye-rinsing aurora borealis of Ms. Mori's devising. The high-tech work is fun while it lasts and must have cost someone a fortune to produce (Cotter).

DON NICE, "Paintings on Anodized Aluminum," Babcock, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 767-1852 (through Aug. 5). Since the 1980's Mr. Nice's primary format has been the totemic arrangement of images -- mostly flora and fauna and now abstract passages, too -- in cut-out structures around a central theme. Here the theme is almost always a bright, sunny landscape quickly observed, and surrounded by a heraldic framework that includes, along with abstract passages, stereotypical images of birds, fish, flowers and animals representing air, earth, fire and water. A departure is that he has adopted anodized aluminum for his support rather than canvas or paper, providing a lustrous, light-struck surface. This helps enliven his slick and decorative formula (Glueck).

JULES OLITSKI, "Spray Paintings of the 1960's," Ameringer Yohe Fine Art, 20 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 445-0051 (through Aug. 1). That the spray-painted Color Field paintings that Mr. Olitski made in the 60's once seemed such an important culmination of Modernist art history is something to ponder. Was it the merit of the paintings, which have, at their best, an expansive, confectionery prettiness? Or was it the mesmerizing rhetoric of their champion, the czar of formalism, Clement Greenberg? (Johnson).

"TAKE OUT," Zabriskie, 41 East 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 752-1223 (through July 18). This cleverly titled and conceived group show is about the art of subtraction. Paul de Guzman cuts the text and images out of art books, leaving intricate, three-dimensional grids. Robin Charles Clark selectively scrapes away the ink from dollar bills; Marla Hlady exposes the inner mechanics of toys; Courtney Smith carves Art Nouveaulike patterns into found cabinets; Noriko Ambe cuts organic landscapes into reams of paper; and Markus Baenziger paints lovely bunnies, birds and trees around simulated, scratch-off lottery tickets (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

"BOYS OF SUMMER," ClampArt, 531 West 25th Street, (646) 230-0020 (through Sept. 6). If you like to look at men and you're passing by, stop in. Standing out among the crowd of pictures by more than two dozen photographers are "Bruce in His Car," a 1981 portrait of a skinny bohemian in his big red convertible by Nan Goldin; a beefy, shirtless young football player celebrating with his team, by Brian Finke; men in leather, by Barbara Nitke; and, by Malerie Marder, a large color image of a mixed-sex group of naked people relaxing in a California bathhouse (Johnson).

MERLIN CARPENTER, "Children of the Projects," American Fine Arts, 530 West 22nd Street, (212) 727-7366 (through July 19). Like a grunge-generation Philip Evergood, Mr. Carpenter has created a suite of brushy, intentionally clumsy and overbearingly sentimental paintings that allegorize the plight of poor urban children. A boy in huge sneakers resembles an op-ed cartoon about escapist dreams of athletic success. Two boys in hip-hop clothes, one aiming a handgun at himself, illustrate suicidal tendencies nurtured by poverty. Something is being mocked here, but it is not clear exactly what (Johnson).

DONNA MOYLAN, "Paintings on a Theme," Nicole Klagsbrun, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 243-3335 (through Aug. 1). Ms. Moylan's partly abstract, partly representational meditations on global strife of the last two years are visually engaging and poetically affecting. Feathery gestures and painted whorls following the grain of plywood panels morph into smoking, apocalyptic landscapes, sparsely populated by wan, tiny people and by trucks and helicopters. She evokes a curiously contradictory mood of playfulness and mournful anxiety (Johnson).

"ONLINE," Feigen Contemporary, 535 West 20th Street, (212) 929-0500 (through Aug. 9). Not about Web art, but about the traditional use of line, this 38-artist show includes too much that is only tangentially linear. But works like Daniel Zeller's intense fields resembling a zany topographical map, Hilary Harkness's fantasy of sexy girl sailors drawn with Ingres-like refinement and Beth Campbell's branching diagram of her possible futures suggest that a more focused investigation of the varieties of linear expression in contemporary art would be worth pursuing (Johnson).

TONY RAY-JONES, Ariel Meyerowitz, 120 11th Avenue, at 20th Street, (212) 414-2770 (through July 11). With a light, poetic touch and affectionate humor, Ray-Jones captured perfect moments of metropolitan pluralism -- a quartet of exotically costumed black men watched by elderly British ladies, for example -- as he explored dog shows, beauty contests and strongman competitions with a sharp sociological eye but no condescension. Ray-Jones died in 1972 at 30; this exhibition shows why he nevertheless has inspired succeeding generations of British photographers (Johnson).

JOEL SHAPIRO, PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, (212) 929-7000 (through July). If the sculptures of Donald Judd and Elie Nadelman had children, they might grow up to look like the best works in Mr. Shapiro's exhibition. They are the ones beautifully fabricated in various woods: airy, floating jumbles of tenuously connected boxes that visually resolve from certain angles into figures jauntily dancing or assuming graceful yoga postures. A pair of giant bronzes, however, look ponderous and overscaled (Johnson).

* DO-HO SUH, Lehmann Maupin, 540 West 26th Street, (212) 255-2923 (through July 11). Mr. Suh's full-scale re-creation of his vacant New York apartment, including outer hallway and stairs leading to a nonexistent second story, is a wonderful blend of the mundane and the miraculous. From a distance, it is a ghost house, with translucent walls, stairs, doors, and kitchen and bathroom fixtures all made from sheer, slightly metallic blue, green and purple nylon. Inside you discover that everything from the door hinges to the toilet has been realized with loving attention to detail (Johnson).

* KARA WALKER, Brent Sikkema, 530 West 22nd Street, (212) 929-2262 (through July 25). Ittakes an unflinching surrealistic imagination to get a grip on American history, the psychic legacy of slavery in particular. This inspiring exhibition of works on paper proves that Ms. Walker has what it takes. Drawing with seemingly effortless spontaneity and an uncanny knack for cartoon ventriloquism, she illuminates primitive and obscene fantasies lurking in the shadows of the American collective unconscious (Johnson).

CHUCK WEBSTER, "Plenty," ZieherSmith, 531 West 25th Street, (212) 229-1088 (through Aug. 8). Mr. Webster's playful semiabstract compositions, painted and drawn with brusque immediacy on small, distressed pieces of paper, include mandalas, crystalline fields, frames within frames, circulating sperms, bodily organs, spirals, glowing discs and other metaphysically suggestive motifs. Tacked up edge to edge and running almost all the way around the gallery, 163 of these pictures create an engaging, diaristic visual journey (Johnson).

"WORKS ON PAPER," Marvelli Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 627-3363 (through July 12). Each artist in this fine show brings to paper a distinctive intensity: Dean Smith accumulates tiny, radiating pencil marks into iconic floral images; Guy Hindley draws crystalline topographical visions on Mylar; Andrea Frank paints trees and animals in washes of extreme delicacy; Tim Maxwell generates swirling cosmologies out of miniaturistically detailed fragments; Nicolas Touron draws sweet, small, surrealistic cartoons; and Kurt Lightner presents a patchy collage of shimmering color and light (Johnson).

JOHN ZINSSER: "BIBLE STUDIES"; DAVID MAISEL: "THE LAKE PROJECT PHOTOGRAPHS," Von Lintel Gallery, 555 West 25th Street, (212) 242-0599 (through July 12). Using only two colors, but working them to gorgeous effect, John Zinsser has produced a group of same-size nonobjective paintings loosely based on the 1960's Abstract Expressionism heritage. To a ground layer of enamel, he applies oil paint by different methods: brush, squeegee, palette knife. The enamel often shows through, producing what he calls a duochrome effect. The paintings are a lot about paint for paint's sake, but they are not without spiritual associations, justifying their Biblical titles. In another room, David Maisel also creates abstract imagery, with the aid of a camera and a cooperative reach of arid, eroded land called Owens Valley in California. His aerial photos of the colorful geological mayhem there have the force of abstract paintings (Glueck).

Galleries: SoHo

"- NOT(PAINTING) : EXTENDING THE FIELD," Ise Cultural Foundation, 555 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 925-1649 (through July 19). This group show organized by Koan-Jeff Baysa is about painting, but there is no actual paint in sight. Margaret Evangeline shoots holes with a gun through steel panels; Gyoko Yoshida inserts wood stretchers into silk organdy bags; Habib Kheradyar deals in fabric and moire effects; Kunie Sugiura's photographic works were made by leaving live chickens on sheets of photographic paper overnight; Monica Castillo's video records a ballet dancer spilling paint all over herself; and Emma Dewing composes a 21-foot-long wall work out of feathery splashes of cooled molten pewter (Johnson).

CINDY WORKMAN, Lennon, Weinberg, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 941-0012 (through Aug. 1). With found cartoons, comic book imagery and abstract elements dissonantly layered over pornographic photographs from the 1950's and 60's, Ms. Workman's large inkjet prints, laminated to sheets of transparent plastic, are curiously reminiscent of David Salle's early paintings. In contrast to his misogynistic gloom, however, her works offer an insouciantly feminist take on sex and power (Johnson).

Other Galleries

"BLINKY," Foxy Productions, 129 Bedford Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-9016 (through July 13). Visions of pop culture past and of utopias to come run through a group show at this storefront gallery. The artist team called A Constructed World offers painting of an extraterrestrial phenomenon, and Sarah Ciraci photographs of buildings, lifting off like spaceships. A jittery spaciness emanates from a video by the collective Paper Rad, which transformed Gumby cartoons into a narrative of apocalyptic danger and deliverance, while the work of Cory Arcangel, a member of the collective Beige, turns hacked versions of 1980's video games into beautiful little abstract videos that pulse to an electronic beat (Cotter).

* "THE NEW WORLD'S OLD WORLD: PHOTOGRAPHIC VIEWS OF ANCIENT AMERICA," AXA Gallery, 787 Seventh Avenue, at 51st Street, (212) 554-4818 (through July 19). From the mid-19th-century onward, photography played many roles in the frontier territories of North and South America: as a scientific instrument, a surveillance device, a definer of cultural identity and an aesthetic form. This beautiful show documents those uses and offers a sustained meditation on the shadow play of picture-taking and politics (Cotter).

"NOT NEUTRAL: CONTEMPORARY SWISS PHOTOGRAPHY," Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780 (through July 19). It is not a good sign when an exhibition appears to be contradicted by its title, but so it is with this gathering of photo-based work by nine artists born or living in Switzerland. Although beaming with competence and impressively diverse, nearly everything operates comfortably within the well-defined borders of received ideas (Smith).

BILL SAYLOR, "Softail-Project," Leo Koenig, 249 Centre Street, TriBeCa, (212) 334-9255 (through July 26). Abstraction Expressionism meets outlaw motorcycle gang culture in Mr. Saylor's bracingly ugly canvases. He paints winged skulls, charging sharks and a bear wrestling an octopus with impulsive gestures in dirty as well as garish colors. Best is the sculpture in the back room -- a standing, life-size polar bear with a wooden leg and a mystic third eye (Johnson).

HEADLINE: Toiling to Keep The Song Alive 

BYLINE:  By SETH KUGEL 

 BODY:
Two weeks ago the singer Paloma put on an all-black outfit -- bell-bottoms, a long-sleeved mesh of fishnet and a top emblazoned with an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe -- and headed to her Friday night gig at Guadalajara de Noche, a tiny Mexican restaurant under the No. 7 elevated line along Roosevelt Avenue in Queens. 
 That Sunday, Consuelo Santiago, the Mexican immigrant known as Paloma, left her Queens apartment to do a very different kind of work: cleaning other people's houses. Singing and cleaning are just two of the ways this 23-year-old cobbles together a living for herself and her 7-year-old daughter, Jennifer. She also designs outfits for other Mexican singers, and recently has looked into starting a home-based catering business. 
 Making a living as a musician in the restaurants where Latino immigrants eat in Queens, the New York borough with the most foreign-born residents, is not easy. Moonlighting is nothing new to struggling musicians, but whereas struggling American-born and educated musicians might have day jobs as office workers or waiters, these singers typically work in low-end immigrant jobs: cleaning houses, washing dishes, delivering packages. 
With the economy sputtering, neither their day jobs nor their night gigs are stable. Restaurant owners along Roosevelt Avenue -- the main immigrant strip that shifts from Ecuadorean to Irish to Filipino to Colombian to Mexican in a matter of miles -- say business is drastically slower than it was just a few years ago. Many restaurants have canceled their live entertainment, forcing local musicians to seek jobs farther away from home or simply to give up music altogether. 
Of those who still work, many lead double lives, spending weekdays in the lower echelons of the New York labor market and evenings and weekends as entertainers. The families whose houses she cleans, said Ms. Santiago, know nothing of her singing career. "I don't like to tell them," she said. "I have wanted to when I get mad, but no."
Guadalajara de Noche is a long and narrow place, an unwieldy layout for live entertainment. The small stage, about 6 feet by 2 feet, is crammed between the bar in front and the tables in the back. The Jackson Heights restaurant attracts the kind of crowd that thins at the end of the month as rent comes due. It is usually a mixture of couples and families, and at the bar, a familiar Roosevelt Avenue scene: tired Mexican men, back from some laborious and underpaid job, drinking Coronas and looking melancholy.

Sad songs
The karaoke-style sound system Paloma uses for her Tex-Mex music is set for what might be called stereophonic echo chamber, incongruously making her seem as if she is welcoming a crowd of thousands to an arena rather than a dozen or so to a cozy restaurant. Her favorite songs are sad ones, like "La Tequilera," about a woman who drowns her sorrows with tequila, and she does a lot of Selena covers. 
As in many such places, customers with some singing ability occasionally ask to take the stage. Paloma is also spelled and, to some extent, upstaged by her daughter, who wears a matching outfit, and though she spends part of her mother's performance playing with a set of "Finding Nemo" stickers, Jennifer takes the stage with aplomb. If anything, she is more energetic than Paloma, perhaps because her diminutive size gives her some room to prance around the tiny stage.
The next evening, seven blocks away on Roosevelt Avenue, the band members of Embajada Musical plays accordion-heavy, polka-inspired Mexican norteno music in the Azteca Restaurant, as they do every Saturday and Sunday. The show starts at 10, but on this evening the only customer in the room at that time was a thin, white-haired man sitting at the bar in a Maradona soccer shirt and Yankees sweat pants. The 15 tables covered in pink tablecloths and adorned with fake flowers were empty.
Unfazed, Santos Lopez and his band, mostly restaurant workers by day, directed their high-volume show to the Maradona fan, the bartender and three blank-faced uniformed waitresses. Nearly an hour later, there were still only nine people in the restaurant.
Then, literally at the 11th hour, in a whoosh of perfume, a group of a dozen celebrating their friend's birthday swept in, and the place suddenly came alive. The waitresses kicked into gear, taking their drink orders of Corona and Negra Modelo. When the band diverged from its Mexican repertory to strike up a recent Colombian hit, "El Hijo de Tuta," in which a worker disparages the undeserved good fortune of his arrogant boss, everyone got up to dance.

Worrying About the Rent
The band members can relate. When they are not making music, they mostly work in low-paying restaurant jobs, washing dishes or busing tables. Mr. Lopez lost what had been a steady job when the Dew Drop Inn restaurant in Greenwich Village closed, and since then he has scraped together enough to support his girlfriend and child taking whatever temporary jobs he can, and repairing the occasional accordion.
It is a tricky task to run a band under such circumstances. "It's difficult when you work somewhere else and you have to learn new songs," he said in an interview during a break. "We can't rehearse. Our schedules don't let us."
Members have frequently dropped out. "People are always worrying about the rent," he said. "Sometimes they lose their job and it becomes necessary for them to leave the group to look for work. They come and go, come and go. That's why it's difficult to progress in music."
Natives, a huge Colombian restaurant less than a mile away on Northern Boulevard, has music almost all day on weekends. Last month, on Father's Day afternoon, Fabio Marquez (on the guitar) and Manolo Rodriguez (on the banjo), who bill themselves as Duo Internacional, were serenading tables. They alternated sets with Sofia Alvarez, a manicurist at nearby Northern Nail on weekdays who roamed the floor with a wireless mike, singing ranchera music over the restaurantwide sound system. 
Like Ms. Alvarez, they do not make a solid living through music, although both used to, Mr. Rodriguez in Venezuela and Mr. Marquez in Colombia. Mr. Rodriguez, who is 62, now counts on his family for support, but even so, he recently started a one-man company, Silver Cup Window Cleaning. When Mr. Marquez came to New York 17 years ago, a friend got him a job with a jeweler in Manhattan, and he supplemented his income playing in restaurants all weekend, often until 4 a.m. He lost his day job at the end of last year. When his wife died unexpectedly in April, he could not afford to miss playing guitar the next day.
Mr. Marquez and Mr. Rodriguez stroll the restaurant, waiting for tables to call them over and request songs. "Peruvians come here, Argentines, Colombians, even Americans, and you have to have a repertory for everyone," Mr. Marquez said during a break. "People ask for songs from their country. It brings back memories of when they were dating." At the table of Jose Alberto Ospina and Luzdary Gordaliza, who were with their two children, Mr. Ospina requested "Mi Negra" for his wife. "It's a song I have always dedicated to her," he said. 
It is not unusual for a client to ask the duo to leave the restaurant and serenade a girlfriend or a family member at their home, and the managers of Natives permit the pair to leave and return after such missions.

Stevie Wonder, Sort Of
Another group of Queens-based minstrels is the Mariachi Tequila Azul. Several local restaurants hire mariachi bands, the crowd-pleasing uniformed troubadours, including Guadalajara de Noche. Tequila Azul, however, no longer has a regular gig in Queens. Although its musicians work late nights at El Gran Rancho Jubilee, a Dominican restaurant in the East Elmhurst section near La Guardia Airport, most of their work is outside the city. On Monday and Tuesday nights, when they play at El Bandido restaurant in Spring Valley, N.Y., the audience could not be more different from the typical crowd in Queens. That restaurant caters to a suburban crowd, as evidenced by the pinatas hanging from the ceiling and its faux Mission decor. 
That calls for an adjustment in music. Instead of crooning the romantic mariachi classics Latin Americans would expect, they play recognizable tunes like "La Bamba," "Oye Como Va" and, of course, the Champs' oldie "Tequila." They are popular, even though they bungle the lyrics of "Margaritaville" or know just one line of a Stevie Wonder hit. (Their version: "I just called to say I love you/I just called to say I love you.")
After their weekend gigs in Stony Point, N.Y., they have recently been making late-night stops in Queens at El Gran Rancho Jubilee. There, they return to the Latin classics, fielding requests for songs from artists like Pepe Aguilar, Vicente Fernandez and Marco Antonio Solis.
Those late nights can be especially difficult for Marcos Trujillo, 25, who plays two string instruments, the guitarron and the vihuela. When the band plays until late, he heads straight to his seven-day-a-week job delivering newspapers starting at 4 a.m. He is not often well rested. "Sometimes you sleep on the road," he said in an interview in the Queens apartment he shares with the group's leader, Wilson Moreno, and several others. "Sometimes you sleep two hours in the day and two hours in the night. Sometimes, when there's not that much work, you sleep five hours."
Mr. Moreno delivers packages for Dynamex. His irregular schedule also gets to him, but at least he can still make music the way he did back home. "There is no other alternative here," he said.
"It must be difficult if one is married," he added. "But I don't have that problem."
Actually, Mr. Moreno does have a wife and three children -- in Ecuador. He sends them at least $800 a month, leaving himself just enough to pay the rent, car insurance and food. 
Like so many immigrants, Mr. Moreno is torn between providing for his children by sending dollars from New York or moving back home to watch them grow up. His oldest child is 16. Recently he has been leaning toward heading home, so El Bandido may soon need a new mariachi group, and Dynamex may have a vacancy for a deliveryman.
"In this country there is a lot of money," he said. "But happiness is not in money." For the present, though, he is grateful for the work. "It's an independent job where you are your own boss," he said, "and they pay us for what we like to do." 
The other singers echoed Mr. Moreno's words: while they wish they could do better financially, they were happy to have a place to perform and glad to make some extra money doing it, especially during difficult economic times. 
Paloma took the long view. "For me, it's something that helps me get ahead for my daughter," she said. "She wants to be in ballet or maybe in karate. And this is something that I've always liked doing."

Spanish Serenades Are a Side Order

Many immigrant musicians from Queens who play restaurants at night have much less glamorous work during the day. A sampling of those musicians performing this weekend in Queens:

PALOMA. At Guadalajara de Noche, 85-09 Roosevelt Avenue, between 85th and 86th Streets, Jackson Heights, (718) 397-9666, every Friday night, 9 to 11.

EMBAJADA MUSICAL. At Azteca Restaurant, 92-01 Roosevelt Avenue, at 92nd Street, Jackson Heights, (718) 672-7373, tomorrow night and Sunday, beginning at 10 p.m.

DUO INTERNACIONAL. At Natives Restaurant, 82-22 Northern Boulevard, at 83rd Street, Jackson Heights, (718) 335-0780, tonight, tomorrow night and Sunday, 7 p.m. to 1 a.m.

MARIACHI TEQUILA AZUL. At El Gran Rancho Jubilee, 23-04 94th Street, at 23rd Avenue, East Elmhurst, (718) 335-1700, Sunday, beginning at 10 p.m. (They may also perform here after midnight tonight and tomorrow.)

HEADLINE: Graduates Hope They, and Liberia, Have a Future 

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

DATELINE: MONROVIA, Liberia, July 1 

 BODY:
It was a glorious Tuesday morning last week, said Winston C. Holt, who was in the soccer stadium in downtown Monrovia amid a sea of grinning would-be college graduates in shimmering black caps and gowns. Their proud parents clutched camcorders and flowers.
 The occasion was commencement for the class of 2003 of the African Methodist Episcopal University. About an hour into the program, as Mr. Holt, an economics major, was listening to a guest preacher speak about facing the future, an explosion in the distance announced the first mortars. 
 "Boom boom boom," was the sound Mr. Holt said he heard. Cellphones began trilling with calls from friends outside. Mothers and fathers began fidgeting in their seats. Some got up and left. The explosions got closer and closer. 
The capital was under attack once more. In the next two and a half days, several hundred Monrovians died.
The deaths were nothing new. The class of 2003 has grown up during 20 years of off-and-on war in a failed state now run by an accused war criminal, in a country so poor that it does not even rank on the United Nations Human Development Index for 2002.
Yet as their country disintegrates and President Bush considers sending American forces here as peacekeepers, young middle-class Liberians continue, remarkably, to dream of a better future.
"You have to be educated," declared Mr. Holt, 26, who graduated that morning with a 3.0 grade point average. "You never know what could come your way.'
Striving under these circumstances requires not just pluck, but an appreciation of the absurd.
And so Mr. Holt attended lectures in development economics, his favorite subject, in a country where the president's son drives a custom-made Mercedes 4x4 while babies starve to death.
Mr. Holt's classmate Famatta Sanoe, 25, wants to work in a bank, in a city where the banks are shuttered because of gunfights between government and rebel forces.
Their friend and fellow graduate Benjamin Tulay, 24, wants to pursue a graduate degree -- in public finance, he thinks. But this is a country where government militias are accused of robbing ordinary citizens of cars, rice and cash as compensation for unpaid salaries.
In fact, just the other night Mr. Holt's father, the Rev. George Franklin Holt Sr., managed to keep his attackers at bay only by calling an old friend and fellow Freemason, Defense Minister Daniel Chea. Today bullet holes dimple the black gate of the Holt residence. Above is a handmade sign, etched lovingly last week by Winston Holt's nephew. "Congratulations Mr. Winston C. Holt," it reads, "for a job well done."
Liberia was founded more than 150 years ago by black Americans, and until recently, all through the cold war years, it was among Washington's staunchest African allies. Today it is best known as the epicenter of chaos in West Africa, a breeding ground for drugged-out mercenaries in wigs who range the region spreading disorder.
But the Liberia you see at A.M.E. University is of a different order. Accounting is the university's most popular major. Economics is popular too.
"I guess because our economy is so bad," Ms. Sanoe said breezily.
Case in point: during a two-day period this week, after the bullets stopped flying, the price of gasoline fell from $8.70 a gallon to its normal price of $3.62. The price of a enough marijuana for a joint remained unchanged -- less than $5.
Hardest of all in this mess is planning ahead. Ms. Sanoe, for instance, was planning to take a job application test at one of Monrovia's principal banks this month. Now she has no idea ifthe exam will be held.
Mr. Tulay was planning to apply for fall classes at the University of Liberia. Now he does not know when registration will begin. "We have a plan and the next day it's all shot off," he said.
Mr. Holt, for his part, was counting on a friend in the United States who had offered to help him continue his studies at an American college in exchange for his services as a church organist. Mr. Holt says he has not heard from the friend in quite some time. Being a practical sort, he is considering trying his luck in Ghana instead.
His father, a high school principal whose classrooms now shelter displaced people, has reluctantly offered his blessings. "Those who are ambitious, those that want to better themselves, those that want to continue their education, they have to leave," his father confided. "There's no room for them right here."
"I know he has a future," he said of his son. "We are praying to God to make a way for him."
In the face of Liberia's disintegration, the A.M.E. University is itself a symbol of determined adaptation. Classes are held inside a half-finished building that looks more like a abandoned construction site than a temple of higher learning, with piles of sand in the courtyard and rainwater flooding the corridors. The building once housed the Rev. Holt's high school, also supported by the A.M.E. Church in the United States. It was demolished in the war in 1990.
This time around, a mortar shell fell on a church office next door, pocking its mustard-colored walls with shrapnel. Worse, the college administration building, including the president's office, was ransacked. Computers, typewriters, petty cash and college souvenirs were stolen. The other day, Winston Holt saw militias roaming through downtown Monrovia in A.M.E. University T-shirts.
David Parker, the school's general services administrator, said he had not yet been able to tally the cost of the damage. He prays that vandals spared the computer diskettes on which university records are stored. The president, Dr. Louise C. York, was so rattled by the latest events that she said she was not speaking to anyone, "except God."
The latest fighting, between forces loyal to the Liberian president, Charles Taylor, and his rebel enemies, turned the school's year-end plans upside down. The baccalaureate ceremony, originally scheduled for earlier in June, was canceled because rebels advanced toward the capital.
Bishop Richard Franklin Norris of Philadelphia, who was to deliver the commencement address, was forced to cancel his trip.
Then, with a cease-fire in place and calm returning to the capital, commencement exercises were set.
But the promise of Tuesday morning lasted only an hour. Shortly after the program began, so too did the mortar shelling and machine-gun fire. No one knew where it was coming from, or from how nearby. But everyone knew that the rebels were making a second bid to take the city.
Students stirred in their seats. Some stepped outside to see what was happening. "You're still in there?" Ms. Sanoe's friends shouted over her cellphone. "They're coming. Get out of there. Get home."
What kind of commencement would this be, Mr. Holt wondered.
"Hearing those sounds, it was not encouraging," he said. "That day, you should be happy. Even some of the parents, they started to leave. They couldn't stand the tension."
The class of 2003 stayed put. They forced the rambling guest speaker to cut his speech short. They waited for the university president to call the names of 185 graduates. A benediction was read. Pictures were snapped. The band played a gospel song, "My God Will Do It."
The gunfire kept getting closer.
"We needed that degree," Ms. Sanoe said of their decision to stay. "We deserved it so bad."
Diplomas in hand, the class of 2003, the hardiest of their friends and family at their sides, streamed out of the stadium. People filed through downtown with mattresses on their heads and terror in their eyes, not knowing in which direction lay safety. 
Graduates who lived on Monrovia's west side, where fighting raged most intensely, had no way of getting home. Mr. Holt still has not heard from most of them.
That night there were no graduation parties. "We couldn't go anywhere," Mr. Holt said. "People just came home and listened to heavy artillery."

HEADLINE: Legal Reprieve For Wall Street Is Not Likely To Last Long 

BYLINE:  By LANDON THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Judge Milton Pollack's summary dismissal this week of three investor suits against Merrill Lynch has been embraced by an investment banking industry battered by years of litigation and criticism over its research practices.
 Bank executives quietly concede, though, that the decision is not likely to have a significant impact on the many arbitration cases in which investors aim to prove that they relied on fraudulent stock research when they incurred their losses. 
 Judge Pollack bluntly declared that it was the collapse of the Internet bubble that caused investor losses and not research analysts like Henry Blodget, Merrill Lynch's former Internet analyst. The ancient notion of caveat emptor was reaffirmed and by no less a legal authority than Judge Pollack, a 96-year-old judicial titan who has been handling complex securities law issues since the 1930's. 
Less noticed amid the excitement was that Judge Pollack appeared to be knocking down a straw man in throwing out the Merrill Lynch suits. Legal experts and analysts are in wide agreement that the class-action suits brought against Merrill Lynch were surprisingly frivolous: the investors were not clients of the firm and they did not make the case that they relied on Merrill Lynch's research when they made their investment decisions. 
Many of the plaintiffs were online investors, seeking short-term gains on volatile and risky stocks like 24/7 and Interliant.
A large number of other arbitration cases aim to show that clients of Merrill Lynch and other brokerage houses relied on analyst research in making their decisions.
Nowhere in his decision does Judge Pollack address this investor class, which, analysts say, has experienced billions of dollars of losses during the stock market collapse.
"These suits were an embarrassment, and Merrill should indeed be pleased," said E. Reilly Tierney, a brokerage analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton. "But what he didn't do was make clear what the threshold for reliance was."
E-mail evidence showing that Mr. Blodget and Jack B. Grubman, Salomon Smith Barney's former telecommunications analyst, disparaged the stocks they covered and acknowledged the influence of investment bankers on their research has spurred an increase in arbitration suits -- many of which are also considered frivolous. 
Arbitration lawyers say that there are many cases pending that clearly show that investors who were clients of investment banks relied on the research of Mr. Grubman and Mr. Blodget in making their investments. To make their case, they said, they plan to produce e-mail in which investors discuss the research with brokers, proof of quantifiable losses, and the research itself.
"I have a number of cases where there is clear evidence that investors relied on research," said Jacob H. Zamansky, an arbitration lawyer in New York who gained notice by winning a $400,000 claim against Merrill Lynch in 2001. "As long as you can show you are a customer of the firm and that you relied on its research, you should be able to win in arbitration. What the Pollack decision will do is weed out all the bad cases."
Arbitration suits have soared in the wake of the stock market crash. Through May, cases filed before NASD, which handles 90 percent of arbitration disputes, have increased 22 percent from the same period last year, and a growing number are now claiming that fraudulent research from firms like Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith Barney caused clients of these firms to lose money.
Analysts estimate that arbitration and other civil litigation cases will eventually cost the big investment banks billions of dollars.
To be sure, lawyers for the investment banks will brandish the Pollack decision with gusto when they argue their cases in coming arbitration cases -- just as lawyers for investors have leaned on the e-mail evidence arising from the investigation into tainted research at Wall Street firms by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general.
And when arguing a case against a client who claimed to have read Mr. Blodget's research cover to cover, bank lawyers will point to the section of Judge Pollack's decision stating, "Blodget's opinions of possible future stock performance were replete with risk warnings of the potential that the stock price could drop significantly."
Still, by agreeing to settle with regulators this April, the banks with a big network of individual customers, like Merrill and Citigroup, have tacitly agreed to the claims made by regulators that some of the research they issued during the boom was fraudulent, even though they neither admitted to nor denied such accusations.
As long as arbitration lawyers can prove that their clients relied on fraudulent research, they have a chance to win cases, Judge Pollack's decision notwithstanding.
In fact, the ruling made no mention of whether Merrill's research was fraudulent. The judge's point, instead, was that even if the research was fraudulent, the plaintiffs could not prove that their losses were tied to the research because they were not Merrill Lynch clients.
The investors needed to demonstrate that they had relied on Merrill's research.
"Judge Pollack emphasizes that if there had been reliance, it would have been a very different case," said Alan R. Bromberg, a professor of securities law at Southern Methodist University. "For people who can prove that they relied on Merrill's research, they may have a case. But to say that I bought Blodget's stock after reading his research is not enough. Ultimately, a jury will have to decide: did you rely, and if you did, did you reasonably rely?"

HEADLINE: Subway Cars' Last Stop: Under Sea, Not Ground 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT HANLEY

DATELINE: CAPE MAY, N.J., July 3 

 BODY:
The hollowed hulks of 50 obsolete New York City subway cars were dumped into the Atlantic Ocean off South Jersey today to begin a watery new life as a haven for fish.
 The 50-foot cars, known as Redbirds and long the workhorses of New York's numbered subway lines, became the latest and largest additions to a man-made artificial reef about eight miles off Cape May. 
 Bradley M. Campbell, New Jersey's environmental commissioner, seemed ecstatic after spending about 90 minutes watching a steam shovel push the dull-red hulks off a barge into about 70 feet of water. They all sank in seconds. 
"This is the biggest enhancement of our artificial reef system in one stroke," he said. "This is a win for New Jersey's fishermen, a win for the shore economy and a win for the marine environment because we're enhancing fish habitat."
Mr. Campbell expressed none of the misgivings about asbestos in the old cars that two years ago prompted the state to reject New York City's offer of 650 Redbirds. New York State passed on a similar offer. But New Jersey leaders have since changed their minds, and are eager to use the cars. Over the next two months, four more New Jersey reefs will each receive 50 of the cars.
Recreational and commercial fishermen extolled the subway cars as welcome additions to the artificial reefs, which are piles of old Army tanks and armored personnel carriers, tons of concrete and other construction debris, and scrap steel. The reefs first attract mussels, barnacles and tiny plants. Then sea bass, tautog and flounder come to feed on them. Later, bigger game fish, sometimes tuna and sharks, arrive.
Fishermen say the reefs, like all underwater structures, teem with marine life and become a boon to their hobbies and livelihood. 
New York City Transit called ocean disposal the cheapest and easiest way to get rid of the 40-year-old Redbirds.
Yet some jitters about asbestos in the cars linger. New York State, for instance, has passed up a chance to obtain 650 Redbirds for the 11 reefs it has built off Long Island since 1962. The state's Department of Environmental Conservation is still not convinced the asbestos is safe for marine life.
"There's conflicting opinion on whether the cars are safe or desirable," said Matt Burns, a spokesman for the department. "Our first choice is to use more benign materials."
Mr. Campbell, New Jersey's environmental commissioner, said he was satisfied the asbestos would not harm the environment. He said he based his opinion in part on a 2002 study by the federal Environmental Protection Agency that found that ocean disposal of the cars was safe.
That study was issued about a year after New Jersey's acting governor, Donald T. DiFrancesco, rejected the offer of 650 cars for the reefs, citing concerns about the asbestos.
Asked today why the state had reversed its position, Mr. Campbell said, "We took a closer look at the science and we weighed the interests of our saltwater anglers more heavily, and then we struck a more balanced approach."
David Ross, the New York City Transit official overseeing disposal of the Redbirds, said the agency was satisfied the asbestos would not pose problems. "In the water, it doesn't have any health hazard at all," Mr. Ross said as he watched the old cars, one by one, sink into the ocean.
The asbestos, he said, is embedded in an epoxy substance in the floor tiles of the cars and between their exterior and interior walls. The substance was used for insulation, soundproofing and fire retardation. Mr. Ross said New York City Transit was satisfied the epoxy would remain intact, with the asbestos lodged in it, for decades in the ocean.
He said rocks in the ocean naturally contain asbestos. If any ever escapes from the epoxy, he said, it will be little different from asbestos getting loose from ocean rocks.
The Environmental Protection Agency study Mr. Campbell cited dealt with four New York subway cars dumped on an artificial reef off Delaware last year, and five others from Philadelphia's mass transit system placed on an artificial reef off Sea Girt, N.J., in 1990. The study's author, William Muir, an E.P.A. oceanographer, said he studied ocean water in and around the nine cars and found that asbestos levels did not exceed naturally occurring background levels at the two sites.
He also said that laboratory testing he performed on the epoxy from the subway cars shows that it did not dissolve, convincing him that there was little likelihood it would break up in the ocean.
The cars dumped offshore today were stripped of all doors, windows, hand grips, signs, wheels, engines, and oil and grease, Mr. Ross said.
"Anything you don't want in the ocean we take off," he said.
Nearly 1,000 of the Redbirds have already been dumped in the last two years on artificial reefs off four other Atlantic Coast states. Delaware got 567, while 200 went to South Carolina, 150 to Virginia and 50 to Georgia, Mr. Ross said.
New York City Transit has only about 100 Redbirds left, Mr. Ross said, and they will go to museums or serve as work trains in the subway system. Cleaning and ocean disposal of the 1,200 cars will cost Mew York City Transit about $16 million, he said, half the estimated cost of cutting up the cars and burying them.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 14, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on July 4 about the placement of 50 obsolete New York subway cars in the ocean off Cape May, N.J., to enlarge an artificial reef misidentified the equipment used to push them off a barge. It was a diesel-powered hydraulic excavator with a backhoe attachment, not a steam shovel.

HEADLINE: French Exchange Students Get the Cold Shoulder 

BYLINE:  By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
First it was French wines. Then French fries. Now it's French exchange students who are getting the cold shoulder from American families still smarting over France's opposition to the war in Iraq.
 Program coordinators and others say that the drooping economy, global tensions and the recent outbreak of SARS have all cut into the summer ritual of students from various countries spending the summer in American homes. 
 But the programs that seem to have it worst are those selling Americans on the virtues of taking home a little bit of France this summer. 
"This has been a horrible year," said Deborah Bertrand, the New York area manager for Loisirs Culturels a L'Etranger, a not-for-profit exchange program based in Paris. "Usually I have no problem finding host families. The only thing I can attribute it to is the anti-French feeling going on because of the Iraq war. My coordinators all up and down the East Coast are having the same problem."
Each year, L.E.C., as the program is known in France, signs up several hundred French teenagers whose parents have paid dearly for them to come to the United States for a summer tradition that has endured for more than three decades. But this year, even though the number of prospective visitors is one-quarter what it once was, the program has yet to find host families for nearly half the 250 teenagers who signed up.
The first wave began arriving on Monday, and unless homes can be found quickly, four Boston-bound teenagers in that group will get refunds instead of trips. At least 100 participants in the program who expected to come in August are also in limbo.
" 'Not this year' is what I hear a lot," said Mary Lou Church, an L.E.C. recruiter in Portsmouth, R.I., who is taking extra students into her own home this year rather than turn them away. "This year, with everything that happened with the war, people locally have just taken it personally. When I ask them, 'Would you open your home to a French teenager?' they look at me like, 'Are you out of your mind? Why would we, when they've been so ungiving to us?' "
Hers is one of the few programs in the Northeast that pays $100 to families to cover groceries and incidentals. So she believes that the economy is an unlikely culprit. "I start talking about exchange programs and they say, 'Great.' And when I say they're all from France, end of conversation."
Maybe not here, but in France they are still talking about "the little incident of Carcassonne," as Daniele Thomas Easton, the French honorary consul, put it. A group of 15 students from that city in southwestern France had planned to visit the United States in August at the invitation of the Springside School, a private girls' school in Philadelphia. After four American host families pulled out, the school retracted the invitation, suspending an informal exchange program that has existed since 1976.
When the incident was reported in the European press in June, the French Embassy in Washington interceded, and enough new families stepped forward in the Philadelphia area to receive 10 teenagers after all.
The strained hospitality is hardly one-way. In France in recent weeks, spectators at sporting events have jeered American athletes and renditions of "The Star-Spangled Banner," and one exchange program that sends Americans to France -- A.F.S. Intercultural Programs in New York -- said its French-bound program took longer to fill this year. Nonetheless, program coordinators say, French host families do not seem to be refusing American students who make the trip.
There is no precise count for the number of French students who enter the United States each summer on tourist visas. Nearly 100 organizations are members of the Council on Standards for International Educational Travel, with many of the largest handling anywhere from 300 to 500 French students each. At a minimum, that suggests that a few thousand French students a year head this way for short stays.
The harsh economy, terrorism and the outbreak of SARS have made finding host families a challenge, according to John Hishmeh, the council's executive director. But globalization, the Internet and cheap airline travel, he said, have conspired in another way as well. "Having a foreign student is no longer a novelty in a lot of communities," he said.
Ms. Bertrand, a Syracuse woman who is L.E.C.'s coordinator for New York and parts of Connecticut, said that most years she has been allowed to make pitches to French classes at five area high schools. This year, she said, only one school granted access. Ads in church bulletins drew little response, and appeals to local newspapers went ignored, she said.
She finally became so exasperated that she drafted an open letter to prospective hosts that was more cri de coeur than letters from the lovelorn.
It started with, "What is wrong with central New York people?" It ran in The Post-Standard in Syracuse, and in slightly altered form -- lambasting "Connecticut people" -- in The Advocate in Stamford, Conn.
"Are we so self-serving that we've lost touch with the true meaning of America?" it went on. "Are our lives so busy that we can't open our hearts and homes to children who want to learn about our culture? Or perhaps we're still in the anti-French mind-set?"
Though it was not the response she hoped for, her letter drew an immediate reply from John Vogler, a retired machine operator in Syracuse. "Where was France when we needed its support to back us in the war on terrorism against Iraq?" he wrote to his local newspaper. "As far as keeping Franco-American friendship alive, it died six months ago."
In a telephone interview, he added: 'That would be the last kid I'd want to take in right now. They can keep their wine and cheese. They'd all be speaking German if it weren't for us."
Things were not much friendlier in southern Connecticut, where L.E.C. also recruits. Wilfrid Malonga, the program's coordinator in Stamford, was so irked by the poor response he was getting that he altered his pitch. His new solicitations sought families who might be interested in being host to a "European" student, with no mention of the fact that the students happened to be French. He said he got more calls, but no takers once details were given.
"Two years ago, I was just inundated," said Mr. Malonga. "I had to select families. Now it's kind of slow." As a native Parisian, he says, he is trying hard not to take the backlash against all things French personally, as he hopes the students in France are doing. "They have nothing to do with the political situation in France, and they are admirers of this country," he said.
Jeremy Ahier, 17, one of the teenagers from Carcassonne who will be in Philadelphia in August, said through an interpreter that he was "most interested in learning more about the Amish." A friend who will be joining him on the trip, Pierre Robin, 17, said he wanted to visit museums and take in a baseball game.
Roland Stern, the managing director of L.E.C. in Paris, said that in years like this one, outreach programs mean more than ever.
Linda Alario, a lawyer who talked her husband into opening their home in Syracuse this year to a French student named Sandra LeClair, said: "I thought this is the year to do it. When the war began, so many people reacted as though the French did not have the right to express their opinion."
And when all else fails, the recruiters are recruiting one another. Late last week, Ms. Church, the Rhode Island recruiter, and her husband, a tugboat operator, bailed out the program when they agreed to receive Sebastien Plantet, a young man from Versailles who arrived on Sunday but had nowhere to go.
Ms. Thomas Easton, the honorary French consul in Philadelphia, expressed confidence that any French teenagers who made it to America this summer would not be disappointed. In the end, she said, they want what every teenager around the world wants, and will find it here.
"They want to be away from Mom and Dad for a while," she said.

HEADLINE: In Blazing Bonus, 2 Sets of Fireworks Are to Fly on 4th 

BYLINE:  By DAISY HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
People going out to watch the fireworks along the East River tonight will get a bonus: two sets of fireworks, one in Midtown and the other downtown.
 Two barges of fireworks will be stationed on the river between Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, with the best viewing from the South Street Seaport and the Brooklyn Heights Promenade. Four more barges of fireworks will be on the river at its traditional spot, between 23rd and 42nd Streets. 
 The 30-minute show, the 27th Annual Macy's Fireworks Spectacular, will start at about 9:20 p.m., and forecasters are said to expect clear skies tonight along with high humidity and temperatures in the 80's. 
The two shows along the East River will be nearly identical. The barges, which measure 350 to 500 feet, will fire 30,000 shells, including some classic fireworks like the blooming white peonies and happy faces.
"Happy faces are a standard," said Robin Hall, the show's executive producer. "People would shoot us if we didn't do the happy faces."
Businesses in downtown Manhattan, still coping with the aftereffects of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack and the sluggish economy, are hoping the fireworks will increase sales. 
"It'll bring throngs of people to Lower Manhattan," Carl Weisbrod, president of the Downtown Alliance, said about the fireworks.
The best place for viewing the fireworks from Manhattan will be the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive in Midtown and Lower Manhattan and the South Street Seaport. In Brooklyn, good viewing spots will be at the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, Empire Fulton Ferry State Park and Furman Street.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said sections of the F.D.R. Drive below East 63rd Street would be closed to vehicle traffic after 3:30 p.m. today. In Brooklyn, Furman Street between Atlantic Avenue and Cadman Plaza West will be closed to vehicle traffic at 7 p.m. 
In Manhattan, pedestrian access to F.D.R. Drive will be limited to entrances at 23rd, 38th, 42nd and 48th Streets in Midtown after 7 p.m. There will be regular access to the drive in Lower Manhattan. The pedestrian walkways on the bridges will also be closed.
More than 4,000 police officers will be on special Fourth of July assignments, Commissioner Kelly said. That is a small reduction from the number of officers assigned last year, he said.
The police will also have 23 patrol boats on the waters, and the East River will be blocked to pleasure boats so it can be prepared for the fireworks.

HEADLINE: For Hospitals Seeking Split, Debt Is Glue 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
After a troubled marriage and a long separation, two of New York's premier academic medical centers, New York University and Mount Sinai, are moving toward outright divorce.
 But splitting up could prove just as tricky as merging. The hospitals' serious money problems present obstacles to dissolving the financial ties that still bind them, and officials say a final division probably remains years away. 
 It is no secret that the much-hailed 1998 union went bust; the medical schools and hospitals agreed in 2001 to give up on the idea and continue on their mostly separate ways. But in the last few months, they also set about severing connections in the few areas of operations they had successfully merged. 
The hospitals combined their information technology systems, but last week, they signed a 10-year, $380 million deal with I.B.M. to handle those functions -- a pact that explicitly provides for separate systems for the hospitals. The hospitals created a unified patient-billing office; recently, they have begun to take it apart. And as for the joint employee benefits function, "notice just went out to employees that it's being de-merged," said Sue Riley, chief financial officer of Mount Sinai Medical Center.
"We could, in fact, be functioning as two completely separate entities sooner than two years," she said.
Except for the debt.
After the merger, Mount Sinai and New York University Hospitals Center combined their debts, which total about $670 million. The problem, according to Wall Street analysts and hospital officials, is that they appear to be too weak, financially, to be able to redivide the debt -- which would mean refinancing -- and sever their ties.
After a series of credit downgrades, Mount Sinai N.Y.U. Health, the merged entity, is rated at the highest junk-bond status, making refinancing on its own prohibitively expensive. Hospitals often issue debt through New York State's Dormitory Authority, allowing them to pay low interest rates. But the authority requires hospitals to have at least an A- rating, several steps above Mount Sinai-N.Y.U.'s.
The Federal Housing Administration often helps troubled hospitals issue bonds, but under current rules, Mount Sinai-N.Y.U. would not qualify, because it has suffered three straight years of losses. In addition, federal tax law generally prohibits refinancing the hospitals' debt more than once during the lifetime of the debt, and most of their bonds were refinanced as part of the merger.
"Until they find a way of segregating their obligations, they can't really finalize the separation," said Bruce Gordon, a senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service. "But it isn't clear they can do that." 
Hospital officials say they plan to apply to the F.H.A. for a waiver of the usual standards and are exploring other options, including the possibility of petitioning Congress for a change in tax law.
N.Y.U. Hospitals operates on a roughly break-even basis, while Mount Sinai expects to lose about $70 million this year. N.Y.U. is especially eager to sever the connections between them, analysts and hospital officials say, and might consider unconventional steps, like paying off a significant part of its debt early, to enable a refinancing. 
An N.Y.U. Hospitals spokeswoman said the top executives of the medical center who could discuss the matter for the record were all on vacation this week and unavailable for comment. But recent developments were confirmed by other N.Y.U. officials.
"It's like you've moved out a long time ago, and now you're finally sitting down to work out divorce papers," said an N.Y.U. Hospitals trustee who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "It's a milestone even if it's no surprise. And then you find that there's no easy way to separate the financial accounts."
The view from Wall Street is that the partners are probably stuck with each other for several more years, at least. "No one feels that that's an untenable circumstance," said Dr. Kenneth Davis, president and chief executive of Mount Sinai. "We all feel that there are more important issues on each of our campuses that we're dealing with now."
Mount Sinai has taken difficult steps to improve its finances, and officials there say those measures have begun to pay off. Dr. Kenneth Berns was moved aside this year as the hospital's chief, and replaced by Dr. Davis, dean of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. The medical center has closed some outpatient clinics and eliminated 500 jobs. And after a hiatus of more than two years, it resumed advertising, at a cost that officials declined to divulge.
Dr. Davis says that after dropping sharply last year, the number of patients is up, thanks to advertising, the recruitment of new doctors, and other factors. Ms. Riley said that by the end of this year, the month-by-month profit and loss picture should be much improved.
Many hospitals in New York merged in the 1990's, hoping to gain financial strength. The results were a mixed bag -- some good, some bad, some in between. But the combination of Mount Sinai and N.Y.U is widely seen as the biggest failure.
On its face, it was a strong merger of esteemed institutions. On one side was N.Y.U. School of Medicine and N.Y.U. Hospitals Center, including the main hospital on First Avenue, N.Y.U. Downtown Hospital and the Hospital for Joint Diseases. On the other was Mount Sinai School of Medicine, and Mount Sinai Medical Center, including the main hospital on Fifth Avenue, and Mount Sinai Queens.
The union fell victim to many forces, notably turf wars, as forces on each side resisted yielding autonomy.
"Politically, you couldn't have had joint department chairs overnight, or sharing of some specialties," said M. Craig Kornett, senior director at Fitch Ratings, a Wall Street bond-rating firm. "But gradually, over five or six years, you could have done it, and you could have saved a lot of money."
A stated central reason for the merger was the hospitals' prediction that they would jointly negotiate better reimbursement rates from insurance companies, but that never happened. After merging, "they said that the added leverage would not provide improved rates, and we were just perplexed by that claim," Mr. Kornett said. "It seemed like they never really tried."
Mount Sinai has had more economic trouble than N.Y.U. in part because of its longstanding commitment to treating the residents of East Harlem, including many poor patients with limited or no insurance.N.Y.U. does not do nearly as much indigent care, partly because of its location, and partly because the main hospital is next to Bellevue Hospital Center, which carries much of that burden.
Mount Sinai was also hit hard by damaging publicity last year after an organ donor involved in a partial liver transplant died. A yearlong shutdown of the transplant program followed.

HEADLINE: No Major Taxes Will Rise, but Many Pockets Are Hit 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 3 

 BODY:
As he promised, Gov. James E. McGreevey did not raise New Jersey's sales tax, income tax or any other broad-based tax in the budget fight that ended this week.
 But it may be difficult to convince many New Jerseyans that the state is not claiming more of their paychecks, particularly if they are college students, smokers, gamblers, limousine drivers, theatergoers, real estate brokers or spouses planning a divorce. 
 Tucked away in the 300 pages of the $24 billion budget for fiscal year 2004, which began on Tuesday, are an assortment of strategically targeted tax and fee increases and financing cuts that will cumulatively hit the pocketbooks of millions of New Jersey residents in some way, seen or unseen. Cuts to higher education will lead to tuition increases at state universities, and cuts in aid to arts groups are likely to bring higher ticket prices. 
Mr. McGreevey won the highly publicized battles to raise taxes on casino and billboard companies, but he also imposed less-noted fee increases on an assortment of businesses: real estate brokers, alcohol manufacturers and distributors, restaurant and beauty shop owners and nursing home operators, and any business that deals with hazardous chemicals or uses a refrigeration unit or steam boiler.
In all, the McGreevey administration imposed more than $40 million in fee increases, including charges for limo drivers, real estate transfers and divorce filings.
While the grab bag of charges and surcharges may appear chaotic, it was guided by the logic of political survival. Mr. McGreevey remembers well the wrath New Jersey voters unleashed on their last Democratic governor, Jim Florio, for pushing a $2.8 billion tax increase through the State Legislature more than a decade ago.
So when the treasurer's office found itself facing a projected budget gap of more than $4 billion, the administration adopted an a la carte strategy of cuts, tax increases and higher fees, wagering that the public might be less offended by a series of levies than by one or two big ones.
"The main principle was, we didn't want a sales or income tax increase," said Eric Shuffler, a McGreevey aide and the key negotiator in the budget talks. "The second rule was, we didn't want to do anything that would start a rebellion."
While that strategy is a dramatic departure from the Florio years, many other states now struggling with fiscal problems have employed a similar approach. Arturo Perez, an analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures, said that 40 states were facing significant budget problems this year, and that only 3 had thus far instituted broad-based tax increases.
Governor McGreevey said he was particularly gratified that New Jersey had also avoided resorting to some of the drastic cuts being enacted elsewhere, like aid to public schools, early release for nonviolent prison inmates or removing legal immigrants from the Medicaid rolls.
"This is a responsible budget," he said this week. New Jersey Republicans, who pressured Mr. McGreevey to reduce his proposed tax increases to $600 million from $800 million, are quick to disagree. They accuse Mr. McGreevey of cleverly overstating the budget problems so he could sell tax increases to the public while increasing spending. This year's budget includes $700 million more in outlays than last year's.
"One thing is said and just the opposite is done," said State Senator Joseph Malone, a Republican from Burlington. "The residents of the state should not be subjected to this form of torture. Abbott and Costello could not have written a script for the past two weeks."
With the entire State Legislature up for re-election this year, Republicans are also blasting the governor and fellow Democrats for New Jersey's onerous property taxes. The new budget cut the NJ Saver property tax rebate to $250 from $500, and Mr. McGreevey has frozen aid to municipalities for two straight years, forcing many towns and cities to raise their rates.
But Democrats are hoping that the public will be willing to place the blame on the weak economy so long as any new taxes are imposed craftily. McGreevey administration officials tried to foist the most visible taxes on groups unlikely to generate much sympathy: smokers, casino operators and billboard owners. They also tried to avoid taxing items that could easily be transformed into incendiary political symbols the way Mr. Florio's proposed tax on household paper products inspired anti-tax advocates to print the governor's likeness on rolls of toilet tissue.
Administration officials discussed taxing cable television, but were worried that Republicans might respond with ads accusing them of "taxing my 'Sopranos,' " an administration official said, so the idea was dropped. A tax on dog kennels was proposed and ultimately scrapped for fear that it might stoke the fiery passions of pet owners.
The administration did fight for one tax that would affect the vast majority of New Jerseyans: a surcharge on every monthly telephone bill in the state, which would have generated $116 million. But that provision was dropped during the final day of bargaining with Republicans.
"It's hard to imagine anyone who gets hit by more than two of those fees," Mr. Shuffler said.
But others suspect that the aggregate total of taxes will ultimately anger voters.
"All taxes are income taxes, because they come out of someone's income," said Murray Sabrin, an anti-tax advocate who has run for office as both a Libertarian and Republican. "What Governor McGreevey did was impose nuisance taxes, and people will notice."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Slip After Disappointing Report on Unemployment

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Stocks fell modestly yesterday after the government reported that the unemployment rate jumped in June and payroll jobs declined. But the three major gauges still finished the week higher, after closing out a very strong second quarter on Monday.
 While stocks fell, Treasury yields moved sharply higher. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note rose to 3.66 percent, from 3.53 percent on Wednesday. Although the yield is up from a more than four-decade low of 3.11 percent just three weeks ago, it is still low historically and only back up to where it was in early May. 
 One reason for these two performances is that the jobs data, combined with a later report that showed that the service sector had expanded for the third consecutive month, left investors with the same ambiguous outlook for the economy that they have had for a while: While forecasters and many Federal Reserve officials say they expect the economy to pick up, there is still no concrete evidence in the data that an upswing has begun.
"We expect better performance in the second half of 2003, but I wouldn't bet the ranch on it," said Joseph Liro, an economist and market analyst at Stone & McCarthy Research.
Still, Mr. Liro said the bond market sell-off could be a positive sign. "This is a reflection in the bond market that the economy is going to be better in the second half and inflation is not going to be a problem," he said. "I am taking that as good news."
Trading was moderate in a shortened session that ended at 1 p.m. ahead of the Independence Day weekend. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 72.63 points, or 0.8 percent, to 9,070.21, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 8.05 points, or 0.8 percent, to 985.70. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 15.27 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,663.46.
For the week, the Dow was up 0.9 percent and the S.& P. 500 climbed 1 percent. It was the eighth positive week for these two market gauges in the last 10. The Nasdaq climbed 2.4 percent and was up for the seventh week in the last 10.
Among the stocks leading the market lower yesterday were 3M, I.B.M., Wal-Mart Stores, Pfizer, Citigroup, Cisco Systems, Microsoft and Intel. AT&T fell after Standard & Poor's reduced its credit rating on Wednesday to BBB, from BBB+. The BBB rating is two notches above noninvestment grade, or junk bond, status.
While stocks were up for the week and the S.& P. 500 had its best quarter in the three months ending June 30 since the fourth quarter of 1998, the broader market has had trouble making headway since June 17, when the Dow and the S.& P. 500 reached their recent highs. The Nasdaq, which is loaded with the technology stocks that have helped lead the market rebound that began on March 11, reached a 2003 high on Wednesday of 1,678,73.
Mr. Liro said he thought this lack of clarity about the economy could lead to a sell-off in the stock market in the third quarter. He noted that the third quarter has been bad for stocks recently, with the Dow falling in four of the last five third quarters.
The Labor Department reported yesterday that the unemployment rate rose in June to 6.4 percent, a nine-year high, from 6.1 percent in May, while nonfarm payroll jobs declined by 30,000. Both moves exceeded market expectations.
On the service economy, the Institute for Supply Management's index for nonmanufacturing companies rose to 60.6 in June, from 54.5 in May. A reading above 50 means the sector is growing.
In the bond market, where trading also ended early, the price of the 10-year note fell 31/32, to a price of 99 25/32. 
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 25/32, to 110 20/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.69 percent from 4.58 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: More Taxes, A Few Cuts, But Little Pain In New Budgets 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 3 

 BODY:
Six months ago, political leaders around the New York City region were sounding alarms. They warned that state and local governments were facing the worst fiscal crisis since the 1930's and predicted dire budget cuts that in the eyes of many legislators would cripple services.
 In the end, though, New York State, New York City and New Jersey all managed to put together budgets that avoided the deepest cuts, and they paid for them with borrowing or tax increases that have yet to arouse a public outcry. 
 In short, political leaders in all three places made the political calculation that it was better to raise taxes than to hack away at government spending.
In Connecticut, meanwhile, a fierce battle is being fought over the same issue, as the Republican governor remains at loggerheads with a Democratic legislature over whether to raise taxes or cut spending to close a $1 billion shortfall. Gov. John G. Rowland has vowed not to sign any budget that includes more than $250 million in new taxes. 
Across the country, in most of the states whose fiscal years were winding down in recent days, legislators have wrestled with the effect of three years of declining revenues. The taxes-versus-cuts debate is continuing in California, where Gov. Gray Davis and the Legislature are locked in a battle over how to resolve a $38 billion shortfall. Governors in 19 states proposed to shrink spending in real terms for the first time in two decades, making cuts in every area: kindergarten, medical services, colleges, police, prisons and aid to local governments, according to a report by the National Association of State Budget Officers.
The relative calm afterthe budget battles in New York and New Jersey has more to do with perception than reality, budget analysts said. Both states are still in trouble, because they rely heavily on one-time borrowing to put off spending cuts -- $4.2 billion in New York, and $1.6 billion in New Jersey. That means they will face large deficits next year, of about $6 billion in New York and about $2 billion in New Jersey, the analysts said. 
Both states also enacted large tax increases just to support a small increase in the current level of spending, a risky way to go about solving a budget shortfall because it does nothing to rein in future spending growth. Health care and education costs, usually the biggest expenses, tend to rise each year far above the rate of inflation because of labor agreements and laws requiring services for the poor, budget experts said.
In New York City, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the City Council also decided to raise income, sales and property taxes rather than to cut too deeply into city services, as Mr. Bloomberg had threatened to do in April. Unlike the state, the city has not relied on borrowing, partly because state law forbids it. 
Yet the city still faces a $2 billion gap next year, and raising taxes will be harder to sell to voters the next time around. Mayor Bloomberg's popularity has already taken a beating for the steep tax increases he has approved over the last six months.
"What neither the state nor the city did was bring spending into line with fiscal reality," said Diana Fortuna, an analyst with the Citizens Budget Commission.
Budget experts said lawmakers' and executives' reluctance to tackle the hard job of reducing spending permanently has only put off the day of reckoning. Many taxpayers may feel a sense of temporary relief, but it is only a matter of time before the public realizes that there are more deficits looming despite the recent tax increases, the experts said.
"It's the eye-of-the-storm effect," said Edmund J. McMahon, a conservative analyst with the Manhattan Institute.
One reason for the pervasive sense that the crisis has passed is the annual game of expectations played in the capitals and City Hall. Gov. George E. Pataki came out in January with a budget that threatened to cut school aid by $1.4 billion and Medicaid by $1 billion, prompting hospital workers' and teachers' unions to protest. Mayor Bloomberg presented a plan in April that would have eliminated after-school programs, shuttered swimming pools and cut the police force to its lowest level in 10 years.
In New Jersey, Gov. James E. McGreevey proposed a plan in February that eliminated financing for the arts, cut money for higher education and reduced health insurance for the poor.
The psychological effect on taxpayers was to make them more willing to accept tax increases, even though spending on those services was being held flat or reduced slightly in most cases.
"This is an expectations game," said Alan G. Hevesi, the New York State comptroller, who has criticized the state's budget because it relies heavily on borrowing. He added, "The bottom line is a huge portion of the problem has been postponed until next year."
Some New Jersey lawmakers, like Assemblyman Joseph Malone, a Republican from Burlington, accused the Democratic governor and legislators of manipulating public opinion. "One thing is said and just the opposite is done," Mr. Malone said. "The residents of the state should not be subjected to this form of torture." 
In New York State, legislative leaders won a bitter fight over taxes with Mr. Pataki, a third-term Republican who swore that he would not raise income taxes. Legislative leaders were so certain that voters would prefer higher income and sales taxes to higher property taxes caused by a drop in state aid that they overrode the governor's veto of their $92.3 billion budget.
The Legislature's leaders -- Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, and Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader -- also persuaded Mayor Bloomberg to adopt similar tax increases for city residents. Those taxes, along with the restoration of $800 million in school aid and other programs Mr. Pataki had wanted to eliminate, made it possible for the city to escape the severe cuts Mr. Bloomberg outlined in April.
Another reason the New York State and New York City budgets have not rankled many legislators, or, according to public polls, their constituents, is that the tax increases were intended to hit a small number of high-income New Yorkers harder than everyone else. The income tax increase for people making more than $100,000 affected only about 5 percent of residents. The sales tax increase, affecting everyone, was relatively small.
In New Jersey, Mr. McGreevey also tried to limit the number of people affected by new taxes. He fought for and won legislative approval for higher taxes on cigarettes, real estate transactions and casinos, but backed away from raising broad-based taxes on sales or income.
Directing tax increases at a few thin slices of the public is smart politics, but it does not address the underlying problem, which is the inexorable growth in spending, some budget analysts said.
Scott Pattison, the executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said New York and New Jersey were not the only states resorting to borrowing and one-time revenues to weather the storm. Many large states still have not adjusted to the truth: the boom in tax revenues of the 1990's has ended. "These are elected officials; they just don't want to have any pain," Mr. Pattison said.
The rise in spending means New York State will face a $6 billion deficit next year, while New York City and New Jersey will each have to fill a shortfall of about $2 billion, budget officials said. 
"These numbers are still very large gaps," said Robert A. Kurtter, a senior bond analyst with Moody's Investors Service.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
A Desert's Unexpected Bloom

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: NISHINOMIYA, Japan, July 3 

 BODY:
It was 3:30 on a cloudless afternoon and the members of the Tigers New Era Fan Club were already assembled in the far corner of the right-field bleachers. The ragtag group of two dozen or so factory workers, shopkeepers and hangers-on were there to cheer the Hanshin Tigers, working their way through the team's fight songs even though game time was more than two hours away.
 "We're all crazy for the Tigers," said Yoshio Morita, a 55-year-old businessman draped in a black-and-yellow Tigers happi coat. Between slugs of beer and choruses of "The Wind of Mount Rokko," the Tigers' anthem, he ran through his game-day routine, which includes driving two hours from neighboring Shiga Prefecture to get to the stadium by 9 a.m. and line up for a ticket. 
 Morita's devotion, a tale repeated by many of the 53,000 fans packed into Koshien Stadium, is typical of the baseball fever in Nishinomiya, a city of 400,000 in the Osaka metropolitan area, Japan's second largest. The Tigers, Japan's oldest baseball franchise and long one of its worst, are on a march toward only their second championship since 1950, when the two-league system was started. Their sudden success this year has turned this recession-bit region into something bordering on a permanent party. 
 To understand the excitement, imagine what might happen if the Boston Red Sox or Chicago Cubs ever exorcised their demons and won the World Series. In fact, the baseball fates seem to be working on something of a parallel universe, with the Red Sox and the Cubs remaining stubbornly competitive at the halfway point of the Major League Baseball season.
 Unlike the Red Sox, who last won the World Series in 1918, or the Cubs, who last won in 1908, the Tigers last won the Japan Series just 18 years ago. But their record of ineptitude has left scars on their fans: the Tigers have finished in the bottom half of the six-team Central League 15 times since.
 As a result, Tigers fans, like those of the Red Sox and the Cubs, talk of a mystical burden their team must overcome. In Hanshin's case, the burden is known as the Curse of Colonel Sanders. After the team won its lone championship in 1985, fans assembled at the Dotonbori Bridge in Osaka's flashy entertainment district. One by one, those who resembled Tigers players jumped into the river to raucous cheers. But since no one looked like Randy Bass, the team's star slugger, fans stole a statue of Colonel Sanders from a nearby Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet and tossed it in.
 Legend has it that the Tigers will not win a championship until the colonel is found. Efforts to dredge the river and recover the statue have proved fruitless.
 This season, Tigers fans seem to be putting their fatalism behind them, and for good reason. The Tigers have become the fastest team to reach 50 victories, and they are already 30 games above .500, the first time they have reached that mark in a half-century. Their batters are hitting nearly .300 and their pitchers are the league's stingiest.
 Crucially, the Tokyo Yomiuri Giants, the league's pre-eminent team, have stumbled this season with their longtime star, Hideki Matsui, now playing for the Yankees. Coincidentally, the Tigers have benefited from the return of a former Yankee, pitcher Hideki Irabu, who returned from North America after six seasons and has already won 10 games. Another Major League Baseball refugee, Jeff Williams, a former Dodger, is the league's top closer.
 "We have a big chance to win it all this year," said Irabu, who also has the league's lowest earned run average. "It's right in front of our eyes."
 The Tigers have perhaps the best manager in Japanese baseball, Senichi Hoshino. Pugnacious and crafty, he leads much the way Earl Weaver did in Baltimore in the 1960's and 1970's, relying on strong pitching, scrappy hitting and aggressive base running. Like Weaver, he kicks dirt on umpires and screams at his players, a brand of leadership that the fans embrace.
 The passion surrounding the Tigers this year is about much more than victories. Like the Red Sox and the Cubs, the Tigers suffer from a permanent identity crisis. Since World War II, Osaka has been in the shadow of Tokyo, where the nation's government, media and business elite are centered. Home to many of the country's leading manufacturers, the Osaka region now has one of Japan's highest unemployment rates as companies move their factories to China.
 Because of Osaka's blue-collar roots and hard knocks, any victory over a Tokyo team and its white-collar fans is particularly satisfying. 
 "Basically, Hanshin fans are against centralization, against power and against money, all the things that the Giants represent," said Koichi Kunisada, an Osaka-based economist who embroiders the names of his favorite Tigers players in gold silk on the inside of his suit jackets.
While jaded fans in Tokyo have come to expect winners, people in Osaka cannot hide their fanaticism. On a major thoroughfare in the Amagasaki district, shopkeepers unfurled a banner that included the team's magic number on it even though it was still June and the Tigers needed 79 more victories or losses by their opponents to clinch the pennant. (The magic number fell to 54 on July 2.)
 "Some people might say we are brash, but we're simply having a good time," said Kenichiro Yoshioka, the 43-year-old camera shop owner who put up the sign.
 Politicians are also getting into the act. The governor of Osaka Prefecture, Fusae Ota, wants to clean up one of the city's dirtiest rivers, one that fans jump into to celebrate hometown victories. The government's economics minister, Heizo Takenaka, said a Tigers pennant run would change Japan's economic landscape just as it did in 1985, the last time the Tigers went all the way.
 The Tigers' success is already giving the ailing economy a lift. Tickets are suddenly scarce, even when the Tigers are on the road. The broadcast of a Tigers-Giants match-up earlier this season drew a record-high 30.2 percent share, twice the typical audience for a baseball game.
 Shops are also doing a brisk business in anything emblazoned with the Tigers logo, even stores in enemy territory. At the Keio Department Store above Tokyo's Shinjuku Station, the Hanshin Tigers shop sold 696 million yen ($5.8 million) worth of towels, megaphones and cellphone straps in June, five times the level in May. Shares in Hanshin Department Store Ltd., whose parent company owns the Tigers, have risen nearly 40 percent since the season began.
 In all, a Tigers championship could generate 113.3 billion yen ($945 million) in extra spending, according to the Japan Research Institute.
 The party, though, would come to an end if the Tigers reverted to their old ways and performed a late-season swoon. The biggest hurdle is shino roodo, or the Road Trip of Death that the Tigers endure every year. For three weeks in August, their crumbling, ivy-covered stadium here holds the national high school baseball tournament. Few Tiger squads have fared well over this stretch.
 Back in right field, Morita and his fellow merrymakers shrugged off such concerns. The Tigers, they say, are on destiny's road. 
 As the Tigers completed their victory against the Chunichi Dragons, the fans released thousands of whistling balloons in celebration. The customary "hero interview" was conducted near the dugout and broadcast over the stadium loudspeakers. Once finished, outfielder Shinjiro Hiyama received another round of cheers for hitting for the cycle in the game. A half-hour after the final out, the fans finally filed out, many hoarse from all the screaming.
 Yet Morita, who faced a numbing ride home through traffic, seemed energized. He taped the television broadcast of the game and planned to watch it again. 
 "I was so busy cheering," he said, "I didn't even see all those home runs."

HEADLINE: Reconciliation, Not Just Reconstruction 

BYLINE:  By Stuart E. Eizenstat; Stuart E. Eizenstat, deputy Treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001, is author of "Imperfect Justice: Looted Assets, Slave Labor and the Unfinished Business of World War II."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Despite efforts by American and British forces to restore order, Iraq remains perilous. Since President Bush declared an end to major combat on May 1, at least 21 American soldiers have been killed, while six British soldiers died in an ambush last week in southern Iraq.
 Bringing the rule of law to Iraq is essential, as is the political and economic reconstruction of the country. Yet these tasks may fail unless the Bush administration also provides justice for Iraqi victims of Saddam Hussein's terror. Healing these wounds will not only lay the groundwork for a stable nation, but will also reinforce the United States commitment to helping the Iraqi people. 
 Many of those who were victimized -- the Kurds in the north, so-called marsh Arabs in the south, Shiite opponents of the Baath Party regime -- represent the major political and religious factions in Iraq. If their grievances are not addressed, Iraqi society will bear permanent scars and endure continuing frustrations, leading to growing resentment and cycles of retribution. There are several ways to address the grievances of Saddam Hussein's victims and promote reconciliation.
The first is to establish a compensation fund for victims of torture, assassination or other human-rights abuses, or their families. A panel with both Iraqi and international representation would review claims and distribute funds. A small percentage of the revenue from Iraqi oil sales could be allocated for this purpose; 5 percent of such revenue already goes into a United Nations fund for victims of the Persian Gulf war.
Foundations recently created in Berlin, Vienna and Paris that have provided payments to more than a million victims of the Nazi era could serve as a model. As a condition to receiving any money, each Iraqi claimant should be required to sign a statement pledging support for a democratic Iraq and waiving claims against any interim or permanent Iraqi authority. A similar requirement was instituted for victims of Nazi crimes who received restitution.
The administration should also convene a property commission in Iraq to resolve the claims of the tens of thousands of Iraqis who were driven from their homes during the Saddam Hussein era. The restoration of propertyrights will be an important element in the establishment of stability and the rule of law in Iraq, particularly in northern Iraq, where serious disputes have already broken out. This commission should have the authority to resolve competing claims and award legal title, or compensation in lieu of property when return is infeasible or undesired by the claimant. The administration should work with the United Nations to form this commission.
With about one million internally displaced people in Iraq, the number of potential property claims may seem daunting. But there is a precedent. The Commission on Real Property created in Sarajevo after the war in Bosnia has so far been able to decide more than 250,000 property claims. Armed with legally binding decisions, large numbers of the dispossessed in the Balkans have been able to return home and resume their lives. A similar process in Iraq could avoid lingering bitterness.
A historical commission, consisting entirely of Iraqis, should also be established to document for future generations the ways in which the Baath Party committed such vast human-rights abuses. The South Africa Truth and Reconciliation Commission, created shortly after the end of the apartheid era, provides a model. By encouraging victims of apartheid to tell their stories, it gave them the opportunity to air their grievances and it educated the public -- white and black. It was one reason that a blood bath of retribution against the apartheid-era leaders was avoided.
Last, a war crimes tribunal should be created -- within Iraq, to make evidence-gathering easier -- with United States leadership and United Nations blessing, to bring to justice the most senior members of the Baath Party regime. As the Nuremberg trials did for postwar Germany, such trials would provide legitimacy for postwar Iraq. As in South Africa, those who confess to their crimes could be granted amnesty.
As has become increasingly clear in the two months since the official end of hostilities, the United States faces a difficult task in Iraq. Establishing instruments for justice may not be as dramatic as patrolling the streets of Baghdad, but it is equally important. Only through these institutions can the administration translate its ambitious goal of a stable, tolerant, democratic Iraq into reality.

HEADLINE: Bush Sends Baker to Georgia for Talks 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3 

 BODY:
President Bush has dispatched former Secretary of State James A. Baker III to the former Soviet republic of Georgia this week to discuss political and economic issues, the White House said today. 
 While in Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, on Friday and Saturday, Mr. 
Baker will meet President Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who was the Soviet foreign minister when Mr. Baker was secretary of state in the administration of the elder President Bush. 
 Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said Mr. Baker would be traveling on behalf of the president to discuss with Mr. Shevardnadze "ways to advance political and economic reform in Georgia through free and fair parliamentary elections this fall." They will also discuss American-Georgian cooperation on counterterrorism and other security matters.
"The Baker mission reflects the United States' readiness to work with all Georgian citizens who are committed to advancing reform and fighting corruption in pursuit of a democratic, prosperous and stable Georgia," Mr. Fleischer said.
According to a June 16 report by the Russian news agency Interfax, Mr. Shevardnadze has said it will be impossible to make fundamental constitutional changes before elections on Nov. 2. The changes would involve establishing a two-house Parliament and a cabinet of ministers, reduced powers for the Parliament's lower house, and the country's territorial division, Interfax said.

HEADLINE: Bush Insists Liberian President Go Before Troops Come In 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER and ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3 

 BODY:
President Bush, enmeshed in an internal struggle in his administration over whether and how to send American peacekeeping troops to Liberia, strongly implied today that no soldiers would bedeployed until the Liberian president, Charles Taylor, steps down.
 "I recognize the United States has got a -- has had a, you know, unique history with Liberia," Mr. Bush said in an interview at the White House with reporters from African countries. 
 And, therefore, it's created a certain sense of expectations. But I also want to make sure that there are certain expectations met, as well. And one expectation is Mr. Taylor has got to leave." 
Later in the day, Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security adviser, told reporters that there were "sensitive discussions" with Mr. Taylor. She refused to provide details other than to say that Mr. Taylor was someone "who has murdered and looted and really put the country in extremis."
Mr. Bush, in his interview with the African reporters, made an unusual appeal for time in making a decision that will have repercussions on military strategy as well as on domestic politics.
He said that once his strategy was decided, "I will let people know whether or not I'm airborne." But until then, "I'm just gathering enough information to be rational in what we do."
Mr. Bush spoke as American military officials were meeting in Ghana with representatives from the Economic Community of West African States, a regional group of 16 nations, to discuss the makeup of a possible peacekeeping force. The group was said to be reviewing how American troops could be deployed alongside regional troops. A senior administration official said it was likely that American forces would be sent, but that Mr. Bush might not decide until Monday when he leaves for a trip to Africa.
The delay in the president's decision reflects the complex practical problems of deploying troops as well as divisions between the State Department and the Pentagon. State Department officials fear that uncontrolled violence in Liberia will undercut Mr. Bush's message of commitment to Africa on his five-day trip to the continent. But Pentagon officials do not want American troops to become entangled in a civil war when the military is already stretched thin because of large deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the same time, Mr. Bush has come under increasing political pressure at home to deploy troops to a country that was founded by freed American slaves and has longtime ties to the United States. On Wednesday, the leading Africa expert in the Congressional Black Caucus, Representative Donald M. Payne, Democrat of New Jersey, urged the administration not to delay.
"We do not want the blood of Liberians on our hands and cannot justify waiting another day," Mr. Payne said in a letter to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.
The United Nations, France, Britain and countries in West Africa have also urged Mr. Bush to intervene. But Mr. Bush, who denounced "nation building" in his 2000 presidential campaign, has long been skeptical of using American forces for peacekeeping operations. 
A million refugees have flooded into Liberia's capital, Monrovia, as the country has been engulfed by fighting in recent weeks between rebels and militias loyal to Mr. Taylor. He has been indicted on charges of war crimes by a court created jointly by Sierra Leone and the United Nations. Mr. Taylor has said he will go, but he has not said when.
Military officials in Washington and in Germany, who are readying force options for Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Mr. Bush, said preparations for Liberia continued today, but that no troops had been alerted for possible action. Officials said the options included sending 500 to 2,000 troops, but details like the precise size, makeup and command structure were all undecided.
"We're monitoring the situation and doing prudent planning," said Cmdr. James Graybeal, a spokesman for the United States European Command, which has responsibility for military operations in most of Africa.
Despite wariness at the Pentagon of deploying forces to a new mission when 146,000 American soldiers are in Iraq and 10,000 are in Afghanistan, there is a growing, if still somewhat tentative, support to send American peacekeepers for a short time.
Senator John W. Warner, a Virginia Republican who heads the Armed Services Committee, offered his support for the mission. "At this point in time, our forces could accept that level of deployment," he said.
Africa specialists agreed that a Liberian mission would not unduly strain the military and that it would help burnish America's image on the continent and in the world, especially after its bruising diplomatic struggle with some European countries over Iraq.
"It's a way of showing we just don't throw our weight around to be tough, that we can also protect the little guy," said Herman J. Cohen, who was assistant secretary of state for Africa affairs in the first Bush administration. "It's an image builder if he does it, and the risks are low."
Chester A. Crocker, who was the assistant secretary of state for African affairs in the Reagan administration, said that the United States would not have to send a large force for it to be effective and that American involvement would lead other countries to take part. Mr. Crocker also said it was essential for Mr. Taylor to get out of the country as quickly as possible.
"You've got to get him someplace unless you want to have him chopped up in small pieces in downtown Monrovia," Mr. Crocker said.

HEADLINE: Plastic Is Back: Relearning Recycling's Dance 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
New York City may be recycling plastic again, but the ever-changing rules of disposal have left many residents befuddled. 
 Since Tuesday, when the city re-imposed the recycling of plastic, residents have been deluging City Council members with questions about the new regulations. Can they recycle old strawberry containers? What about blue glass? Is the city still accepting recycled cardboard? When are the trucks coming? 
 The city dropped plastic and glass from its recycling program last year to save money in the face of huge deficits. But the promised $40 million savings never materialized, as costs of traditional waste disposal increased and more economical ways to recycle emerged. 
Now, the city has returned plastic to its list of recyclable materials, and will phase glass back into the program in April of next year.
"The recycling about-face is a little like the decision to abandon new Coke and return to Classic Coke," said Mark Izeman, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which supports recycling. "We spent years teaching New Yorkers how to recycle, then we told New Yorkers to forget everything they know and put glass and plastic into the trash, and we're now telling New Yorkers to go back to the original rules. It's going to take several months for New Yorkers to relearn the dance steps."
So plastic is back, but not all of it -- only bottles and jugs. All those little yogurt containers still go in the trash. All glass, too. It's garbage until next April, when it becomes recyclable. Metal, plastic bottles and jugs and drink boxes go into the blue recycling bins, paper and cardboard into the green bins.
Figuring out collection times is equally complex. The city plans to collect recyclable items every other week, but that schedule does not go into effect until August. Until then, trucks will be making their rounds every week. Regular trash collection will not be affected by plastic recycling services. 
City Councilman Michael E. McMahon, chairman of the Sanitation Committee, said that New Yorkers are still baffled by the details of the rules. While some want to know whether they can recycle glass (no) or orange juice containers (yes), most are concerned about being fined if they try to recycle the wrong materials at the wrong time.
"There's just a lot of general confusion," Mr. McMahon said. "I still don't know which week I should be putting out my curbside recycling. If I put it out on the wrong week, technically, I could get a citation."
Mr. McMahon said he planned to ask the Department of Sanitation to suspend fines on recycling violations for the next six months, as New Yorkers adjust to the new rules. 
Although the Sanitation Department is not currently issuing fines for plastic recycling, the department will continue to cite property owners for other violations, like throwing metal and paper into the garbage, said Kathy Dawkins, a spokeswoman for the department. The department has not decided when it will begin fining New Yorkers for violating plastic recycling rules. 
David Higby, solid waste project director for the group Environmental Advocates, said the city had not done enough to educate New Yorkers. Without education, the new rules will not be effective, he said.
The Sanitation Department said it planned to explain the new rules by putting out newspaper advertisements and sending fliers and brochures to New Yorkers.
The new rules are still a bit perplexing to Charley Beal, 45, a West Village resident who calls himself an "over-recycler." Mr. Beal is an old hand at sorting out paper and metal, but when it comes to recycling plastic, he said he stares hard at the triangle and number inscribed on the bottom of his strawberry cartons and Chinese soup cups, then just throws everything into the recycling bag. "I've erred toward recycling," Mr. Beal said. "When I'm in doubt, I put it in recycling."
But at 78th Street and Columbus Avenue, tenants are erring on the side of garbage, said Lou Martarano, 48, a resident who is on his building's condominium board. Mr. Martarano said he and other residents were still confused about the changing procedures, and were continuing to dump plastics down the trash chute.
A visit to a half-dozen apartment buildings in Morningside Heights shows that superintendents and apartment porters have an equally shaky understanding of the regulations. "We haven't gotten any notice from sanitation -- nothing," said a maintenance worker at 730 Columbus Avenue. "When will glass be recycled? I don't know. Management will tell us."
On the ground floor of 336 Central Park West, the building's superintendent, Vincent E. Gardiner, seemed more confident. 
Mr. Gardiner pointed to a printout from the Department of Sanitation's Web site he had posted near the elevator. Mr. Gardiner visited the site just Monday, but somehow the rules he found were from July 2002.
"I've read about it," Mr. Gardiner said. "It's very clear. We're recycling aluminum cans and metal. Cardboard is regular garbage. Plastics and bottles aren't being recycled, and glass is."
He was one for four.

HEADLINE: Democrats See Opening For Attack on Economy 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3 

 BODY:
The jump in the unemployment rate gave Democrats a new opening today to attack President Bush's management of the economy and question the effectiveness of his signature tax cuts.
 In strikingly similar terms, many of the Democratic presidential candidates attacked Mr. Bush's policies as misdirected and unfair. The continuing loss of jobs from the economy allowed them to call into question Mr. Bush's vow that his latest tax cut, the third in three years, would create a million new jobs. 
 "This president has a failed economic policy on his hands, and he has no inclination to be flexible and change it," Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, one of the nine Democratic presidential candidates, said in an interview. "He keeps doing more of the same thing he's been doing, which is more tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. It's a repeat of the Reagan program times three. It didn't work then, and it isn't working now."
White House officials said Mr. Bush was concerned about the rise in unemployment, and they said the economy's sluggishness showed he had been correct when he pushed through a $350 billion tax cut this spring, as he had been in signing the two previous tax reductions.
"The tax cuts have helped create jobs and to promote growth in the economy," Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said.
Mr. Bush continues to be in an enviable political position, with high overall approval ratings, a loyal base and a huge fund-raising advantage. But for the first time, Democrats said, Mr. Bush is showing signs of vulnerability on both the economy and on his conduct of foreign policy. Some Democrats say the continued loss of American lives in Iraq, the failure to find any chemical or biological weapons and the general postwar chaos there have started to take some of the shine off the president's record as commander in chief.
At the same time, the economy is continuing to defy predictions that it will be turned around by the tax cuts and the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate reductions. The economy has shed nearly 2.5 million jobs since Mr. Bush took office. The growth in disposable income has been weak.
"The gap between the president's need to talk about positive trends in the economy and people's lack of income or job opportunity is explosive," said Stan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster.
A poll last month by Mr. Greenberg's firm found that Mr. Bush had a 61 percent approval rating. But 53 percent of the voters polled said the country should go in a different direction on the economy. And when offered two statements, one reflecting the Democratic criticism of Mr. Bush's tax cuts and the other reflecting the White House's argument in favor of them, the voters favored the Democratic position 56 percent to 41 percent.
A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll released today found that 56 percent of Americans did not think the latest round of tax cuts would help their families' finances.
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, another of the Democratic candidates, said: "We'll continue to bang away. This will clarify as we move toward the primaries, and more important, when we choose a nominee. Then there will be a face-to-face confrontation with a president who will have to defend a record of losing millions of jobs."
The White House has already begun counterpunching on the economy, focusing on promises by the Democratic candidates to roll back Mr. Bush's tax cuts, a step his supporters say would be a huge tax increase that would stop the economy's recovery in its tracks.
Moreover, said David Winston, a Republican pollster, voters are not taking out their economic anxieties on Mr. Bush.
"This is a different electorate since Sept. 11," Mr. Winston said. "They're not looking to assess blame. They're looking for what you've done to correct the problem."
But Mr. Winston added that voters would be looking for improvements in the jobs situation by next summer. "In a major way, it's how Americans judge the economy," he said.
Mr. Bush's political fate may depend on whether the economy and the presidential campaign follow the pattern of the early 1980's or the early 1990's.
In Ronald Reagan's first two and a half years as president, the unemployment rate surged from 7.5 percent to as high as 10.8 percent and then declined steadily, to 7.2 percent, by the time he faced the voters in 1984. He won a landslide re-election victory.
In the first two and a half years of the first Bush administration, the unemployment rate jumped to 6.9 percent from 5.4 percent. But the rise in joblessness continued, peaking at 7.8 percent in June 1992, after the Democrats had settled on Bill Clinton as their nominee. Mr. Clinton attacked the first President Bush on the economy and beat him in November.
The current President Bush is betting that his experience will be more like Mr. Reagan's than his father's. The Labor Department's report today that unemployment in June rose to 6.4 percent, from 6.1 percent in May, put joblessness at its highest level since April 1994 and well above the 4.1 percent level when Mr. Bush was sworn in two and a half years ago.
But administration officials, Republican strategists and many economists say they are confident the economy will turn around, helped along by the tax cuts, and that unemployment will begin declining by next summer, when voters start to make up their minds.

HEADLINE: U.S. JOBLESS RATE INCREASES TO 6.4%, HIGHEST IN 9 YEARS 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
Once again failing to live up to politicians' hopes and economists' expectations, the labor market got tougher for job seekers last month. The unemployment rate rose to 6.4 percent, the highest in nine years, and the economy lost 30,000 jobs.
 The Labor Department also said that job losses were much more severe in May than originally reported -- 70,000 outside of farming, rather than 17,000. In all, the economy has lost 236,000 jobs this year. 
 The figures were a gloomy conclusion to the first half of the year, especially given that the economy had shown a few positive signs in June. Economists said that hints of revival in both the manufacturing and service sectors might have lured job hunters into the labor market too soon.
Job losses occurred across almost all industries, but blacks had considerably more trouble finding work than whites. Many more people started looking for work, but the number of employed blacks shrank, while the number of employed whites grew.
"It's hard to put a positive spin on this report," said Ethan S. Harris, chief economist of Lehman Brothers. Not only did overall unemployment rise, he said, but "the rest of the report didn't look good, either." The unemployment rate in May was 6.1 percent.
The data put the White House on the defensive. Democrats charged that the latest package of tax cuts, signed by President Bush on May 28, had contributed little to the strength of the economy. Page A18. 
"This is another indication that these ideologically focused, supply-side tax cuts are not the way to get at the fundamental problem," said Senator Jon Corzine, a Democrat from New Jersey. "It's increasingly becoming clear the policies aren't having the result that was, at least, their stated intention. These have been very inefficient uses of resources to try to stimulate growth or jobs."
Claire Buchan, a spokeswoman for the White House, responded by saying much of the boost that will come from the most recent fiscal package has yet to be felt. "The withholding tables went into effect the day before yesterday," she said. "The child-credit checks will go out at the end of the month. Businesses have access to the expensing and the depreciation, so there is a lot of stimulus."
The Labor Department's report includes data from separate surveys of households and business and government payrolls. According to seasonally adjusted numbers from the household survey, 611,000 people joined the labor force in June, yet the number of employed people rose by only 251,000.
Mr. Harris said part of that gap might reflect steep drops in payrolls from earlier this year -- one survey catching up to the other. But he said encouraging signs coming from the economy might have been premature, at least for people seeking work.
"One thing I wonder about," he said, "is whether all the happy talk about the economy encouraged people to start job hunting again, only to find that the labor market wasn't nearly as strong as what they were hoping for."
The latest figures on new applications for unemployment benefits also offered little encouragement. Last week, 430,000 people filed first-time claims, up from a revised figure of 409,000 in the previous week, the Labor Department reported yesterday. Many economists regard any figure above 400,000 as a sign of continued weakness in the labor market.
Richard D. Rippe, chief economist of Prudential Securities, said that strong growth in jobs might not occur until the end of the year, because of increases in worker productivity.
"We can produce more output without adding a lot of workers," he explained. "What you're going to have to get is strong and consistent output growth before you're going to add workers. I don't think, even if the optimists on the economy are correct, that you're going to get strong job growth in the near term."
Last month's slackness in the labor market encompassed virtually all industries, with few noteworthy exceptions. Manufacturing suffered heavy losses of 56,000 jobs, while some of the largest gains came among restaurants and bars, which added 20,000 positions.
Much bigger differences arose between the employment of blacks and whites. Though the survey of households is considered a rougher picture than the survey of businesses, which does not tabulate workers by race, the figures from June sent a stark message. For every four white workers added to the work force in June, the number of employed whites rose by three. But for every four black workers added to the labor force, the number with jobs slipped by three.
In all, whites in the labor force rose by 461,000, and the number of employed whites rose by 321,000. But among blacks, 99,000 entered the work force, and the number of employed blacks fell by 73,000.
In the aftermaths of previous economic downturns, job opportunities for blacks have opened up more slowly than for whites, said William E. Spriggs, the executive director of the National Urban League Institute for Opportunity and Equality. This time, he said, blacks who lose their jobs seem less likely to drop out of the labor force and more likely to look for new ones. As a result, the unemployment rate -- especially for black men -- is rising.
"Given the high share of African-Americans that are long-term unemployed," Mr. Spriggs said, "it's just going to take a long time to clear that out." The Labor Department said that for blacks, the unemployment rate in June was 11.8 percent, up from 10.8 percent in May. For whites, it rose to 5.5 percent in June from 5.4 percent a month earlier.
In June, more than half of the unemployed had been looking for work for more than 12 weeks -- the highest figure since May 1983. The average time spent unemployed reached almost 20 weeks, a level not seen since 1984.
Longer job searches by women, as well as by blacks, may account for the longer duration of unemployment, said Robert Shimer, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago. Women who lose jobs, he said, have also become less likely to leave the work force.
Mr. Harris, the Lehman Brothers economist, said that with so many people seeking jobs for so long, "it makes the threat of unemployment more dire" for anyone who loses a job now. Though the jobless rate typically lags behind other indicators of the economy's health, its upward creep, he said, could limit consumers' appetites for new spending.
Yesterday did bring one promising sign, however, as the Institute for Supply Management said that its index of activity in nonmanufacturing industries surged to 60.6 in June -- a reading indicative of growth -- from 54.5 in May. Mr. Rippe, of Prudential, asserted that the stage was set for better performance.
"We are getting through some of the past problems, and we have all of the policy dials that we have available set to growth," he said. "Everything we can do from a macro policy perspective is being done, and the question is, will it work? I think it will."

HEADLINE: Israelis Sense They've Won 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: TEL AVIV, July 3 

 BODY:
Israeli officials are expressing growing confidence that after 33 months they have defeated the Palestinian uprising, or intifada. 
 The Israeli chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Moshe Yaalon, told Israeli reporters on Wednesday that the developments this week might eventually be seen "as the end" of the conflict. "It is certainly a victory" for Israel, he was quoted as saying. 
 Some Israeli analysts criticized that conclusion as premature, if not hubristic. Yet for now, the American-brokered talks between the adversaries are being held on what appear to be largely Israeli terms. 
Negotiators who three years ago were discussing how to divide Jerusalem are debating how to return partial control of cities thatwere then under Palestinian authority.
"When the intifada began, the demand was, 'End the occupation, because the negotiations led to nothing,' " said Samir al-Mashharawi, a leader of the mainstream Palestinian faction, Fatah. "Now, Palestinian demands are to return back to the situation right before the intifada, and we are negotiating about this." 
He said that during one of his terms as an Israeli prisoner, he and other inmates demanded chairs and tables. In response, he said, the Israelis took their mattresses. The prisoners demanded them back. 
"After a month, they returned the mattresses, and we felt very happy we achieved something," he said. "Israeli diplomacy is based on this idea." 
How the Bush administration will press the peace plan forward is unclear. Violence could erupt again at any moment, and Palestinians have proven they can inflict tremendous pain -- including economic loss -- on Israel. It was no accident that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon chose an economic conference in Jerusalem today to declare, "For the first time since I entered the office of prime minister, there is a real possibility of an end to terror and the return to normal life." 
The Israelis appear to be filling in the details of a new American-backed peace plan, which Israel had resisted, to better suit its perceived interests. 
The Israeli Army will not withdraw from any more Palestinian cities until it sees that Palestinian security officers are acting against violent groups in Bethlehem and Gaza, where forces pulled back this week, a senior Israeli military official said today. 
Mahmoud Abbas, the appointed Palestinian prime minister, may be seen as an Israeli agent if he jails those who violate the truce. He hopes to gain strength as Israel makes concessions, and for now, the main Palestinian factions have voluntarily suspended attacks.
Israel says that it cannot risk being too indulgent and that Mr. Abbas must act against militants in the next two or three weeks or the peace process will freeze. 
Over the course of the conflict, Israel maximized its bargaining position, by taking back territory and encouraging settlers to set up new outposts to extend their grip on the West Bank. By contrast, the Palestinians, whose main demand is statehood, find their negotiating leverage much reduced. 
Mr. Mashharawi said they had shown that unless the Israeli occupation ended "there will be no peace and security in the region." And he warned of "another intifada" unless the Israelis moved swiftly to give Palestinians independence. 
Israelis say they have forced Palestinians to rethink violence. In March 2002, during a wave of Palestinian attacks, Mr. Sharon declared: "The aim is to increase the number of losses on the other side. Only after they've been battered will we be able to conduct talks." 
At the end of that March, Israel launched military offensives to seize Palestinian cities in the West Bank, control of which had been ceded under the Oslo peace process. 
Now, the senior military official said, "the Palestinians -- at least the ones who make decisions -- came to the conclusion that violence will not achieve their political goals." 
"I cannot say it is over," he cautioned, but he said that if the peace process succeeded, the Palestinian street might come to the same conclusion about violence "in a few weeks, and a few months." 
He said the American wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as new pressure from European and Arab states, had also helped change the Palestinian view on violence. 
If the Palestinians end their uprising, their remaining levers for negotiations may be time and demography. With the Palestinian population growing rapidly, Jews will become a minority in Israel and its occupied territories within a few years, Israeli experts say. That may put either Israel's Jewish character or its democracy at risk if Palestinians do not form a separate state. 
The new American-backed peace plan, known as the road map, calls for a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace and a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza in just three years. But Mr. Sharon has a longer time line in mind. The second of the peace plan's three phases -- a Palestinian state with "provisional" borders -- could ease Israel's demographic predicament without forcing it to confront the deepest disputes between the two sides, such as control of Jerusalem. 
The military official said that Israel would not begin substantive political negotiations over questions like Jerusalem until the Palestinians had fully broken up militant groups, confiscating their weapons, destroying their training centers, arresting their dangerous members and ending all "incitement" to violence. 
"They will have to get rid of all their terrorist capabilities," he said, acknowledging this could take years. 
The Bush administration does not appear to be pressing Israel to abide by the plan's schedule. A Western diplomat said the administration was more interested in commitments met than dates kept. 
As demanded under the plan, Israel has begun taking down some of the settlers' outposts, though new ones are going up. Little has been said about a freeze on further growth of established settlements called for in the plan's first phase.
To try to raise Mr. Abbas's popularity, Israel has begun releasing some of its more than 5,000 Palestinian prisoners, a step not in the plan. But as one senior Israeli official noted, there is a difference between releasing prisoners and conceding land: freed prisoners can always be arrested again.

HEADLINE: It's Stupidity, Stupid: You Can Look It Up 

BYLINE:  By EMILY EAKIN 

 BODY:
Along with the shag haircut and platform shoes, imbecility was hip in 1970's London. There, in 1976, a journalist named Stephen Pile founded the Not Terribly Good Club of Great Britain. The admission requirement was simple: incompetence. Meetings consisted of individual demonstrations driving home the point (displays of ineptitude at small talk, batik, art-making, etc.). At the club's kickoff event -- a meal at a hand-picked, third-rate restaurant -- Mr. Pile made the mistake of catching a soup tureen midfall. For this blatant display of adroitness, he was instantly demoted. 
 Mr. Pile went on to write "The Incomplete Book of Failures" about the club and the trait it sought to honor. A catalog of notable imbecility, including "the worst tourist" (a man who spent two days in New York believing he was in Rome), and the "slowest solution of a crossword" (34 years), the book also featured a membership application form for the Not Terribly Good Club. 
 As a result the club's numbers swelled. After the book appeared in 1979 (complete with a two-page erratum slip), the organization received 20,000 applications in two months. An incontestable success, the club was in violation of its commitment to failure, and under the terms of its own bylaws had to be disbanded. 
Today imbecility seems to be making a comeback, and the success of the "Dumb and Dumber" movies isn't the only evidence. Consider a 46-year-old lapsed academic named Matthijs van Boxsel who has been campaigning full time on imbecility's behalf in the Netherlands for the last five years. In 1999 he published "The Encyclopedia of Stupidity." The book was an unexpected success. Mr. van Boxsel became a sought-after figure on the local lecture circuit, and avid fans went on to found stupidity clubs in Amsterdam and Groningen, where, he says, members "give accounts of their own stupidity and try to outwit each other." 
Now American readers can see what the fuss is about: "The Encyclopedia of Stupidity" has been translated into English and has just been published by Reaktion Books. An illustrated hodgepodge of ruminations, anecdotes, aphorisms and esoterica, the book attacks its subject obliquely, spinning a theory of stupidity while cataloging its sightings. 
Foolish science? Mr. van Boxsel cites research on "the effect of side winds on arithmetic sums," "the specific gravity of a kiss" and "the surface of God." Or consider what he describes as the "explosive mix of stupidity and intelligence" on display in recent technological advances: filters for water purification that turn out to be breeding grounds for bacteria; suntan lotions that cause skin cancer and cushioned running shoes designed to protect the knees but at the expense of increasing stress on the hips. 
Mr. van Boxsel devotes two pages to darwinawards.com, a Web site honoring those "who improve our gene pool . . . by removing themselves from it." Recent laureates include a "bungee jumper who had gauged the length of his rope against the depth of the gorge, but forgot that the rope was made of elastic," and the leader of a Christian sect in Los Angeles who died after slipping on a bar of soap while trying to walk, Christ-like, on the water in his bathtub.
But Mr. van Boxsel is hardly mocking such lethal haplessness. "On the one hand, stupidity poses a daily threat to civilization," he writes. "On the other it constitutes the mystical foundation of our existence. For if man was not to fall victim to his own stupidity, he had to develop his intelligence." Or as he put it in a telephone interview from his home in Amsterdam, "Stupidity is the engine that drives our society." 
This is his most insistent point: stupidity is not the same as a lack of intelligence -- though precisely what it is is not always clear. "It's a quality all its own," he said. "It's unwitting self-destruction, the ability to act against one's best wishes with death as the most extreme consequence. And it's a typically human talent." 
On this last point, novelists seem to agree with him. Rabelais, Cervantes and Sterne were fascinated by imbeciles. And Flaubert devoted a sprawling novel to stupidity: "Bouvard and Pecuchet." Unfinished at his death, it featured two retired clerks who embark on a disastrous quest to assimilate the world's entire supply of knowledge. Constantly thwarted by their own poor judgment and ineptitude, they eventually concede defeat. "They acquire a faculty deserving of pity," Flaubert explained. "They recognize stupidity but can no longer tolerate it."
And in 1937, a year before the Anschluss, the Austrian writer Robert Musil gave a lecture in Vienna titled "On Stupidity," in which he described "higher stupidity" as a sophisticated and ubiquitous "disease of the mind that endangers life itself."
Nor is Mr. van Boxsel the only one theorizing on the subject today. In November the English publisher Gibson Square Books will publish "The Dictionary of Idiocy," by Stephen Bayley, a historian of design in London. Inspired by Flaubert's "Dictionary of Received Ideas," which was published as an appendix to "Bouvard and Pecuchet," Mr. Bayley said the book (whose title was changed to avoid confusion with Mr. van Boxsel's work) is a catalog of foolish opinions on topics ranging from beards and Italian food to accountants and abstract art. 
"You have to be terribly intelligent to be aware of what stupidity is," he explained by telephone from his home in London. 
But of stupidity's commentators past and present, Mr. van Boxsel stands out for his exalted view of the phenomenon. Stupidity, he suggests, is motivating. Without it, we would have little in the way of progress, success or civilization, which in his contrarian view is nothing more than "aseries of more or less abortive attempts to come to grips with the self-destructive folly found in all countries and at all times."
It's a theory that seems borne out by Mr. van Boxsel's career. He has managed to turn an inauspicious topic into a source of stable employment -- and modest renown. His second book on stupidity, "Morosofie," a compendium of 100 absurd theories by modern Dutch thinkers, appeared in 2000. His third, "The Topography of Stupidity," a catalog of European cities and provinces known for their stupidity, is nearing completion. And he says he plans four more: on stupidity and theology, stupidity and sex, stupidity and the economy, and stupidity and art. 
"Of the people like me, who are spending most of their life on stupidity," he said cheerfully, "I guess I'm the only one living off it. I'm the only one living off my own stupidity."

HEADLINE: Foreign Stocks Slightly Lower On U.S. Data 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks fell overseas yesterday, with Japan's main index retreating from a nine-month high, as weak employment in the United States stirred caution among investors who had been betting on a speedy recovery.
 Analysts said many global investors decided to cash in recent gains after the jobless rate in the United States unexpectedly jumped to 6.4 percent last month, the highest level in nine years. A weak report on German manufacturing and a profit warning from the Dutch retailer Vendex also weighed on shares. 
 Financial markets were closed in the United States for Independence Day and will reopen on Monday.
In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei stock average lost 77.07 points, or 0.8 percent, to 9,547.73. That came after the Nikkei gained 32.56 points in the previous session to reach its highest level since Sept. 19, 2002.
Traders said Asian investors took their cue from Wall Street's moderate declines on Thursday and pushed down shares of automakers like Honda, Nissan and Toyota. In recent days, stocks had surged on growing hopes for a strong economic recovery in Japan and the United States.
The Tokyo stock price index dropped 3.77 points, or 0.4 percent, to 948.67 points. In the previous session, the Topix, which includes more than 1,000 of Japan's largest companies, gained 7.20 points, or 0.76 percent.
Hong Kong's main Hang Seng index slipped 9.29 points, or 0.1 percent, to 9,636.81. On Thursday, the index had gained 43.48 points, or 0.5 percent. Brokers said the market was hit by selective profit-taking after two sessions of gains.
In Europe, stocks fell after Vendex warned that losses at its V&D department stores would be greater than previously forecast. Germany's economics ministry also said the nation's manufacturing orders declined unexpectedly by 2.2 percent in May.
Britain's F.T.S.E. 100 dropped 3.30 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,021.50. In France, the CAC 40 Index closed down 19.69 points, or 0.6 percent, to 3,072.40, while Germany's Xetra DAX fell 2.31 points, or 0.1 percent, to 3,239.61.
Other international stocks were mixed.
Taiwan's shares closed at a high for the year, with investor optimism for a second-half economic recovery fueling the gains. The weighted price index of the Taiwan stock exchange rose 56.54 points, or 1.1 percent, to 5,151.85.
In Singapore, shares closed higher for a fourth consecutive session after data indicated the nation's manufacturing sector was recovering from a downturn caused by the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome. The Straits Times Index rose 3.31 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,486.24.
In Australia, shares closed lower, pushed down by Thursday's weakness on Wall Street. The all ordinaries index fell 16.30 points, or 0.5 percent, to 3,000.80.
And in Seoul, the Korea composite stock price index, or Kospi, rose 0.9 percent, or 6.42 points, to 693.25.

Europe's Constitution: All Hail the Bureaucracy

BYLINE:  By Edward Rothstein 

 BODY:
About 16 months ago, when the European Union began a constitutional convention of 105 representatives to create a document that would bind more than 25 nations in a new civil union, who knows what might have been possible? 
 The Declaration of Independence was just a one-page document explaining why 13 colonies felt the need to rebel, but it became a formidable influence and is still being celebrated. Imagine what Europeans might have created: a constitution drawing on centuries of political experience and informed by tragic wisdom borne of millenniums of wars; a document influenced by European philosophers like Hobbes and Rousseau, Hume and Kant, Machiavelli and Montesquieu, who addressed fundamental questions about government and human nature. 
 It might also have been a belated Old World response to the achievements of the New. In the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson and his compatriots could begin with a nearly clean slate: from laws of nature, from truths held self-evident, from unalienable rights, from the notion of "consent of the governed." At that time, European nations could not; they were entrenched in history and heritages -- feudal lords and monarchies and priesthoods and stratified classes. 
But with a constitution, the nations of the European Union would supposedly be demonstrating what could be done when even American ideas were superseded, when old ideas of sovereignty were themselves sloughed off. And the constitution itself, like the union, would be an answer to the United States, a counterbalance to its influence and power. 
Former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who oversaw the creation of the first draft of the constitution, even compared himself to Thomas Jefferson (though Jefferson did not work on the United States Constitution). One representative who worked on the European constitution told the British weekly The Economist that it would actually help define a new European identity: "It was the Bill of Rights that created American identity. . . . It will be the same with Europeans."
And last month Mr. Giscard d'Estaing declared competitively, "Of all the men and women in the world, it is the citizens of Europe who will have the most extensive rights." 
Yet faced with this document -- the full text, with recently proposed amendments, can be read on the Web at european-convention.eu.int -- visions of Hobbes and Locke and Rousseau quickly fade. So does any idea that this document will map out any important ground.
The union itself, of course, may work perfectly well. Perhaps Europe, with all its divisions, may eventually have a single foreign policy, a single immigration policy, a single transnational sovereignty and one set of ideas to which speakers of 21 languages will pledge allegiance. After all, it might have seemed just as absurd in 1789 that the disparate American colonies could possibly share ideals. Perhaps, too, this draft will undergo revisions beginning in October, when it is to be reviewed by an intergovernmental conference, though Mr. Giscard d'Estaing has insisted that there is "no longer much room for changes." 
But the document itself is marred by such sloppy language and incoherent thought that numerous complaints have already appeared in the international press. (The Economist suggested that the entire document be jettisoned.) 
Moreover, the constitution's Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union incorporates 50 paragraphs enumerating Mr. Giscard d'Estaing's "extensive rights," including the following: a "right to life" (with the death penalty prohibited); a "right to respect" for one's "physical and mental integrity" (including a prohibition on using human body parts for financial gain); a "right to respect" for "private and family life"; a "right to the protection of personal data"; a "right to marry"; a "right to conscientious objection"; the "freedom to hold opinions"; a "right" to "join trade unions"; a right to "have access to vocational and continuing training" and the right to "receive free compulsory education"; a "right to engage in work"; a right for children to "express their views freely" and to have those views "taken into consideration"; "rights of the elderly to lead a life of dignity and independence"; a right of the disabled to "benefit from measures designed to ensure their independence"; the "right of access to a free placement service" for employment; workers' right to take "collective action"; the "right to paid maternity leave and to parental leave." Sexual equality is to be ensured in all areas, but so is the government's ability to allow "advantages in favor of the underrepresented sex."
This list is incomplete, but it always will be, because the language of rights is just the language of policy: a list of beliefs about an ideal society. There are oddities here (why a right to receive compulsory education?); inconsistencies (body organs and blood are regularly sold for medical reasons, a practice that explains why such issues are usually dealt with by laws rather than with constitutional principles); and peculiarities (a child's right to be taken seriously?). But each of these rights must be affirmed by every nation in the union; each will require supervision and legislation. And by being called rights, at least some things are being placed beyond debate. 
This is not the Jeffersonian language of "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness," with its allusions to the Enlightenment, nor is it the language of the Bill of Rights, which limits government power. This is the language of interest groups, which, enshrined as constitutional rights, will end up guaranteeing the ruling bureaucracy its right to daily bread.
One paragraph asserts the "right to good administration," which is a sort of protection clause against the union's own potentially Kafkaesque agencies, but the constitution's atmosphere is itself uncommonly Kafkaesque. Its often knotty procedures are designed to accrue powers to the central authority while moderating the authority of pre-existing nations. 
The document as a whole bears the scars of a tug of war between nations that would like to establish a supreme federal power in Europe and those, like Britain, that are wary. It multiplies rights, it seems, because it has little faith in the ability of democratic self-government to allow subsidiary rights to grow out of others or in the wisdom of citizens to adopt some rights as laws and to reject others.
This lack of confidence erupts in anxious assertions of authority. The constitution affirms democracy, but the language affirms restriction and power. Is that really what a united Europe wants to declare? And is it something that will ever be celebrated, even in Europe?

HEADLINE: In Portugal, Cork Makers Just Say No To Screwcap 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: AZARUJA, Portugal 

 BODY:
This is a land that has seen its enemy, and he drinks red wine from a screwcap bottle.
 For this is cork country. Silvery green cork oaks dot the dry, straw-colored landscape. Factories for trimming, boiling and binding cork into bundles surround the whitewashed villages. The free-ranging hogs that yield the region's characteristic hams and sausages fatten on cork oak acorns. Corks pop from bottles of the local Alentejo wines that wash down virtually every meal. Local entrepreneurs hand out business cards with their names printed on slivers of cork. 
 Cork, cork and more cork has brought a measure of prosperity to what has otherwise been a dirt-poor region of south-central Portugal.
Teresa Ortigao Ramos, a diminutive, silver-haired woman who is descended from the counts of Galveias, invites a visitor into a chapel on her property that is lined with votive paintings depicting the ordinary lives of local cork growers, the earliest from the mid-18th century, about the time her family settled here. That was only a century or so after a French monk, Dom Perignon, first plugged a round piece of cork into a bottle of bubbly. Before that, wine bottles were stopped with things like cloth and wooden pegs.
Just how many cork trees does she have? "Thousands," she replied. "I should know. But I don't."
Eduardo Silva, 61, the manager of her lands, estimates that there are roughly 49,000 of them on about 1,700 acres.
"Here in this village, we always had cork factories, so starvation was never so deep as elsewhere," he said later over a lunch of boiled meats, cabbage and potatoes -- and, of course, an Alentejo region wine topped with natural cork. Tugging his mustache, he added: "I don't understand why we're not in paradise: good wine, good weather, good cork."
Indeed, cork arguably is to Portugal what crude oil is to Saudi Arabia. 
More than half of the $2 billion worth of corks produced every year originate here; nearly all the rest comes from nearby Mediterranean countries. Scrap cork goes to making floor coverings, insulation and the like. Roughly 16,000 Portuguese work in the industry.
But as the global wine industry has grown, so has the spread of stoppers like screwcaps and plastic corks.
Natural corks sometimes leak, sometimes crumble. They can impart a musty odor, called cork taint, spoiling the wines they are there to protect. They are also getting expensive. In the last five years, Mr. Silva said, raw cork has gone from $41 or less for a standard 33-pound bundle to as much as $58.
So wine growers in Australia, California and even premier regions of France, like Bordeaux, are resorting to alternatives. In Switzerland, half the wine is now sold without natural corks.
The battle lines between the cork producers and their rivals are clearly drawn.
On Web sites and in professional journals, the screwcap industry points up natural cork's shortcomings. Blind taste tests and consumer surveys showing a preference for -- or at least lack of hostility to -- the screwcap are highlighted.
The cork manufacturers have been equally busy picking at the makers of screwcaps and pressing their own case. When the Australian Wine Research Institute recently found that rubbery odors in bottled white wines were more notable in screwcap bottles than those with corks, for example, the cork manufacturers trumpeted the results.
Cork people also accuse the screwcap people of spreading lies -- for example, that harvesting cork bark kills the trees, which it does not. In fact, they say, if cork forests die out because demand for cork drops, ecological disaster will befall the cork-growing regions.
Both sides snipe at the synthetic-cork makers, saying their products are hard to extract from bottles and may impart a chemical taste to wines. And the plastic-cork makers echo the criticisms of natural corks, but say that wine lovers want their bottles to open with a pop, not a twist.
As demand for Portuguese wines rises, the growers of Alentejo are increasing production of their reds and whites. Asked whether any of it comes in screwcap bottles, Mrs. Ortigao Ramos winced. "Please," she said. "Corks."
Adriano Jose Carapinha Gino owns one of a dozen or so factories that ring Azaruja, population 2,300, where he trims and boils the cork before it is shipped to factories in northern Portugal to be drilled into bottle corks. On his desk is a collection of stoppers, some of ground cork, others of cork slivers glued together that are cheaper than whole cork stoppers. Among them is a bright yellow plastic stopper from an Italian competitor.
What makes good cork? "We know by experience," he replied. "Some areas are very good, others, I don't even go there. I like to buy cork no farther than 50 kilometers from here," or about 30 miles. "Farther, I don't even go. I know this is the best."
Mr. Gino and several other local entrepreneurs are building a $5 million factory to process cork scrap. They say that when it is up and running later this year, they will consider making cork stoppers.
The bark is harvested from late May to July. Mature cork oaks, 40 years old before their bark is suitable for wine corks, are stripped once every nine years during their expected lifespan of more than 200 years. According to the Natural Cork Quality Council of Sebastapol, Calif., stripping one average tree yields enough material for 4,000 bottles at each harvesting.
On a recent steamy afternoon, Ambrosio Bengalinha, 59, was perched in the fork of a spreading oak in the forests under Evora Monte, a hilltop town half an hour's drive from Azaruja. Wielding a razor-sharp ax in one hand, he deftly urged the thick bark from the tree, as he has done every summer for 25 years. For eight hours of harvesting that begin at 8 in the morning, he nets roughly $90, after deducting social security and health insurance contributions.
But his relation to the trees seemed a lot more than material. Asked what was hardest about stripping the trees, he wiped sweat from his face and replied: "It's not difficult when the tree helps you, when she gives up her bark readily. Sometimes, she's difficult."
Will screwtops eventually put him out of a job? "They've been talking about screwtops for a long time," he said, yet he is still climbing the trees.

PERSON: Anthony Dapolito 

HEADLINE: Anthony Dapolito, 82, Community Advocate 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Anthony Dapolito, a baker whose battles for his community earned him the honorary title of mayor of Greenwich Village, died on Wednesday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan, one day before his 83rd birthday.
 He had a stroke last year, but the cause of death was pneumonia, his wife, Frances, said. He lived on La Guardia Place just south of Washington Square Park, an urban oasis he had long championed, and a few blocks from his well-known bakery, Vesuvio. 
 Mr. Dapolito and powerful allies like Eleanor Roosevelt and Jane Jacobs successfully fought to remove traffic from the park and stop a freeway planned for Lower Manhattan. But in more than half a century of membership on his community board, he waged day-in, day-out battles for parks and other amenities in the Village and adjoining communities that were at least as important as his earlier fights.
In a highly politicized province of Manhattan, he rejected many urgings to seek public office. Instead, working mostly behind the scenes, he served as the unpaid chairman of Community Board 2 for terms that added up to 12 years and as chairman of the board's parks committee for many more. 
"He was not a screamer, unlike many of his neighbors," said Henry J. Stern, the former parks commissioner, who worked with Mr. Dapolito for more than 40 years in various capacities. "More important, he was a baker. He had a real living. So many community people today are activists or consultants, which are euphemisms for unemployed. Tony actually rode around in the morning delivering bread and rolls."
But he was far from the humble baker he liked to portray, easily navigating shark-infested political waters. He first cultivated Carmine G. De Sapio, the legendary political boss; then former Mayor Edward I. Koch, who began his political career by savaging Mr. De Sapio; and still later the younger Democrats opposed to Mr. Koch.
In an interview with The New York Times last year, Mr. Koch called Mr. Dapolito "the heart and soul of the Village" and declared, "He is our protector."
"He was really a rather tiny man," Mr. Koch said in an interview Thursday, "but he always seemed to be a giant."
Mr. Dapolito sold his bakery at 160 Prince Street earlier this year because of poor health, and it is now closed for remodeling. Under the new ownership, it will remain Vesuvio Bakery.
Anthony Victor Dapolito was born on Houston Street on July 3, 1920. His parents, Nunzio and Jennie, both Neapolitan immigrants, opened the Vesuvio Bakery in 1920, shortly after Anthony was born. The eldest of five boys, he was the first to be given the chore of delivering bread. He drove a horse-drawn bread wagon; the family did not have a truck until 1937.
In 1946, he married Frances, a local girl, and they had one child, Jennie, who still lives in Manhattan. Mr. Dapolito is also survived by his brother, Joseph, of Boynton Beach, Fla., and one grandson.
Mr. Dapolito was elected to his community board shortly after the boards began in 1950, and his wife said he had wanted to live to become the first person to serve for 50 years on a community board. He served 52 and was chairman of his board's parks committee at his death.
Ed Gold, a longtime member of Board 2, said that Vesuvio Bakery became a second meeting place for the community board, which represents the Village, the West Village, SoHo and parts of NoHo, Little Italy and Chinatown.
Mr. Gold said that Mr. Dapolito was "a modest guy" except when it came to defending parks, of which he created or remodeled a half dozen.
In 1968, when critics questioned the remodeling of Washington Square Park because derelicts and hippies were among its chief users, Mr. Dapolito rose in eloquent defense of the plans.
"The restoration can save the square," he said in an interview with The Times. "If it is attractive enough -- and it will be beautiful, very beautiful -- then so many respectable people are going to come in they will crowd out the bums."
Mr. Koch recalled how Mr. Dapolito cleverly dealt with community opposition when he wanted to put up a statue, which by law must include the mayor's name on a plaque. Some board members so loathed Mr. Koch that they were willing to give up the statue because of the plaque. 
But Mr. Dapolito literally minimized the problem. 
"My name is on there as mayor," Mr. Koch said. "But very small."

U.S. Looks to Free Market To Curb Medicare Costs
Under measures passed by the House and the Senate, the 40 million Americans on Medicare would have the chance to receive a prescription drug benefit either under Medicare or under new programs offered by private health plans. The government hopes that by encouraging beneficiaries to enroll in the private plans of their choice, it can rein in Medicare costs through the discipline of the free market.
 But some policy analysts say that private health plans have never proved they can save significant sums of money and that Washington is at risk for repeating its mistake of trying to encourage private health plans while keeping a lid on costs. Page A1. 

Mazda Shifts Some Work to Isuzu
Mazda Motor, Japan's fifth-largest automaker, said that it would stop making some light trucks and shift the production to Isuzu Motors to cut costs and focus on the market for passenger cars. The move is part of a broader shakeout in Japan's crowded truck market and comes three months before the government tightens rules on diesel emissions. C3.

Path Cleared for Sale of Selfridges
Aletheia Partners, the fund backed by the British property investor Robert Tchenguiz, said today that it would not bid for Selfridges, the department store chain, clearing the way for Galen Weston, left, to buy it. Mr. Weston, a Canadian billionaire, submitted a bid on May 12 that valued the company at $:598 million ($958 million). Selfridges encouraged shareholders to accept the offer. C3.

South Korea Vows to Appeal Tariff
South Korea warned the European Union that it would appeal to the World Trade Organization if Europe decided to extend heavy tariffs against Hynix Semiconductor. The action would be comparable to the appeal that it has already filed against the United States. C3.

Ireland Begins Housing Initiative
Ireland has decided to address the lack of affordable housing by building thousands of houses on hundreds of acres of government land and selling them nearly at cost. The prime minister said that two large tracts of land in Dublin would be given to a local authority, which will hire developers to build the houses and sell them to young people. C3.

Factory Orders Drop in Germany
German manufacturing orders fell for the third time in four months in May, government figures showed, indicating that the economy may contract again in the second quarter. Orders to factories, whose production accounts for about a fifth of the economy, Europe's largest, fell 2.2 percent from those in April. C2.

Sweden's central bank unexpectedly cut its benchmark interest rate, the fifth reduction in eight months, citing easing inflation and sputtering growth. C2.

Stocks Post Declines Overseas
Stocks fell overseas, with Japan's main index retreating from a nine-month high, as weak employment in the United States stirred caution among investors who had been betting on a speedy recovery. The weak report on German manufacturing and a profit warning from a Dutch retailer also weighed on shares. C2.

Financial markets in the United States were closed for the Fourth of July holiday. They will reopen on Monday.

HEADLINE: Broke Town's Mayor, Facing Furor, Bows to It 

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: DESERT HOT SPRINGS, Calif., July 1 

 BODY:
The mayor of this bankrupt hamlet high in the low desert insists that he is a misunderstood man.
 He was not attempting a coup, he says, when he proposed extending his term for a year without a public vote. Contrary to what his detractors maintain, he was not trying to milk out an extra year of work because he is himself financially bankrupt, otherwise unemployed and generally unpopular. 
 The mayor, Matt Weyuker, says his motivation for trying to prolong his term and those of two allies on the City Council was to benefit democracy.
After a loud public outcry, however, Mr. Weyuker has backed down, telling a hostile crowd assembled at a Council meeting tonight that he will no longer pursue the matter, "as a result of the apparent misunderstanding of those in the community who tend to be distrustful of the motives of those of us who see the wisdom" in changing the law.
Desert Hot Springs is a poor town of some 15,000 people, just north of Palm Springs, that filed for bankruptcy protection a year and a half ago, in the wake of a multimillion-dollar court judgment favoring housing developers and the accumulation of some $4 million in unrelated debt. It then came to light that the mayor himself had filed for bankruptcy, after being dismissed from his administrative job at a local university and losing his nest egg in the market.
Just last year, an electorate grown disenchanted with what many see as the mayor's autocratic style of leadership rejected a ballot measure, proposed by Weyuker supporters, that would have changed the mayoral term to four years from two.
But a few weeks ago, Mr. Weyuker and the Council's two other Republicans joined to push through, on a 3-to-2 vote, legislation to add a year to their terms, due to lapse at the end of 2003. 
The mayor said his motivation was to save the town some money by consolidating elections in an even-numbered year, a move that would have the salutary side effect, he said, of increasing voter turnout in local elections.
The citizenry revolted.
A recall campaign was undertaken by Mayor Weyuker's fellow Republicans. Even many of his former supporters said they believed that his true motive was personal finance: by prolonging his term, the mayor would keep his $1,200-a-month job and his health benefits, and qualify for a state pension.
"The mayor's desire for power has impaired his ability to count," said Alex W. Bias, chairman of the town's Economic Development Commission and a former member of the mayor's re-election committee. "The people told him no last year, and he tries to usurp their will."
As for saving the town money, a call to the office of the Riverside County registrar found that not only would Desert Hot Springs not save anything by consolidating its elections, it would be charged about $2,500 to notify voters of the change.
Yielding to the furor, the mayor tonight tabled a vote on the term-extension bill, which had required passage a second time for final adoption.
The recall campaign, meanwhile, has been dropped. And Mr. Weyuker contemplates a run for re-election this November.

HEADLINE: Searching for a Dial Tone in Africa 

BYLINE:  By G. PASCAL ZACHARY

DATELINE: ACCRA, Ghana, July 3 

 BODY:
The Internet bubble has long since popped in the United States, Europe and Asia. But in parts of Africa the Internet is serving as a powerful force for change, primarily by allowing companies and individuals to make international telephone calls far less expensively than through conventional channels.
 Calls in and out of sub-Saharan Africa have long been among the world's most costly, strangling business opportunities and burdening ordinary people. Services have been tightly controlled by government-owned telephone companies, many of which are rife with corruption and incompetence. Governments also imposed high tariffs on international calls, seeing it as a lucrative source of revenue. 
 But now, thanks to what is called voice-over-Internet, phone alternatives are flourishing, sharply lowering costs and expanding opportunities for business and consumers in some of the poorest places on earth -- even as they pose a competitive threat to government-sanctioned telephone companies. 
Sending telephone calls over the Internet is gaining ground in Africa because it makes possible a range of new services, linking the sub-Saharan to the world's major industrial centers in ways unimaginable only a few years ago. And better digital connections, mostly via satellite, are raising the hope that Ghana -- the most peaceful country in a West African region besieged by civil wars and ethnic strife -- may become the regional hub for an information-technology industry.
"As Ghana improves its connectivity to the outside world, it has the potential to become for Africa what Bangalore became for India," said Paul Maritz, a former senior executive at Microsoft who recently visited Accra to survey the nascent high-tech scene here.
Last Thursday, at a United Nations conference in New York, the secretary general, Kofi Annan, delivered a message that developing countries also need to include wireless access, known as Wi-Fi, in building an Internet system.
"It is precisely in places where no infrastructure exists that Wi-Fi can be particularly effective," Mr. Annan said, "helping countries to leapfrog generations of telecommunications technology and empower their people."
As the movement advances, though, many government-owned telephone companies, which dominate wired service in most African countries, are fighting a rear-guard action.
Internet telephony "is presented as the salvation for business and society in Africa," said Oystein Bjorge, chief executive of Ghana's national telephone carrier. "It is not."
Mr. Bjorge, a Norwegian telecommunications consultant hired recently to do battle against the Internet telephone services, said it wreaks havoc with the economics of phone companies. Here in Ghana, the national phone company is waging a sporadic campaign against its own citizens who use the Internet to make or receive telephone calls from America and Europe, periodically turning off the lines of those suspected of doing so.
Three years ago,the government even jailed the heads of some of Ghana's leading Internet providers. Though later exonerated by a court, the dissidents fear another crackdown. "Internet telephony is changing the whole power structure," said Francis Quartey, chief technology officer of Intercom Data Network and one of those jailed. "The dangerous thing is that the power elite is responding out of fear and ignorance."
Despite this opposition, American companies are experimenting with new ventures in Ghana, seeing if enthusiasm for Internet telephony can transform local technology entrepreneurs into a force for genuine economic advancement.
For example, Rising Data Solutions, which is based in Gaithersburg, Md., introduced a call center here last month, where a dozen Ghanaians -- trained in American-style English -- are trying to sign up customers in the northeastern United States on behalf of a wireless phone company. At least three other call centers are expected to open in Accra later this year, all relying on Internet telephony instead of telephone carriers.
Internet telephony also aids companies like Newmont Mining, which is searching for gold in Ghana, the second-largest gold producer on the continent, after South Africa. To help manage its operation, Newmont plans to link its operations within Ghana to the wider world through the Internet. 
Acquiring reliable phone service is essential, foreign investors say, which is why they bypass the government-owned telephone company. Ghana Telecom has an order backlog of more than 300,000 lines; bribery is the fastest -- indeed, usually the only -- way to obtain new service. Even those with service suffer from frequent failures and inaccurate bills. Roughly every other call results in a busy signal, an indicator of what Ghana Telecom calls "network congestion."
Under the circumstances, Internet telephony -- which has failed so far to make serious inroads into the American telephone market because of lower voice quality -- seems positively fabulous to many weaned on Africa's creaky systems.
"Internet gives me control over my destiny," said Sambou Makalou, chief executive of Rising Data. "My business needs to be up 24-7; we can't get a busy signal."
Busy signals are common in Ghana because the public phone networks are overloaded. As recently as four years ago, a dial tone was among the scarcest resources in the country, which had fewer than 200,000 phone lines in a nation of 19 million.
Few people realized how much demand for phone service was waiting to explode until Ghana's most successful wireless company, Spacefon, was introduced in 1996. Before it started, executives thought the potential customer base was probably 3,000 people, at most 12,000. Seven years later, Spacefon has more than 300,000 subscribers.
The country's total phone lines are now approaching 750,000, roughly two-thirds of them wireless. But completing a call is still difficult, especially between rival networks (there are five), and neither Ghana Telecom, nor the country's legal wireless operators offer a reliable connection to the Internet.
In response to these limitations, private businesses have built scores of data networks, relying on satellite- and radio-based Internet-access systems. 
But telephone service became appealing because of the high network costs: Companies typically pay from $2,000 to $5,000 a month for a robust connection to the Internet, an enormous sum when economic output per person is only about $400 a year.
"I'm paying $2,000 a month for Internet access, so I want to use the technology to the fullest,"said Austin Addo, chief information officer of Ghana Link Network Services.
Mr. Addo's company, which began operations here early this year, helps the government calculate duties on goods imported into the country, relying on frequent updates, via the Internet, of product values. The company's partner is based in Madrid, so Mr. Addo uses a standard device to make international calls over his computer network. He is not billed for the calls, which would otherwise cost him roughly 75 cents a minute, including the cost of line.
His telephone calls are not really free, since he pays $2,000 a month for Internet access. But he is still saving lots of money because he can speak as long as he wants without worrying about the cost. "Five years ago to get this level of communication," he said, "I'd have to fly to Spain -- several times a week." 
Such productivity gains have been a cause for celebration almost everywhere in the world. But official anxiety over Internet telephony is widespread throughout Africa and particularly rife in Ghana. At a public meeting in May, held at the largest Internet cafe in Accra, a regulator defended the government's latest campaign against those who use the Internet to bypass authorized telephone providers. "The players have been apprehended or will be apprehended soon," said Bernard Forson, deputy director of the National Communications Authority of Ghana.
The government is not opposed to any particular technology, Mr. Forson explained, but merely wants "regulated entities to provide telephone service," not unlicensed and untaxed wildcatters.
Other African countries face a similar quandary, aware of the appeal of Internet voice service but fearful of its damage to the state-owned telephone company.
Neighboring Togo, for instance, allowed Internet telephony until the end of last year, when the government cracked down on behalf of Togo Telecom. So many foreign calls in tiny Togo were being routed over the Internet that a small "com" center -- ubiquitous in Africa, offering calls for a fee -- took in $10,000 a month from just two phones.
But some African countries have embraced Internet telephony as a way to end decades of frustration. In Nigeria, for example, the government has not officially approved telephoning over the Internet but looks the other way, partly to ease congestion on its authorized networks.
Still, the legal confusion surrounding Internet telephony has prompted some to avoid it. Affiliated Computer Services, which is based in Dallas, set up shop in Accra two years ago, relying on a private satellite connection to the Internet that supports both a data and a telephone network. Today, it is one of Ghana's largest private employers, with 1,200 people and plans to hire another 700.
While the company runs call centers in Jamaica, Mexico and India, it does not intend to do such telephone work in Ghana. "We can't use satellite lines" because of the brief delay in hearing a response, said Tom Blodgett, the executive who started the Ghana operation. And for now, he adds, "there is no suitable wired alternative." A legal one, anyway.
But for all their efforts to restrain the movement, African telecom companies are probably fighting a losing battle.
"Periodically the police confiscate equipment or the telco turns off phone lines," said Russell Southwood, a London-based consultant and publisher of a weekly newsletter on Africa's telecom scene, Balancing Act's News Update. "But it's about as hopeless as Canute trying to turn back the tide."

HEADLINE: California Official Campaigns Again, This Time for Insurance Overhaul 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif. 

 BODY:
Twice, John Garamendi has run for governor of California. Twice, he has lost.
 Now, nine months after winning election as the California insurance commissioner -- a job he also held in the early 1990's -- Mr. Garamendi is back on the campaign trail, this time, he says, for the cause of reform. 
 His stated objective, as he shakes hands around the state, chats with grocers and fishmongers and labor leaders and delivers peppy speeches, is to win support for a plan to drive a stake into what many California business people say is their biggest, single problem: the soaring cost of workers' compensation insurance. 
But political friends and foes say Mr. Garamendi, a Democrat, may also be positioning himself for another run for the governor's office.
"It is widely assumed that Garamendi wants to run for governor again," said Kevin Spillane, a Republican political consultant who advised Mr. Garamendi's opponent, Gary Mendoza, a Republican lawyer, in the election for insurance commissioner last fall.
The field of potential candidates for governor in 2006 is already crowded and, to many Californians, that election seems far away. But the workers' compensation problem is a real payday issue across the political spectrum, and Mr. Garamendi is being widely, sometimes grudgingly, applauded for helping focus attention on it.
"I'm in the process of building the best consumer protection agency in the country," Mr. Garamendi said as he rode through Los Angeles recently in a chauffeured sedan, part of his barnstorming efforts to popularize his proposals. Here in the state capital, he has been pressing the legislature to take steps to reduce medical, legal and administrative costs, which he says are the main factors pushing insurance prices for California employers. He wants standardized medical procedures and fees and the use of generic drugs, and he wants a medical review panel and an ombudsman to resolve disputes and reduce litigation.
But the proposed changes threaten some of the state's most powerful political forces and, although Mr. Garamendi says he is increasingly optimistic, meaningful compromise is proving difficult. 
"A lot of bills have been introduced and the bulk of them have been bottled up in the legislature by special interest groups," said Senator Chuck Poochigian, the chairman of the Republican caucus. 
In many ways, workers' compensation is a perfect issue for Mr. Garamendi. It provides an opportunity to raise his already high profile among voters with little political risk: the price of workers' compensation insurance has risen higher in California than anywhere else in the country, costing jobs and forcing some businesses to close or leave the state. But the problem is so big and so bewilderingly complex that even if he fails to achieve major change, he stands a good chance of winning praise for having fought the good fight.
Mr. Garamendi, a former football player at the University of California at Berkeley, former Peace Corps worker in Africa and veteran of the state legislature, with a reputation for intelligence and a willingness to take on complex issues, is not denying he dreams of higher office. But, for now, he says, he is concentrating on insurance.
"If I look too far into the future," he said, I'm going to miss the opportunity to do what needs to be done today and tomorrow."
Mr. Garamendi, who grew up on a ranch in the foothills of the Sierras, served as Bill Clinton's campaign manager in California in 1992. After he was defeated in the gubernatorial primary in 1994, the Clinton administration found a job for him as a deputy secretary in the Department of the Interior. In 1998, Mr. Garamendi opened a Washington office for a Los Angeles investment firm, then went on to run for insurance commissioner. His wife, Patricia Wilkinson Garamendi, also served in the Clinton administration and is now an assistant secretary in charge of international economic development for California. They have six children.
Mr. Garamendi, 58, is well known in California. On the streets and in airports, people call out to him. He chats easily with them and tells them to urge their legislators to focus on workers' compensation. He recently spent a full day talking workers' compensation with business owners in Los Angeles and was up at dawn the next day in Sacramento to speak at a labor breakfast. Then he went on to address the Associated General Contractors of California. 
"He's trying to position himself as the moderate, pro-business Democrat in the 2006 primary for governor," Mr. Spillane said. 
Senator Jackie Speier, the chairman of the Senate insurance committee, a Democrat and political ally, said Mr. Garamendi was "first and foremost a candidate," adding: "I don't think you can rule him out for 2006." 
(Like many other prominent Democrats in California, Mr. Garamendi said he would not be a candidate this fall should the state's Republicans force a recall election of Gov. Gray Davis.)
In his zeal for the spotlight, Mr. Garamendi is an anomaly among the 51 insurance regulators in each of the states and the District of Columbia. 
A few insurance regulators have risen to higher office. Ben Nelson, the Democratic senator from Nebraska and Bill Nelson, the Democratic senator from Florida, are two examples. But most are gray, faceless bureaucrats -- all but invisible, appointed by governors rather than elected. They worry about getting out in front of their benefactors on the issues and they run from controversy. None of them, including Mr. Garamendi, is empowered to make big changes on their own. But the bully pulpit is theirs for the mounting.
But few insurance regulators choose advocacy. Instead, they affect a neutral stance, professing to deal evenhandedly with insurance companies and their customers. But the insurance companies have the advantage. They pour millions into lobbying and they and the regulators are experts in insurance.
Mr. Garamendi is not neutral. In his first campaign for insurance commissioner in 1990, he ran on a promise to carry out a new law that established a price range for auto and home insurance and forced the insurance companies to refund hundreds of millions in premiums. He also took the side of customers who complained that the insurers were trying to cheat them on their damage claims after the devastating brush fires in the hills of Oakland in 1991 and the North Ridge earthquake that stunned Los Angeles in 1994. Mr. Garamendi, who has an M.B.A. from Harvard, was criticized however, for selling the assets of a failed life insurance company in behalf of policyholders for far less than he could have gotten once the bond market revived.
This time with Mr. Garamendi as insurance commissioner, there is less tension over auto and home insurance and the insurers are delighted that he is pledging to cut workers' compensation costs. "I'm trying to work with them and they're trying to work with me," Mr. Garamendi said.
In workers' compensation, however, one person's solution is another's problem. To the lawyers who specialize in representing injured workers, the talk of cutting legal costs sounds like Mr. Garamendi wants to put them out of business. Political experts say the strong medical lobby is also likely to oppose efforts to make cuts in their field. Yet others, like Senator Poochigian say Mr. Garamendi's cost cutting does not go far enough. "They've cherry-picked some of the more popular ideas and been cautious about embracing other reforms, some of which might be offensive to their core constituencies," Mr. Poochigian said. 
Tom Rankin, the president of the California Labor Federation, A.F.L.-C.I.O., the state's largest labor group, favors set fees for medical services. But he said some of the ideas backed by Mr. Garamendi and Governor Davis "we think are totally unworkable." One example, is the medical review board, that Mr. Rankin says will add another layer of bureaucracy "to the detriment of the injured worker." 
Mr. Rankin also wants controls imposed on what insurance companies can charge. But Mr. Garamendi says that if the expenses within the system, like those for medical services, are reduced, the insurers' prices will follow.
Part of his job, he says now, is making sure that insurance companies can operate profitably.
"But," he said, "it's also making sure the insurance companies obey the law and treat their customers properly. If not, they are going to have some serious conversations with me."

HEADLINE: Olympic Hurdles for New York 

 BODY:
The selection of Vancouver this week as the site of the 2010 Winter Olympics was supposed to hurt New York's chances of winning the Summer Games that follow, the reasoning being that one continent should not be the host for successive Games. But recent history is filled with exceptions to that position, including the 1980 Winter Games in Lake Placid and the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles. The fact is, New York's biggest challenge is not geography, but time and money. 
 With the International Olympic Committee set to decide two years from now on the 2012 Summer Games, New York's planners are looking like weight trainers halfway into a clean and jerk: the heavy lifting has just begun and the clock is ticking. To stay competitive in a field that so far includes London, Madrid and Paris, the city needs to begin work on a far West Side addition to the No. 7 subway line, but there will not be much time after the necessary reviews to get started on that before the selection date. That transportation is needed if planners are to proceed with a grand plan to transform the mostly life-deprived Hudson Yards, west of Midtown, into an exciting residential and recreational center at a pace that would resemble "Trading Spaces" on steroids. This work and a Long Island waterfront project would be the landscape legacies the Olympics preparations are supposed to spur, much in the way Barcelona reshaped its oceanfront for the '92 Games. While competition is driving all this activity, planners here say the change will happen whether the Games come to New York or not. 
 Part of the West Side development plan is a much-needed expansion of the Javits Convention Center. But planners have been less compelling about the necessity for a proposed stadium that would eventually become the home of the New York Jets. And the volume of new commercial and residential space -- 40 million square feet in the course of 40 years -- seems especially ambitious in a big picture that includes rebuilding Lower Manhattan.
The team led by Deputy Mayor Daniel Doctoroff needs to answer, and soon, the biggest question of all: how the development, which totals $4 billion, will be financed. Planners appear to be working on a self-financing mechanism that would put the major risk on developers rather than the taxpayers. But details have not yet been made public. Paying for the stadium is a separate issue -- while the Jets are supposed to bear much of the cost, the team would not have to pay for the $500 million roof and foundation that would make the site multifunctional.
There is no question that winning the Olympics can help to revitalize a local economy, and right now New York's is hurting. And that's the point. The architects of the New York Olympic bid still have to convince New Yorkers that pain now will be worth the gain in 2012 and beyond.

HEADLINE: Beliefs; 
A professor offers a critique of legal responses to reported cases of sexual abuse by the clergy.

BYLINE:  By Peter Steinfels

 BODY:
When it comes to sexual abuse by the clergy, "I have as much experience with this issue as just about anyone," Patrick J. Schiltz said. 
 Mr. Schiltz is associate dean of the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis. From 1987 to 1995, when he left private practice to become a law professor, he represented not only Roman Catholic dioceses, but almost every major Christian denomination in cases of sexual misconduct by the clergy -- more than 500 of them, throughout the United States and in several foreign countries. 
 He has spent hundreds of hours listening to victims of such abuse describe their pain. Just listening can be unbearable, he said, adding, "How much worse it must be to experience that pain." Mr. Schiltz said he had also spent hundreds of hours "being frustrated by the decisions of some of the bishops I have advised." 
That is not, however, the part of Mr. Schiltz's outlook that is likely to meet with resistance these days. 
In several recent talks, an article in the current issue of America, the weekly Catholic magazine published by Jesuits,and a forthcoming article for the Boston College Law Review, Mr. Schiltz makes some other points that challenge conventional sentiments. 
His first argument is that current litigation over sexual abuse by the clergy, besides posing economic peril for religious institutions, is rife with implications for religious freedom. He worries that emerging legal theories in sexual abuse cases, which are not limited to cases involving minors, could greatly expand the notion of what constitutes "reasonable" supervisory duties of religious leaders. 
These theories, he argues, may cripple those leaders' ability to extend pastoral care to victims of abuse because doing so would create new fiduciary obligations and consequent legal risks for those church leaders. 
Mr. Schiltz also says the theories growing out of litigation could chill the willingness of religious groups to engage in public controversies or take chances on flawed leaders with any sexual misbehavior in their histories. (By today's standards, even St. Augustine would not be considered a safe bet for clerical ranks, he notes.) And these theories may justify unprecedented government intrusion in internal church matters. 
Is Mr. Schiltz exaggerating these dangers? Possibly. Still, it seems that those who normally exercise great vigilance about any risks to First Amendment liberties should pay attention to these concerns. 
Mr. Schiltz has also said that, over the past year or so, the news media, in covering reports of sexual abuse by the clergy, "have grossly distorted the problem and thereby left the public terribly misinformed." 
"Despite devoting thousands of articles to clergy sexual misconduct, 99.9 percent of reporters missed the most important story," he told a Rotary group in Minneapolis on May 9. 
That story, he said, began with the fact that "in the late 1980's and early 1990's, churches got sued a lot." They responded with a host of changes and by investing hundreds of millions of dollars and hours of work in combating sexual misconduct. 
"And churches had remarkable success," he said. 
As an example, Mr. Schiltz cited a report done last fall by The Courier-Journal in Louisville, Ky., analyzing 185 sexual assault lawsuits filed against the Archdiocese of Louisville, which he said was "perhaps the worst of all the Catholic dioceses in terms of the number of abuse cases per Catholic."
"Do you know how many of those lawsuits involved abuse that had occurred since 1990?" Mr. Schiltz asked. "One. One of 185."
What about the claim of plaintiffs' lawyers and victims' advocates that this statistic merely reflects the time it takes before victims are willing to report abuse and that, a few years from now, it will become clear that nothing really changed in the 1990's? 
"This is hogwash," Mr. Schiltz said. Some victims do wait for years to report their abuse, but others do not, he said, adding, "I worked on hundreds of cases in which the abuse had been reported promptly." 
Today, moreover, victims of sexual abuse are much more likely to be believed and given support than in the past. Where many people, even parents of victims, once discounted evidence of abuse out of the conviction that a clergyman could not do such a terrible thing, "no one is laboring under that illusion today," Mr. Schiltz said. All of that means that more victims, not fewer, should be reporting abuse if it has continued at the old levels, he said. 
In Mr. Schiltz's eyes, the fact that abuse might be on the decline does not diminish the anguish and harm done to those who were abused, at whatever date. Nor does it remove churches' moral obligation to help victims or excuse the crimes of abusers or the negligence of church leaders who ignored credible accusations. 
Rather, he said it puts the problem of abuse, especially in the Roman Catholic Church, in sharper focus. As he wrote in America magazine: "Because most dioceses got their act together in the 1990's, there aren't a lot of new abuse cases. But because most dioceses did not get their acts together until the 1990's, there are a lot of old abuse cases." 
Mr. Schiltz has a positive proposal for addressing clergy abuse. "The church should set up a national tribunal, a group of extremely well-respected people who are completely independent of the church, to arbitrate sexual abuse claims," he wrote. 
In his plan, dioceses would pay whatever the tribunal determined was fair compensation to any victims who appeared to be telling the truth (and Mr. Schiltz thinks that is about 98 percent of them) and who agreed to forgo litigation. 
Cases could be resolved quickly, he said. Dioceses would save millions of dollars in legal costs, he pointed out, and victims would keep all their compensation, "rather than turning over one-third to one-half the amount to pay an attorney and thousands of dollars more to pay the expenses of litigation." 
One great challenge, of course, would be to ensure that the tribunal was truly independent. In a phone conversation, Mr. Schiltz suggested that including a representative of one of the victims' advocacy groups "would give it instant credibility." 
Even when Mr. Schiltz's arguments are read in full, they clearly remain debatable. 
But at a time when former Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma can command headlines with his departure from the Catholic bishops' national review board and when Bishop Sean P. O'Malley can grab attention with his arrival in Boston, the hard-to-categorize views of this experienced litigator and legal scholar deserve a wider and fuller hearing.

HEADLINE: Credit Rating Worries California 

BYLINE:  By JOHN M. BRODER with JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 4 

 BODY:
California officials were meeting through the holiday weekend to try to address the state's $38 billion budget shortfall and an imminent reduction in the state's already low credit rating.
 Gov. Gray Davis vowed to resist a Republican budget plan that he said threatened education and public safety and said that a recall election to remove him would waste $30 million that would be better spent for pressing state needs. 
 In brief remarks before he met with his budget advisers this afternoon, Mr. Davis said the Republican proposal would postpone kindergarten for more than 100,000 5-year-olds and deny college admission to tens of thousands of students. 
"My budget balances our books and still provides enough funding for education, public safety and health insurance for children," Mr. Davis said of his own plan, which raises taxes by $8 billion and cuts $18 billion from the budget. The Republican plan has no tax increases.
But there was little hope that the budget stalemate would be resolved in coming days, and there were predictions that the situation could drag on through the summer, as it did last year. In the meantime, supporters of the effort to recall Mr. Davis were canvassing holiday picnics and parades to gather the 900,000 signatures needed to put the recall question to voters in the fall.
Two major credit-rating agencies, alarmed by California's continuing political and fiscal trauma, said this week that they were considering further lowering the state's credit rating, already the worst in the nation. Such a move would significantly raise the state's cost of borrowing and make potential investors wary about purchasing California public debt at a time when it appears that the state will have to turn to the markets to help pay its bills.
California's estimated $38.2 billion shortfall over the last and current fiscal years is larger than the annual budget of every other state except New York.
The State Assembly is scheduled to meet on Sunday to consider a Republican budget plan that includes the proposal to save money by delaying entrance to kindergarten for more than 100,000 5-year-olds. The large Democratic majority in the Assembly is expected to reject it.
The nationwide economic slump has strained the finances of more than half the states, several of which are operating on short-term budgets and seeking tax increases and spending cuts to cover operating deficits. The credit-rating agencies have listed more than a dozen states as having a negative outlook for the medium term, meaning that a rating cut is not imminent but that economic developments are worrisome.
Moody's Investors Service downgraded Connecticut one notch this week, but the state's credit rating remains relatively healthy.
But California, by nature of its huge deficit and its political deadlock, is in a class by itself.
Moody's and Standard & Poor's, citing the budget stalemate and the recall movement, placed the state on their watch lists for possible downgrade in the next 90 days. Moody's rates California debt at A2, the lowest rating among the 50 states, along with New York and Louisiana. Standard & Poor's, which uses a different nomenclature, rates California debt at A, the lowest of any state.
The third major bond-rating house, Fitch Ratings, has three states on its list for possible imminent downgrade: California, New Jersey and Wisconsin.
Analysts at Moody's and Standard & Poor's said this week that political instability caused by the recall movement was exacerbating the fiscal problem. Recall proponents say they have submitted nearly one million signatures to election officials and are continuing to gather more.
The bond analysts said Wall Street was growing increasingly worried about the state's ability to resolve its crisis and meet its debt obligations.
"The concern is that they'll take the easy way out by not cutting spending or increasing revenues enough to cover the shortfall and instead will borrow their way out of their problem and hope that economic growth will bail them out," said David G. Hitchcock, a state credit analyst at Standard & Poor's who has been following California finances for more than a decade.
"That would not be a good development from a credit perspective," Mr. Hitchcock said. "But it is a sovereign state and it is in their own hands."
He said that if the budget impasse lasted into August, the state might be unable to make payments to local governments and community colleges or meet other obligations. It has basically exhausted its ability to issue short-term notes and is operating on the proceeds of revenue-anticipation bonds issued in June.
But Mr. Hitchcock also expressed the belief that California's deep and diverse economy and progressive income tax structure would eventually pull the state out of its quagmire.
Phil Angelides, the California treasurer, said in a telephone interview that the warnings from the ratings agencies were a symptom of the state's problems, not the cause.
"Clearly what they're concerned about is the deep partisanship reflected in the recall movement and the budget stalemate, which are creating political paralysis with financial implications," said Mr. Angelides, a Democrat.
Mr. Angelides said that a one-notch downgrade would mean $400 million in additional interest costs on $24.6 billion of general obligation bonds that have been authorized but not issued over the 30-year life of the loans.
While governors and legislators across the country are struggling with the effects of the economic slowdown, the problem has not quite reached the proportions of the recession of the early 1990's, credit analysts say.
Since February 2001, when the high-technology bubble began to deflate, Moody's has downgraded eight states a total of 11 times, including California three times and Tennessee twice. In the recession of the early 1990's, Moody's downgraded nine states a total of 11 times.
Currently, Moody's has 15 states on a list with a negative outlook. Two of them, California and Michigan, are also on Moody's watch list, which means there could be a ratings downgrade within 90 days. Michigan has an Aaa rating, the highest possible.
Karl Jacob, a director in the state and local government group at Standard & Poor's, said the states' fiscal distress had been deeper and longer than anticipated. Tax revenues and others have not rebounded as quickly as state officials have hoped. Several states, including Massachusetts and Connecticut, were hurt by recently enacted tax reductions, further cutting into anticipated revenues and making it harder to balance their budgets.
But the problem has been moderated in part by reserves accumulated in the economic boom of the latter half of the past decade. The National Governors Association calculated that the states had total year-end balances of $49 billion in 2000.
California had $9.4 billion in reserves in June 2000, 18 months after Mr. Davis became governor, according to the State Department of Finance. It has none today.

HEADLINE: Midpoint Test Now Winnows CUNY Students 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Hundreds of students at the City University of New York are quietly being bounced out of college because they could not pass a test intended to gauge whether they have reading, writing and thinking skills appropriate for students halfway through college.
 CUNY started the test two years ago to demonstrate that it was not letting students steal through without mastering skills widely expected of college graduates. But the test -- sometimes referred to as a "rising junior exam" because it is usually taken by college students finishing their second year -- is only beginning to have bite. 
 To date, nearly 600 students have reached the point of ejection, while more than 28,000 have passed the test -- a three-hour exam involving reading and comprehension of serious academic-style articles, and which also requires a written essay.
Standardized testing has become part of the landscape in primary and secondary schools, but is much less prevalent in colleges. 
CUNY's move is one of the largest and most serious attempts by a university to vouch for the quality of its students and is a sign of how the trend is spreading at the college level. 
"Rising junior exams have become very politically popular," said Peter T. Ewell, a vice president at the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems, a nonprofit consulting firm in Boulder, Colo., that studies higher education policy. 
He said that Florida, South Dakota, Georgia and Arkansas were among the other states that had such exams, and that the California state college system -- including campuses like Cal State Fullerton and San Jose State -- requires that students pass a writing exam. 
At CUNY's four-year colleges, students will not be allowed to move beyond their sophomore year without passing the exam; its community college students will not be allowed to graduate, even if they have passed all their courses and met all other requirements. Students who fail three times must leave the university, but may retake the exam and re-enroll if they pass. 
It is too early to say whether the current 8 percent dismissal rate for students who have taken the test three times will hold steady as more students take the test. On many campuses, students have ignored notices to take the exam -- which counts as a failure -- but the number of test-takers has begun to grow as students realize that after September they will have no choice.
Dennis Paoli, coordinator of the Reading/Writing Center at Hunter College, said the passing rate could fall as more students sign up, since students who have been avoiding the test "may be the ones who will be the most problematic."
About 13,000 students took the exam in March. (CUNY has 179,000 undergraduates.) Of the 11,142 students who took the test for the first time in March, more than three-quarters passed. But the numbers ranged widely among campuses, from 90 percent at Baruch to 50 percent at Hostos Community College. So far, about 92 percent of CUNY students have passed the test within three attempts.
CUNY officials say that they are pleased with the results, and that the test illustrates their students' real achievements as well as the university's determination not to give diplomas to students it deems unqualified.
"This, to me, is tough love," said Matthew Goldstein, CUNY's chancellor. "This is not an easy exam. But the university has an obligation to make sure that our students write clearly and that they are good analytical thinkers. If they can't do that after so many attempts, they ought to be thinking about doing something else with their lives."
Despite the growing number of students failing the test, there has been remarkably little protest. College presidents say that few students have appealed for a fourth try. And many faculty members say the test itself is appropriate, although many dislike the idea that there is a test. 
"What does this say about the meaning of passing grades that students receive in their courses?" asked Anne Friedman, a professor of developmental skills at Borough of Manhattan Community College. "The assumption seems to be that our students may not be getting grades that they deserve and that our courses are watered down."
Some professors fear that the test will scare some students into enrolling at more costly private colleges. Others are concerned about the strain on resources if they have to provide extra help to thousands of students who fail.
"Think about if 20 percent of 60,000 students fail the test," Mr. Paoli, of Hunter, told a CUNY Faculty Senate meeting in February. 
Several student government leaders said that they welcomed the exam and had heard relatively few complaints from other students.
"The students I have spoken to say it gives them better confidence in their writing and comprehension," said Agnes M. Abraham, president of the student government at Medgar Evers College and the student representative on the CUNY board's academic affairs committee. "It's like a review of the things they have studied."
CUNY officials have talked on and off about imposing a mid-college exam since the 1970's. But it was not until 1997, when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and CUNY's own trustees attacked the value of a CUNY diploma, that the university moved to adopt the test. They asked for it immediately, but the process turned out to be neither quick nor easy.
While some other university systems, like South Dakota, use tests provided by the ACT program and other large testing companies, CUNY wantedto design its own exam. A faculty committee consulted with experts from the Educational Testing Service and ACT, surveyed other universities, polled its own faculty members, and then developed an exam.
"We wanted to create a test that required processing of text, critical thinking, and ability to write -- the kind of test you take in college," said Bonne August, an English professor at Kingsborough Community College and chairwoman of the faculty committee that designed the CUNY exam. 
The test that emerged has two parts. For one part, students are given a long article to read about two weeks before the exam. During the test, the students read a second, shorter passage and then respond to questions about both in an essay.
The second part of the test provides a short reading and data in two forms, like an informational table or a pie chart. The students are asked to assess how much the data do or do not support claims made in the reading. They can answer in a paragraph or in a list of points.
While CUNY's administrators set the final passing score, they ask faculty members to define what is an acceptable level of work. 
"What you are looking for is a minimum level of competence," Dr. August said. "You want the student who has enough skills to survive."
Louise Mirrer, CUNY's executive vice chancellor for academic affairs, who oversaw the exam's development, said the testing process was beginning to improve education at CUNY as colleges seek to ensure that their students can read and understand difficult texts and data. 
"This has been a very positive step for our students," she said. "They need these skills."
The university has started a writing program at all its colleges in which departments like biology and economics designate writing-intensive courses that will require extra writing from students. CUNY has provided 200 doctoral students who are writing experts to work with the regular professors and the students in those courses. 
Many campuses are also re-examining their curriculums. After the test was introduced at Borough of Manhattan Community College, for example, department chairmen met almost weekly with the dean for instruction, and also with the college's testing director, the head of student advising and other administrators. They discussed how best to prepare students for the test.
The college also held workshops -- "CUNY Proficiency Exam 101" -- to acquaint its faculty with the exam. It also offers special workshops to coach students just before the tests. 
Gail O. Mellow, president of La Guardia Community College, said that her faculty had found innovative ways to help its students. One English professor whose class was reading a novel about Vietnamese immigrants brought in a chart showing the change in such immigrants over time.
"She said she hated graphs," Dr. Mellow said, "but found that kind of thinking useful to prepare the students."
How long CUNY will continue the exam remains to be seen. CUNY spent about $391,000 this year, about a third of that on test development and the rest to pay ACT for scoring 21,298 tests -- about $12 per exam. The total sum will rise as the number of exam-takers rises.
Dr. Ewell, the testing expert in Colorado, said that some states, like New Jersey and Colorado, that tried using such exams to assess their colleges subsequently walked away.
"When they find how complicated and expensive it is, and how much ill will it generates," Dr. Ewell said, "sometimes they back off."

HEADLINE: Liberian President Again Says He Will Go 

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

DATELINE: ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast, July 4 

 BODY:
With pressure increasing for his departure, President Charles Taylor of Liberia promised again today to step aside but said he would leave his country only after peacekeepers arrived to prevent bedlam between warring factions.
 President Bush repeated his call for Mr. Taylor to leave for the sake of Liberia's future. Bush administration officials, who are weighing whether to send troops to Liberia, have called Mr. Taylor's exit a condition for restoring stability. 
 Mr. Bush, who is scheduled to begin his first presidential visit to Africa next week, today ordered military experts to assess whether American troops should be deployed to monitor a fragile cease-fire between Liberian government forces and rebel forces. Meanwhile, the Economic Community of West African States agreed today to dispatch up to 3,000 soldiers for the mission. Most of them will probably come from Nigeria, the regional powerhouse.
Should Mr. Taylor decide to leave, there remains the question of where he will go, given that he is accused of crimes against humanity in connection with a war in neighboring Sierra Leone. President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria has discussed the possibility of offering refuge to Mr. Taylor and is scheduled to go to Monrovia, the Liberian capital, on Sunday, government and diplomatic sources said. The Liberian foreign minister has already met with Mr. Obasanjo in Abuja, the Nigerian capital.
"The important thing here is for international peacekeepers to come to Liberia as quickly as possible to take charge of the situation if I am going to step down," Mr. Taylor told reporters outside the presidential residence, according to news agency reports from Monrovia. "The ball is in the international community's court."
A diplomat who is monitoring the situation interpreted Mr. Taylor's remarks as yet another bargaining effort. Mr. Taylor, he said, would step aside only if he had no other choice. 
"He will do it, but if the U.S. decides not to deploy, my best guess is that he will try to maneuver to stay in power," the diplomat said.
In 1985 Mr. Taylor escaped from a Massachusetts prison, where he had been held for 15 months on an extradition request filed by the Liberian government, which accused him of embezzling $1 million. He returned to Liberia and began a guerrilla war in 1989, finally assuming power in 1997. Three years ago his foes started a rebel movement to oust him. 
Last month the rebel faction from the north, the so-called Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy, made two violent bids to take the capital, killing several hundred people and displacing tens of thousands in overcrowded shanties there.
The rebel factions enjoy the support of neighboring Guinea and Ivory Coast, whose presidents have made no secret of their dislike of Mr. Taylor. Liberia's war has scattered arms, mercenaries and disorder across West Africa. Mr. Taylor is under United Nations penalties and is barred from selling diamonds, buying arms and traveling overseas.
Meanwhile, talks resumed this morning in nearby Accra, the capital of Ghana, to determine the shape of a transitional government before elections can be held. Whether Mr. Taylor's senior aides or rebel officials will be allowed to take part in the interim body remains a bone of contention. The British ambassador to the United Nations, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, on a Security Council delegation to West Africa this week, has already said that the rebels should stay out of negotiations. The Americans, who count Guinea as an ally, have remained silent on the subject.
The danger exists, should Mr. Taylor suddenly step down, of a power vacuum in Monrovia and elsewhere in the country. In his remarks to reporters today, Mr. Taylor said the situation could become "extremely chaotic" if he left. 
Mr. Taylor had promised early last month that he would step aside, but later he said he would serve out the rest of his term until January.
The archbishop of Monrovia, Michael Kpakala Francis, a critic of Mr. Taylor and of the rebels, called it practical and wise to have an international force sent in before Mr. Taylor's departure.
"If he steps down before troops come, you'll have a problem," the archbishop said. Asked if he believed Mr. Taylor's pledge this time, he added: "We have to believe. If we don't believe, what do we do?"
If and when he leaves his country, Mr. Taylor faces another problem: the war crimes tribunal in Sierra Leone. Its prosecutor has said he will not drop the 17-count indictment. Earlier this week, however, Sir Jeremy said that Nigeria, like Britain, had no law compelling it to extradite anyone to a war crimes tribunal.

HEADLINE: Afghanistan, the Forgotten Land 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Far from "hedging its bets," as Sarah Chayes writes in "Afghanistan's Future, Lost in the Shuffle" (Op-Ed, July 1), the United States as well as the United Nations has provided significant military, political and economic support to President Hamid Karzai, not the regional leaders Ms. 
Chayes describes as "warlords." Yet Mr. Karzai's government has grown weaker, and Taliban and Qaeda extremists have reorganized in Kandahar and other Pashtun strongholds. Moreover, Mr. Karzai has rejected the idea of electing local and regional leaders. 
 Ms. Chayes does not mention Afghanistan's fractured ethnic relations or diversity. Not seeing the brutality inflicted upon the non-Pashtun peoples is tantamount to seeing Yugoslavia through the eyes of the Serbs or South Africa through the eyes of the Afrikaners.

Seoul Warns Europe Not to Raise Tariffs on Hynix Chips

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, July 4 

 BODY:
The South Korean government warned the European Union today that it would appeal to the World Trade Organization if Europe decided to extend heavy tariffs against Hynix Semiconductor.
 The ministry of foreign affairs and trade said such action would be comparable to the appeal that it had already filed against the decision by the United States Commerce Department to impose a tariff of 44.71 percent on Hynix memory chips. Most members of the European Union favor a 34 percent tariff on Hynix chips, which would slightly increase a tariff already in place. 
 South Korean officials fear that the tariffs will force Hynix into bankruptcy proceedings and liquidation, a process that many foreign analysts think would be healthy for the semiconductor industry and the Korean economy but that Korean officials fear would precipitate more business failures.
The Commerce Department issued its tariff ruling in June based on a complaint by Micron Technology of Boise, Idaho, which surpassed Hynix two years ago as the world's second-leading manufacturer of memory chips after Samsung Electronics. Micron was rebuffed last year in an attempt to buy the plants that produce Hynix memory chips, and it contended that Hynix had cut into its sales in the United States because of large infusions of credit provided by government-controlled Korean banks.
Infineon Technologies of Germany, which is challenging Hynix for third place in the manufacturing of memory chips, has lodged much the same complaint with European authorities. Both Micron and Infineon contend that Hynix is responsible for driving the price of memory chips well below $4 each, the average cost that it takes to make one.
At the heart of the complaints by Micron and Infineon is the role of the Korea Exchange Bank, the lead creditor for Hynix, which now owes more than $6 billion after three major infusions of cash. Both the Korean government and the Korea Exchange Bank have insisted that the bank acted independently. The government, through the Bank of Korea and the government-owned Export-Import Bank, owns a controlling 36 percent stake in the bank.
The European Commission imposed a provisional tariff of 33 percent on Hynix chips in April and is expected to impose the full 34 percent tariff on Aug. 25 when it meets for its final decision. Among the European Union's 15 members, only France and the Netherlands have been reported to oppose the tariff, which would remain in effect for as long as five years.
The South Korean government, in battling the tariffs, stated its case in in a letter to Linnet F. Deily, the United States representative to the World Trade Organization in Geneva, Bloomberg News reported.
The letter, according to Bloomberg, said that the United States had "failed to demonstrate the existence of a financial contribution by the government of Korea."
That is an argument that Korean officials have made repeatedly. The last hope of reversal of the Commerce Department's ruling, short of a long appeals process before the World Trade Organization, rests with the United States International Trade Commission, which will review the decision on July 31.

 BANGKOK 8
By John Burdett.
318 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf.
$24.
 JOHN O'HARA'S "Butterfield 8" is a novel about a prostitute who wants to go straight -- but that's old news. John Burdett's quirky, talky and highly entertaining novel, "Bangkok 8," deals with what seems to be an entire city of prostitutes, and going straight is just about the last thing on anyone's mind. The setting is Thailand's clamorous capital two decades or so after the end of the Vietnam War. The characters include crooked cops from all ranks, a wide choice of prostitutes (both active and retired), respected (if not altogether honest) jade merchants, bemused agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation flown in from Washington, local drug dealers and a highly paid surgeon specializing in sex-change operations. And it all begins with a grotesque variation of an old-fashioned locked-room murder: an American Marine sergeant, driving his luxurious gray Mercedes while being trailed by two Thai detectives, is suddenly entangled in a swarming knot of snakes -- cobras and a python -- that kill him before the policemen can save him.
How was it done? Why was he driving that car and living in an expensive antique teak house that no ordinary marine could afford? Who was the woman in the car just before the attack? Why were the police even following him? It sounds like the promising beginning of what could turn out to be a better than average thriller. But thriller is not the right word for this novel. Toward the end, at just about the time when the pieces in a traditional mystery would begin to come together to produce a logical solution, the narrator confesses that this is not a whodunit, which should surprise no reader who has been paying attention. Anyone expecting to find a tidy trail of clues leading to a logical conclusion will end up as baffled as some of the book's F.B.I. agents.
What Burdett, a former lawyer who now lives in Hong Kong, is doing is seducing his readers into thinking not as logical Westerners devoted to the basic rule of cause and effect but as Thai Buddhists who accept and even celebrate life's illogical turns. The voice of Buddhism is the 32-year-old narrator, Detective Sonchai Jitpleecheep. Since the death of his partner, he seems to be universally regarded as the only surviving honest policeman in District 8, one of Bangkok's principal red-light districts, a place he calls the "essence" of the city, "its heart and its armpit." His partner, Pichai, was accidentally killed by one of the cobras trapped in the marine's Mercedes, and Sonchai has vowed to kill the man -- or woman -- who put them there. Sonchai and Pichai were born and raised in the whorehouses of Bangkok. Both of their mothers were prostitutes, enterprising country girls who had come to the city to cash in on the bordello boom created by the Vietnam War. A turning point in the boys' lives came when they were packed off to a Buddhist monastery to atone for killing a yaa baa (methedrine) dealer. After a grim year of meditation worthy of a prison sentence, the abbot ruled that karma demanded that they become policemen, uncorrupt policemen -- arhats -- and sent them to serve under his youngest brother, the enthusiastically corrupt commanding colonel of District 8. Deep in mourning after Pichai's death, Sonchai speaks of his love for his partner with a frankness unheard of in any of the gritty American television precincts.
There is nothing grim about the way Burdett presents Sonchai's mother and other Thai prostitutes. In a land with few opportunities for women, they have found a way to prosper and be independent. They are models of capitalism and free trade, entrepreneurs who, unlike the sullen Russian prostitutes in Bangkok, are not saddled with pimps. Indeed, the comic high point of this basically noir novel with a surprising number of comic turns comes when Sonchai's mother discovers Viagra, realizes its economic potential and makes plans to open a geriatric brothel called the Old Man's Club. Her business partner is her son's boss, the colonel.
Being an arhat is not Sonchai's only distinction. He is blond, with, as he describes himself, "straw-colored hair and sharp nose," genetic gifts of the mysterious American G.I. father he has never seen. As a result of visits abroad with his mother and her generous English-speaking lovers, he is also something of a linguist, the presentable "front man," that the Royal Thai Police showcase for sensitive dealings with foreigners. Which is another reason he is assigned to work with F.B.I. agents sent to investigate the marine's murder. His primary contact is Kimberley Jones, who becomes his Dr. Watson as they peel back layers of local corruption that rattle tea cups as far away as Washington. She may be an embodiment of the puzzled Westerner, but she is not above wearing a "So Many Men So Little Time" T-shirt when she goes on the town in District 8 with Sonchai.
They follow no tightly linked chain of clues that lead to an orderly conclusion without car chases (Bangkok traffic would not permit them) or shootouts. Although there are a few dramatic face-offs (including what might be called a bullwhip-in-a-china-shop confrontation set in a warehouse full of precious antiques), the solution finally comes not through deduction but meditation and a Buddhist sensitivity to the reincarnations of past lives. Everything is a red herring.
James M. Cain once recalled that when he went to Hollywood to become a screenwriter, the first thing he learned was that everyone in a 
B-picture talks "too smart." That is a problem with "Bangkok 8." Everyone talks too smart -- cops, doctors, prostitutes, homeless yaa baa dealers living under a bridge, a radio talk show host whose voice is overheard at irregular intervals throughout, even an honest, grieving detective sitting on the futon in his tiny windowless apartment. But all the smart talk does not diminish the overwhelming presence of the sprawling, chaotic, illogical city, with its jampacked bars and impassable streets, that invigorates this remarkable novel and makes it something to enjoy for its sheer bravado.

 AFTER JIHAD
America and the Struggle
for Islamic Democracy.
By Noah Feldman.
260 pp. New York:
Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $24.
 THE question bound to preoccupy readers of Noah Feldman's "After Jihad" -- the only reason most readers will pick it up in the first place -- is to learn what kind of future the author envisions for Iraq. 
The reason the answer matters, and that Feldman himself is suddenly so newsworthy, is that he has just been tapped by the Bush administration to help draft Iraq's new constitution. His selection stunned most observers: although Feldman is extremely accomplished and has a background in Islamic as well as United States constitutional law, he's very young (in his early 30's), was raised an Orthodox Jew and worked for Al Gore during the Florida vote recount. Nonetheless, he's already been to Baghdad and back.
For good or ill, however, this slight book doesn't reveal much about how Feldman plans to handle his new responsibilities. He devotes just a few pages to Iraq: it's only one of the many op-ed-length chapters that make up this somewhat disjointed work.
Feldman's project in "After Jihad" is to focus on a more general question: how can political Islam and democracy be reconciled? The answer matters, he writes, because Islamism is one of the few vibrant intellectual movements alive today in the Muslim (especially Arab) world. Repressive governments have found it much harder to shut down mosques than political parties. Canny clerics have tapped into widespread anger while providing much-needed social services that corrupt governments have failed to offer. As a result, political Islam now seems the only alternative to autocracy for many of the planet's 1.2 billion Muslims. Should elections be held in their countries, Islamists of one stripe or another could dominate. 
According to Feldman, however, such a result needn't worry us. On a theoretical level, he finds nothing irreconcilable between Islam and democracy, and argues that they actually have a lot in common. As "mobile ideas," both view everyone as equal; both are flexible (adaptable to different cultures and circumstances) and relatively simple.
True, Islamism's image may have been tarnished in the West by extremists. But that savagery was the work of a few fanatics. "Sept. 11, and the sporadic attacks which have followed," he writes, "are the last, desperate gasp of a tendency to violence that has lost most of its popular support." In contrast, Feldman points to reassuring counterexamples like the rise of moderate Islamic parties in Indonesia, Jordan, Morocco and Turkey, and to the writings of reformers like the Tunisian exile Rachid Ghannouchi to show that fusions of Islam and democracy are not only possible, but inevitable.
With these arguments,Feldman has thrown himself into the center of an unruly brawl now raging in policy circles over what to do with the Arab world. One faction consists of the cautious staff members of the State Department, pessimists (or "realists," as they prefer to be called) for whom culture is destiny and the Middle East an unredeemable mess. Another camp is represented by thinkers like Bernard Lewis and Fouad Ajami, who are almost as critical of Arab states as the pessimists but advocate a new American imperium to remake the region. Still a third faction includes scholars like Graham Fuller and John L. Esposito, who have so much faith in Arab reformers that they oppose outside interference. 
And now Feldman has staked out territory squarely in the middle. On the one hand, he joins with Lewis and company in pushing for America to intervene on the side of democracy. Feldman is unabashed about his support for Western activism: "If these methods sound interventionist," he writes at one point, "that is because they are." Such language makes him sound at times like one of Donald Rumsfeld's wild-eyed neoconservatives. Where he parts company with the right, however, is in his unflinching insistence that democracy in the Arab world should be Islamic in character (although he hedges on just what that will mean).
Eying this debate from the outside, how should a lay reader sort out the battling experts' radically different views? Feldman himself provides a kind of answer. Deciding whether to trust in Islamic democracy is a bit of a gamble, he admits. Push for open elections in the Arab world, and the short-term result may be radical, anti-American governments. But ignore the urge for democracy and the United States risks engendering an even bigger backlash. Besides, Arab dictators run the real danger of bloody overthrow. Thus, "in the starkest terms, the question is whether to entertain the risk of disaster in the form of a revolution that is not certain but would be extraordinarily costly, or to take on the less costly risk of destabilization that definitely accompanies a process of democratization."
This account gets far more right than it gets wrong; uncritical support for Arab dictators (including, at one time, Saddam Hussein) has indeed been a disastrous policy, and a betrayal of America's revolutionary democratic example. The main problem with the choice Feldman offers, however, is his presumption that moderation will ultimately prevail. For that to happen, we have to rely on the Islamists not to interfere with future elections once they themselves win office. Unfortunately, Islamists have proven unreliable protectors of pluralism: for example, the Ayatollah Khomeini's mullahs assembled a broad-based republican coalition to topple the shah in 1979 -- and then proceeded to undermine and eliminate every rival. Absolutists and fundamentalists tend not to be good compromisers.
As for Iraq, Feldman is now almost uniquely well positioned to help shape the rules of the game there. And one of the few things Feldman does promise for that country's future is that it will be Islamic as well as democratic. A few words of caution, however. Iraq's main fault lines are ethnic, tribal and sectarian. Feldman says very little about the role of economics, class or culture in the development of democracy -- factors that could play an even greater role than religion. Furthermore, Iraq is famously split between two very different forms of Islam: Shiite and Sunni (to say nothing of half a million Christians). How can Islam play anything more than a symbolic role in government when future voters cannot even agree on the definition of "Islamic"? Untangling that knot may prove impossible. Let's hope that in trying, Feldman doesn't overlook the solution that has worked pretty well in the West: a secular constitution that favors no one religion at all.

Had Enough Of the Flag Yet?

BYLINE:  By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
THE week before Independence Day, the Dixie Chicks played the Washington MCI Center, a mere dozen blocks or so from the White House. "Well, what do you know, Washington, D.C.," said the singer Natalie Maines, prompting a standing ovation from the crowd. "If I'm not mistaken, the president of the United States lives here." Then, as The Washington Post reported, the cheers grew even louder.
 As we conclude this Fourth of July weekend, let us not forget the happy denouement to the saga of Ms. Maines, whose crime against America was to tell a London audience in March that she was "ashamed that the president of the United States is from Texas." What followed were boycotts, death threats and a ritualistic network TV flogging in which, as Jim Lewis put it in Slate, Diane Sawyer demanded that the Chicks "affirm their patriotism and their support for the troops" in the "tradition of a Stalinist show trial." 
 No matter. The Dixie Chicks have been able to exercise free speech happily all the way to the bank. They've posed nude for the cover of Entertainment Weekly with "Saddam's Angels" emblazoned on their flesh. Their album "Home" rebounded from its brief dip, returning to No. 1 on the country chart for weeks. Their tour has sold out from its first stop, that left-wing stronghold Greenville, S.C. The Dixie Chicks may be bigger than ever. 
From national infamy to renewed superstardom in a matter of weeks: that's the kind of story that restores your faith in an America where everything is possible. And most Americans, the Dixie Chicks no doubt included, not only have that faith in their country but love it as well. Yet you'd never know it from the more embittered cultural battles that have raged since 9/11.
"Read 'Treason' this Fourth of July, and let the fireworks begin" commands the full-page ad hawking the latest book by Ann Coulter. In it the author claims that every liberal in the country -- or at least every liberal Democrat -- "hates America" and is guilty of her titular crime, which, last time I looked, is punishable by death. (The Dixie Chicks escaped her noose by turning traitor only after her book went to press.) According to her book jacket bio, Ms. Coulter's expertise in delivering such sweeping condemnations derives from having been "named one of the top 100 public intellectuals by federal judge Richard Posner in 2001." What she doesn't add -- and this is typical of her own intellectual methodology in "Treason" -- is that the list was compiled not on the basis of smarts but on the number of times names turned up in the media during the Clinton-hating heyday of 1995 to 2000. Mr. Posner's book was titled "Public Intellectuals: A Study of Decline" (my italics), and by its ranking system, Ms. Coulter turns out to be far less of an intellectual than such conspicuous traitors as Sidney Blumenthal, Susan Sontag and Gore Vidal.
At least she doesn't slap the flag on the front of her book to wrap herself in it. (She chose instead an idealized photo of something she loves more than Old Glory: herself.) The same cannot be said of Dick Morris and Sean Hannity, who use the Stars and Stripes as a merchandising tool for their own self-aggrandizingly patriotic screeds cashing in on their TV celebrity. In this, they follow the lead of their employer, the Fox News Channel, which, like its less successful cable rivals, has exploited the flag as a logo to sell itself as more patriotic than thou.
Such flag-waving for personal and corporate profit has gotten so out of hand that last month, when the House of Representatives passed a constitutional amendment banning flag desecration for the umpteenth time, I for once found myself rooting for the Senate to follow suit. It would be fun to watch TV executives hauled on to Court TV. If NBC's post-9/11 decision to slap the flag on screen in the shape of its trademarked peacock wasn't flag desecration, what is? 
As patriotism is the last refuge of scoundrels, so the coercive patriotism of this historical moment is the last refuge of cynics. In "The Story of American Freedom," the historian Eric Foner observes that a similar phenomenon occurred a little over a century ago, uncoincidentally enough, in tandem with "America's triumphant entry onto the world stage as an imperial power" during the Spanish-American War. It was in the 1890's that "rituals like the Pledge of Allegiance and the practice of standing for the playing of 'The Star-Spangled Banner' came into existence," as well as Flag Day. Our leaders were then professing to spread democracy to Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines with the same blithe self-assurance that our current leaders promise to bring the American way to Iraq and its neighbors.
The rituals we get to accompany our 21st-century imperial interlude include fights over the Pledge of Allegiance and a costumed president's re-enactment of Hollywood's "Top Gun." Most bizarre is the defense department's new Operation Tribute to Freedom, initiated on Memorial Day weekend, which offers talking points to those citizens too challenged to figure out for themselves how "to demonstrate public appreciation for American men and women in uniform." (One approved method: listing your name and "patriotic activities" on a government Web site.) When America's patriotism turns this "garrulous," as Alexis de Tocqueville once observed, it "wearies even those who are disposed to respect it."
But patriotism needn't make us so weary. Look around our culture, and it isn't hard to find a faith in America that is not defined by government-commissioned flag-waving, political demagoguery or cable news's jingoism-as-marketing-strategy. The most telling American fables don't come in the blacks and whites of our current strident political and cultural discourse, which so often divides Americans into either flag-draped heroes or abject traitors. The great American stories, from Huckleberry Finn's to the Dixie Chicks', have always been nuanced; they can have poetry and they can have dark shadows. They can combine a love of country with an implicit criticism of it.
One example this summer is the movie that could prove to be the redeeming Hollywood entertainment of this schlock-movie year: Gary Ross's adaptation of Laura Hillenbrand's "Seabiscuit," opening later this month. The title character, as almost everyone knows by now, is the misshapen race-horse-that-could of the 1930's that captivated the nation, becoming a bigger story than Hitler and F.D.R. on the eve of World War II.
The unlikely triumph of the horse, its jockey (Tobey Maguire in the film), its trainer (Chris Cooper) and its owner (Jeff Bridges) is right out of Horatio Alger, but as presented by Mr. Ross, the Depression background of economic injustice and deprivation is in the same sharp focus as the nail-biting foreground at Santa Anita. It's precisely this panoramic context that makes a classic American struggle against all odds all the more poignant. Not every American rooting for Seabiscuit, after all, got a piece of the purse. 
"Seabiscuit" could be a bookend to an unexpected film success that's been sweeping the country since late spring, the documentary "Spellbound," about eight young contestants in the National Spelling Bee of 1999. The kids it chronicles are almost a too-perfect American cross-section -- from a privileged child of the suburbs to the black daughter of a single mother in a D.C. housing project to (most stirringly) the daughter of non-English-speaking Mexican immigrants in the Texas Panhandle. The Bee is arguably as wacky as a Coney Island hot-dog-eating contest, and the parents who cheer the kids on can occasionally be as hard-driving as the appalling stage parents on Fox's insufferable weekly tots' talent contest, "American Juniors."
One such parent in "Spellbound" is an immigrant from India who drills his son tirelessly, prepping him on as many as 8,000 words a day in the family's beach house in San Clemente, Calif. "There is no way you can fail in this country," the father says while showing off the home he designed and built himself. "That's one guarantee in this country -- if you work hard, you'll make it." As the movie then demonstrates, that is far from the case. There are nine million children competing in the National Spelling Bee, most of them working hard, and, as in the races of "Seabiscuit," only one competitor comes in first.
As one of our best playwrights, Richard Greenberg, writes in another genuinely patriotic drama on tap this summer, the baseball play "Take Me Out," these all-American competitions reveal something about America that our current political debates avoid: "While conservatives tell you, leave things alone and no one will lose, and liberals tell you, interfere a lot and no one will lose, baseball says: Someone will lose . . . So that baseball achieves the tragic vision that democracy evades."
Even if their parents sometimes forget, the children in "Spellbound" understand this tragic vision implicitly, but are not defeated by it and do not deserve to be labeled un-American for recognizing it. Like Red Pollard, the washed-up jockey who makes good in "Seabiscuit," they will look for the second chances that America at its best affords those who lose the game.
Most Americans, whatever their age, don't need politicians or government boondoggles like Operation Tribute to Freedom or enforced flag-waving or fictionalized TV dramatizations of Jessica Lynch's rescue to tell them what it means to be an American. You see the wise, optimistic young citizens of "Spellbound," whether struggling or triumphant, and you see the whole package that is America, imperfect and heartbreaking as it sometimes is. That the Ann Coulters of 2003 look around our nation and see traitors everywhere is pathetic, but not so much so that they can spoil what we celebrate on the Fourth.

Currency Hedges: Thick With Obscurity

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
BECAUSE of the dollar's swoon, many investors may be attracted to foreign bond and stock funds for the extra returns a weaker dollar can provide.
 But policies on hedging foreign currency risk are not always clearly stated on mutual fund Web sites or in fund prospectuses. Investors can easily be confused about how much currency exposure they are carrying, even if they pay close attention. 
 "It is hard to make hard-and-fast distinctions between funds," said Lynn Russell, a mutual fund analyst at Morningstar Inc. who focuses on global bond funds. 
Through hedging, a fund manager turns at least some of the value of foreign bonds or stocks back into dollars, aiming to minimize the drain on a fund's performance from a rising dollar. As a result, when the dollar falls against the euro, a hedged portfolio of euro-denominated stocks does not reap the full benefits of the currency shift. By contrast, a portfolio of foreign stocks that is not hedged will benefit when the dollar weakens and will be hurt when the dollar gains.
"The risk profile of an unhedged fund is going to be a lot more volatile than a fully hedged fund," said Eric Jacobson, senior analyst and fixed-income editor at Morningstar.
Hedging, of course, can be complicated. Some funds compete against a benchmark index that is partially hedged back to dollars. A global fund, which can include bonds or stocks from the United States, is effectively partially hedged to the extent that it holds dollar-denominated assets.
In addition, some portfolio managers have recently dropped their hedges as the dollar's decline has stretched into its 18th month. And some managers say on their fund Web sites and in fund prospectuses that their portfolios are hedged, without explaining that they are actually heightening currency risk by making bets on currency moves in an effort to bolster returns.
For those reasons, investors may be unable to discern the policies of their funds easily. "For the ones that fall in between or change their policies, it is a lot harder to know where you are," Ms. Russell said.
At Putnam Investments, Paresh Upadhyaya, a currency analyst, is trying to raise returns in global and international funds by making currency bets that magnify the effects of foreign currency movements against the dollar.
Bill Kohli, managing director for core fixed-income at Putnam and portfolio manager of its Global Income Trust, said he used these currency recommendations to improve the performance of his fund against its benchmark, the Lehman Global Aggregate Index. The index is 41 percent invested in dollar assets, so it is effectively 41 percent hedged, limiting the benefits of a falling dollar.
Mr. Kohli has increased the fund's foreign-currency exposure based on Mr. Upadhyaya's advice. Currently, Mr. Upadhyaya is advocating positions that favor the Canadian and Australian dollars, as well as the British pound, and that underweight the Japanese yen. To control the amount of risk added to the fund, Mr. Kohli increased its currency exposure by half of Mr. Upadhyaya's recommendation.
These added currency plays have added 4.7 percentage points to the fund's return, bringing the total return to 8.9 percent through June, Mr. Kohli said.
"If investors want to diversify their returns and they think they are in an environment where the dollar might decline, this is a good way to try to add to their returns," Mr. Upadhyaya said.
This currency strategy, however, is not clear in the prospectus. And the fund description on the firm's Web site does not say that the fund's hedging strategies include adding or reducing currency exposure to increase returns. Only in the annual report dated October 2002 is there a reference to how "our euro currency positions performed well" because the fund was "overweight the euro."
Some funds are clearer about what they do. The Pimco Foreign Bond fund states on both the company Web site and in the prospectus that it hedges at least 75 percent of its foreign exposure back into dollars. Its return through June is 3.4 percent because it has missed most of the gains from the weaker dollar, which has fallen 8.9 percent against the euro, 2.7 percent against the British pound, 16.6 percent against the Australian dollar and 14.3 percent against the Canadian dollar.
The Pimco Global Bond II fund has about 29 percent of its assets in United States bonds and the remainder in foreign bonds. It also hedges at least 75 percent of its foreign exposure back into dollars, giving it a return through the second quarter of 3.8 percent. The Pimco Global Bond fund, however, leaves its foreign bond exposure unhedged and has returned 8.3 percent through the second quarter this year. But it is open only to institutional investors.
The BlackRock International Bond Portfolio switched from a hedged strategy to an unhedged strategy at the end of March. Its return in the first quarter this year was 2.1 percent, compared with 4.1 percent in the second quarter. But the fund's prospectus gives its managers considerable leeway in dealing with currency risk. They can make extra bets on currency, the way Putnam's managers can, and they could start hedging again if they chose to do so.
Anne Ackerley, the head of BlackRock's private client group, which includes mutual funds, said the fund had changed to the unhedged strategy because investors apparently preferred the currency exposure.
She said the fund was unlikely to go back to hedging. While the fund can make extra currency bets, she added, they would be no more than one to two percentage points above the exposure of the fund's benchmark. These possible refinements are not in the prospectus.
ANDREW CLARK, senior research analyst at Lipper, said an analysis of total returns indicated that funds investing in emerging-markets bonds have relatively little foreign currency risk because they usually own debt from developing countries that is denominated in dollars.
For funds investing in developed markets, he said, about half of the returns, on average, are apparently driven by currency movements. In general, that means that the funds would be about 50 percent hedged.
But it is hard for investors to know. "There really isn't a good answer in the prospectus," he said, "and that's sad."

A Burnout Cure That Few Companies Prescribe

BYLINE:  By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
LESTER E. BADDEN acknowledges that after two decades at Nike, working in a fast-paced job that includes arranging for shoe designers to view live dissections of human cadaver feet, he needed to catch his breath. So, two summers ago, Mr. Badden, a senior design manager at the company, took a brief sabbatical. It is a perk for employees who have been with the company for at least 10 years. 
 Under the program, Nike, based in Beaverton, Ore., grants eligible employees five weeks off, with full salary and benefits, to do just about anything they want. After they become eligible, workers can use the perk every five years. The program, intended to help prevent worker burnout, started in 1994, though Nike says it does not know how many employees have used it over all. 
 Mr. Badden, 56, said he had been eligible for the program since its inception but had always been too busy. He spent his sabbatical building a treehouse for his two young children and "fixing things around the house" in Portland, Ore., where he lives with his wife, Gerri, 49. 
As more workers across the country feel overworked, and often stressed, because of continuing job cuts in a sluggish economy, many would welcome such extra time to spend with their families or to rethink career goals. But paid sabbaticals, or leaves of absence with salary and benefits intact, remain rare in corporate America. Only 5 percent of employers offered them last year, according to a survey by the Society for Human Resource Management. 
Sabbaticals are used more today, though, than they were in the mid- to late 1990's, when they gained a toehold in the workplace. In 1997, only 3 percent of American employers offered paid leaves of absence, according to the group.
Jon Van Cleve, a consultant at Hewitt Associates, a human-resources consulting firm in Lincolnshire, Ill., said sabatticals are unlikely to become widespread anytime soon. He cited their cost to employers and the slimmer payrolls at many companies, which have made it difficult for employers to maintain productivity levels, he said.
At companies that offer paid sabbaticals, managers say the leaves give employees a way to recharge their mental batteries and to come back refreshed -- and often more productive. "We're looking for energy and creativity, and it's hard to be like that without rejuvenating," said Louise J. Rothman, a senior vice president for human resources at Charles Schwab in San Francisco. Schwab, which started its program in April 2000, gives employees four weeks' paid leave for every five years they have worked at the company; the leaves cannot be combined. Other companies that offer paid leaves of several weeks include American Century and the Frank Russell Company, two financial services businesses; the Time Inc. division of AOL Time Warner; and Genentech, the biotechnology company. 
More widespread are unpaid sabbaticals. Last year, 17 percent of American employers offered unpaid leaves, with benefits intact, according to the Society for Human Resource Management; the percentage was unchanged from 1998. Frank J. Scanlan, a spokesman for the group, said he did not expect that figure to rise anytime soon.
Corporate recruiters and benefits experts warn, however, that sabbaticals of any type can pose a threat to some workers' careers.
"If you're on sabbatical, someone has not only taken over your tasks, they've taken on your role," said Peter Capelli, a business professor at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. "Individuals don't want to be away from the chase that long because they may feel they'll be forgotten and they'll lose out on the race to the top."
Mr. Badden, the design manager from Nike, said he harbored no such worries. But others who have taken sabbaticals said that while they did not feel that their careers had suffered, they sensed an ambient unease among colleagues.
Bruce P. Flynn, an estate and trust lawyer for 15 years at the Seattle firm of Perkins Coie, said that "some lawyers have a concern that they may lose clients if they spend a protracted amount of time away from the office." Mr. Flynn, 56, said he had delayed his eight-week sabbatical for several years because of a heavy workload. When he finally decided to take a leave, at the urging of his wife, Mary Ann, he informed his clients well in advance. By adding a month of regular vacation to the leave, he was able to spend 12 weeks from January to April traveling through South America and then relaxing at his condominium in Scottsdale, Ariz. 
"Most of them were very pleased that I had the opportunity," he said of his clients. "And it's not a bad way to expose your clients to other competent people."
He said that he returned to work "totally refreshed" and that his clients were not upset by his absence.
BUT in a world awash in cellphones and e-mail, it can be difficult to unplug from the workplace and receive a sabbatical's intended benefit. "I didn't totally disconnect, and I always knew what was going on," Mr. Badden said.
Citing layoffs and restructurings, Alan Johnson, a managing director of Johnson Associates, a compensation consulting firm in New York, said that "in this economy, most people would be nervous about being away from their jobs for a couple of months."
Though an employee cannot be dismissed, of course, for taking a company-promoted leave, an employer may be within its legal rights if it undertakes broader layoffs during that time that result in the loss of that employee's job, said Patrick W. Shea, an employment law lawyer at the Stamford, Conn., office of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker.
Sometimes, employees may create their own sabbaticals and take their chances of having a job when they return. Although she did not qualify for her company's regular program, Amy J. Paulsen, 44, decided to leave her job as executive editor of Time's Teen People magazine about two years ago to sail around the world with her husband, Albert Nalle, a sculptor, and their two young daughters. The family financed the leave, from September 2001 to September 2002, by renting their New York apartment. Her job was filled by someone else, and she returned to a senior-level but short-term editing job at a sister publication, InStyle Specials magazine. She is now a part-time consultant for Teen People.
"I had no guarantee of a job when I came back," Ms. Paulsen said. "But we had made up our minds we were going to do this." She said she had hoped to land a senior-level, full-time magazine-editing job.
Some companies have used unpaid sabbaticals as a way to save money without resorting to layoffs. Last summer, Qwest Communications International, the telecommunications company based in Denver, offered employees a voluntary unpaid sabbatical, with benefits still intact, over July and August to reduce labor costs. 
In academia, sabbaticals have been common for decades as a way for scholars to undertake or complete time-consuming projects in their fields. In corporate America, paid sabbaticals were first offered by engineering and technology companies in the 1970's and 80's to help star employees avoid burnout. Many dot-com companies adopted them in the 1990's as a recruiting tool. These days, they are offered more often in industries like publishing, financial services and transportation, according to the Society for Human Resource Management. They are rarely offered by utilities or manufacturing companies, or by the government, the group's data shows. 
Statistics are hard to come by on the percentage of American workers who are eligible for paid sabbaticals who actually take them. But some employment experts suspect that relatively few eligible employees avail themselves of the opportunity. 
"The reality is that most people would find it hard to take time off," said Eileen P. Maraldo, vice president for benefits at Time Inc. "Most people would say they have a lot of work to do." 
Referring to the company's own sabbatical program, she added, "I can't say we promote it specifically or go out of our way to solicit people to take them." Time offers employees a six-month leave, at half salary, after 15 years of service, or a three-month leave, at 75 percent salary, after 20 years. Employees can take only one, not both, of the sabbaticals. Case by case, Time also permits longer, unpaid leaves like the one that Ms. Paulsen took.
ANECDOTAL evidence from various companies suggests that senior employees on the verge of retirement are more likely to take advantage of the programs. Of the 47 employees at Time who took leaves last year, 27 were retiring, Ms. Maraldo said.
Preparing to take a rest from the job often involves a lot of work. Most companies require employees to clear their plans with their supervisors and to make extensive arrangements with colleagues to cover their jobs, if necessary. "You can't just say, 'I'm out of here for six months.' You have to work it out with your manager," Ms. Maraldo said.
Sarah B. Renz, 39, a production services manager at American Century, based in Kansas City, Mo., said that before she went on a cruise to Tahiti in May 2001 as part of her four-week paid sabbatical, she made a list of all her meetings and responsibilities "and doled out work to different people on my team." American Century offers four weeks of paid leave after seven years of service, and another four weeks every five years thereafter.
Ms. Renz's boss, Diane D. Stanley, said co-workers did not resent her leave. "They know their time will come," she said.

Wondering If Office Market Has Plumbed Bottom

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
HALFWAY through the year -- which has been more or less awful for New Jersey's office real estate market, as was 2002 -- the question increasingly being asked concerns how much longer things will go on like this. 
 Fresh statistics on market activity in the second quarter of 2003 are not exactly encouraging: the overall office vacancy rate for both lease and sublease space dropped a fraction of a point, to 19.1 percent from 19.3 percent in the first quarter, according to Cushman & Wakefield. Insignia/ESG's numbers were slightly different, showing vacancies up to 19.9 percent from 18.6 percent. 
 In certain areas, the overall vacancy rate was much higher. According to Cushman & Wakefield, it was 30.9 percent in a small submarket in western Morris County and 36.1 percent in a 114-building market along Route 78 in Somerset County and in a 61-building market on the northern stretch of Route 287 in Middlesex County. 
Still, Sam Buckley, Insignia's senior managing director, said there were signs of "bottoming out" and he added, "It has to stop getting worse before it can get better."
Christopher Kinum, Cushman's senior managing director, talked of "the bleeding" stopping. And Jeff Schotz, executive managing officer for GVA Williams, said, "There is reason to think and hope that we are poised to return to a semblance of health."
These brokers, and a number of others, said that as the quarter ended, there had been an increase in the number of deals for office space and pointed to that as a positive sign -- even though this was not yet substantial enough to affect quarterly market statistics. "There is action, there is life," Mr. Schotz said. "There is reason for optimism -- if not real tangible signs."
In late June, Barnes & Noble leased 75,000 square feet at 300 Mountain View Boulevard, Basking Ridge, for its college bookstore division, for example. The move represents the bookseller's entry into the New Jersey office market, said Tom Reilly of CB Richard Ellis, who represented Barnes & Noble on the deal. In addition, he said, the company will be the first tenant for the 133,960-square-foot office building, which the Gale Company built on speculation and which has stood empty for two years.
Another leasing deal that closed as the quarter ended was Tyco International's seven-year sublease of 146,000 square feet of space that Merrill Lynch had leased after its offices weredestroyed in the Sept. 11 attack on Manhattan. Tyco, the troubled conglomerate that is based in Bermuda, plans to set up a United States headquarters in the space at the Commons at Princeton complex in West Windsor, relocating from several other offices in New York City, New Hampshire and elsewhere.
MR. BUCKLEY said there were only a few Class A sublease spaces left, "fewer than people might suspect." 
"Those are starting to be leased, and once they are, then the market for direct leasing of Class A space and build-to-suit office space, can really pick up," he said.
"Right now," said the Insignia executive, whose company represents both owners and tenants, "there is almost no way to compete head to head with Class A sublet space on price -- because the tenant has already taken the space and can't use it, so anything they make in terms of rent is gravy."
Brokers said much of the activity was being generated by companies that might logically be expected to do well despite difficult economic times, or even because of them: pharmaceutical companies, law firms, finance and mortgage companies, and real estate service concerns.
Also, brokers said, some large established companies can be expected to take advantage of low interest rates and asking prices that have been stubbornly slow to come down from the highs of 2000. I.B.M., for example, recently renewed and expanded its lease at Washington Plaza in Piscataway; it now occupies a total of 78,353 square feet, bringing the building at 1551 South Washington Avenue to full occupancy.
Sedgwick, Detert, Moran & Arnold, a law firm, recently relocated to 3 Gateway Center in Newark from offices at 1 Gateway. The firm sublet the entire 12th floor for its new office. Also, Accenture, the consulting firm, extended and expanded its lease to 66,436 square feet of space at 5-95 Spring Street in New Providence.
A drug company, Pliva Inc., formerly Sidmak Laboratories, has just signed a lease for almost half the 140,000-square-foot building at 72 Eagle Rock Avenue in East Hanover owned by the Reckson Associates Realty Corporation. And a broker with knowledge of the deal said that Dendrite International, a pharmaceutical software company, was set to sublease 220,000 feet of space in a Bedminster building that had been occupied by Pharmacia before it was taken over by Pfizer.
In May, a real estate company, Advance Realty Group, bought a three-story, 56,000-square-foot office building at 310 Madison Avenue in downtown Morristown from the Jersey City Power and Light Company.
"Some fairly large deals have been consummated," Mr. Schotz said last week, "and even more interesting, right now there are at least 17 deals where companies are looking for space in excess of 100,000 square feet in central and northern New Jersey."
Mark Yeager, president of the Gale Company, said a number of "high-profile requirements" -- requests to find space for well-known companies -- had emerged in recent weeks. He also noted a surge of activity in the Montville-Woodcliff Lake area, where Toys "R" Us, Sony and Merck are already in place. Like Mr. Schotz, Mr. Yeager would not name particular companies now seeking space in New Jersey, but he said, "In the last four weeks, we've had a diversity in requirements, various industry types, interested in different parts of the state, for traditional office space, flex space and build-to-suit. 
"That is different. I don't think things are necessarily better, but they are different. When it goes from really bad to different, that is the first step to better."
Several brokers referred to their feelings and hunches about how and when economic conditions might change.
Pointing to the Barnes & Noble lease, Mr. Buckley said, "This may be the summer of the big deal." Entering the traditionally slow summer months, "people are going to be making their best below-market deals," he said.
Insignia's second-quarter figures showed a continued drop in annual rental rates, showing the per-square-foot asking rate to be down to $25.15 from $25.44 in the first quarter and $25.74 in 2002.
Jonathan B. Schultz, chief executive of the Schultz Organization/TCN Worldwide, a property management firm, agreed that "more midsize companies are taking advantage of current conditions to do lease renewals or expansions." But he added that he did not expect any discernible improvement in the market for some time.
"Even if the economy has pretty much hit bottom, the large companies need time to figure out what they are doing -- whether any more layoffs will be made, whether consolidations or downsizing might still be necessary," he said. 
"My opinion is that we are six to 12 months away from a complete bottom. The bottom to me is just before interest rates start going up -- and they just lowered interest rates another quarter point."
Mr. Yeager predicted that it would be the end of the year before the office market began to revive. "We are not yet where we need to be in terms of economic recovery," he said. "We're still kind of scuttling along the bottom. It's just a guess when we start to go up."

Strategies For Bonds If Rates Head Up

BYLINE:  By JOHN KIMELMAN

 BODY:
BOND investors learn early on that bond values rise when interest rates fall. Indeed, during the tumble in rates over the last year, bond fund holders have benefited mightily. But the opposite also holds true: as interest rates rise, bond prices fall, and some professional bond investors are worried that this could happen in the next year.
 In the 12 months through June, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped to 3.52 percent from 4.83 percent, and yields of other government and corporate bonds of varying maturities also tumbled. In the same period, the average taxable bond fund had a total return of 11 percent, according to Morningstar Inc., while stock funds fell 0.4 percent, on average. 
 To stimulate the economy, the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates repeatedly, including a quarter-point cut in the federal funds rate late last month, so that rates are now hovering at their lowest levels in nearly five decades. Now, a growing number of bond investors worry that if a recovery takes hold -- fueled by sweeping federal tax cuts and low borrowing rates for consumers and businesses -- rates could turn around and begin to climb within the next year.
Rising interest rates would have an especially negative effect on the value of longer-term bonds, which are more sensitive than short-term bonds to interest rate moves.
An increase of one percentage point in interest rates could result in a 4 percent decline in the value of the Lehman Aggregate Bond index, a benchmark consisting of corporate and government bonds, according to Mark Kiesel, an executive vice president of Pimco, whose Total Return bond fund is the world's largest.
A basket of longer-maturity bonds could fall by more than double that amount.
"It would not surprise us if we have one of the worst bond markets on record in the next 12 to 18 months," said Robert Rodriguez, a principal at First Pacific Advisors and manager of the FPA New Income fund, one of the most successful bond funds of the last decade.
Even managers who are less bearish than Mr. Rodriguez accept the likelihood of rising rates and falling bond values in the next year or two. "Interest rate risk has moved up in terms of importance because rates are so low right now," said Mr. Kiesel, who helps oversee corporate bond strategy at Pimco.
The negative outlook raises a question: Should bond investors act now to protect their gains? Or should they just sit tight?
There is no consensus, but some bond fund managers recommend that investors, especially those heavily weighted in bonds with maturities of 10 years or more, reduce or eliminate their exposure to an inevitable upturn in rates. Investors could reduce their allocation to bonds and bond funds over all, or shift from funds with longer-maturity bonds to funds that buy only short-term ones.
Mutual fund companies like Fidelity Investments, the Vanguard Group and Pimco have portfolios that invest primarily in short-term or "low-duration" bonds. Investors in Pimco Total Return, with more than $75 billion in assets, may want to consider Pimco Low Duration, with $12 billion in assets. Though the low-duration fund has a yield that is half a point lower than that of Total Return, it also has less than half the interest rate risk.
For every one-point increase in interest rates, the price of a bond or bond fund will fall by its duration number in percentage terms. That means a bond or bond fund with a duration of 8 years -- considered fairly long -- would be likely to lose about 8 percent of its value if interest rates rose by one percentage point. That loss would double, to 16 percent, if interest rates rose two points. Conversely, any declines in interest rates would send bond prices up in the same way.
Low-duration bond funds tend to lose no more than 2 percent of their value because of a one-point uptick in rates.
In recent months, some managers have shortened their funds' duration to reduce their interest rate sensitivity. In the last three years, for example, Mr. Rodriguez has cut the duration of New Income portfolio to 1.3 years from 4 years, lowering its rate sensitivity by about two-thirds. A year ago, the fund had a duration of 2.5 years. 
Some fund managers argue that an investor should not move aggressively into lower-duration funds. That would be a form of market timing, they say, and generally counterproductive to long-term investment goals. They recommend staying with bond funds that have middle-of-the-road maturity and duration levels and to hold on through shifts in the interest rate cycle.
"For most people, the middle is where they should be," said Kevin Grant, a Fidelity vice president who manages several broad-based portfolios, including the Investment Grade Bond and Spartan Investment Grade Bond funds.
Trying to anticipate interest rate swings by changing duration bets is a loser's game, he said. People who play it, he added, could find themselves in the position of investors who miss a recovery in the stock market because they cash out.
"The biggest problem with market timing is, what if the market goes against you?" Mr. Grant said.
He said interest rates could remain low, or even fall further if an economic recovery did not materialize and inflation stayed near historic lows. Indeed, he said, high unemployment and the Fed's recent decision to lower rates are signs that the economic stimulus that would push up interest rates could still be a long way off. 
MR. GRANT recommends that investors stick with a good, broad-based, intermediate-term offering, and consider controlling interest rate risk through dollar-cost averaging. In that technique, the investor buys the same dollar amount of bonds every month or quarter, and ends up acquiring more bonds when yields or interest rates are high and fewer when yields are low.
"I think you need to be thinking about a 10- to 20-year minimum investment if you are going to use this approach," he said.
But in many circumstances, a shift in duration can make sense. For example, many investors use bonds for short-term needs, like income for retirement or a child's college education.
The Vanguard Group offers a wide array of no-load, short-term taxable and tax-exempt bond funds that can be used as alternatives or to complement its intermediate and long-term offerings. Portfolios include Short-Term Bond Index, which holds an assortment of corporate and government bonds, and more specialized offerings like Short-Term Corporate Bond and Short-Term Federal, which holds government and agency bonds.
"For investors with new money to put to work, we're advising not to chase yield and therefore not to buy long-term funds," said Robert Auwaerter, the head of fixed-income investing at Vanguard. "Instead, they should buy a combination of short- and intermediate-term bond funds."

How Much Does It Cost Not to Go To the Gym?

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
YOU belong to a health club but visit it only once or twice a month. Your wallet is filled with gift cards to Barnes & Noble and the Gap that you promise you will use soon. You exhausted your prepaid cellphone minutes last month and faced hefty charges when you continued to make calls, but you are sure it will not happen again.
 You are, in the words of a new research study, an overconfident consumer. 
 Such irrational confidence in one's own behavior is hardly new. The flight of Icarus, the voyage of the Titanic and the bull market of the 1920's all attest to the timelessness of human hubris.
But the day-to-day economic consequences of this hubris have rarely been as large as they are now. As the economy has become more sophisticated and simple cash is involved in fewer and fewer transactions, people must plan ahead far more than they once did. They need to choose a health care plan and to estimate whether they are spending more money on their credit cards than they are earning in salary. Among a myriad of payment plans for long-distance phone service, Internet access and gym membership, they must decide which ones will cost least. 
They -- we, that is -- rarely succeed, according to recent research by economists from Stanford to Harvard. The loss of income from these mistakes is quickly becoming significant for many households.
Health club memberships offer a particularly clear case study, probably because they offer two opportunities for excess optimism. First, people overestimate the number of times they will make the effort to get to the treadmill or the weight room. Then they congratulate themselves for seeming to save money by buying an expensive gym membership that rewards frequent visitors.
Stefano DellaVigna, an assistant professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley, and Ulrike Malmendier, an assistant professor of finance at Stanford, recently collected data at three health clubs in New England. Like many others, the clubs offer three basic membership plans. People can pay about $10 a visit, a monthly fee of about $70 or an annual fee of roughly $700.
Relatively few people pick the annual contract, leaving them with what seems like a fairly simple comparison. If they expect to go to the gym at least seven times a month -- or about twice a week -- the monthly package makes sense. Any less of a gym rat should pay $10 each visit.
This seems a good place to pause, set aside feelings of financial superiority and ask yourself how often you go to the gym. The answer for this overconfident consumer, who pays a flat monthly fee at his gym, is about once a week.
In the study, monthly members go about as often and, as a result, pay the equivalent of about $17 a visit. Only one in five members saved money by buying the monthly contract, the professors found when they studied the clubs' records. Over a six-month period, the average member would have saved more than $150 by paying for each visit. 
THE professors summarize their findings by quoting from one of the fictional diaries of Bridget Jones: "Monday 28 April. Gym visits 0, no. of gym visits so far this year 1, cost of gym membership per year $:370." 
Now extend this overconfidence across the consumer economy. People will spend more than $40 billion this year on retail gift cards, the plastic successors to gift certificates. That is up from about $13 billion five years ago, according to the consulting firm Bain & Company. A few pennies of every dollar on these cards will never be spent. Households will also rack up cellphone charges and credit-card interest fees because they made unrealistic assumptions about their own spending patterns.
Economists describe this as "time-inconsistent behavior." When the benefits of an action are far in the future and the costs are immediate, people do not give the benefits much weight. Tomorrow's buff body loses out to the dread of today's workout, and a reduced risk of cancer is obscured by the pleasure of a cigarette. When the costs are in the future and the benefits immediate, as when the purchase of a new BlackBerry requires only the flick of a credit card, the benefits eclipse the costs.
For Bally Total Fitness, Bank of America, Barnes & Noble and other companies, consumer overconfidence turns into millions of dollars of unexpected profits. For many households, it reduces income by hundreds of dollars a year. 
At a time when wages are barely keeping pace with inflation, a little humility might be a valuable thing.

Money Market Options Amid the Paltry Yields

BYLINE:  By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
YIELDS on nearly all money market funds have shriveled to fractions of 1 percent, so you might assume that it makes little difference which one you choose to stash sidelined capital safely. 
 But even small yields add up. A half-point of interest on $50,000, for example, is still $250 a year. Industry experts advise close scrutiny of money market funds for other factors as well -- including safety, convenience and fees. 
 "It's always important to choose wisely," particularly now that expenses take such a big bite out of gross yields, said Joel Friedman, director of fund services at Standard & Poor's. Moreover, he said, because money funds are actively managed and not insured, "there is credit risk."
Some funds are restricted to buying United States Treasury obligations. Others buy government-agency portfolios, while some venturesome prime funds can include commercial paper, which occasionally has defaulted. If a Treasury fund puts even 5 percent of its assets -- the legal maximum -- into other investments, it does not qualify for S.& P.'s highest rating, A-1m.
As the third quarter began, the Vanguard Admiral Treasury fund was the top-yielding fund, at just under 1 percent, largely because it holds expenses to 0.14 percent a year. The fund requires a minimum investment of $50,000.
"There is a wide degree of types" in this $2.1 trillion business, Mr. Friedman said, and they vary not only in quality but also in fund expenses and the average maturity of their portfolios. They also differ in services, like electronic bill-paying or the ability to write checks, and the ground rules for check services. 
Unlike savings accounts at banks, money funds are not federally insured, but the possibility that an investor will lose principal is considered extremely remote. Many fund sponsors, especially those whose expense charges approach 1 percent, are now waiving part of their fees rather than having their yields turn negative or, in industry parlance, "breaking the buck." By industry practice, yields vary with the market while maintaining investors' principal at $1 a share.
Fee waivers indicate how willing managers are to absorb costs to keep your principal whole. With about 4 percent of money fund assets now yielding one-quarter of 1 percent or less, according to iMoneyNet Inc., another rate cut by the Federal Reserve would put severe pressure on more managers. 
Maturities matter, too. A portfolio with an average maturity of several weeks will reflect changes in market rates faster than one whose holdings do not come due for many months. Be particularly wary of funds with high minimums that are intended for institutions, specialists say. Professional investors tend to bail out quickly when rates start to rise, possibly disrupting the portfolio.
And do not assume that the money fund into which your stockbroker sweeps sales proceeds and other cash will give you a favorable return. Various lawsuits contend that brokers have channeled clients' money into high-cost funds and received commission payments in return.
Finally, note that yields on tax-exempt money funds, about 15 percent of the market, are close to those on taxable ones. The tax-exempt funds' yield was 0.5 percent at the start of the third quarter, versus 0.58 percent for taxable funds.
"That's the attractive sector in the money fund business, one of the free lunches out there" these days, said Peter Crane, a vice president of iMoneyNet.
Advisers recommend against transferring money to a different money market account merely to get marginally higher rates or, worse, out of pique. Still, a well-considered shift to a fund that provides superior services and liquidity may be worthwhile.
"It always makes sense to shop," Mr. Crane said.

Tax Cut May Add New Meaning to Stock Buybacks

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
SOON, investors may have another indicator for gauging how a company sees its own prospects: share repurchases.
 Of course, share repurchases are not new. But because of recent legislation and the experience of the bursting bubble, they may be primed to achieve a new level of usefulness as a signal of a company's true value. 
 In principle, a company ought to buy back its own shares when doing so is the best use of its ready cash. By that criterion, no investment would offer a higher return to shareholders than simply reducing the number of outstanding shares in the company, and thereby increasing -- in a purely mechanical way -- the value of each share held by the public. A company's managers might be most likely to buy back shares if they believed the current price understated the true prospects for future earnings. 
"If you don't have great ideas, maybe the best thing you can do is to distribute this money to shareholders," said Josef Lakonishok, a finance professor at the University of Illinois who owns part of a money management firm. But, he added, for companies with low price-to-earnings ratios, "a repurchase conveys a very important signal, that maybe the price of the stock is cheap."
In the past, however, a flurry of repurchases in the market did not necessarily suggest that stocks were ready to rise. Because of high tax rates on money paid out as dividends, companies often seemed to use repurchases as a substitute for enriching shareholders. And as the bubble of the late 1990's ballooned, some companies engaged in repurchases like clockwork -- apparently, on occasion, as a way of preserving their shares' value while funneling millions of stock options to executives.
The basic motivation for repurchases -- the one most related to the company's earning potential -- was hard to spot.
But that may change. The latest tax cuts brought income tax rates for capital gains in line with those for dividends. As a result, the income an individual might realize from a buyback will no longer be taxed at a lower rate than dividends.
"Just from a pure taxation issue, maybe repurchases become a touch less attractive because you are not really penalized as much for paying dividends," Professor Lakonishok said.
A continuing shift in the way companies pay top executives -- away from stock options and toward stock held with restrictions -- may also remove some artifice from repurchases. A study in the mid-1990's by Christine M. Jolls, a law professor at Harvard, showed that all other things being equal, grants of options were more likely to be associated with share repurchases than were grants of restricted stock.
In addition, Professor Lakonishok said, fast-growing companies with high price-to-earnings ratios may have used repurchases simply to bolster their share prices as the stock market shot up in the late 1990's. Such gimmicks, he said, have probably receded.
Looking back at the market's tumble, many companies that set up regular buybacks in the heady 1990's might think better of them now, said Byron R. Wien, a senior investment strategist at Morgan Stanley.
These days, he said, "they're no longer doing it on an automatic basis."
Given these changes, are Wall Street's gurus ready to start focusing on repurchases?
"Probably, but not for sure," Mr. Wien said. "We've seen the tax legislation go through, but I don't think we've seen the ramifications of it."
He noted, however, that share repurchases spiked in March, when the stock market slipped to its lowest levels since October. Perhaps companies' decisions to buy back shares have become more sensitive to stock prices -- and less influenced by other factors -- after all.

Despite TheirName, Balanced Funds Can Teeter

BYLINE:  By GREGORY JORDAN

 BODY:
AFTER the market's seesaw pattern of recent years -- its climb in the late 1990's followed by a plunge in the last three years -- many investors would like to see some balance in their financial lives. 
 Why not just buy a balanced fund? Because, financial advisers say, many balanced funds can leave investors feeling as wobbly as the rest of the market. 
 Balanced funds hold 30 to 40 percent of their portfolios in bonds and 60 to 70 percent in stocks, but the type and quality of stocks and bonds vary widely from fund to fund. As a result, financial advisers increasingly say investors should give these funds more scrutiny than those in other categories. 
Jonathan Murray, senior vice president for investments at Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore, said, "From the late 90's through today, we continue to see very disparate returns among balanced funds." 
As a result, he said, prospective investors need to do more than the standard kick of a fund's tires for manager tenure and historical returns. "With balanced funds you have to factor in interest rate movements and the manager's ability to shift between different stock and bond allocations," he said. "There are many more moving parts under the hood than in the typical mutual fund."
"The last bull market really jumbled this category," Mr. Murray said. " 'Balanced' is too often a misnomer, and this is the fund category that is most vulnerable to misrepresentation and confusion."
Traditionally, he said, the funds devoted most of their equity holdings to large-capitalization value stocks and most of their fixed-income holdings to short- and intermediate-term Treasury issues. The category was considered a one-stop shop: because the funds were conservative and diversified, advisers recommended them to young investors, who had limited capital, and to retirees, who liked their relative safety.
But in recent years, some balanced funds have become much more aggressive than the traditional model. For example, the category's leader this year, Green Century Balanced, up 34.2 percent through the second quarter, has 70 percent of its portfolio in stocks, primarily small-capitalization growth stocks, and 30 percent in bonds, mostly junk bonds. It invests only in companies that it believes are committed to environmental improvement.
"We are fairly high in non-investment-grade bonds," said the fund's manager, Jackson W. Robinson. "We don't own Treasuries because the biggest polluter in the world is the U.S. government. There are some wonderful green companies whose debt has junk status, but we are looking at companies where the credit situation will improve. Being a balanced fund has nothing to do with the nature of your equity or debt portfolios."
Other funds near the top of the list for the second quarter of 2003 were Scudder Flag Value Builder, up 21.2 percent; Dean Balanced, up 17.8 percent; and Eaton Vance Balanced, up 16.2 percent. But in 2002, Green Century lost 37.1 percent, and the others lost 18.9 percent, 27.4 percent and 14.7 percent, respectively.
Over the last five years through June, the leaders include Oakmark Equity and Income, up 11.2 percent, annualized, and Dodge & Cox Balanced, up 8.5 percent. Among the losers over that time were Atlas Balanced, down 5.8 percent, annualized, and CDC Nvest Balanced, down 4.5 percent.
Mr. Murray prefers to look at 10-year performance, and to study periods within the 10 years, but some balanced funds have not been around that long. 
Mr. Murray said that for investors who have sufficiently examined the role a balanced fund could play in their portfolios, the research department at Legg Mason recommended Dodge & Cox Balanced, which returned 12.3 percent for the second quarter and has a 10-year annualized return of 11.8 percent; American Balanced, up 12.8 percent for the quarter and 10.5 percent for 10 years, annualized; and MFS Total Return, with 9.8 percent for the quarter and 9.4 percent for 10 years, annualized. 
Advisers say Dodge & Cox Balanced typifies the traditional balanced fund. 
"Our basic goal is to preserve and enhance capital," said John Gunn, president and chief investment officer at Dodge & Cox. "Our typical investor should be someone who is more comfortable with a narrower range of returns over time. Both the fixed income and the equities have a long-term time horizon and low turnover. Basically we think it is a good fund for anyone who doesn't want the potentially wide swings of a straight equity portfolio."
That pleases Dr. Gerry Feldman, 61, a gynecologist, of Pikesville, Md. "I'm very conservative; I don't want upswings and downswings," he said. "This balanced fund just smooths everything out. I am aware that some of these balanced funds aren't really balanced, and I weeded those out."
Some advisers argue that the weeding burden should not be on the investor, and they contend that balanced funds should shun riskier stocks and debt altogether. Erika Safran, principal at the Financial Asset Management Corporation in Manhattan, called some of the riskier balanced funds "ridiculous for investors." 
"It is important to realize how misleading this category can be and how educated investors have to be," Ms. Safran said. "You can't just go and buy a balanced fund. Why is a balanced fund like Green Century up over 30 percent? Because it primarily has a small-cap-growth allocation. There is nothing conservative or balanced about it. Ten years ago, a balanced fund was a balanced fund." But today, she said, balanced funds will not necessarily give conservative investors one-stop shopping.
Ms. Safran recommends Vanguard Wellington, up 12.6 percent for the quarter and 10.5 percent for 10 years, annualized; Oakmark Equity Income, up 13.2 percent for the quarter and 11.2 percent for five years, annualized; and Dodge & Cox Balanced.
EVEN though advisers see the category as confusing, it has been popular with investors. According to Lipper, the fund research company, some 210 funds have balance as their objective. Inflows into balanced funds for the second quarter totaled $5.90 billion, according to AMG Data Services, up 28.1 percent from the comparable period last year.
Morningstar Inc. recently tried to help investors by creating two new categories, moderate allocation and conservative allocation. "We were noticing that asset mix was really having a great effect on returns," said Josie Raney, a Morningstar fund analyst. Most funds that use the name "balanced" were previously categorized as domestic hybrid by Morningstar but now fall into the new moderate-allocation category. Lipper, however, retains "balanced" as a category name. Morningstar's conservative-allocation category holds income-oriented funds with sizable bond holdings.
Still, advisers say, investors need to study a potential holding in detail before investing because some funds are more aggressive than any of these labels implies.
One way to pare down the choices, Ms. Raney said, is to go to Morningstar.com, which has many interactive tools for screening funds. One important tool gives an analysis with nine investment subdivisions.
"The new categories aren't designed to be the be-all, end-all of fund appraisal," she said. "But they do try to strike the right balance between differentiating between asset allocations while still providing sizable peer groups for judging performance."

(Don Hogan Charles/The New York Times) Chart: "Not So Steady"Their name is reassuring, but some balanced funds have produced volatile returns.

Bear Market Legacy: More Investors Who Shun Risk

BYLINE:  By ERIC BAUM

 BODY:
AFTER years of stock-market losses, investors have flocked to conservative mutual funds, even though they were not initially rewarded for their prudence, according to a new study by Lipper, the financial research company.
 Lipper found that, in a down market, investors were attracted to funds that had minimal monthly losses, and not necessarily to the best-performing funds over all. 
 The company measured funds' month-to-month losses from September 2001 to March of this year. The funds that had the smallest total losses received the highest rankings for capital preservation, indicating that they are more conservative. Positive returns were not considered; that way, steady performers received higher ratings than funds that balanced big losses with gains. 
For the first several months of the study, Lipper found that the funds with the best ratings for capital preservation generally did not have the best total returns. It wasn't until the first quarter of 2003 that the rankings for capital preservation and total return had converged, the study found.
Nevertheless, throughout the 18-month period, investors preferred to buy the most conservative funds. The funds that ranked in the top 20 percent for capital preservation, a total of 743 funds, had a net inflow of more than $80 billion. Over all, there was a negative outflow of $29.4 billion from stock funds for the period; that means investors pulled $109.4 billion out of all the remaining stock funds, according to the study, which was released late last month. It can be read at www.lipperweb.com/usa/products/studies.shtml#Risk. 
"Over the past year and a half, the 20 percent of stock funds with the best risk ratings accounted for all of the new investments into stock funds," said Sean McLaughlin, a spokesman for Lipper, referring to the ratings for capital preservation. "People pulled more money out of the rest of the funds than they added, and despite a terrible market they continued to add more money to lower-risk funds." 
Buying relatively conservative stock funds allowed some investors to sleep at night during the bear market. Donald Riskind, a retired executive in Evanston, Ill., added more than $50,000 to his stake in Tweedy, Browne Global Value fund, one of the top-ranked funds for capital preservation, or lower risk, in November 2001. The fund lost 4.7 percent of its value in 2001, but that was still 16.8 percentage points better than its peers among foreign stock funds. In 2002, it lost 12.1 percent, which was four points better, according to Morningstar Inc. 
"It's our feeling that you can't get out of the market and go only into bonds," Mr. Riskind said.
Funds ranked high for capital preservation can be found in many investment categories. These include CGM Realty, a real estate fund, which earned 16.46 percent for the 18-month period, and was up 36.13 percent in the second quarter; FBR Small Cap Financial A, a financial services fund, which was up 25.67 percent in those 18 months, and was up 11.72 percent in the second quarter; and Pimco's NFJ Small Cap Value A, which returned 11.78 percent in those 18 months and 15.27 percent in the second quarter.
Some funds that were ranked among the best for capital preservation in 2000 have since produced lackluster results. For example, Liberty Utilities A, a midcap value fund, lost 46.84 percent during the study period and underperformed its category average by 20.30 percentage points. For the second quarter, the fund gained 18.35 percent. Also, AmSouth Value, a large-cap fund, fell by 29.40 percent and underperformed its peers by 3.77 points in the the study period. It gained 18.36 percent in the second quarter.
Mr. Riskind's financial adviser, Joseph Taiber, a senior consultant at DiMeo Schneider & Associates in Chicago, warned that funds that lose relatively little money in a down market may not excel when stocks rise. "If you look at a manager that typically captures 85 percent of a down market, they often fall short of capturing 100 percent of an up market," Mr. Taiber said. "Investors are flocking to exceptional down-market performers, but they're typically better off finding appropriate funds and sticking with them."
MARTIN VOSTRY, an analyst at Lipper who is the author of the study, said value funds were historically better than growth funds at capital preservation, but there were exceptions in the period. The Baron fund, a small-cap growth fund, was highly ranked for capital preservation and attracted new money when other growth funds did not, Mr. Vostry said. Value funds, as defined by Lipper, buy discounted stocks and are typically more conservative than growth funds, which seek companies with big earnings potential.
Mutual fund companies known for growth investing, like Putnam Investments, Janus Capital Management and AIM Investment Management, lost more assets during the bear market than competitors specializing in value investing. Many value-oriented funds offered by American Funds, Franklin Templeton Investments and Evergreen Investments that were often overlooked during the market bubble have attracted investors since the market's downturn.
Howard Present, director of global product management at Evergreen, predicted that investors who recently lost money in aggressive funds -- a group he calls the "perma burned" -- will stay with their newly acquired moderate investing habits. 
"Will there be a larger market for the firms that have an aggressive understanding of risk in a bull market?" he said. "Our answer is yes."

A National Stage for Puff Pastry and Duck Jerky

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE HAMLIN

 BODY:
CHOCOLATE was clearly the front-runner, but wasabi, cheese, citrus flavors and beverages made of tea and fruit were not far behind last weekend at the 47th annual Summer Fancy Food Show, the nation's largest showcase of specialty foods.
 Over three days, 2,300 exhibitors showed off both domestic and imported products to 24,000 people at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan. Retailers who were considering adding the new foods had to sample them on the spot, however, because only marketing material, not food, could be removed from the building. 
 Specialty foods represent $25 billion in annual sales, according to the National Association for the Specialty Food Trade. And the business is growing. "We're now projecting a steady 4 to 6 percent rise in sales every year for the next five years," said Ron Tanner, vice president for communications and education at the trade group, which sponsors the show. The group had 350 members 20 years ago; it has 2,100 now. 
Retailers and producers attribute the increase in sales to increasingly sophisticated, quality-conscious consumers, concerned about food sources and drawn to organic and additive-free foods. Even in a sluggish economy, there is still power in the "treat factor" -- the ability of shoppers to treat themselves to, say, a $16 pound of premium coffee or a $3 bag of four cookies made of natural ingredients.
The strongest sales, he said, are on the West Coast and in New England and the Middle Atlantic states.
For owners of small businesses, participation in the show is a significant investment, but many said it was important, because it can bring the exposure that makes the difference between profit and loss. The cost of a booth is about $3,000, but lodging, transportation and shipping can raise the expense of participating for three days to $10,000 to $12,000, Mr. Tanner said.
Several producers said their business had increased 30 percent to 40 percent after an appearance at the show. Orders might not come on the spot, but they tend to trickle in for months afterward, exhibitors said.
"It's important to be here, no matter how established you are," said Trish Karter, who owns the Dancing Deer Baking Company in Boston. "It's a chance to really meet and talk to customers, to show them what's new, to hear what's doing well and what's not. Anybody can bake a great cookie; it's everything else that's the hard stuff." 
The company, which started with a single type of molasses cookie, had $4 million in sales last year.
Ms. Karter, working at her booth at the Javits Center, listed some of the challenges that face a small company: "packaging, marketing, production, developing recipes, being flexible enough to fill retailers' demands -- like creating a baking mix in four days -- and just understanding a very complex retail market."
"Only the tough survive," she said.
IN 1994, Ms. Karter, who has an M.B.A., and her husband at the time, a business analyst, invested in a small wholesale Boston bakery. Shortly thereafter, they produced their first retail product, a small line of packaged cookies. They were soon contacted by a buyer for Williams-Sonoma, the national cookware shop and catalog retailer that was beginning to sell packaged food in its retail stores. 
Ms. Karter quickly applied "everything I learned in business school and then some" to pay invoices, add staff and still maintain quality.
For retailers, the show is a way to gain exposure to a wide range of products. "I consider this an extraordinary learning experience," said David Levine, owner of A Touch of Italy, a specialty-food shop in Fort Myers, Fla.
Standing in front of a table filled with artisanal cheese from Italy, Mr. Levine said he was learning as fast as he was tasting, gathering "information that my customers really want to know, and expect to learn."
All retailers can turn into customers. But for the small specialty-food producers, attention from a big national retailers -- like Williams-Sonoma or the Whole Foods Market, or from one of the smaller regional chains like Central Markets in Texas, Straub's in Missouri and Wegman's on the East Coast -- is the equivalent of being a finalist on "American Idol."
If a big company or chain likes a product it sees, it will often suggest reformulations or even new ideas. In the case of Dancing Deer, Williams-Sonoma wanted a gingerbread mix, and fast.
"In four days we created it from scratch, and although we didn't know it then, beat out a lot of competition," Ms. Karter said.
Nina Robertson, the owner of Good Wives Inc. in Lynn, Mass., said that getting orders from Central Markets and Straub's allowed her business, previously a food service company for institutions, to become a successful specialty-food company. In the food show's awards competition last week, she had a winner. Her Good Wives Seafood Thermidor Puff Pastries, which are frozen, handmade cocktail pastries, won in the snack food or hors d'oeuvre category.
Laura Logan, the owner of Austin Special Foods Company in Austin, Tex., said that just one of these star merchants can make a product line succeed. Ms. Logan, whose Chipotle Double Fudge Chunk Cookie was a winner last week in the cookie and cracker category, said that it was only two years ago that she "no longer had to call my brother for money" for her company, which she started eight years ago in her home. 
But money is still tight; she had to accept the cookie award in absentia, she said, because she could not afford a booth at the show this year. "I was there last year and it was terrific," she said, "but I was subsidized by the State of Texas," which, like some other states, had a pavilion at the show.
RETAILERS said the selection this year was especially impressive, noting the cheeses from both the United States and Europe. 
"Pretty amazing, huh?", said Ari Weinzweig, an owner of Zingerman's, a food store and mail-order retailer in Ann Arbor, Mich. Mr. Weinzweig, who travels extensively and imports many of his artisanal products directly, has come to the show since 1984.
He said there had been big changes in packaging, which is less gimmicky than before, and in the variety and quality of the products.
"It used to take years for producers to catch up with a very small buying audience," he said. "Now, because of really smart consumers, and lots of them, the pace has gotten so quick it's about six months between great product and buying public."
Consumers are finding specialty foods at a much larger range of stores, said Mr. Tanner, of the specialty-food trade association. The products are now sold on Web sites and in gift stores, juice bars, coffee shops, department stores, discounters and household stores like Bed Bath & Beyond. Hardware stores are selling condiments with their barbecue grills. Even Victoria's Secret, he said, is selling specialty foods.
So what can consumers expect to find starting this fall in the specialty-foods category? The list may include wasabi and ginger, often together (two products, combining both ingredients, won food show awards) as well as rich, combined pure fruit juices; a multitude of bottled waters with "nutrients added"; and low-carbohydrate snacks like duck jerky. Shoppers may also see multitudes of new cookies, salsas, Asian condiments and organic products.
There will also be chocolate, in vast amounts and forms. On its way for the holiday season is a chocolate voodoo doll from the Chocoholics Divine Desserts Company in Stockton, Calif. The product is meant to be assigned a persona and then eaten, head first.

HEADLINE: Mutal Funds Report; 
At Last, a Quarter When It's Safe to Look

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
THE stock market ended June with its best quarterly gain since the end of 1998, but the historical comparisons for mutual funds were even more impressive.
 With the exception of one fund group -- bear funds, which bet that stock prices will fall -- every category tracked by Morningstar Inc. and Lipper posted double-digit gains in the second quarter. 
 "This is the first time that has happened since the first quarter of 1987, where funds were up this much, this broadly," said Martin Vostry, a research analyst at Lipper. 
On average, diversified domestic equity funds rose 16.1 percent in the quarter, according to Morningstar. Funds specializing in technology and communications rose more than 24 percent, and international funds gained 18.9 percent. And the continued decline in interest rates helped bond funds post positive returns. 
Analysts cited a variety of factors for the improved performance of domestic stock mutual funds, including the quick end to major fighting in Iraq, a reduction in taxes and a cut in interest rates. Many investors believed that stock prices had simply fallen to very low levels.
"The rebound is simply about the fact that stuff got reasonably cheap after a bear market unwinding the excess," said Russel Kinnel, director of fund research at Morningstar. "It all gets back to valuations." 
Low interest rates allowed many companies that were formerly investment grade to refinance debt and bolster their share prices. At the $700 million Fidelity Leveraged Company Stock fund, David Glancy, the manager, posted a gain of more than 50 percent in the quarter by investing in companies rated BBB+ or lower. 
"These companies are doing what the consumer has been doing: cutting debt service cost," Mr. Glancy said. "As their problems start to ebb a little bit, that is when you get big moves in the stock price." 
As an example, he pointed to the AES Corporation, the independent power producer based in Arlington, Va., which is one of his fund's biggest holdings. Over the first six months of the year, AES not only refinanced a large portion of its outstanding debt, but last month it also raised equity in the stock market. At the end of the fourth quarter last year, he said, some AES bonds were trading at 45 cents on the dollar and its stock was trading at 70 cents a share. "Six months later, the debt is trading at par, or $1, and the stock is at $6," he said. 
Inflows into stock funds accelerated as the quarter progressed, said Robert Adler, president of AMG Data Services. But inflows into bond funds remained heavy, he said, though they began to ease as the quarter unfolded.
The high-yield bond market rallied sharply, bolstered by investors' strong demand for higher returns. 
The Vanguard Group, the big mutual fund company, became so concerned about the size of the inflows into its $9 billion High Yield Corporate bond fund that last month it closed it to new investors. 
"We have taken in a little under $1.5 billion into the fund this year, and that is a rather extraordinary amount for that fund," said Gus Sauter, Vanguard's chief investment officer. "But it wasn't until credit spreads between investment grade and high yield started to narrow and high-yield bonds started to take off that we saw a flow of cash. It had the symptoms of a mania." 
According to Mr. Adler at AMG, about $10 billion in new money went into high-yield funds in the quarter, bringing the total for the first half of the year to about $21 billion. That is much more than the $11.7 billion that went into high-yield funds for all of last year and ahead of the record 12-month total of $17.9 billion for 1997.
Bond funds of all stripes did well in the second quarter, because of the continued fall in interest rates, but high-yield funds fared best, posting an average return of nearly 9 percent, according to Morningstar data. 
Those gains were impressive for bond funds, but they pale compared with the performance of some riskier segments of the domestic and global stock markets. 
In the United States, technology and telecommunications funds, which had been battered, were two of the best performers. Both gained more than 24 percent. Funds investing in biotechnology stocks, a sector in which only a handful of companies are now profitable, rose more than 18 percent, according to Lipper. 
The strong performance in technology resulted from a "mixture of improving sentiment and improving fundamentals," said Kevin Landis, the chief investment officer at Firsthand Funds, which specializes in technology stocks.
"Over the next few months, we will be able to look back and see if it was a little bit of one and a lot of the other," Mr. Landis said. "If it turns out the fundamentals really do suport it, then there is room for sentiment to continue improving." 
Returns on foreign stock funds were also impressive. 
Largely because of the performance of the South Korean stock market, emerging-markets stock funds rose more than 23 percent, according to Morningstar. Latin American stock funds were up more than 21 percent. Even funds focusing on Japan, which has been in a decade-long slump, scored a double-digit gain, rising nearly 14 percent. 
Given the widespread gains in the stock market, bear market funds had big losses, dropping an average of 18.9 percent for the quarter, according to Morningstar. Not everyone, though, is counting out the bears for the next quarter.
After all, there have been confident predictions about second-half recoveries the last three years. And current economic indicators are not entirely reassuring.
"Other than the stock market going up, not many leading indicators have shown much to suggest a pickup in the second half," said Mr. Vostry at Lipper. "There is a huge amount of stimulus that in just about any other economic time would be truly inflationary. Whether this works remains to be seen." 
Tom McManus, chief investment strategist at Banc of America Securities, is optimistic about the market's prospects. What happened in the second quarter is merely the "appetizer" in the current run, he said. 
"The next course is the main course, and that is when business starts to get better and earnings start to improve," he said. 
THOMAS F. MARSICO, head of Marsico Funds, with $21 billion under management, said earnings for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index should be about $52 a share this year, and $61 next year. 
"With interest rates staying at around 4 percent, we think the stock market could trade at 20 to 22 times earnings," he said. "That could put the S.& P. 500 in the 1,200-to-1,300 range over the next 18 months." It ended the quarter below 1,000.
Robert Hagstrom, manager of the Legg Mason Focus Trust, which was up more than 30 percent for the quarter, said the market's prospects rested almost entirely on the economy.
"If the data is weak, my guess is that stocks will have a very modest return from here," he said. "If the data show increasing demand, then we have a good chance of good performance."

HEADLINE: Italy's Designer Outlet Mall Drains Its Cities of Shoppers 

BYLINE:  By GUY TREBAY

DATELINE: SERRAVALLE SCRIVIA, Italy 

 BODY:
THE name of the mall was carried along in whispers at the men's wear shows in Milan two weeks ago, written on scraps of paper, covertly passed from one fashion editor to another -- from Vicky McGarry of Men's Journal to Michael Nash of Vibe to Stefano Tonchi of Esquire. It was almost as if this outlet mall, McArthurGlen Serravalle, set in the middle of the Italian countryside, had developed the cachet of a hot Los Angeles club, the kind of place so inside you have to know someone who knows someone to find it. 
 And the mall itself has a vaguely unreal dimension: it is a hilltop mirage floating on the landscape two minutes from the autostrada in an agricultural no-place, in the center of an imaginary triangle formed by Genoa, Turin and Milan. Not long ago, grapes and grain were the mainstays of this sleepy town in the Piedmont. Now its future is banked on less essential commodities, ones for which consumers have an insatiable appetite: premium brands. 
 Serravalle is Italy's first designer outlet center. Until fairly recently, the country thatsome historians say invented commercial capitalism in the Middle Ages had to stand behind England, France and the United States in terms of participation in one of capitalism's more curious economic flowerings, the outlet mall. 
Financed by the McArthurGlen group, a London-based operator of 12 designer outlet centers in Europe, Serravalle opened in the fall of 2000 with 150,000 square feet of retail space rented to 64 shops and restaurants. Its developers gambled that Italian consumers would forgo their historic affection for the main streets of urban centers and act like Americans, motoring an hour into the countryside for the chance to buy last season's Prada pumps at 80 percent off retail cost. And they have.
These days there are 146 stores, selling not just Prada but Versace, Trussardi, Cerruti, Loro Piano, Frette, Dolce & Gabbana, Swarovski and even Bulgari, whose windows are filled with pearl earrings and diamond-studded watches marked one-third off. On a given Sunday, 35,000 visitors have been known to show up. More than six million people have visited thus far, the developers claim. But some locals insist that number must be an understatement, given the gridlock that routinely forms on the A-7 highway leading there. 
"In the beginning we got mostly locals and Japanese," said Lorenzo Aletti, the marketing coordinator for McArthurGlen in Italy. "Now we get 49 percent from the region, and the rest are Japanese, Koreans, Americans and Russians, who are the new rich for Europe. 
On a weekday morning a while back, Katsuhiko Yamato and Hiroki Hamaguchi, two travelers from Osaka, moved nimbly through the Dolce & Gabbana shop, selecting with laser concentration from among the piles of shredded jeans at 50 percent markdown, suits for $400, belts for $30 and a stack of deeply discounted shirts. After paying for their bounty, the two men checked their merchandise behind the counter and hurried to the nearby Prada shoe boutique. 
"Our itinerary is Florence, Milan and Serravalle Scrivia," said Mr. Hamaguchi, referring to a route that bypassed high culture and Da Vinci's "Last Supper" in favor of shinier commercial shrines. 
"We get people coming in and saying, 'Can we buy the whole shelf?' " said Maurizio Messina, the manager of the Bally store here. And they can. Unlike luxury shops in the designer-barnacled cluster of 18th-century streets in Milan known informally as the Golden Triangle, at Serravalle there are no quotas imposed. "I have customers who come every three months and buy 100 handbags at a time," Mr. Messina said.
The bargains are just one part of the appeal. "There is a theatrical Disneyesque-type attraction beginning to happen at Serravalle," said Julia J. Calabrese, McArthurGlen's chief executive officer.
The mall is an enfolding environment, a hillside farm rendered postmodern village in pastiche. Gently curved streets conduct pedestrians inward. Buildings have ochre stuccoed walls and porticos. Tasteful cast-iron trash cans are surmounted by acorn-shaped lids consistent with an Italo-rustic theme. Perhaps as important, chrome displays and cool recessed lighting cast the merchandise in a flattering light that is far from the bare-bulb reality that the goods are not this season's and failed to sell when they were. 
"For myself it is like Montenapoleone Street, but in the fields," said Fabio Bellini, 28, a chauffeur in Milan, referring to the Fifth Avenue of Milan, a street typically thronged on weekends with orange-tanned men draped in silk sweaters and women whose appearance suggests that personal grooming is a sacred rite. 
"Some people don't mind spending full price; for myself, I like a bargain," said Mr. Bellini, who stopped in at Frette, the high-end linen store, to purchase a terrycloth bathrobe for his wife, a set of towels and some Egyptian cotton sheets, before heading to Pal Zileri's men's wear store and then the Toys Center Outlet to get a gift for his infant son, whom he calls Super Mario.
"This is fall-winter 2002," a saleswoman at Versace explained late last month, referring to a $6,500 evening dress (reduced from $14,000) that she was holding for a client from Genoa. Unlike some American outlet malls -- where chain retailers dump their disasters, and where manufacturers sell specially produced discount lines -- at Serravalle, mustard-colored blazers, mesh leather hot pants and bump-toed clown shoes are nowhere to be found. 
Instead there is quarry to freshen a bargain-hunter's blood: Prada loafers that would cost $350 in the United States at $150; cashmere Loro Piano jackets for $400; Alberta Ferretti spring frocks for $85; seasonless-looking Jean Paul Gaultier dresses reduced from $1,000 to $134; $300 cashmere blankets from the high-end stationer Pineider. There were clothes priced so low that the regional competition, a department store mall called Foxtown, 50 minutes and a Swiss border crossing away from Milan, seemed likely to be undercut, outflanked, forgotten. "Foxtown, you get maybe 20 percent off," said Monica Giordana, a data processor from Milan. "At Serravalle sometimes they are throwing it in the street."
At Serravalle, too, there is the custom of displaying what people in the outlet mall industry call double pricing. That is, the pre- and post-markdown prices are shown in the window, with the same intoxicating effect on bargain hunters that gamblers feel when the dealer breaks the seal on a new deck.
"Originally, there was some resistance to double pricing," Mr. Aletti said. Bulgari, for one, was reluctant to submit its pricey baubles to tactics reminiscent of warehouse refrigerator sales. "They did not want to do it at first," Mr. Aletti said. Now the double prices are posted discreetly in Bulgari's window. At a third of their original Italian retail price, Bulgari bracelets cost a fraction of what they might in New York. 
If the assembled fashion editors seemed to bypass the jeweler's wares during the men's wear season, they were still to be found stuffing their bags with Nikes ($35), Dolce & Gabbana jeans ($29), Prada mules ($79) and Pineider stationery ($10), and walking to waiting limousines as laden as glamorous pack mules with bulky shopping bags.
"So far, we don't have Gucci or Ferragamo or Tod's, but we're working on it," said Ms. Calabrese of McArthurGlen. So far, the chain has not made quite the same imprint on the Italian landscape that outlet megamalls like New York's Woodbury Commons have in the United States. Still, Italian retailers seem to have glimpsed the future and concluded that it will be populated with shoppers eagerly hunting for luxury goods in settings that make Disneyland look uncontrived. 
The second McArthurGlen Italian outlet mall is already in the works. Replete with Ionic colonnades and tasteful replicas of Roman ruins, it is set to open outside Rome in early 2004.

HEADLINE: The Back Page: A How-To Manual; 
A Century of Small Wars Shows They Can Be Won

BYLINE:  By MAX BOOT; Max Boot is a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of "The Savage Wars of Peace: Small Wars and the Rise of American Power."

 BODY:
AFTER a series of smashing military victories, the president declared the war over. Yet far from giving up, the forces resisting American occupation switched to guerrilla tactics. Isolated sentries were killed by assailants who pretended to be friendly civilians. Patrols in the countryside ran into booby traps. One carefully staged ambush wiped out half an infantry company. American forces responded with harsh countermeasures that led to charges of brutality.
 That may sound like a portrait of today's Iraq, but it actually describes the Philippines a century ago. Having kicked out the Spanish in 1898, the United States decided to keep the archipelago for itself. Many Filipinos resisted American rule. President William McKinley thought the struggle was over by early 1900, when the regular Filipino armed forces were routed, but the resilient insurrectos proved him wrong. 
 The United States eventually won, but it was a long, hard, bloody slog that cost the lives of more than 4,200 American soldiers, 16,000 rebels and some 200,000 civilians. Even after the formal end of hostilities on July 4, 1902, sporadic resistance dragged on for years.
There is no reason to think that the current struggle in Iraq will be remotely as difficult. But the Philippine war is a useful reminder that Americans have a long history of fighting guerrillas -- and usually prevailing, though seldom quickly or easily. 
Many lessons of those counterinsurgencies were set down in "The Small Wars Manual," written by a group of Marine Corps officers in the 1930's. This book, which was reprinted in the 1980's, was intended to draw on the experience of leathernecks who had battled "bandits" (as the authors preferred to call all resistance movements) in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua and elsewhere during the early years of the 20th century.
In contrast to major wars, the manual warns, "in small wars no defined battle front exists and the theater of operations may be the whole length and breadth of the land. . . . In warfare of this kind, members of native forces will suddenly become innocent peasant workers when it suits their fancy and convenience." Confronted with such elusive foes, the manual counsels a two-pronged approach to "establish and maintain law and order."
On the one hand, occupying forces must stay on the offensive against rebel groups, hunting them down wherever they hide. "Delay in the use of force . . . will always be interpreted as weakness," the authors warn. On the other hand, the manual is keenly aware of the limits of firepower in an ambiguous environment.
"Peace and industry cannot be restored permanently without appropriate provisions for the economic welfare of the people," they write. They also warn that the "hatred of the enemy" usually inculcated among combat troops is entirely inappropriate during an occupation. Brutal repression -- of the kind carried out by some American soldiers who used a torture technique called the "water cure" to extract information from Filipino suspects -- only creates more recruits for the rebels. "In small wars, tolerance, sympathy and kindness should be the keynote to our relationship with the mass of the population."
However skillful they are in the application of carrots and sticks, the manual teaches, American troops cannot win a permanent victory by themselves: "Native troops, supported by marines, are increasingly employed as early as practicable in order that these native agencies may assume their proper responsibility for restoring law and order in their own country."
American troops followed this advice with a great deal of success in combating insurgencies from the Philippines to, in more recent years, countries like El Salvador. So did the British in postwar Malaya. 
In Vietnam, by contrast, The Small Wars Manual was conspicuously neglected. Gen. William Westmoreland tried a conventional big-unit approach, with disastrous consequences. The relations of American soldiers with civilians were not, for the most part, characterized by "tolerance, sympathy and kindness." Nor did the Americans turn over the fight to "native troops . . . as early as practicable."
Of course, the biggest problem in Indochina was outside the army's control. The guerrillas operating in South Vietnam had a virtually impregnable base in North Vietnam. That made it impossible to isolate the battlefield, as the United States Navy had been able to do in the islands of the Philippines.
In Iraq, American forces may also find it difficult to cut off the insurgents they now face, since the country shares long borders with Syria and Iran, both hostile to the United States. From Washington's standpoint, the good news is that both countries should be much more vulnerable to American pressure than North Vietnam was, because they lack a superpower patron.
In many respects, the American campaign in Iraq has been straight out of The Small Wars Manual. Security sweeps in Sunni areas of central Iraq are combined with efforts to reopen schools and hospitals. This is not bleeding-heart humanitarianism but, as the manual reminds us, a vital step to winning hearts and minds.
Achieving that goal also requires that American troops avoid the sort of excesses committed in the Philippines. Brig. Gen. Jacob Smith was court-martialed for ordering his men to "kill and burn"' indiscriminately -- a case as shocking in its day as the My Lai massacre in Vietnam was. 
While the behavior of American troops in Iraq has been for the most part exemplary, one area where they have lagged is in using indigenous security forces. In the early years of the 20th century, United States occupiers generally set up constabularies trained and led by Americans but made up of local enlisted men. Quasi-military organizations like the the Philippine Scouts proved to be formidable instruments of counterinsurgency because their soldiers knew the local culture and language. This is especially important in fighting foes without uniforms, where the chief challenge is simply to identify the enemy. Small wars place a great premium on accurate intelligence.
As the Afghanistan experience shows, it will take a long time to set up a new military in Iraq. Until then, the occupation authorities will not be able to proceed to the last two sections of "The Small Wars Manual": "Supervision of Elections" and "Withdrawal."

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Evolving Opinions; 
Heartfelt Words From the Rehnquist Court

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
CHIEF JUSTICE WILLIAM H. REHNQUIST was asked some years ago whether his views on any major legal subject had "evolved" during his decades on the Supreme Court. He considered the question for a moment, cocked an eyebrow and said in a self-mocking tone, "Oh, you mean have I shown a capacity for growth?"
 His wry response reflected not only an awareness of his own reputation as a rock-ribbed conservative, but his acknowledgment that evolution, far from a neutral word in this context, connotes a one-way path toward greater enlightenment. Indeed, the "one-way ratchet" in constitutional law, the observed phenomenon by which rights expand but never seem to contract, is a familiar concept among students of the court. 
 Call it growth, evolution or something in the water: something was going on during this Supreme Court term. In the absence of a unified field theory, it could be that webs of personal association and experience have led the justices to see old problems in new ways. Consider:
* Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, skeptical throughout her judicial career of any government policy that took account of race, suddenly embraced affirmative action at the University of Michigan Law School as not only tolerable but good for the country.
* Chief Justice Rehnquist's majority opinion rejecting immunity for the states under the Family and Medical Leave Act described the burdens facing women in the workplace with a heart-felt sensitivity that left women's rights leaders, having expected the worst, wondering whether Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was his ghostwriter.
* Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's eloquent apologia for the court's previous failure to accord "dignity" and "respect" to gay relationships stunned even those who had assumed, based on his libertarian streak and a demonstrated openness to gay-rights issues going back to an opinion he wrote as a federal appeals court judge in 1980, that he would probably vote to overturn the Texas sodomy law. In both its rhetoric and analysis, his opinion took the court much further than necessary to accomplish a simple invalidation.
Justices do change. Justice Harry A. Blackmun, a law-and-order conservative when he joined the court in 1970, ended his career 24 years later as a passionate opponent of the death penalty. Justice John Paul Stevens, whose liberal vote is now almost taken for granted, voted with the anti-affirmative-action bloc in the 1978 Bakke case. And Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. said after his retirement that he regretted his vote with the 5-to-4 majority in Bowers v. Hardwick, the 1986 decision repudiated by the court's new gay-rights majority.
Times change, too. The Supreme Court has become a gay-friendly workplace where employees feel sufficiently comfortable in their open identity to bring their partners to court functions. Justice Powell's comment to one of his law clerks while Bowers v. Hardwick was pending in 1986 that "I don't believe I've ever met a homosexual" (untrue, considering that the clerk was, in fact, gay) could not be uttered in the court -- or the Washington or the legal profession -- of today.
Of course, not everyone responds to change in the same way, as shown by Justice Antonin Scalia's bitter dissent in the Texas case, warning of "a massive disruption of the current social order." It was as if he and Justice Kennedy, born within four months of each other 67 years ago, both Roman Catholic, both Harvard Law School graduates, both elevated to the court within 15 months by President Ronald Reagan, were speaking from parallel universes. So the bare facts of biography are not enough to explain Anthony Kennedy.
A close friend from his Sacramento childhood, the writer Joan Didion talks about his growing up in the shadow of the California Legislature. His father was a lawyer and lobbyist, and the Kennedy home had a constant flow of people and ideas. "There was a world outside their personal world that came into that house," Ms. Didion said. His decision to go to the London School of Economics after Stanford surprised his friends. "He wanted to live in a larger world," she said.
In the last few years, that world has included New York, which neither Justice Kennedy nor his wife, Mary, knew well before all three of their children, now married, moved there. Now they visit frequently. After Sept. 11, 2001, Justice Kennedy worried to Washington acquaintances that the atmosphere of freedom he so admired about New York might be in jeopardy.
These are simply pieces in a mosaic; no one would suggest that having grown children in New York necessarily makes a life-tenured judge more attuned to personal liberty "in its spatial and more transcendent dimensions," as the justice wrote in his Texas opinion. Yet this term may serve as a reminder that even in late middleage, people are open to new ideas. In fact, it may be harder than ever to avoid new ideas; in the isolation of their chambers, some justices surf the Internet.
Extensive foreign travel has made both Justice Kennedy and Justice O'Connor more alert to how their peers on other constitutional courts see similar issues. Justices have always traveled, teaching or taking part in seminars. But these are trips with a difference. 
Along with Justice Ginsburg and Justice Stephen G. Breyer, Justices O'Connor and Kennedy have held extensive sessions with judges in Europe. Justice Kennedy has met with numerous Chinese judges, here and in China. Justice O'Connor has been involved in the American Bar Association's reform initiative for Eastern Europe. With emerging democracies groping toward the rule of law, with colleagues on the federal bench volunteering for constitution-writing duties in Iraq, it is not surprising that the justices have begun to see themselves as participants in a worldwide constitutional conversation.
From this perspective, Justice Kennedy's citing of the European Court of Human Rights in his Texas opinion was a natural development. Justice O'Connor, in the Michigan case, linked affirmative action to the acquisition of "the skills needed in today's increasingly global marketplace" and to the maintenance of integrated leadership for the military. 
It is tempting to suppose that her invocation of diversity as "essential" to "the dream of our nation, indivisible," was aimed not just at a domestic audience but at the constitution-building world in which she is a star participant.
And what of chief justice Rehnquist's solicitude for the usefulness of the Family and Medical Leave Act in erasing the "pervasive sex-role stereotype that caring for family members is women's work"?
His daughter, Janet, is a single mother who until recently held a high-pressure job and sometimes had child-care problems. Several times this term, the 78-year-old Chief Justice of the United States left work early to pick up his granddaughters from school.
Not evolution, perhaps, but life.

Teachers Are Paid Well, One Economist Says
 ARE public-school teachers underpaid compared with other professionals? 
 Not by many measures, writes Richard Vedder, an economics professor at Ohio University, in "Comparable Worth," in the summer issue of Education Next, published by the conservative Hoover Institution. 
Using Labor Department data, Professor Vedder said he found that weekly pay for teachers in 2001 was within 10 percent of the pay for accountants, biological and life scientists, editors and reporters. 
Teachers, moreover, enjoy longer vacations and work fewer days a year than most professional workers. Using the National Compensation Survey of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Professor Vedder found that the average hourly wage in 2000 for all "professional speciality" workers was $27.49. Elementary-school teachers earned $28.79 an hour. Secondary-school teachers earned $29.14 an hour and special-education teachers earned $29.97. Teachers also received benefits totaling more than 26 percent of their salaries; the average for private industry is below 17 percent. 
The problem, Professor Vedder says, is not low salaries, but inefficient hiring. According to rules typically negotiated by unions, teachers in high-demand specialties, math and science, earn the same as teachers in fields like English, which have a surplus of applicants.

Imposing or Proposing A Stance Against Abortion
Hard line" 70's feminism has been rejected by women, but "its ideology lives on in law and politics -- like light rays from a dead star," writes Mary Ann Glendon, a professor at Harvard Law School, in the conservative Catholic publication "First Things." 
Legalized abortion is the legacy, writes Professor Glendon, who has advised the Vatican. Two 1973 Supreme Court decisions left little room for states to maneuver. Roe v. Wade overturned a Texas statute that banned abortion except when the mother's life was in danger. Doe v. Bolton, issued the same day, is less well known, but had more impact, she writes. It said that doctors must be allowed to consider emotional and psychological factors in deciding whether an abortion after fetal viability is necessary to preserve a pregnant patient's health. With Doe the court "signaled the doom of legislative efforts to provide even modest protection of unborn life," she writes. "And it was Doe's broad definition of 'health' as 'well being' that the court would later use to strike down even bans on the cruel procedure known as partial birth abortion."
As a result, "we have become a society where nearly everyone has been touched by abortion, if not personally, then through friends and family members," she writes. That ubiquity has allowed people "to take refuge in slogans like 'Who am I to be judgmental?' and the famous 'Personally, I'm opposed but I can't impose my opinions on others.' "
"Impose," Professor Glendon says, is the wrong word. "When people advance their moral viewpoints in the public square, they are not imposing anything on anyone. They are proposing. That's what citizens do in a democracy -- we propose, we give reason, we vote."

Save the Bandtail Pigeon, An Oregon Hunter Says
A longtime hunter in the coastal range of Oregon takes stock of his favorite prey, the bandtail pigeon, in the summer issue of The Double Gun Journal, a publication for sportsmen and collectors.
"Over the years -- principally in the 1950's, 60's, 70's, into the early 1980's -- I hunted bandtails in scores of locations in the Coast Range," Worth Mathewson writes. But in the early 1980's, "I began to curtail my pigeon shooting -- then quit entirely. It wasn't a pleasant decision. It was based on the sharply declining numbers of this large wilderness pigeon."
What caused this? "Its declines have had nothing whatsoever to do with habitat, lack of food sources, changes in farming practices or anything else so commonly, and correctly, associated with reduced numbers of birds shot for sport. The bandtail suffered gravely from overshooting. Nothing else."
The author said there are signs of recovery; last year, British Columbia and Washington managed to hold brief shooting seasons. But the bandtail is one of the slowest-reproducing game birds, so it will be many years, Mr. Mathewson says, before strong flocks return. But the author recalls: "There have been mornings in years now long passed, where almost instantly I have been engulfed with the flocks. If I was shooting well, everything was over sooner than I wished. I nearly always made a point of lining up the birds on a log or stump to admire them."

Will Anyone Throw Money, Lots of It, at a Glass House?

BYLINE:  By Jane L. Levere (COMPILED BY CHRISTINE BOCKELMANN)

 BODY:
If buying a home is a "big vote of confidence in the economy," as one economist recently asserted, is buying a really big home a really big sign of confidence?
 After a year on the market, a 35,000-square-foot glass house outside Princeton, N.J., has attracted interest, and its owner expects it to sell this month. 
 John Boulton, a retired electronics magnate, predicts that he will soon receive a suitable offer for his custom-built, two-story house, on 48 acres in Franklin Township. The property is called Chalan Farm, and the asking price is $12 million. 
Mr. Boulton began building the home in 1992. It is constructed of energy-efficient, high-tech glass and has 360-degree views, an eight-car garage and a swimming pool in the master bedroom. The design is inspired by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe; Mr. Boulton, as a young electrical engineer, worked with him on the landmark Seagram Building in Manhattan. 
Mr. Boulton, who invented such things as a remote-control music system sold in the 1960's at Hammacher Schlemmer in New York City, put Chalan Farm on the market a year ago when his wife, Prudence, required medical care in Manhattan. 
An auction of Chalan Farm was conducted in May by the J. P. King Auction Company, with a $3 million minimum bid, but it did not sell. The auction did help identify prospective buyers, however, said J. Scott King, executive vice president of the auction company. 
Mr. Boulton said he has been contacted by a number of "serious contenders," including Somerset County, which is considering turning the house into a historical museum; several foundations; and two wealthy individuals -- separate bidders -- who would live in it.
Offers are due on July 15. Mr. Boulton said "we'll decide that day" which is accepted, but he would not say how close to $12 million he expects the offers to be. Jane L. Levere

HEADLINE: CITY PEOPLE; 
Devoted to Mom and Pop

BYLINE:  By SETH KUGEL

 BODY:
BODEGAS are an icon of New York's Latino neighborhoods, but these mom-and-pop grocery stores where owners greet children by name, longtime customers buy on credit and neighbors discuss the latest news are also a throwback to Main Street America.
 Their role was underscored 10 days ago at a news conference in front of a bodega in the Bedford Park section of the Bronx, when Mayor Bloomberg announced an anticrime program designed to protect these businesses from robberies. 
 "As you know, bodegas play a vital role in the daily life of New York City," the mayor said before a dozen television cameras. "We're going to do everything we can to combat robberies committed against bodegas and ensure that New York City's bodega owners will see their businesses flourish." 
For the mayor, the event may have been no more than a routine news conference about a modest new crime-fighting program, cost: $10,000. For Jose Fernandez, the short, slight Dominican man in the crisp white shirt standing to the mayor's immediate right and fitting right in with the crowd of politicians and police officers, it was a shining moment, the pinnacle of five years of work.
Mr. Fernandez, 35, is the president of the Bodega Association of the United States, the group that pushed for the new initiative. As Ramon Murphy, the association's general secretary, described the event, it was "the greatest achievement in bodega history."
Maybe. One thing is certain. Less than a month after Mr. Fernandez telephoned Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly to express concern about a spate of recent crimes against bodegas in the city, the mayor came to the Bronx to announce a pilot program to fight the problem. Under the program, which will go into effect at 10 bodegas in 10 precincts, security cameras will be installed and systems will be put into place to allow rapid police response if a crime is committed. The City Council has set aside $5,000 to expand the program to more stores.
The event put a spotlight on Mr. Fernandez and his organization. Some have compared him to Fernando Mateo, a successful businessman who organized livery cab drivers, but Mr. Fernandez shuns that comparison, noting that he started as a bodega owner, whereas Mr. Mateo came from outside the livery world.
The association, which claims to have 7,000 members, some from as far away as Philadelphia, is the main instrument of Mr. Fernandez's political muscle. It was born out of a conversation that he had back in 1997 with Mr. Murphy and Arsenio Morales, Mr. Murphy's business partner, when the three men were seated on milk crates in the back of a van outside of Mr. Fernandez's grocery.
The group has had minor success, securing meetings with borough presidents, landing a $115,000 state contract for training bodega owners about regulations on cigarette sales, and getting some press coverage.
But most of their efforts have been only moderately successful. 
Most recently, when the group protested against the new cigarette tax's potential to harm bodega owners, the mayor dismissed their concern as "a minor economic issue." (In response, Mr. Fernandez called the mayor a "traitor.")
However, with a dozen killings of grocery store workers in the past year, according to the association, and data from the association's telephone survey showing that 75 of 205 bodega robberies in the Bronx from May 2002 to May 2003 were not reported to the police, Mr. Fernandez saw a chance to make his mark.
AS he tells it, on a Friday he called the commissioner's office and told the secretary that he was giving a news conference that afternoon and wanted to speak with the commissioner. The commissioner called back, met with Mr. Fernandez on Monday and announced the program three weeks later.
Or, as Commissioner Kelly described the exchange in an interview after the news conference: "He called me, and I called him back. We try to be responsive."
The city's plan made news in the city's major daily papers and graced the cover of the Spanish-language tabloid Hoy.
Mr. Fernandez, a serious and unassuming man, came to New York in 1983, at the age of 15, and, like so many Dominicans before him, settled in Washington Heights. He earned a bachelor's degree from Lehman College, and, in 1997, after four years working as a counselor for children in a domestic violence shelter, he gave up a steady salary with benefits, borrowed money from his credit card and relatives, and made a $40,000 down payment for a small grocery store in the Morrisania section of the Bronx.
His education did not make up for a lack of experience. His bodega cost him $120,000, far more than it should have, he now realizes. Unable to pay off his loan, he lost his business. It was during this period that the meeting in the van took place.
"The difference between me and other people is that they don't stand up for themselves," Mr. Fernandez said. "They go to work in a factory. I started an association."
By that time, he translated his political talents into a job as a community liaison for State Assemblyman Adriano Espaillat, who represents upper Manhattan. Two years later, he again pieced together loans and bought a bodega in the Belmont section of the Bronx. This time the cost was only $30,000, and the business, Cristian Deli Grocery, was a success.
His family runs the store, and Mr. Fernandez, who lives in Lodi, N.J., spends most of his time working out of the association's new office on West 179th Street in Washington Heights, outfitted with dark-stained wood furniture that give it something of the air of a small corporate boardroom. The association's $250,000 annual budget is financed through corporate donations and fund-raising events.
The day after the press conference, the office was buzzing. Executives from Goya Foods, a New Jersey company that is a main supplier of food to bodegas, had arrived to speak with Mr. Fernandez, and the phone was ringing with people calling for appointments.
"For me it was a miracle," Mr. Fernandez said. "I feel proud about myself, and I feel surprised at the same time, because I never thought I was going to get the attention of the mayor to help the bodegueros. I always felt I was fighting and fighting, but I was frustrated because no one was listening to me."
The cause of bodega safety has a long way to go. With the money from the police and the City Council, about 60 stores will get security equipment and added protection. But at least 2,000 New York bodegas need help, Mr. Fernandez said.
Meanwhile, the association also has some mundane work to do. Mr. Fernandez said his group has signed up 7,000 stores as members, some of them as far away as Philadelphia. But that figure was impossible to verify, since most of the sign-up sheets are still in stacks. Things are so hectic that association employees haven't had time to enter the information into the Excel spreadsheet that serves as the organization's database.

Walk a Dog and Help the Planet

BYLINE:  By TARA BAHRAMPOUR

 BODY:
Dogs being walked in New York City probably aren't committed to preserving endangered plant life. 
 But these days, the people on the other end may be, at least if they are members of Dogwalking for Rainforests, a pet walking, training and sitting collective that donates 30 percent of its fees to causes around the world. 
 The agency was started a year ago by Joan Roney, a longtime New York dog walker and pet trainer who had also been an advocate for local groups and community gardens. She decided to merge the two kinds of services, and today she has four full-time and two part-time workers who help select causes to assist -- including a Brazilian student newspaper, a Lower East Side women's bookstore, a rain forest preservation group in Brooklyn and a group of 86 Ecuadorean indigenous communities. 
Dog walking has become increasingly competitive as the economy has soured, Ms. Roney said, but added that her business quadrupled after she began making donations. Members of the collective help decide where donations should go and clients make suggestions.
So far Dogwalking for Rainforests has donated $6,500. 
While some other dog-walking services contribute to animal-related causes, Ms. Roney said many of her new clients were attracted by the unusual world view behind her donations.
"It's one of the reasons I contacted her," said Jodi Barish, who uses the service for her mixed-breed dog, Thangka. "It seemed less about just someone out to make money. It just makes you trust them a little more, that they're going to take very good care of your animals." 
And Ms. Roney's old clients? 
"They think that I'm, uh, they find me endearing," she said.

Sure-Fire Mo rning Wreckers: Green Eggs and Spam

BYLINE:  By HUBERT B. HERRING

 BODY:
When it comes to precious time, the Internet gives but, alas, it also takes away. In 0.15 seconds you can get a list of nail salons in Natchez, but there's a dark side: the time spent deleting spam. 
 A survey of 1,528 people by McAfee Security, which sells a SpamKiller program, found that nearly half of Americans spend more than 40 minutes a week hitting the delete key. (The level of outrage while doing so? Not tallied.) And 49 percent call spam the No. 1 technology time waster, dwarfing the 24 percent who picked a sure ex-champion -- multiple-choice phone labyrinths. 
 The survey noted that people delete spam an average of 30.6 times a week but read to children just 2.81 times. Dr. Seuss has been spammed. HUBERT B. HERRING

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Reading, Writing and Now Checkbook Balancing" (June 22), which discussed the state of financial education for teenagers in high school: 
 Financial education at the college level is equally essential for securing a young adult's financial future. As the article noted, many new college students are unprepared for the financial realities that they face once they leave home. Furthermore, evidence shows that many of today's college students will continue to struggle with their finances throughout their lives.
While I recognize the importance of financial education before college, there are some topics, such as retirement and tax planning, marital finance, and insuring one's life and property, that are more age-appropriate for college students.
Our program at Smith College offers courses on basic finance. We build upon this with more advanced courses covering investing, retirement, interpreting financial news and entrepreneurship. Some of our students go on to offer workshops on financial topics in local high schools.
I hope that other colleges and universities will also find a way to incorporate financial literacy into the curriculum. Clearly, we cannot afford to neglect this "fourth R" at any educational level.

HEADLINE: Doctors' Testimony Under Scrutiny 

BYLINE:  By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
Feeling under siege by malpractice lawsuits, medical societies are setting up tribunals to review the testimony of doctors who act as expert witnesses in such lawsuits. Doctors whose testimony does not pass muster can be suspended or expelled from the societies.
 Lawyers who represent plaintiffs in malpractice cases say such reviews and the threat of sanctions are meant to intimidate witnesses. They say the mere existence of the grievance procedures has made it harder to find experts, whose testimony is crucial in most malpractice cases. 
 The idea for the grievance procedures seems to have started with the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, which has prevailed in three court battles over their legality. Societies of obstetricians, gynecologists and spine doctors followed, and societies of anesthesiologists and ear, nose and throat specialists are expected to vote on establishing similar procedures this summer and fall.
"There are probably another 10 that are studying it closely," said Russell M. Pelton, a lawyer in Chicago who represents the neurosurgeons' association.
The American Medical Association supports the moves, said Dr. Donald J. Palmisano, the association's president-elect.
"The giving of expert testimony should be considered the practice of medicine, and it should be the subject of peer review," Dr. Palmisano said. "If someone comes into court and gives junk science, we don't want fraudulent testimony in court."
But the trend troubles plaintiffs' lawyers.
"Not only does this appear to be a form of intimidation of witnesses that violates the federal Civil Rights Act, but this is a sort of restraint of trade that could also be an antitrust violation," said Robert Peck, the president of the Center for Constitutional Litigation, which often represents the American Trial Lawyers Association.
"It's extremely widespread," Mr. Peck said. "It leads us to believe that many doctors are afraid to come forward because they fear retaliation."
Some lawyers say the effect of the grievance procedures is already being felt in the legal system.
"It's more difficult to get a good neurosurgeon as an expert than any other specialty," said Norman D. Tucker, a Michigan lawyer who represents patients.
Dr. Albert L. Strunk, vice president for fellowship activities at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said he was not convinced that review of expert testimony by medical societies would prevent poor-quality testimony. The college has a grievance program that has heard occasional complaints about such testimony.
"When a medical society disciplines one of its members for this sort of thing, it just plays into the hands of the personal injury lawyers," Dr. Strunk said. "They say this is the medical profession closing ranks to stifle doctors who are speaking out on behalf of a patient who has been injured."
Dr. Strunk also said the college asked members to sign a statement affirming that any testimony they give will be complete and accurate and that they will submit their testimony to peer review.
Plaintiffs' lawyers say that request is a form of intimidation, too.
"It's a ploy by A.C.O.G. to discourage its fellows from giving expert testimony," said James Cook, an Iowa lawyer who represents plaintiffs in malpractice cases.
The neurosurgeons' association has heard more than 30 complaints over the past 20 years, all but one of them about expert testimony given on behalf of plaintiffs, Mr. Pelton said. Only members of the society can file a grievance.
The hearings resemble trials, with witnesses and lawyers. They are usually held during annual conventions. The doctor bringing the complaint must prove "unprofessional conduct, not a difference of opinion between professionals," Mr. Pelton said. "Due process is observed."
One doctor was expelled from the association after such a hearing, he said, and 8 or 10 others have been suspended, usually for six months.
Dr. Gary J. Lustgarten, a neurosurgeon in Florida, was suspended for six months over expert testimony he gave in a 1998 case involving a patient's death during spinal disk surgery. Among other things, he was said to have misstated the doctor's responsibility.
Dr. Lustgarten's office said he was on vacation and could not return a call seeking comment. 
Dr. Lustgarten sued the association on antitrust and other grounds, drawing what he called a "painful but apt" comparison between "a professional peer review program and the sending of masked riders in the night."
"In the 19th century, motivated by animus and economic interest, the Ku Klux Klan terrorized witnesses who would appear in courts and give testimony not to the Klan's liking," he told a federal court in Georgia in 2001. The neurosurgeons' association, he suggested, was doing something similar.
Dr. Lustgarten dropped his suit after the federal appeals court in Chicago found for the association in a similar case that year.
In the Chicago case, Judge Richard A. Posner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit endorsed the grievance procedure as lawful and valuable. The case was brought by Dr. Donald C. Austin, a Michigan neurosurgeon who was suspended for six months after testifying in a case in which the patient emerged from surgery with a paralyzed vocal cord.
Judge Posner wrote that membership in medical societies brought with it privileges and obligations.
"By becoming a member of the prestigious American Association of Neurological Surgeons, a fact he did not neglect to mention in his testimony, Austin boosted his credibility as an expert witness," Judge Posner wrote. "The association has an interest -- the community at large has an interest -- in Austin's not being able to dazzle judges and juries and deflect the close and skeptical scrutiny that shoddy testimony deserves."
"This kind of professional self-regulation furthers rather than impedes the cause of justice," he added. "More policing of expert testimony is required, not less."
Mr. Peck, of the Center for Constitutional Litigation, said the legal system was capable of evaluating expert testimony without help from medical societies.
"Juries are remarkably good at this," he said. "Judges are very good at this. The juries' appreciation for things you might think are difficult to convey is outstanding."
Plaintiffs' lawyers say that only testimony on behalf of plaintiffs seems to land doctors in trouble.
"They are not reviewing the highly outrageous testimony they see from defendants' experts," Mr. Tucker said.
The medical societies say their procedures are evenhanded and are not meant to discourage testimony for either side, but rather testimony that is biased or irresponsible.
The sanctions can have serious consequences.
Dr. Austin told the court that his suspension was "disastrous" and "catastrophic," as it caused what the appeals court called his moonlighting income for expert testimony to drop to $77,000 from $220,000 annually.
Judge Elaine E. Bucklo of United States District Court in Chicago, who dismissed Dr. Austin's case in 2000, said that was all but inevitable.
"Who, after all," Judge Bucklo wrote, "wants an expert who has to acknowledge that he was suspended from his professional association for ethical violations he was found to have committed as an expert witness?"

HEADLINE: Not Counting on 911, Companies Hire Private Ambulances 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
A growing number of big companies in Manhattan are bypassing the 911 system for their medical emergencies, and signing up instead with private ambulance services that hold out the promise -- explicitly or not -- of better, faster service.
 The ambulances run by these services do not answer 911 calls, responding instead only to callsfrom their corporate customers. The ambulance companies say their crews are less busy than those who answer 911 calls, are more likely to be close to the scene of an emergency, and are familiar with their clients' high-rise buildings -- all leading, at least in theory, to faster responses. 
 These services make up a tiny niche in the ambulance industry, averaging perhaps a dozen calls a day, compared with the thousands that go to 911. But the niche is growing fast, roughly doubling in size in the last year, with more than 100 corporate clients, who each pay thousands of dollars a year. 
Officials at the Fire Department, which runs the 911 medical system, dismissed the private services as marketing gimmicks, and disputed the idea that they were any faster or better than the city system. "We strongly believe that circumventing 911 is not in the best interest of the patient," Deputy Commissioner Francis X. Gribbon said.
It seems odd that such services would boom in a sluggish economy, especially when New York City's Emergency Medical Service, once troubled, is much improved. In some cases, the explanation dates to the attack on Sept. 11, 2001, when hundreds of 911 calls went unanswered. The experience raised the fear at some corporations that in another major crisis, the city system might be too overwhelmed to help them.
But the broader reason for the surge appears to be wider availability of the services and more aggressive marketing.
"I think the market was always there" but not exploited, said Dr. Daniel E. Weiner, chairman of the emergency department at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. He said the hospital had changed its view of ambulance services and emergency rooms, once seen as expensive burdens. "Now we think of the E.R. as the front door to the hospital, the big generator of admissions."
Roosevelt Hospital started an ambulance service for Midtown corporations in the 1980's, but hospital officials say it languished because little effort was put into it. Last year, the hospital turned over operation of the service, FastCare, to MetroCare, a large ambulance company. At the same time, Roosevelt began actively seeking new customers, especially in its booming Columbus Circle neighborhood, and urging old clients to use the service more. Officials say they have won new business and raised the call volume by 40 percent.
Last September, Empress Emergency Medical Service, another big ambulance company, started a similar service, Emergacare, affiliated with New York University Hospitals Center, serving companies in the financial district. 
FastCare says it has 56 clients in 72 locations, including Viacom, Newsweek, The New York Times and Lincoln Center. Emergacare claims about 50 clients but says they do not want to be identified publicly. The clients generally employ anywhere from several hundred people at a single site to several thousand.
The vice president for employee relations and development at Viacom, Betty Panarella, said Viacom did not have an in-house medical department, and spoke of a "comfort level" supplied by FastCare.
Several corporate executives who were interviewed said an essential part of the appeal was their belief that the service was faster than 911, though they could cite only anecdotal evidence and did not know what 911 response times were. "We think it's so, but we've never really analyzed it," Ms. Panarella said.
One executive, who insisted that his company not be identified, said, "Sept. 11 made a lot of our people edgy about what could happen in a big crisis, and if this reassures them, it'sworth the price."
Richard Gregory, executive vice president of Emergacare, said that its downtown clients had felt the Sept. 11 trauma keenly and that many signed up because of it.
Emergacare charges companies $1,500 to $30,000 a year, depending on their size, Mr. Gregory said. FastCare generally charges $1 per year per employee at a covered building, and $500 for the main location and $250 for each additional one. Both services also charge for each ambulance run, as the city's Emergency Medical Service does with 911 calls, and both usually bill that charge to a patient's insurance company.
New York City's 911 medical system is a hybrid of the Emergency Medical Service and the ambulance corps of dozens of hospitals. Hospitals have long used their participation to win patients; a hospital ambulance answering a 911 call is likely, all things being equal, to take the patient back to that hospital.
Similarly, FastCare, whose operating costs are shared by Roosevelt and MetroCare, also produces revenue for Roosevelt, as hospital officials acknowledge frankly. About 85 percent of the people it takes to emergency rooms go to Roosevelt, they say, and a handful are admitted to the hospital on an average week. This can be significant in an era of precarious hospital finances. MetroCare, meanwhile, collects the fees that FastCare charges.
Most FastCare patients work for big corporations, so they are far more likely to have insurance than patients who come in through 911 calls. "Certainly, they're as profitable as anyone we bring in here," said Dr. Richard F. Daines, president and chief executive of St. Luke's-Roosevelt.
Mr. Gregory says that Emergacare makes no effort to steer patients to the affiliated hospitals of N.Y.U. Hospitals Center, though "it is standard in the ambulance world." But in fact, for many cases in Lower Manhattan, N.Y.U. Downtown Hospital's emergency room is a logical destination.
Ambulance industry executives say they know of no similar services elsewhere in the country, and doubt that other cities have the concentration of people and large employers to sustain them. 
The 911 system has a mix of basic life support units and advanced life support units with better-trained crews and more equipment. Emergacare and FastCare operate only advanced life support units, and their affiliated hospitals provide the clients with services like training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and in emergency preparedness.
Mostly, though, what customers pay for is time: the promise of precious minutes saved in an emergency.
The 911 system has greatly improved its speed in the last decade, so that on average, an ambulance responds in less than seven minutes in life-threatening situations. Also, in some of the most serious categories of calls, when the patient appears to be having a heart attack or is unconscious or choking, a nearby fire engine is dispatched in addition to an ambulance, and the fire crews have some medical training and equipment like cardiac defibrillators.
"If you add those numbers in, in those serious cases where you want to get there as quickly as possible, our average response time is actually under five minutes," Commissioner Gribbon said. He added that bypassing 911 could also mean bypassing an appropriate police response, as when someone suffers a drug overdose or is injured in an assault.
In terms of speed, an official response time is to the address, not to the patient, a distinction that the corporate ambulance services say matters.
Emergacare promises a response time to the address of less than eight minutes, or the call is free. Mr. Gregory says the company has a faster average time than 911. 
FastCare does not promise specific response times. Roosevelt officials do not claim that FastCare is quicker than 911, though they hint at it, and MetroCare officials say so outright, although they do not give a specific time. 
Judging such claims is impossible with the limited information available. But it does seem that the calls-to-ambulances ratio is lower than in the 911 system. In essence, corporate customers pay for the knowledge that ambulances run by private services spend much of their time roaming or idling in nearby, strategic spots, waiting for their calls.
On a recent weekday afternoon, two paramedics, Natan Mandelbaum and Ivor Edwards, sat in a FastCare ambulance, on a traffic island in Times Square. Calls to 911 came and went, and an occasional ambulance sped by, but they stayed put.
"We get anywhere from one to eight calls in a 12-hour shift," usually closer to the low end of that range, Mr. Mandelbaum said. "That's not a lot compared to working 911."
FastCare keeps one ambulance on the street around the clock, with another ready at Roosevelt, and company officials say they plan to run both full time on the street soon. Emergacare covers business hours on weekdays, and will not say how many ambulances it operates at a time. Both say that as parts of larger ambulance companies, they can quickly call in more units, but that it is rarely necessary.
Both companies say that familiarity with their clients' buildings is as important as curb-to-curb response times. The ambulance crews practice drills with the customers, and develop a protocol for each building.
"There's no pulling up at the main lobby, with all the confusion and the crowds, or pulling up at the wrong loading dock at a building you've never seen," said Alfred F. Kim, vice president of MetroCare and a former New York City paramedic. "In a high-rise, delays like that are inevitable with 911. With our teams, it's choreographed, the security staff knows our guys, everybody meets at the right entrance, and they've got the cargo elevator waiting with the override key."

At a checkpoint here bristling with boys both armed and anxious, a giant billboard shows two figures -- a small Liberian youngster and a large Uncle Sam facing each other at the end of a long curving road. The Liberian figure looks up and says: "We've come a long way, big brother. But it's still rough! We are suffering."
 "For true?" is Uncle Sam's woolly response. 
 It may come as a surprise to many Americans, but Liberians do see the United States as their big brother. Freed American slaves settled Liberia 150 years ago and their descendants have remained its elite ever since. Until the end of the cold war, when its utility as an anti-Communist ally on the strategic West African coast ran out, Liberia was among Washington's most reliable partners on the continent. 
Today, after more than a decade of on-and-off war, Liberians want desperately to capture America's imagination once more: they want American troops to come in and stop the fighting. 
Certainly, Liberia has a peculiar relationship to its big brother across the Atlantic. But the billboard on the Monrovia street corner captures a much more widely popular sentiment in Africa. As President Bush begins his first official trip to the continent on Monday, African eyes are on America as never before. 
Africans have never forgotten the comment that Mr. Bush made during his presidential campaign. "While Africa may be important," he said, "it doesn't fit into the national strategic interests, as far as I can see them." 
The president's view has clearly changed. The fight against terrorism that has become a central part of his administration has forced him to focus on the Horn of Africa, where Al Qaeda is known to operate. He has also leaned on African heads of state to support his agenda, most recently, securing promises of immunity for Americans in the International Criminal Court. 
Beyond that, he has surprised many critics with the attention he has paid to Africa, meeting with nearly half the continent's government leaders in Washington and offering numerous pledges for turning Africa around. 
Still, many Africans say Mr. Bush, representing the richest country on earth, must prove his commitment to some of the poorest.
"Africa has always been on the bottom of the list as far as America's priorities," said Maria Nzomo, director of the Institute of Diplomacy and International Studies at the University of Nairobi. "How is this president going to help us?" 
Not everybody is after American military might. "We don't want him to send his troops all across Africa or to just view us in terms of international terrorism," Ms. Nzomo said. "There are roots to the violence here, and poverty, weak institutions and the devastation of AIDS are tied to them."
On his trip, Mr. Bush will avoid the continent's worst trouble spots, dropping in instead on success stories. He will visit Senegal (with its long democratic tradition), Botswana (where the economy is booming), South Africa (America's largest trade partner in Africa), Uganda (which has successfully reduced the spread of AIDS) and Nigeria (which has replaced a succession of military coups with elections, however flawed). 
Kayode Fayemi, head of the Center for Democracy and Development, which is based in Lagos, said that while he was "cautiously optimistic" about Mr. Bush's promises, he worried about Washington's increased focus on the oil-rich -- and human-rights-poor -- states of West Africa. Nigeria, for one, had done little to share its oil wealth with its own people, he said. 
"The focus on oil in the Gulf of Guinea would probably ensure that the United States looks the other way when it comes to human rights, accountability and transparency," Mr. Fayemi said. "In Nigeria, the example of that would be how does the United States respond to campaigns from local communities for equitable and local management of resources." 
Moreover, Africa finds itself roiled by numerous conflicts, and Mr. Bush will be pressed at every turn to beef up American involvement in peace efforts. War, however, is far from the only killer. Disease takes the lives of even more Africans than fighting does, and entrenched poverty is the fate of most of those who survive. 
This president will find an Africa that is markedly different from the one his predecessor visited in 1998 on the first of two official tours. When President Clinton arrived, Ivory Coast and Zimbabwe were zones of stability. War had not yet brought Congo to its knees. Liberia was in the hands of its warlord-president, Charles Taylor, but the country's meltdown was not imminent. Now those countries are among the most troubled on the continent, along with Sudan, Burundi and Zimbabwe. 
Mr. Bush will also hear about famine in broad swaths of Africa and about economies that suffer despite the tariff-lowering African Growth and Opportunity Initiative. Thanks to American agricultural subsidies, the United States market is virtually impenetrable to African farmers. 
When it comes to peacemaking, Mr. Bush has devoted considerable political capital to the decades-old Sudanese conflict, which pits the Islamic government against Christian and animist rebels in the south. He named a special envoy and spearheaded talks that have gone further than any others. But such activism has been less focused when it comes to other battle zones. 
At issue in Congo is whether Mr. Bush will accede to calls by Secretary General Kofi Annan to fortify United Nations peacekeeping forces. Once ruled by an anti-Communist ally, Mobutu Sese Seko, Congo has been ravaged by four and a half years of war; more than three million people have died. 
Of particular concern is the country's east, near the borders of Uganda and Rwanda, where armed factions battle for control over the riches of the land, despite a peace deal. United Nations peacekeepers have been able to do little to stanch the bloodletting, a point Bush aides are quick to offer. In the northeastern town of Bunia, a multinational force led by the European Union is in place to restore security. When it leaves, on Sept. 1, fighting is expected to flare up again. 
Mr. Bush has yet to back Mr. Annan's request to increase the Congo peacekeeping forces to nearly 11,000 troops. The United States pays a major portion of the United Nations peacekeeping bill and the administration has concerns about the effectiveness of the Congo mission. 
In Burundi, the conflict is more contained, but it is just as brutal to the people caught up in it. Two rebel groups made up of ethnic Hutu who did not join a peace deal struck in 2000 continue to fight in the bush. 
Mr. Clinton attended the signing of that peace agreement in Arusha, Tanzania, saying pointedly at the time that the Hutu holdouts were a grave threat. 
The African Union, an alliance of African nations intent on handling more of its trouble in-house, recently sent peacekeepers into Burundi, in central Africa, but the rebels have only increased their offensives. 
Nigeria, the West African behemoth, is as important to the United States as ever, with its oil shipments helping to relieve Americans of their dependence on the Middle East. Olusegun Obasanjo, a former military leader, won re-election in April, but the victory was marred by rigging and violence. Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, may have put an end to its string of military coups, but it has hardly shaken off a legacy of politically motivated killings, rampant corruption and poverty. 
But nowhere is American engagement sought more than in Liberia. Britain and France have taken the lead in the conflicts in neighboring Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast. Liberia's strong links to the United States have put the onus on Washington to sort out the mess. 
The links between the countries are hard to miss. The Liberian flag is a derivation of the Stars and Stripes. Its currency is the Liberian dollar. The American Embassy in Monrovia is among the oldest in Africa, having opened in 1949, a time when most of the continent was still carved up among colonial powers. 
Liberia stood beside the United States throughout the cold war, supporting its proposals in the United Nations, allowing it to erect a strategic Voice of America radio tower to spread the anti-Communist gospel and playing host to what Liberia's outspoken Roman Catholic archbishop, Michael Francis, recalled as a small village of C.I.A. agents. Today, the archbishop is among the loudest voices calling for American intervention to stop the war. 
"The U.S. has a moral obligation," he said in a recent interview. "We need an intervention force to keep the peace, to disarm the belligerents, to create an atmosphere where there is some security."
He spoke from the study at his home because the Catholic Secretariat had been ransacked. A member of the House of Representatives claimed responsibility and threatened to kill him next.

HEADLINE: As Putnam Develops, a Bid to Protect the Water Supply 

BYLINE:  By MARC FERRIS 

DATELINE: PUTNAM VALLEY 

 BODY:
IN Putnam County, Westchester's less developed neighbor to the north, the talk is of an invasion. Refugees from New York City and from Westchester are coming, Putnam residents say, and the county needs to protect itself from willy-nilly development coming from the south.
 But in the last few months, the tables have turned, and now people in three towns and the gritty river city of Peekskill are seeking powers to protect their water supply from development pressures in Putnam County. 
 Two months ago, 40 residents of Peekskill and Putnam Valley, Yorktown and Cortlandt, organized a group, Hollow Brook Water Watch, to challenge any development proposals that might harm the Peekskill Hollow Brook watershed, said the group's president, Andrew Fischer, of Cortlandt. The watershed supplies about 10 percent of Cortlandt's water and 90 percent of Peekskill's water, Mr. Fischer said. Westchester has designated the 48-square-mile watershed as a Critical Environmental Area. 
 Rising housingprices near the city have pushed developers and home buyers farther north into Putnam's woodsy lands, raising prices of Putnam County homes and acreage to levels hard to resist for owners. 
 That development has brought a backlash of groups ranging from grassroots advocates like the Hollow Brook Water Watch to the Nimham Mountain Singers, specialists in American Indian values and music of the Wappinger tribe, which once called all the land that could be seen from atop the 1,350-foot Nimham Mountain home. 
 Putnam County's motto, "Where the Country Begins," is apt: It is possible to drive for miles on some roads without seeing a traffic light. Most local water is drawn from wells, though several of the county's reservoirs are links in the chain that supplies the majority of Westchester's and New York City's tap water. The city owns about 9 percent of the county's land, which is kept pristine to protect the watershed. 
 Water is just one of the development issues in Putnam. Antidevelopment forces say sprawl -- and the potential for more -- threatens to destroy the largely rural way of life enjoyed by longtime residents and by newcomers. Historic preservation, building moratoriums and tough environmental laws are on the agenda of the Putnam Valley Residents' Coalition, whose slogan is "Putnam Valley: Worth Fighting For." 
 "When you cross from Westchester into Putnam off of Route 6, it's like coming out of a rabbit hole into what looks like Vermont," said Wendy Whetsel, president of the coalition. "That sprawl has already begun to spill over here." Just behind her 1800's farmhouse, a 15-unit subdivision consisting mostly of modular homes, selling in the $500,000 to $600,000 range, is under construction. 
 Joining the Concerned Residents of Southeast and the Concerned Residents of Kent/Mahopac, formed in the late 1990's, along with the Web site www. planputnam.org, which is a forum on development issues, the 250-member Putnam Valley residents' coalition was incorporated last year. The coalition consolidated several neighborhood groups after a New Jersey-based developer floated the idea of building a hotel with a conference center, a small college, stores and 124 units of senior housing at Bryant Pond, just off the Taconic State Parkway. The proposal has since been scrapped. 
 "That project was the epitome of smart development, but they were opposed even to that," Carmelo Santos, Putnam Valley town supervisor, said of the residents' coalition. "It would have created a community confined to 40 acres on a 100-acre plot. The issue is, can you stop the influx of people coming into the county?" 
 Last month, both houses of the State Legislature passed a bill to empower the city of Peekskill with the same enforcement capabilities in Putnam County that New York City has over its water supply system, said State Assemblywoman Sandra R. Galef, who represents parts of Westchester and western Putnam County and sponsored the bill in the Assembly.
 Watershed areas in the eastern part of the Putnam that feed New York City and Westchester, including the East Branch, the West Branch and the Croton Falls reservoirs, situated in the towns of Carmel and Southeast, sites of the county's most concentrated development, are impaired portions of the city system, said James Tierney, Watershed inspector general for the state attorney general. 
 "The leading cause of pollutants is not wastewater treatment or dumping, it's polluted runoff from impervious surfaces," he said. "Sprawl harms water quality. In order to have built-up places like New York City and Westchester, you need places like Putnam County to stay rural."
 Similar pressures threaten the Putnam Valley watershed. Unlike New York City, which owns the 14,460 acres in the county that it patrols, Peekskill enforcement officers would have jurisdiction only over dumpers or loiterers, said Ms. Galef, not over zoning or planning in Putnam Valley that might affect the watershed, because of the state's home rule statutes.
 Protecting the land is part of the American Indian values that are celebrated by the Nimham Mountain Singers, who appeared in Queens last weekend -- just days after their "Circle of Drums" celebration on Mount Nimham in Putman had been held despite sheets of rain. The group's founder is Gil Tarbox, who said, "To us, the drums are the heartbeat of the earth; that's what we were there to celebrate," he said. 
 One potential site of development battles is Oregon Corners, Putnam Valley's main crossroads. A proposal to open a cafe along a 307-foot stretch of Oscawana Brook, which feeds the Peekskill Hollow Brook, prompted the the Peekskill planning department to write to the town of Putnam Valley in March, expressing concerns over the potential impact on water quality.
 During tough economic times, increasing real estate values, tax revenues and jobs are appealing, said the county executive, Robert Bondi. "We pride ourselves on our ability to be able to balance the future with the past."
 Even Mr. Fischer conceded that the middle ground is wide. Golf courses, for instance, have long been targets of antidevelopment forces. But now, he said, things are different. When he heard about a proposed golf course along the Peekskill Hollow Brook in Cortlandt, for instance, "I was the first to say 'no way, let's run these guys out of town,"' he said. "Now, I fully support it. The developer worked with the town government and we negotiated our concerns."
 Divergent views of progress are at the core of the problem, said Ms. Galef. "My Putnam constituents like their dirt roads and want the keep them that way. In Westchester they beg me to pave them."

Waving the Flag for Artistic Freedom

BYLINE:  By PAUL LUSTIG DUNKEL; Paul Lustig Dunkel is music director of the Westchester Philharmonic.

 BODY:
HERE is a quiz for you to take: 
 Rubato is: a. Tony Soprano's middle name; b. A four-star Italian restaurant in Yonkers; c. An opera by Verdi; d. None of the above. 
 If you guessed "d" then treat yourself to a post-Fourth of July hot dog. If you knew "rubato" was Italian for "robbed," then throw in a beverage. And if you knew it referred to freedom in musical performance - literally robbing one beat at the expense of another -- you're eligible for a grand prize. 
 Freedom in performance is something I take for granted. My teachers taught me to play musical phrases with flexibility, but only after I could play them in strict rhythm. "You will play the music without fooling around first, and then you can break the rules," my piano teacher said to me in her thick German accent, adding encouragement with a ruler directed at my offending fingers. It was not a lesson that fell on deaf ears or bruised knuckles. All performing artists go through the process (hopefully less bruisingly). Only after one has painstakingly mastered the mechanics is the ingredient of rubato added to the mix. 
 Freedom of performance is something I have also taken for granted. I've been privileged to perform music that I find challenging and lovable with colleagues I admire in places where I'm appreciated. I play for children and older people and everyone in between. On top of that I get paid. What a country! 
 But events of late are giving me pause. No, the Department of Home Security hasn't quashed Handel's "Fireworks" and the State Department hasn't ruled out Handel's "Israel in Egypt." The House of Representatives hasn't weighed in against Gershwin's "American in Paris" nor does the Christian Coalition object to "The Marriage of Figaro," though it features a little cross-dressing. 
 This is what's troubling me. Here in the United States, the government is using its economic and political system to wage a war against artistic freedom. Here are a few examples:
 A change in the tax codes that makes any corporation think twice about supporting the arts. Why should their employees and neighbors enjoy a night at the symphony or an afternoon at a museum when the bottom line comes first?
 The crippling of the National Endowment for the Arts. Remember the war over the Robert Mapplethorpe photographs?
 What about arts in our schools? Not when we need more time for state-mandated testing.
 Not to mention rolling back inheritance laws and bigger interest on college loans.
 All of these are deadly weapons against artistic freedom and the exchange of ideas. Artistic messengersdie a slow but painful death. And so do audiences.
 Wouldn't it be efficient if the news media were owned by a handful of conglomerates? Fewer issues and a select editorial clique. 
 If America hasn't led the league in great orchestras, opera and ballet companies in the 20th century, it's news to me. If we haven't produced outstanding composers, artists and writers, that's news to me, too.
 It has happened because we have invested in the arts. The arts enhance the quality of our lives. The study of the arts shapes mind and character. Exhibit A: Albert Schweitzer played the organ. 
 Our most important national holiday has just gone by and people are turning their attentions to shopping for Christmas. 
 We need to worry about freedom for a few more days. The National Rifle Association is doing a swell job protecting our freedom to bear arms. 
 It's freedom of expression that needs your help. Let's make this the Year of Rubato.

HEADLINE: Views of the Bridge 

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO 

 BODY:
ALEXANDER SAUNDERS, a foundry owner from Garrison, wants a Tappan Zee tunnel. Robert Hintersteiner, a freelance engineer from White Plains, wants a three-deck Tappan Zee bridge with six lanes on each level. Jeffrey Anzevino, a planner with Scenic Hudson, wants a bridge about the size of the current one, in the hope of preventing further sprawl. John Shields, the mayor of Nyack, wants to keep every piece of property in his town intact during the rethinking of the Hudson River crossing. Stan Kachnowski, a father of two young children from Tarrytown, wants clean air during construction of whatever is built or rebuilt or changed. 
 And Christopher A. Waite, project manager, and Janet Mainiero, deputy project manager, the experts who lead the team to create the next incarnation of the Tappan Zee Bridge (or tunnel, or both), want to hear the views of all these people, and morel. 
 "The public deserves no less," Ms. Mainiero said in an interview in her office on the future of this crucial link between Westchester and Rockland Counties on Interstate 287 across the Hudson River. 
 To make everybody happy is impossible. "I don't envy you," John Edwards, a resident of White Plains, told the experts sympathetically at a forum this spring on the bridge's future. "You've got to consider light rail. You've got to revamp the Bee-Line. You've got to think about the cost. You have a monstrous job."
 It seems, at least for now, that the Tappan Zee team is trying to listen to everyone as part of a process that is expected to include myriad public forums, decision deadlines, studies, comparisons of options and other steps designed to winnow the current list of choices from 156 down to a final design by the end of 2005. A few people have each spent thousands of hours and dollars to turn themselves into engineers, tunnel experts and public health specialists to contribute to the process of making a decision on what to do with the bridge: whether and how and when to replace it or rehabilitate it. 
 There is no doubt the Tappan Zee Bridge is well past its prime. Designed to last half a century, the bridge is 47 years old. It handles 130,000 vehicles a day on average. It was built to handle 100,000. 
 During rush hours, cars frequently line up bumper to bumper in a honking, immobile fury. The bridge, with three lanes in each direction and a seventh, central and reversible lane used to handle commuting traffic in peak hours, is an indisputable bottleneck. Weekends and holidays can be a nightmare; people have been known to carefully plot trips to avoid the bridge.
 The New York Thruway Authority has declared the bridge, officially called the Governor Malcolm Wilson Tappan Zee Bridge, safe for now, and says that if it is properly repaired and maintained, it could last another 50 years. But prolonging its life will require an initial $1 billion to enhance its ability to withstand earthquakes, according to data released by a governor's task force in 2000. Maintenance costs are another factor; they are much higher for an old bridge than they would be for a new one.
 Building a new, wider bridge -- with at least four lanes in each direction, and possibly two levels -- would cost about $4 billion, according to the same task force. 
 No money has been appropriated for any Tappan Zee repair or rehabilitation project, beyond money for the initial study. 
 LAST summer, the Thruway Authority and Metro-North Railroad created the project group on the Tappan Zee crossing's future. Mr. Waite is a highway engineer with the Thruway Authority, and Ms. Mainiero a transportation planner with Metro-North. And with that, the project, officially called the "Tappan Zee Bridge/ I-287 Corridor Alternatives Analysis and Environmental Review Process," began.
 Wraps, salad and lemonade were served at public meetings where state engineers and consultants solicited opinions. At an early morning meeting in April, vociferous (and sometimes cantankerous) residents voiced their concerns, while Mr. Waite and Ms. Mainiero patiently listened. Survey sites were set up three months ago at more than a dozen shopping malls across Rockland and Westchester to collect information on commuters' preferences. Outreach centers -- small offices in Tarrytown and Nyack -- opened their doors in late March to serve as de facto town squares for the Tappan Zee study. Surveys were also handed out at toll booths. 
 "This is more than usual for government agencies in terms of public outreach," said Christopher S. McBride, a traffic specialist with the New York office of the American Automobile Association, which has monitored public projects involving New York State drivers for decades. "They are trying to get people involved right from the start. They are trying to get everybody's perspective before narrowing down the options." 
 Sherwood Chorost, a trustee of Tarrytown, said, "They seem to be working closer with those who breathe the pollutants." Mr. Chorost has campaigned for a state study of the epidemiological effects of I-287 on the neighboring communities.
 The extensive outreach is a far cry from the days when the current Tappan Zee Bridge was designed in the 1950's. The release of its engineering plan in 1950 took many by surprise. Only three weeks earlier, Thomas E. Dewey, then governor of New York, had said no such plan existed. 
 The public nature of the process is also a far cry from events in the spring of 2000, when a study of the bridge was released by a governor's task force. The state's engineers and consultants -- haughtily, in the eyes of many residents -- declared the bridge decrepit and recommended that the state build a new one. Local residents felt the report failed to take account of the opinions and knowledge of people who lived near the bridge.
 Federal and state environmental laws make public involvement a requirement for federal and state financing. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 requires any governmental agency to disclose the full environmental impact of any project. The New York State Environmental Quality Review Act of 1978 specifically requires public participation in determining the environmental impact.
 Ms. Mainiero said, over a plate of salad at one meeting, that the team has been trying to follow "the spirit of the laws" instead of merely "the letters of the laws."
 The project team held three public meetings in Westchester, Rockland and Orange last January to solicit ideas. 
 In April, the project team invited interested individuals and organizations to a meeting where the team released the dozens of options generated by the public and crystallized by the project team. Many among the audience took notes and asked questions when the speakers used engineering jargon.
 "Have we heard you?" Mr. Waite, the project manager, asked repeatedly. "Is this what you have imagined?"
 A week later, the team held three public meetings where the options were presented and the team engineers explained the engineering challenges of the major models and answered questions around the large tables. 
 "Is an immersed tunnel cheaper than a bored tunnel?" a woman asked. "Not necessarily," answered John Eddy, an engineering consultant hired by the team. He then explained the costs involved in each type of tunnel. 
 While common perception holds that tunnels are more expensive than bridges to build, engineers said that was not necessarily the case. The team, which has not yet studied the quality of the rock beneath the Hudson River, declined to give even a rough estimate of a tunnel's cost. Nor has the team considered the cost of land for tunnel exits.
 Tunnel construction costs could vary widely. "It depends on whether you are drilling through rock or soil or chalk and what the tunnel diameter is," said Edward S. Plotkin, the co-chairman of team from New York Society of Professional Engineers to monitor the Tappan Zee project. 
 The English Channel tunnel, a 31-mile behemoth, cost $21 billion to build in 1994. The Tappan Zee tunnel would be 7-1/2 miles long at the longest. But inflation and other factors must also be reckoned with. 
 For the rest of this year, the Tappan Zee project team will narrow down the choices from the current 156 options, which could be mixed or matched -- a light rail system from Rockland to Westchester, for example, as well as a new bridge or tunnel. 
 The team plans to winnow the choices to about 15 semifinalists, using criteria including environmental impact, cost and the amount of traffic that option could handle. In the next step, which will span most of 2004, the choices will be narrowed down to about five finalists. A final decision is expected at the end of 2005. 
 Mr. Saunders, with the air of an absent-minded professor and unruly hair, has been a fixture at the public meetings. A 63-year-old foundry owner who studied metallurgy at M.I.T., Mr. Saunders has turned himself into a tunneling expert. He visited, at his own expense, many German and Swiss tunnels, attended tunneling seminars, and studied in detail the costs of building and maintaining a tunnel and bridge. He wants not just a Tappan Zee tunnel, but rather a tunnel that originates in Suffern, Rockland, traverses Westchester, crosses the Long Island Sound and ends in Syosset on Long Island. 
 Mr. Saunders's tenacity has won him respect and increasing access in the close-knit community of tunneling engineers. Herrenknecht A.G., one of Europe's largest tunneling companies, invited him to its German factory to discuss a Tappan Zee tunnel. The Robbins Company, an American tunnel maker, invited him to descend below the East River to watch the Queens No. 3 Water Tunnel in the making. 
 GOVERNMENT "people are usually gun shy about public projects," Mr. Saunders commented. "But Chris and Janet have even listened to the very antagonistic ones. They are unusually complete."
 Mr. Chorost is an "antagonistic" advocate. A Tarrytown trustee, Mr. Chorost, known as Sherry, is a former professor of statistics at the City University of New York and a clinical psychologist.
 He said he has spent thousands of hours on the Internet investigating the links between the proximity of major highways and diseases like cancer and asthma. He has sent officials with the Thruway Authority more than a 100 academic papers proving that traffic pollutants cause severe illnesses. He has founded an organization of elected officials from about three dozen towns and villages in the lower Hudson valley, Government United in Action for Responsible Development, to press public health concerns.
 "The Thruway doesn't want that," Mr. Chorost fumed recently in a telephone interview. "They don't want an epidemiological study."
 Although the Tappan Zee team will scrutinize any environmental issues, Mr. Waite said the kind of epidemiological study that Mr. Chorost has demanded is not feasible within the team's $15 million budget.
 Mr. Chorost, ever suspicious of government secrecy, has also been smoldering over something else. While his organization, sent two independent observers to watch the project team preparing for its first public meetings in January, the team has denied his request to dispatch another two observers to watch the engineers winnow down the options. 
 "There is still some trust issue," he said. 
 Mr. Waite and Ms. Mainiero responded that they wanted the engineers to make their choices without constant public pressure.
 The list of 156 options for the bridge's future include mundane ones, like reducing tolls for car pools and adding more buses, and fantastic ones, like creating a tunnel that emerges from a man-made island in the middle of the river to become a bridge for the rest of the crossing. 
 How to improve the life of a commuter is a focal point. Commuters by the tens of thousands drive from Rockland to Westchester every day to go to work in Westchester or New York City. The questions are many: Should free parking be offered to those using mass transit? Should the Port Jervis Line (from Port Jervis to Hoboken) be made more frequent so that more people from Rockland could cross over to Manhattan from Hoboken? Should ferry service be created between Nyack and Tarrytown? Others have suggested a bridge for vehicles and a tunnel for trains. One person has called for a three-deck bridge that connects with a Rockland and Westchester subway system. A third has proposed building a Yonkers bridge connecting the Cross County Expressway with the New Jersey Turnpike.
 The project team has carefully included every suggestion in their list of alternatives, which is posted on the Internet at the team's Web site, tzbsite.com. 
 For Mr. Waite, a stocky 53-year-old with mild manners, imagination is not enough. Every time someone suggests a project, he envisions the practical challenges. 
 Building a bridge linking Yonkers and Bergen County would mean having to consult with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, since a bridge at this location---- unlike the current one -- would lie within its jurisdiction. 
 "We could work with the Port Authority and New Jersey," Mr. Waite said, but bringing in two more parties could mean more delay.
 Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority, said no one has consulted with the agency about a Yonkers-Bergen bridge. He declined to comment further.
 A tunnel is what many in the community have clamored for. For one thing, building a tunnel would not displace the waterfront communities. Also, a tunnel would make it possible to filter automobile exhaust before it was released into the environment, reducing pollution. 
 Mr. Waite and his engineers have tried to tackle the challenges of crossing at what is one of the widest points of the water, and a spot where the banks are high on either side. Neither tunnel entrance could be too steep; if an entrance were, trains simply could not climb out of the hole, and cars would need to burn a lot of fuel to exit. All this means a tunnel would have to be very long. The experts say any tunnel would start between Exits 7 and 9 on I-287 on the Westchester side and end between exits 11 and 12 in Rockland. This makes a tunnel somewhere between 6 and 7-1/2 miles long; the current bridge is 3.1 miles long. "Will people living near the banks be willing to turn around after exiting the tunnel and drive back?" asked Mr. Waite. "Will they be willing to add 10, 20, 30 minutes a day to their commute time?"
 There is also money to consider. The economy is shriveling and the state, which is cash-strapped, has not set aside money for any new Tappan Zee crossing.
 But Mr. Waite, who has worked for the state's highway system since the mid-1970's and seen significant construction, said he was not too worried. 
 Perhaps Congress would appropriate money for the bridge, Mr. Waite said, or federal agencies might chip in. Perhaps the state could float bonds. As a last resort, he said, a private company could finance the project, and the state could pay the company back with income from the tolls.
 "When you have the right project," Mr. Waite said, "there will be money."

Before anything is built, rebuilt or modified, a team of experts is holding meetings to hear the views of the people in the neighborhood of the bridge. "The public deserves no less," said Janet Mainiero, deputy project manager, who is helping to head up the team to create the next version of the bridge.

Some of the choices are to retain the bridge, replace it with a bridge or a tunnel or a bridge and a tunnel or a half bridge and half tunnel. The road mapis there, but the final choice unknown. Retaining the bridgeThe current bridge could be widened to ease congestion and strengthened to withstand earthquakes. Replacing the bridgeA new bridge could be located just north or south of the current one. Depending on the deck design, rails could be installed for commuter trains or light rails.

Montauk Takes Out Some 'Rainy Day' Insurance

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH

 BODY:
WHEN it's raining in Montauk, what's there to do?
Not enough, apparently. And there's a growing sense among the merchants of Montauk, the easternmost point on Long Island and proud of it, that Montauk needs to be a little less isolated and a little more "Hamptons" if its visitors are going to be entertained when the weather doesn't cooperate.
 Last month, board members of the Montauk Chamber of Commerce voted to recruit businesses from outside Montauk to join the chamber. The idea is to give tourists more things to do when it rains, even if that means going as far afield as Connecticut. 
 The chamber hopes to recruit businesses like the Foxwoods casino near Norwich, Conn., and the Splish Splash water park in Riverhead. The chamber wants to include their marketing materials alongside those featuring such local stalwarts as Gurney's Inn and Spa, Viking's chartered fishing expeditions and Gosman's Restaurant. 
Not that Montauk lacks for attractions. Its appeal includes horseback riding at Rita's Stables, going out for bluefish on the Lazybones from the Johnny Marlin Dock and of course, 20 miles of sandy beaches.
Since much of Montauk's fun happens outdoors, its appeal all but disappeared last month, when more than six inches of rain fell, about double the usual amount. 
"Business is down by 20 to 30 percent" at many Montauk stores, said Jimmy Hewitt, a chamber director and the owner of the Shagwong restaurant, where visitors can rub shoulders with local fishermen at the bar, under the stuffed hammerhead shark. "We usually get a lot of seniors who come in May before rates go up. They didn't come this year."
So the chamber took a step toward making Montauk a little less weather-dependant by recruiting attractions outside the area as members. "We opted to allow membership from outside the village," said Paul Monte, a chamber director and the general manager of Gurney's Inn. "People who come to Montauk should have more options of things to do that are within an hour's drive."
Kiri Finnegan, the chamber's executive director, said: "The weather has such an impact on what people can do. The season got off to such a bad start, and the big debate in town is if it's the economy that's responsible, or the weather."
Some Montauk businesses beat the chamber to the punch. Last month, Joan Cass, a motel owner and a chamber director, started a jitney service that goes as far as the Tanger Factory Outlet Center in Riverhead on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Ms. Kass said she expected her ridership would be divided between workers who don't own cars and tourists who want to avoid driving in the famously congested East End summer traffic.
But the chamber directors' vote irked some local business owners. Ken Giustino, who publishes The Montauk Sun, a weekly newspaper, opposes the decision. "I think it's a bad idea," he said. "If there aren't enough things to do in Montauk, we need to create them. We need to do it ourselves, here, not start telling visitors to leave Montauk to find things to do."
By way of example, he said he backed a plan to build a museum at Camp Hero State Park. Theodore Roosevelt and his Rough Riders were quarantined at the camp after they returned from Spanish-American War. 
Others applauded the chamber's decision. Michael Hollander, the executive director of the Long Island Convention and Visitors Bureau, said he thought the chamber was moving in the right direction. 
"People look to do a number of different things on their vacation," he said. "They may want to go shopping, go to a museum, go to a park like Splish Splash. They can do these things" from Montauk, broadening its appeal as a destination.
Montauk's 3,000 motel rooms constitute nearly 20 percent of the Island's inventory, Mr. Hollander said. 
Using Montauk as a home base for day trips to the Hamptons and beyond is a strategy that travelers "in the know" have long used, said Mr. Monte of Gurney's. Montauk's motel rooms are generally far cheaper than the bed and breakfasts that prevail in East Hampton, and the boutique hotels in Southampton. 
This isn't the first time that Montauk has sought to cast a wider net. Andrea Gurvitz is the executive director of the Hamptons Visitors Council, a tourism promotion organization whose members are five village chambers within the Town of Southampton. "Montauk used to be part of the council, but they dropped out several years ago, when the Town of East Hampton did," Ms. Gurvitz said. At the time, "they said that what goes on in the Hamptons is not relevant to Montauk," she said.
Were they right?
Ms. Gurvitz paused a moment. "How do I say this? These are moderate-income places to stay. Montauk doesn't have the veneer of sophistication that the rest of the Hamptons have. It's a fishing destination. It's a family beach destination. Everything takes place on the beach or the wharfs."
But since bad weather is unavoidable, "it behooves them to market themselves" more broadly, she said. 
"I think that when they dropped out of the council, they missed a big opportunity," she added. "Now it's biting them on the foot."
John Keeshan, a real estate broker and director of the Montauk chamber, said that any plan to promote Montauk needed to keep the village's character in mind, because it was this character that attracted visitors in the first place. "Montauk is a little bit Carmel and it's a little bit Coney Island," he said. "That's what's special, and you don't want to change that."

HEADLINE: A Link to the Past, Back in Its Element 

BYLINE:  By CAROLINE B. SMITH

DATELINE: WEST SAYVILLE 

 BODY:
The Priscilla, one of four remaining oyster sloops to have commercially dredged the waters of the Great South Bay for scallops and oysters at the turn of the century, is back in its home waters.
 After a $400,000, 16-month restoration project by the Long Island Maritime Museum in West Sayville, the 115-year-old wooden boat, built in Patchogue in 1888, was relaunched last weekend at the museum's yard. Curators plan to put the boat back to work as an educational tool, sailing the bay while teaching passengers about wooden boats and Long Island's marine industries. 
 "We were always very confident that this day was going to happen," said Doug Shaw, director of the Maritime Museum, which took ownership of the 40-foot Priscilla in 1976. Federal, corporate and foundation grants and $50,000 raised locally provided the resources to save the boat, which was in desperate need of repair. 
"We spent about 20 years using her," Mr. Shaw said. "We sailed her actively. She went and represented the museum in two Operation Sail regattas in New York City." But an inspection six years ago revealed "that everything from the deck up -- the deck beams, the wheelhouse, everything -- was just rotted beyond any reasonable maintenance effort," Mr. Shaw said. 
Visibly moved as she recalled Priscilla's connection to her family's past, Audrey V. McCoskey, a great-great-granddaughter of George and Priscilla Rhinehart, the boat's original owners, said the restoration and relaunching ceremony brought back a lot of memories for her entire family, all of whom grew up around boats.
"She's beautiful," said Mrs. McCoskey, 71, who traveled from Ocala, Fla., for the ceremony. She said the family only learned of the boat's existence a decade ago but has been closely following its whereabouts and the restoration project ever since. 
Priscilla was built by Elisha Saxton in 1888 for the Rhineharts, who dredged the bay for oysters and scallops. After World War II it was converted into a yacht, rerigged from sloop to schooner and "made very pretty," Mr. Shaw said. Various owners used it recreationally, primarily on the North Shore, until Richard Dowd, the boat's last private owner, donated it to the museum in 1976. 
"The boat itself was beautiful but there was no single part of it that was worth keeping," said Josh Herman, lead builder in the museum's restoration of Priscilla. "The whole thing had to be replaced. Essentially, we replaced everything but the keel." 
Mr. Herman, a shipwright trained in Rockland, Maine, and Ricardo Vicente, another shipwright, worked steadily on the boat since March, with volunteers pitching in more than 150,000 hours of their time. 
Mr. Shaw said that Priscilla won't carry any passengers until it gets Coast Guard certification, which is expected in August, but that its rig will be raised and its seaworthiness tested the third week in July. 
Mr. Herman said, "I'm really looking forward to seeing it sailing and to have a bunch of people being able to see what this Great South Bay used to be full of.
"Oystering was a huge part of the economy on Long Island in the 1800's," he added. "So it's amazing to be able to work on a boat like that, rebuilding history." 
Of the approximately 700 oyster boats in Long Island's sailing oyster fleet in its heyday, four remain, including the 35-foot sloop Modesty, which also part of the Long Island Maritime Museum's 114-boat collection, Mr. Shaw said.
Modesty has national historic landmark status and Mr. Shaw said he was confident that Priscilla's application for such status would be granted when it is reviewed in November. Christeen, a third Long Island oyster boat, sits in the Waterfront Center in Oyster Bay, and Mystic Seaport in Connecticut is home to Nellie, the fourth survivor. 
Mr. Shaw said the sailing oyster boat gave way to motorized vessels in the 1920's and 30's. "The fate for a lot of these boats was to have their sailing rig removed and have a power motor put in them," he said. "But somehow, Priscilla and Modesty avoided that fate."
Mr. Dowd said the museum's decision to save Priscilla was an easy one. "Priscilla is a very important boat," he said. "But there are some old, wooden boats that sadly, you can't save them all. There are some that sort of fall by the wayside. It's just fortunate that this boat happened to come here and we had a board that was dynamic and interested in doing this project and were able to find all the key resource people that we needed." 
David Voehl, a great-great-grandson of the Rhineharts who traveled from Pine Brook, N.J., for the relaunching, has a more personal appreciation. "It's a fantastic thing to realize that part of your ancestry will be around museums for years to come," he said. "It's a continuance of something good."

The Stars Are Out For Movie Lovers

BYLINE:  By BARBARA DELATINER

 BODY:
ASK Alan Inkles, director of the Stony Brook Film Festival, why film festivals are so popular, and his response is because "festivals are very sexy."
 Festivals, Mr. Inkles said, enable film enthusiasts to see movies before everyone else does. "It's very cool, very sexy to see a film that's not out there yet," he said. 
 Debra Markowitz, director of the Long Island International Film Expo 2003, agrees that festivals offer "independent film aficionados the chance to see films not available anywhere else and right in their own neighborhoods."
She added, "A lot of our filmgoers are there because they know the people who made the films."
Over 16 days, Long Islanders will get to indulge their tastes for what is new in films at both the Expo, which is showing 17 features from Friday through July 17 in Malverne, and at the Stony Brook festival, which is showing 21 entries from July 16 through July 26. Between them, the two events are also showing 57 short films, some as short as three minutes.
Sponsored by the Long Island Film-TV Foundation, the Nassau and Suffolk County Film Commissions and the Nassau County Sports, Entertainment and Tourism Commission, the Expo emphasizes local productions. Ten of its features were filmed on the Island, most by local filmmakers.
These include "The Blue Lizard," a drama from Fred Carpenter of Shirley, to be shown on July 17; "First Person," Richard D'Angelo's look at reality television, scheduled for next Sunday; and "Malevolence," Steven Mena's thriller about a kidnapped child, to be shown on July 14.
"We had about 2,000 entries, and I guess because of the economy, most of them were shot as videos," Ms. Markowitz said.
Nine of the entries are world premieres, including "Dead Canaries," a gangland saga starring Dan Luria, Charles Durning and Dee Wallace Stone, to be shown on Saturday. The opening night film, "The Stand-In," with Kelly Ripa, David Ogden Stiers and Judith Ivey, is a Long Island premiere.
The festival winners will be honored at a gala on Aug. 21.
At Stony Brook, the feature line-up has three world premieres, including the one film shot locally, "Shelter Island," a thriller with Ally Sheedy and Stephen Baldwin, to be shown on July 18.
Eighteen entries are making their New York or regional debuts. These include "Resistance," a World War II drama with Bill Paxton and Julia Ormond, that will open the festival on July 16, and the closing film, "The Secret Lives of Dentists," Alan Rudolph's comedy about marriage with Campbell Scott, Hope Davis and Denis Leary, to be shown on July 26.
"Many of our films already have distributors and will have theatrical release later in the summer or in the fall," Mr. Inkles said.
Also to be shown is "September 11," a collection of 11 short films from international directors made in response to the terrorist attacks, which will be shown on July 20.
The 12 features in competition include the world premiere of "Dog Gone Love," a romantic comedy with Alexander Chaplin, Richard Kind and Lindsay Sloane, to be shown on July 17, and "American Gun," a drama that was James Coburn's final film, to be shown on July 23.
The Long Island International Film Expo 2003 is at Malverne Cinema 4 on Hempstead Avenue. Information: (516)571-3168. The Stony Brook Film Festival is at Staller Center on the Stony Brook campus of the State University of New York. Information: (631)632-2787.

HEADLINE: Holdouts in Suburbia 

BYLINE:  By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
LOOKING east from the Rottkamp Brothers Farm, fields of growing vegetables stretch as far as the eye can see, with rows of cornstalks disappearing into the horizon.
 The view to the north, though, is quite different. 
 There, a massive brick mansion, built a few years ago, looms over a neatly manicured berm that rises next to the dirt road alongside the 50-acre farm. So while the eastern vista could just as easily be in rural Iowa, the scene to the north is unmistakably suburban Nassau County and more precisely, Old Brookville.
The Rottkamp brothers, Ray and Richard, are fourth-generation farmers. They were just children when the family moved the farm from Elmont to Old Brookville in 1953. "When we came out here, it was country yet," said Ray Rottkamp, now 56. 
But over the years, other farmers have sold their land to developers and moved east into Suffolk County or gone out of business altogether, making the Rottkamp farm one of a handful of survivors in Nassau County. In fact, county officials say there are only four others, all smaller than the Rottkamps' farm.
The Rottkamps say they are constantly approached by developers seeking to buy their land. "We're not interested," Ray Rottkamp said. "We've been here too long, and we're going to stay as long as we can." But he acknowledged that he and his brother were likely the last farmers in their family: they each have two daughters who have shown no interest in going into the family business. 
It is precisely the fear that the Rottkamps' farm could be gobbled up by developers -- that McMansions would sprout in place of tomatoes and corn -- that prompted Nassau officials to start looking for ways to help preserve the county's farmland.
Wherever Thomas R. Suozzi, the county executive, talks about his vision for economic development, he talks about the need to preserve farms as a way of keeping open space in the county.
He reminds people that not too long ago, Nassau County was almost entirely farmland. Until the 1930's, it provided most of New York City's food. In 1945, he notes, Nassau had 14,000 acres of farmland; now there are less than 140. In 2001, Nassau's farms produced only $3.3 million in cash receipts, compared with $169 million in Suffolk, according to state figures.
"The marketplace, left to its owndevices, would have no farms in Nassau County because the land values are so high," Mr. Suozzi said. "But we don't want to be known just as the land of strip malls and Joey Buttafuoco." 
The county created an open-space fund last spring that will receive 5 percent of the proceeds of any county land sold, which Mr. Suozzi anticipates could bring in $5 million to the fund in the next few years. But with land in Old Brookville running as high as $1 million an acre, the fund clearly would not go very far toward buying development rights for existing farms.
So Mr. Suozzi has his planning department looking for federal and state grants. Given the county's precarious fiscal condition, it has no money to spare to further Mr. Suozzi's goal. "So we have to be creative," he said. "But at least we've put the issue on the radar screen."
The owners of the five farms identified by county officials each said they welcomed Mr. Suozzi's interest. Richard Rottkamp, 54, said that no one from the county government had ever before talked about trying to preserve farmland in Nassau County. "It's something to think about, sure," he said. "But we're really kind of isolated here, and realistically, who's going to want to buy it and take it over?"
Certainly, the Rottkamps and the other Nassau County farmers lead a way of life completely foreign to most of their neighbors, and farmers who are looking for land are not likely to consider Nassau and its suburban sprawl as a likely place to put down roots. But for the foreseeable future, Nassau's farmers said they were committed to staying where they are. Being the county's last farmers seemed a point of pride.
To survive, each of the farms has evolved over time and developed its own unique operation. The Rottkamps' vegetable farm is the largest and the only one that runs a farm stand and also trucks produce to the Hunts Point market in the Bronx.
Three much smaller farms sell all their produce at their own farm stands. Youngs Farm in Old Brookville is well known for its greenhouse tomatoes and its bakery. Grossmann's Farm in Malverne has a thriving greenhouse operation that sells garden plants in the spring and a country store that sells everything from scented candles and teddy bears to old-fashioned stick candy. Meyer's Farm sells all of the produce it grows in Woodbury at its farm stand there, supplementing the offerings with vegetables the family grows on another farm in Suffolk County. And the last farm is a vineyard operation, Banfi Vintners in Old Brookville with 47 acres of grapes. Banfi, which also owns Castello Banfi in Tuscany, produces Nassau County's only wine, Old Brookville Gold Coast Reserve Chardonnay.
While other farmers have sold their land and moved east, the Grossmann family never considered it, even though land in Malverne is going for as much as $500,000 an acre. "This is what we had, and this is what we did," said Liz Grossmann Rung, a fourth-generation Grossmann who works on the seven-acre farm, purchased by the family in 1895.
The family used to rent 25 more acres nearby until it was turned into a subdivision with 43 homes in the 1920's, shortly after the Southern State Parkway was built. After that, the Grossmanns decided to farm only their own land and to go into the retail business exclusively. 
"We're in a good spot for that," said George Grossmann, Ms. Rung's father. "We're where the people are, and we have our own niche." Mr. Grossmann turned 80 last month, but he still works on the farm, which he owns jointly with his 89-year-old sister, Barbara.
The Meyers are equally possessive about their 10-acre farm in Woodbury, which the family bought in the 1920's. It opened its farm stand in the 1950's, supplying it from the Woodbury operation and from 100 acres the family farms in Calverton. "But our primary location has always been Woodbury," said Stephen Meyer, who is 25 and is the youngest of three brothers in the fourth generation of Meyerses working on the farm. "The market's better because we're the only ones left her." 
Ms. Rung, 40, runs the Grossmann's greenhouse operation, and she says she doesn't have farm expertise. "Whether I could pick it up, it's not something I want to think about," she said, getting teary-eyed at the thought that one day her father will not be around to run the farm.
But she seems determined to keep the farm going. "We're surrounded by residential homes and two major roads, and it's not your normal farm picture," she said. "But it's important for school kids to see this. They think that chicken comes wrapped in cellophane and carrots come in plastic bags, but here they can see the real thing."
But while being in the heart of a heavily populated area is a boon to Nassau County farmers when it comes time to sell their produce, it can be a curse at other times. Instead of having neighbors who are fellow farmers and who are familiar with farming practices, they are surrounded by suburban homeowners who may be less understanding about the noise irrigation motors make at all hours or about the dust kicked up when the soil is plowed.
Bob Whiting, the estate and vineyard manager at Banfi, said neighbors have complained about noise from their pesticide sprayer and also about the imposing warning signs they are required by law to post around the vineyard when the grapevines are sprayed. "We try to abide by noise ordinances, and the signs are there for their own safety," he said. "But some people don't like the signs because they look at the vineyard like their personal park, and they don't like being told they can't use it." Mr. Whiting once had to call the police to stop one of the neighborhood boys from riding his dirt bike through the vineyard.
Along with the occasional clashes with the neighbors, the farmers said that being in Nassau County can also be a liability because they are so isolated from other farmers. In fact, there is so little sense of a farming community that each of the farmers was hard-pressed to name the other Nassau County holdouts. 
Mr. Whiting said being the only vineyard in Nassau County often makes Banfi "feel like an outpost in the middle of nowhere." 
Jo-Hana Youngs Gooth, who runs Youngs Farm with Paula Youngs Weir, her sister, said that they feel their isolation the most whenever one of their tractors breaks down and they have to have it towed out to Riverhead for repairs. "It's not like you can just run down to the corner and get a spare part," Ms. Gooth said. .
Ms. Gooth, 54, and her sister, 52, have built the farm stand, known as the Annex, into a local institution famous for its pies and pastries. The bakery, in an old potato barn, turns out 100 to 200 pies a day at the height of the summer season. "We're still here doing the vegetable part of the business because of the baking part," Ms. Gooth said. 
The sisters' main concern now is what will happen when their 82-year-old mother, Vivian Youngs, dies, and they inherit the 15-acre farm. Ms. Gooth said that until 1979, when their grandfather died, the family farmed 90 acres, but their father sold off 75 acres to help pay the inheritance tax. 
The land her father sold stayed in agriculture because it went to Banfi Vintners. "It was the only good thing about having to sell," Ms. Gooth said.
Families who live near the farms sing their praises and say they have been good neighbors and pillars of the community. Lucille Fletcher has lived in a house adjoining the Rottkamp farm for the last 15 years. "Their farm is the reason I bought this house," she said.
To be sure, there were certain things Ms. Fletcher's suburban family had to get used to. There were the crow guns, machines that emit intermittent loud bangs to frighten away birds that might devour the Rottkamps' crops. And then there are the flies, which seem to come every August as the crops ripen, and the heavy manure smell, which fills the air when the Rottkamps fertilize. 
"But these are all things we put up with because it's so beautiful to be able to look over my fence onto their fields," Ms. Fletcher said. "It's priceless."
Polly Kahn, who lives in Old Brookville near the Banfi vineyards and Youngs Farm, said she, too, enjoyed the simple beauty of the farmland. "It's a great pleasure to be near them," she said. "Heaven knows if they ever sell that property, there would be a hundred houses there, and that would be awful."

HEADLINE: SOAPBOX; 
An Antagonist's View of Dean Skelos

BYLINE:  By HELENA WILLIAMS; Helena Williams, a resident of Garden City, is a deputy county executive of Nassau County.

 BODY:
AN Antagonist's View of Tom Suozzi" was an apt headline for State Senator Dean G. Skelos' essay opinion, June 29 . Senator Skelos's personal attack on the county executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, was unwarranted and untrue. 
 Terming Nassau's fiscal problems "primarily self-inflicted," Mr. Skelos's view grossly distorts history. Nassau's financial troubles stem from two sources: decades of mismanagement by the Nassau County Republican administration and the untenable burden of state-mandated expenses. As a longtime Republican leader and a state legislator, it's no wonder Mr. Skelos would seek to deflect criticism. 
 The taxpayers of Nassau County elected Mr. Suozzi to fix the mess after decades of Republican failure. In just 18 months, our administration has balanced the budget and eliminated more than 1,000 county jobs, cutting the work force bymore than 12 percent. We have canceled expensive politically connected contracts, cleaned up scandal-ridden departments and rooted out waste, fraud and abuse. "Smart government" initiatives have saved nearly $100 million in taxpayer money. For the first time in more than a decade, Nassau County's credit rating was upgraded by Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Moody's Investors Service.
As part of our approved four-year financial recovery plan, we needed the help of New York State to save $25 million per year.
In April 2002, we submitted to Albany legislation to create a sewer and storm water authority that would consolidate the current hodgepodge of 27 sewage-collection districts and 3 sewage-disposal districts. Reorganizing the county's sewer and storm-water operations into a single authority would allow it to refinance debt at interest rates that are much lower than those available to the smaller, scattered districts. Employees performing storm water-related functions would be transferred to the new authority, relieving the county's General Fund budget of their recurring salary expenses. Our proposal guaranteed no increase in sewer taxes for four years. This is a win-win for county government and county taxpayers.
This proposal received the unanimous support of NIFA, the state's fiscal watchdog, which includes appointees of the state's top two Republicans, Governor Pataki and the State Senate leader, Joseph Bruno. The proposal received the endorsement of the three major Wall Street rating agencies, the county and state Civil Service Employees Association, Newsday's editorial board, News 12's editorial department and almost every Long Island business organization, including the Long Island Association and the Association for a Better Long Island. The League of Conservation Voters hailed the plan as "a model" for storm-water management and financing. 
While the proposal did not pass by the close of the 2002 legislative session, Mr. Skelos said, "In the weeks and months ahead, we will continue working with Mr. Suozzi and NIFA to refine the county executive's sewer and storm water authority proposal."
Following the end of the 2002 session, our staff worked extensively with Mr. Skelos's office and Assemblyman Thomas DiNapoli to achieve the results needed -- a stronger bill, with considerable protections for the county's taxpayers and the environment.
It is clearly a myth to assert that neither the Senate nor the public had any involvement in the legislation, as it was refined over the 15 months from our original proposal. There was painstaking work done on our proposed bill for many months. These efforts included over a dozen meetings in Albany with Senate and/or Assembly staff, easily 100 telephone calls and more than 30 e-mails. The proposal has been covered extensively by the news media, and Mr. Suozzi personally briefed participants at more than 15 economic development meetings all across Nassau County.
In fact, Mr. Skelos's chief of staff led a delegation of more than 30 government officials from the Senate, Assembly and the governor's office to Nassau County on Oct. 17, 2002, to join Nassau County and NIFA staff in analyzing our proposed legislation. The senator's office used outside counsel and an outside engineering company to review the complexities of the bill. 
After more than a year of work, the bill passed the Democratic-controlled State Assembly last month but failed in the Republican-controlled State Senate.
The truth be known, there was no governmental reason left to oppose the bill. The failure of the State Senate to pass this legislation was, in fact, a politically motivated rejection of our sound and well-considered proposal, denying the residents of Nassau County much-needed recurring fiscal relief. We urge the Senate delegation to reconsider their position.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
A Leader Who Showed the Way for Generations of Artists

BYLINE:  By BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO

DATELINE: Newark 

 BODY:
DOES Spike Lee owe his success, in part, to Gordon Parks?
 You'd have to ask Mr. Lee, I guess, although Mr. Parks's early success as a photographer and filmmaker was an important source of inspiration for a generation of aspiring black artists, in the way that Sidney Poitier became a role model for a generation of black actors. Mr. Parks was the Jackie Robinson of the art world, you could say. 
 Mr. Parks, 90, is the subject of a touring retrospective at the Newark Museum. It is a huge show, with nearly 200 photographs spanning his 60-year career. Significant works from Mr. Parks's major series of photographs are here, including his gritty 1940's work for the Farm Services Administration, important assignments as a staff photographer for Life, and more recent forays into color fashion photography. 
 Mr. Parks was very good at what he did, which can best be described as photojournalism. But claims that his photographs should be regarded as fine art are misguided.
 The message of his retrospective is that while competent, technically, Mr. Parks's photographs have little consistent personality or style of their own. He was a camera for hire, shooting subjects rapidly and emotively, to meet a pressing deadline. Thinking of these images as art would be a bit like mistaking daily newspaper journalism for literature.
 Mr. Parks's best photographs are his early individual and group portraits, particularly those that document black America. "Children With Doll" (1942) shows two poor black children, oblivious to the racially divided world in which they are growing up, playing on the dirty floor of a tenement with a brown-haired, white-skinned wooden doll. Taken years before such images became trite, and commonplace, the picture stands as a powerful metaphor for the nastiness of segregation. It also suggests that, in the innocence of childhood, humans are colorblind. 
 Other early portraits worth looking out for are "Ella Watson and Her Grandchildren" (1942) and "New England Family" (1943). Both are carefully staged group ensembles, and remarkable for their compositional sophistication.
 The doorframe running down the center of "Ella Watson and Her Grandchildren" splits the image in two, contrasting the older woman and her grandchildren with a mirror image of her daughter, the mother of the children, pictured next to a photograph of her grandparents. It's all about the bonds of family and the passage of time, and the way love freshens up even the most impoverished of homes. 
 The rest of Mr. Parks's prolific output shows a high incidence of failure. When a work succeeds, however, it stands out a mile.
 For instance, "Red Jackson and Herbie Levy Study Wounds on Face of Slain Gang Member Maurice Gaines," part of a 1948 series on Harlem gangs for Life, is captivating. Stripped of their bravado, the two young men stare with a startled expression at their friend in a coffin, his face tanned and greasy from the cosmetic paint used to hide his wounds. They cannot hide their horror.
 Perhaps the best portrait in the show is "Gambling Woman" (1949). Partly what's special about this tough image is that it is not derivative, like many of Mr. Parks's photographs, and partly that, with a startling economy of means, it tells us so much about its subject. The elegant simplicity of the woman's pendant suggests taste but not wealth, while the absence of rings and low, strapless dress point to her being a courtesan. But most telling is her face; hardened from years of disappointment as she stares absently at the roulette wheel. It's her last hope.
 "Gambling Woman" stands alone as a complete and coherent image, telling us all we need to know about this woman at a gambling table. Her name is irrelevant, as is the place, for we recognize immediately who and what she is. This is precisely what's missing from so many of Mr. Parks's journalistic photographs, which often seem reliant on a text caption to tell you what's going on. Perhaps this is a legacy of his years at Life, where his images were usually published as photo essays accompanied by captions. 
 Aside from photographs, the exhibition contains cabinets filled with copies of his novels, image books and musical compositions, as well as an autobiographical film downstairs.
 Craig Rice's biographical film, "Half Past Autumn: The Life and Works of Gordon Parks," will be shown at the museum on Wednesday as part of the 29th Annual Newark Black Film Festival. With its message of hope in the face of adversity, it is sure to give courage to a new generation of African-American artists and filmmakers. Whatever we might think about Mr. Parks's photographs, his example and influence live on.
 "Half Past Autumn: The Art of Gordon Parks" is at the Newark Museum, 49 Washington Street, through Aug. 31. Information: (973)596-6550 or www.newarkmuseum.org.

HEADLINE: On the Boardwalk 

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

DATELINE: ASBURY PARK 

 BODY:
IT is late morning down the Jersey Shore. The sun has burned through the clouds and hangs low over the Atlantic Ocean, which stretches like a slate blanket beyond the boardwalk, a lonely, nearly mile-long strip of warped and splintered wood that long ago had the life drained from it.
 On this day, Sal Marino and Richard Handschuch are among a small clutch of people strolling on the boards, as has become their habit. Since the men, both in their 60's, retired from teaching several years ago, they have turned their love of the seashore and quest for fitness into a second career of sorts as boardwalk chroniclers. They are the authors of "The Beach Bum's Guide to the Boardwalks of New Jersey" (Beach Bum Press), which offers tidbits about the state's 41 boardwalks, 28 of which follow the shore in a broken line from Sea Bright in the north to Cape May in the south. 
 Strung -- or, perhaps, hammered -- end to end, the oceanfront boardwalks would total 32 miles. Most are still made of wood, but some are of other materials like recycled wood and plastic board, brick pavers, concrete, macadam or some combination of them. 
 Oceanside boardwalks, which date from the 1800's, are the foot-friendly main streets of the beach communities, a place for people to gather at land's end, where the air is salty and cars and traffic do not intrude. Whether they are lined with rides, games and fast-food stands or simply offer uncluttered views of the ocean, boardwalks are -- befitting New Jersey's tradition of home rule -- as different as the communities themselves. Having known better and worse times, they also hold secrets to their towns' pasts and, in some cases, a key to their futures.
 Some boardwalks, like the one in Atlantic City -- considered the granddaddy of them all at 4 1/8 miles-- grew from a simple walkway to a tourist attraction and, despite some modern touches and updates, are content to remain so. 
 "Our boardwalk is really a boulevard," said Vicki Gold Levi, an Atlantic City historian and the author, with Lee Eisenberg, of "Atlantic City: 125 Years of Ocean Madness." "The others are just paths."
 Other towns along the 127-mile-long Jersey coast might take issue with that characterization. For instance, the boardwalks in Seaside Heights, Ocean City, Point Pleasant Beach as well as Wildwood and its sister city, North Wildwood, are also dedicated to the proposition that between Memorial Day and Labor Day people should venture to the Jersey Shore to play skeeball and ride a Ferris wheel. 
 On others, like the 1.8-mile stretch in Spring Lake, no commercial amusements ever stood or likely ever will. Still other boardwalks, such as those in Long Branch and Asbury Park, like the towns themselves, are struggling to make a comeback. 
 In Long Branch, there are plans to turn the 2.2-mile-long boardwalk into a year-round destination by luring tourists with boutiques and restaurants. In Asbury Park, a town mired in a seemingly endless renovation, there are hopes to transform the moribund boardwalk, slightly less than a mile, into a modern version of the entertainment center that it was in its heyday.
 Mr. Marino, his curly hair stuffed under a cap, said he felt a bit sad when he and Mr. Handschuch walked the boards in Asbury Park. For them, the ghosts of a more glorious day entertain their minds and their own youthful memories claim their hearts.
 The men say that when they were teenagers in the 1950's, the boardwalk was the place to take dates after a movie -- a place to walk under the stars, let the sea breezes kiss their faces, hear the waves pound the shore and become swept up in the romance of it all.
 That romance is gone today, as are most of the amusements and fast-food stands. As a nod to its Spartan look, there is a sign stuck in the corner of a shop window that reads: Alarm Calls Police.
 "Show me the baby carriages, the young people," Mr. Handschuch said as he extended his arms and turned his lanky frame from side to side. "It is not the same. But it has to come back, the boardwalk and the city. You can't have one without the other."

The New Train to the Sea
 In the mid 1800's, the Camden and Atlantic Railroad came to Atlantic City, largely through the efforts of Jonathan Pitney, a physician from Absecon, and Richard Osborne, a civil engineer from Philadelphia. The two men convinced investors to finance 60 miles of tracks from Camden to the sandy hamlet of Atlantic City, which they touted as a health resort where the surf and sea could cure the ills of most urbanites.
 By the end of the century, several rail lines snaked along the coast carrying people to the sea. In turn, some sleepy shore towns like Ocean City, Seaside Park and Wildwood blossomed into resorts.
 Atlantic City is credited with inventing the raised wooden boardwalk in 1870. It sprang from practicality, a way concocted by a hotel owner, Jacob Keim, and a railroad conductor, Alexander Boardman, to keep sand off floors and furniture in hotel rooms and railroad cars. 
 Two months after Mr. Keim and and Mr. Boardman petitioned the city for a "footwork," a mile-long street that sat 10 inches above the sand was built at a cost of $5,000. It was designed to be taken apart and packed away for the winter. By the end of the 19th century, a collection of modest boardwalks dotted the Jersey Shore.
 In the intervening years, boardwalks grew wider and more substantial, rose higher above the sand and ultimately became permanent. Atlantic City's boardwalk was among the first to have railings, which early accounts say became necessary to keep flirtatious strollers from falling off.
 Boardwalks also drew businesses as well as amusements. "All of a sudden, the real estate on both sides of the boards became important," said Nory Hazaveh of SOSH Architects, who has worked on several boardwalk projects over the last 22 years. 
 One of the state's first amusement piers opened in Atlantic City in 1882 -- Howard's Pier at the end of Kentucky Avenue -- offering vaudeville acts and concerts. Others followed along the Shore, including the famous Steel Pier, also in Atlantic City, where for about 50 years a horse and a rider were featured plunging 40 feet into a pool of water. Amusement rides like the carousel began thrilling summer visitors in the late 1870's. 
 By the early 1900's, the boardwalk was a fixture in many shore towns. Most were pedestrian paths, but some fronting oceanfront luxury hotels took on the air of high-society promenades. Men and women dressed in their finest strolled the boardwalk, soaking in the sun and watching the main attraction -- the ocean.
 Later, boardwalks also held Easter parades, baby contests and other community events. And some towns made amusements and their attendant hurly-burly atmosphere the heart of their boardwalks.

Storms Punished the Boardwalks
 Yet over time, the boardwalks began showing their age -- many the victim of nature's fury. The hurricane of 1944 and a northeaster in 1962 are said to have landed the strongest punches, swallowing several walkways. Towns like Stone Harbor, Beach Haven, Margate and Bay Head deemed boardwalks costly and precarious structures and chose not to rebuild them.
 For resorts like Long Branch, Atlantic City and Asbury Park, the glitter and glamour of the boardwalk began fading in the 1950's, in some measure because of the Garden State Parkway, which in knifing through the state from north to south provided easy access to nearby states. Air travel put even more far-flung destinations within reach, making the seaside hotels and motels seem a second-rate vacation choice.
 Entertainment patterns also changed, notes Helen-Chantal Pike, a New Jersey author, and that put boardwalks in competition with sprawling amusement parks like Disney World in Florida and, closer to home, Great Adventure in Jackson Township.
 By the 1970's and 80's, while some resorts withstood the changing tide, others slid into decline and their once lively boardwalks turned seedy. Fires, including those of the intentional variety, ravaged other piers and amusement areas.
 Jim Futrell, research director of the Pittsburgh Regional Alliance, an economic development organization, said that in the last 30 years the state lost 7 of its 14 boardwalk amusement areas. Still, Mr. Futrell, who is writing a book on New Jersey amusement parks, said, "No other state has the level of seashore amusements."
 Of the 14 major amusement attractions in the state, half are on boardwalks, according to the New Jersey Amusement Association, which represents 95 percent of the amusement operators in the state.
 Though no figures are available on the effect of boardwalk businesses on the overall state economy, Anthony Catanoso, president of the amusement association and owner of Steel Pier, said, "The Great Wooden Way could be termed as the Great Green Way as it relates to New Jersey tourism."
 To those who will be backed up at bridges and toll booths this summer, Nancy Byrne, the state director of tourism, said that in 2001, the latest year for which figures are available, 103 million trips were taken to the Jersey Shore and visitors spent $16.6 billion. 
 In an age of computers and high-tech gadgetry, Mr. Futrell says that what is most surprising is that the appeal of boardwalk amusements remains the same. "It is the simple pleasure of walking alongside the ocean, of hearing the waves crash," he said.
 And having so many amusements in one spot, he added, is "electric."
 That kind of boardwalk tradition continues in towns like Point Pleasant Beach, Ocean City, Wildwood, Seaside Heights and Seaside Park. Though each has its own distinct atmosphere and has changed with the times, each has managed to remain a prized antique.
 The boardwalk in Point Pleasant Beach, for instance, stretches for a mile and abounds with family rides, arcades, food concessions, a Victorian-style ice cream parlor and amusements, including one of the only fun houses left on the shore. 
 Similarly, in Ocean City, a resort founded in 1879 by four Methodist ministers as a Christian retreat, the boardwalk has shops and myriad amusement rides. But there are no games of chance, and the sale of alcohol is prohibited anywhere in town, sparing Ocean City what some say is the fraternity house environment of other shore towns during the summer.

'A Traditional Boardwalk'
 There is a faster pace along the nearly mile-long boardwalk in Seaside Heights, dedicated to arcades and amusements. The northern tip of the boardwalk in neighboring Seaside Park is much the same, but the rest of Seaside Park's 1.7-mile-long boardwalk has only an occasional gazebo and offers unobstructed views of the ocean.
 Maria Maruca, executive director of the Seaside Heights Business Improvement District, said that after "prom weekends," when high school seniors flood the boardwalks, families and baby strollers take over, at least during the day. Then after 11 p.m., Ms. Maruca said, seven bars and restaurants draw the young back to the boards.
 "Buildings may be improved and games may become more sophisticated, but ours is a traditional boardwalk," said Ms. Maruca, whose family owns Maruca's Pizza, a boardwalk staple since 1950. "When grandparents come, we want the boardwalk to feel the same to them as when they were kids."
 Still, some shore communities, and by extension their boardwalks, have reinvented themselves over the last 30 years. Cape May, for instance, returned to its Victorian past, while Atlantic City opened its doors to casinos and all the attendant glitz. Wildwood, seemingly a suburb of South Philadelphia, has nurtured a Doo-Wop theme by highlighting its mid-century American roadside architecture, including about 280 motels built from the late 1940's to the early 1960's.
 "While we bottomed out in the early 1990's, people still came to the boardwalk," said Patrick Rosenello, director of the Wildwoods Boardwalk Special Improvement Distrist Management Corporation. "It kept the towns alive." 
 The Doo-Wop theme is evident on the combined boardwalks, which extend over two miles, with stylized neon signs -- such as a 20-foot-high sign of two French fries that beckons passersby to Curley's Fries -- injecting a bit of Times Square onto the Jersey Shore. 
 In addition, Mr. Rosenello said, a larger convention center opened on the boardwalk last year to help draw higher-end retail shops and restaurants. Additional housing is also planned above boardwalk retail stores to "bring in more year-round clientele," he said.
 But the biggestc changes since casinos began rising in Atlantic City more than 25 years ago are those promised in Long Branch and Asbury Park.
 On a recent Saturday, the boardwalk in Long Branch teemed with walkers, joggers and clusters of people taking advantage of a group of picnic tables in front of the West End Pavilion at the far southern reaches. Yet despite the activity, the boardwalk is clearly in transition.
 It is a far different place than it was in the 1800's, when Long Branch was among the nation's first seashore resorts, as well as in the 1950's through the 1980's, when amusements and rides crowded its pier and extended to an area on the west side of the boardwalk. 
 In June 1987, a fire destroyed the restaurants and amusements on the pier, leaving a charred skeleton. The amusement area on the west side of the boardwalk closed the following year. Finally, in the 1990's -- with the city on a downward slide and the boardwalk virtually a ghost town -- the pier was razed.
 Anthony Giordano, a Long Branch councilman who grew up in the resort town and worked at the amusement area during the summer in high school and college, remembers when the boardwalk was a spot for seasonal family fun. But he said plans for the future would more closely reflect the city's current face as more of a year-round destination, complete with a rebuilt pier for ferries to Manhattan and Atlantic City and an amphitheater at the far end.
 By the end of this summer, the Applied Development Company of Hoboken plans to begin construction on two oceanside retail buildings that will resemble structures that stood there in the 1930's and 40's.
 The new buildings are part of a larger development that will rise on the site formerly occupied by the amusement area and will include more stores and restaurants as well as 320 rental apartments. Greg Russo, a vice president at Applied, said a central plaza would link the two components, doubling as a space for concerts and plays -- but no rides and arcades.
 Then there is Asbury Park, where a renovated section of boardwalk stands out like a tan line next to the rest of the deserted mile-long stretch -- anchored by the Convention Hall/Paramount Theater complex to the north and the Casino building to the south. The two relics from the turn of the last century stand as melancholy symbols to the resort's faded charm.
 Still, there are other small signs of change, whether in the smattering of new concessions, a vacant retail pavilion that is being refurbished and a new restaurant.

Work Ahead in Asbury Park
 Mayor Kevin Sanders acknowledged the work ahead, but he insisted that the boardwalk he walked as a youth in the 1960's was turning around, "an egg ready to hatch."
 The hope is that one day the boardwalk will be transformed into an updated version of what it was throughout the last century -- a beachside social and entertainment center, a sort of SoHo meets South Beach -- with a mix of restaurants, nightclubs, boutiques and entertainment.
 "It will be an isle in the middle of all the activity," said Mr. Hazaveh of SOSH Architects. "Boardwalks die when the life is taken out of them."
 Under the noontime sun, Sal Marino and Richard Handschuch inspect the new section of boardwalk. "People have to have a reason to come, like they did in the 1870's," Mr. Marino said. "As more people come so will businesses, repeating the cycle."
 As if he had to convince himself, Mr. Handschuch added: "You have to have hope."

New Jersey's Oceanfront Boardwalks, All 32 Miles
Of the 41 boardwalks and promenades in New Jersey, 28 dot the Atolantic coast. They total 32 miles and extend from Sea Bright in the north to Cape May in the south. Most boardwalks are still made of wood, though some are of other materials like recycled wood and plastic boards, brick pavers, concrete, macadam or some combination.

SEA BRIGHT -- At 200 feet, it is the shortest of the boardwalks.

LONG BRANCH -- The 2.2-mile-long boardwalk, 8 to 10 feet above the sand, is one of the highest in the state. In the past there were amusements and concession stands, and there are plans to build retail stores and restaurants in a section being renovated. At the northern tip is Seven Presidents County Park, a nod to the seven American presidents who spent their summers there.

ALLENHURST -- The 0.2-mile-long boardwalk is set high above the ocean and lined with benches.

ASBURY PARK -- Most of the commerce that once enlivened this 0.9-mile stretch of boardwalk is gone and it is awaiting substantial renovation. Plans include entertainment areas, clubs and stores.

OCEAN GROVE -- Some of the boards on this 0.7-mile-long boardwalk are wood, and others are made of recycled plastic.

BRADLEY BEACH -- The 0.8-mile-long boardwalk, made of wooden boards and some brick pavers, features a miniature golf course and bandstand.

AVON-BY-THE-SEA -- The boardwalk is a half-mile long.

BELMAR -- Near this 1.3-mile-long boardwalk, some clubs dot the streets, making the town popular with the under-30 crowd.

SPRING LAKE -- The 1.8-mile-long boardwalk is made mostly of recycled plastic, with benches placed every 25 feet providing unobstructed ocean views. There are no amusements.

SEA GIRT -- The boardwalk, which begins near the old Sea Grit Lighthouse, is 0.7 miles long.

MANASQUAN -- The 0.8-mile-long promenade is made of macadam.

Ocean County

POINT PLEASANT BEACH -- The mile-long boardwalk varies in width from 15 feet at its northern and southern ends to 35 feet in the middle, which includes an amusement area.

LAVALLETTE -- This town has a 1.3-mile-long boardwalk.

ORTLEY BEACH -- The 0.4-mile-long boardwalk has a nightclub in the middle.

SEASIDE HEIGHTS -- The 0.8-mile-long boardwalk -- the only one in the state devoted entirely amusements and concessions -- has more than 600,000 nails.

SEASIDE PARK --Of the 1.7 miles of boardwalk, more than a mile is undeveloped.

BRANT BEACH -- The 330-foot-long boardwalk on Long Beach Island has a 110-foot observation deck.

Atlantic County

BRIGANTINE -- The 0.3-mile-long boardwalk is topped with cement. It has a 10-foot-wide bulkhead, with benches along the western edge.

ATLANTIC CITY -- The longest boardwalk in the state at 4 1/8 miles, it is considered the first "officially proclaimed Boardwalk" in the nation. It is also said to be home of the first amusement pier and rides, among them a carousel and a revolving tower. It is the only one in the state that is considered a street and spelled with a capital B. Visitors still ride rolling chairs.

VENTNOR CITY -- The two-mile-long board connects with Atlantic City's boardwalk to the north.

Cape May County

OCEAN CITY -- The 2.5-mile-long boardwalk has amusment rides, shops of all kinds and even a bandshell but no games of chance and, like the rest of the city, prohibits alcoholic beverages.

SEA ISLE CITY -- The 1.5-mile-long boardwalk is 15 feet wide and sits 6 to 8 feet above the beach.

AVALON -- The 0.7-mile-long boardwalk, which is only 15 feet wide, has a small amusement area but no rides.

STONE HARBOR -- The 0.2-mile-long boardwalk is really a macadam promenade.

NORTH WILDWOOD -- The boardwalk is 0.6 miles long.

WILDWOOD -- The boardwalk is 1.4 miles long. Taken together, the two miles of boardwalk in the Wildwoods have more rides and amusements than any other in the state. They also feature an aquarium and tram cars that are said to have been used at the 1939 New York World's Fair.

WILWOOD CREST -- The mile-long boardwalk is actually a cement walkway.

CAPE MAY -- The 1.4-mile-long boardwalk is made entirely of macadam. There are two arcades and many shops, but no amusement rides.

HEADLINE: DINING; 
Renewal a la Carte In Ruins of Asbury Park

BYLINE:  By DAVID CORCORAN 

DATELINE: ASBURY PARK 

 BODY:
DUSK settles over this battered old resort city on a steamy Tuesday in early summer, and the ocean air is so thick you can taste it. We're not here for the ocean, though. The purpose of this trip is to check out yet another new Asbury Park restaurant.
 This one, called Clementine's, opened just two months ago, serving hearty but sophisticated Cajun-Creole food in a narrow storefront space on one of the few downtown blocks in the city that seem to have no boarded-up buildings. 
 Eight blocks away, Asbury Park's mile-long waterfront is still a ruin of weedy lots, splintered boardwalk and unrealized dreams of urban renewal. At one end the face of Tillie the clown grins manically through peeling paint on the shuttered Palace Amusements building, and trees grow wild in the shell of the majestic old Casino. A half-built apartment complex, abandoned in 1992 when the builder went bankrupt, looms over the wide, largely empty beach, a cruel monument to brutalist architecture. 
 Just inland, however, Clementine's and restaurants like it are writing a different urban-renewal story in this city of 17,000 residents. The owners, part of a new wave of homesteaders and entrepreneurs, are tearing off plywood, gutting old storefronts and banks, and refitting them with kitchens and dining tables. 
 They are a diverse crew: gay and straight, young and middle-aged, black, white and Hispanic. What they have in common is a sense of the possibilities in a shore town that was so ill treated by the social trends of the late 20th century -- middle-class out-migration, a race riot, fires, municipal corruption -- that many locals still call it Beirut.
 "The town was dormant," said Bill Wiley, 46, a former food-service manager at Rutgers who in 1999 took over the long-vacant Seacoast Trust building and began turning it into Sonny's Southern Cuisine. "The old bank looked like a bomb hit it. My wife came down one Sunday, and she said: 'Are you serious? Have you lost your mind?"'
 Mr. Wiley persevered, doing much of the work himself, and opened Sonny's in August 2001. Around the time he began his project, Luke Magliaro and Howard Raczkiewicz, the owners of the successful but tiny Moonstruck in neighboring Ocean Grove, fixed their eyes on a failing nightclub in a sagging frame house on Lake Avenue. 
 "We could see the seeds under the soil that a lot of people couldn't see," Mr. Raczkiewicz, 41, said the other day. The building might have seen better days, but it was on the shore of Wesley Lake, a graceful waterway that glints at night with the lights of the Victorian houses in Ocean Grove. Better still, it had a liquor license; Ocean Grove is famously dry. 
 When they told customers and friends that they were thinking of moving the restaurant to Asbury Park, Mr. Raczkiewicz went on, "They said, 'I hope you're opening a lunch business, because you'll never get anyone to come to Asbury Park at night."' Moonstruck opened in its new $2 million quarters in May 2002. On a recent Saturday night, its parking area was jammed with BMW's and Mercedeses. 
 "We're changing people's opinion of Asbury Park one car at a time," Mr. Raczkiewicz said.
 They have a way to go, of course. That afternoon -- one of the few hot, sunny Saturdays in June -- Cookman Avenue, the city's main shopping street, was bereft of shoppers. Asked about Asbury Park's leading industries, a Monmouth County official who insisted on anonymity paused to think and replied, "Well, there's a lot of unemployment."
 But there is reason to hope that the city's renewal is as inexorable as it is improbable.
 "All the previous plans focused on the waterfront," said John Craven, 33, owner of the Cornucopia General Store, which sells antiques and pricey groceries on a restored stretch of Mattison Avenue. "But businesses are locating downtown now. They're not going to wait for the waterfront."
 Here are brief reviews of five restaurants that are also refusing to wait. Like Moonstruck, they are bringing Asbury Park back from the dead, one diner at a time.

Latin Revival
 Bistro Ole, 230 Main Street, ( 732)897-0048, www.bistroole.com. Lunch, Tuesdays through Saturdays; dinner, Tuesdays through Sundays. Lunch entrees, $7.95; dinner entrees, $14 to $18. B.Y.O. Reservations for large groups only. 
 Wil Vivas, 27, is at the leading edge of "a wave of Spanish influence washing its way through the Jersey Shore, the way Italians did 80 years ago," as the Asbury Park historian Helen-Chantal Pike put it in a recent interview. He made his way to Brooklyn from Venezuela at the age of 19, all alone and speaking no English. He got a job as a dishwasher, then as a short-order cook, refined his technique at the New York Restaurant School and moved to Asbury Park with his partner, Rico Rivera, two years ago. 
 In May 2002 they opened Bistro Vivas, in the space that now holds Clementine's; this spring they moved a few blocks south, to a former bank on a corner opposite City Hall. Mr. Rivera runs the front of the house. Mr. Vivas cooks.
 On the evidence of a single lunch, this may be the liveliest and most interesting of the new crop of restaurants in Asbury Park. Mr. Vivas has a remarkably confident hand with Latin ingredients and spicing. Mussels Peri Peri, in a large crock, were tender and briny, in a tomato-based sauce ablaze with garlic and hot pepper. A heap of mellow, greaseless fried plantains was topped with a second heap of tender and flavorful shredded roast pork. The Sevilla sandwich incorporated portobello mushroom, melted Manchego cheese, roasted red pepper and a delicious cilantro pesto. Flan was dense and concentrated, with bracing jolts of espresso and cinnamon. 
 With raised eyebrows, the waiter agreed to pour our bottle of Chianti riserva into a pitcher and add lemon juice, sugar and chunks of apple and orange. Now that's sangria.

New Orleans North
 Clementine's, 808 Fifth Avenue, (732)897-1177. Dinner, Tuesdays through Sundays. Entrees, $15 to $19. B.Y.O. Reservations recommended.
 Clementine's looks like a set for "A Streetcar Named Desire": invitingly dim, with points of electric light and candle flame; a tin ceiling with a fan beating the sultry air; a giant antique breakfront separating dining room from kitchen. The evocation of a relaxed, genteel New Orleans is convincing, as befits the chef and co-owner, Bobby Johnson, 32, who came here from Lafayette, La., after learning the trade at a popular chain called Copeland's. 
 As in the play,passion simmers just beneath the surface, in dishes like perfectly cooked diver scallops with smoky, spicy tasso ham; a tender fillet of blackened catfish; shrimp etouffee, in a thick sauce that leaves a pleasant, peppery afterglow; maque choux, the sweet, savory corn saute; and a surprisingly tender, full-flavored rib-eye steak. Mr. Johnson does a mean bread pudding, too, with a crust of caramelized sugar and a haunting undertone of whiskey.
 "Asbury Park takes some getting used to," he said by phone the other day. "It takes longer for people to warm up to you here, but once they do, you can connect and have a great friendship." If he keeps serving food like this, he will have no problem.

Asbury Nights
 Harry's Roadhouse, 662 Cookman Avenue, (732)897-1444, www.harrysroadhouse.com. Lunch, Mondays through Fridays; dinner, Tuesdays through Sundays; open to 2 a.m. every night for drinks and bar food. Lunch and dinner entrees, $7.50 to $24.95. Full bar. Reservations accepted.
 "This was Beirut," said Steven Zivkovic, the marketing director at Harry's Roadhouse, invoking an Asbury Park mantra to describe the distant era before his place opened. That was just seven months ago, but Harry's has had an undeniable effect on forlorn, somnolent Cookman Avenue, especially at night.
 Tapping into the visceral connection between Asbury Park and the pounding, blue-collar rock of Bruce Springsteen, Harry's attracts a diverse and vibrant collection of diners and music lovers to a huge trapezoidal space that formerly held clothing and shoe stores. Gutted and stylishly refurbished, with exposed brick, a long wooden bar, salvaged commercial signs and the obligatory 1930's Texaco gas pump (20.9 cents a gallon), it is big enough for arena football. On weekend nights, it needs to be, with live bands or D.J.'s pumping out a steady stream of Springsteen- and Grateful Dead-inspired numbers to big crowds.
 The food is pretty good, too, especially simple fare like a vast sandwich of pulled pork on a brioche roll, with lots of salty, herbed fries. Grilled mahi-mahi with sweet potato hash and chive beurre blanc seemed to be trying a little too hard; it was bland and forgettable, as was Key lime pie. Still, the overall experience of Harry's is anything but bland. As urban renewal, it's an inspired piece of work.

Planet Moonstruck
 Moonstruck, 517 Lake Avenue, (732)988-0123, www.moonstrucknj.com. Dinner, Wednesdays through Sundays; cocktail lounge opens at 4 p.m., dining rooms at 5. Entrees, $12.95 to $29.95. Full bar. No reservations.
 Moonstruck makes a wonderful impression in its new digs, its three tiers aglow with muted lighting and newfound prosperity. Entering by way of a gracious porch, you pass into an Art Deco lounge where dark woods, wicker furniture and snappy Venetian blinds recall colonial Bombay. 
 Get comfortable, because the wait is likely to be long, thanks to Moonstruck's popularity and its no-reservations policy. The dining rooms, under low ceilings on the two upper floors, turn out to be loud and a bit cramped. And service, though friendly, can be overly casual and slow. 
 The restaurant is clearly still in transition from its little quarters in Ocean Grove to its big space here. Some dishes are terrific, like a salad that integrates the precise, contrasting flavors of spinach, avocado, grapefruit and bacon. Desserts are ample, fun and fine. But our entrees were lackluster, from standard roast duck with a sweet port-and-apricot sauce through overdone halibut through a roasted-and-grilled half chicken that had no discernible trace of the promised rosemary.
 Moonstruck deserves great credit for clearly demonstrating that Asbury Park, despite everything, can be a restaurant destination once again. Now it needs to pay more attention to the little things.

Downtown Soul
 Sonny's Southern Cuisine, 574 Cookman Avenue, (732) 774-6262. Dinner, Thursdays through Sundays; lunch, Sundays only. Entrees, $7 to $18.95. B.Y.O. Reservations accepted.
 Of all the unlikely transformations in Asbury Park, Sonny's may be the most striking: from a staid downtown bank to a gaudy, purple-walled nightspot and soul-food palace. 
 The live music here on the Friday night of our visit was gospel-tinged soul, and Mr. Wiley's cooking matched it well. Cornbread was great -- hot, moist, not too sweet -- and Cajun catfish wasn't far behind. Appetizers and sides like crayfish poppers and fried okra, although hardly refined, went down well with beer and chilled wine. Fried pork chops and New Orleans salmon were badly overcooked. The whole experience, though, was redeemed by the music, the sweet, attentive service and a touch of pure South: peanuts, boiled in their shells with Cajun spices.
 Mr. Wiley is a musician himself -- he has won competitions at the famed Apollo Theater in Harlem -- and there is a moment in Asbury Park's long, halting tale of renewal that he will not forget. It was the Wednesday last July when Mr. Springsteen himself showed up at his restaurant to tape three numbers for the NBC News program "Today." 
 "It was -- so -- cool," Mr. Wiley recalled recently, in awestruck tones. That is easy to believe. It was the kind of moment -- musical, interracial, transformative -- that, if repeated often enough, will finally bring Asbury Park all the way back.

HEADLINE: COMMUNITIES; 
Staying Closer to Home, and to the Swim Club

BYLINE:  By DEBRA NUSSBAUM

DATELINE: CHERRY HILL 

 BODY:
FIVE years ago, Gil Goldberg wondered if his summer hangout, the Woodcrest pool, with its timeless pleasures of swimming, tennis, Ping-Pong, basketball and the snack bar, would ever again be the draw it was in the 1960's and 70's, when more than 600 families spent their weekends surrounded by squealing children and the pervasive scent of sunscreen.
 Mr. Goldberg, who is 70, has been on the board of the Woodcrest Recreation Association since 1967 and can remember when his wife and three children essentially lived at the pool. "When we joined in 1964, our kids were home, and my wife took them to the pool every day," he said. 
 But as the baby boom burst and more women entered the workplace, camps and day-care programs proliferated. Woodcrest one of 13 swim clubs in Cherry Hill, suffered the same malaise as many other suburban pools in the state. By the early 1990's, the longstanding Woodcrest waiting list was no longer necessary and membership began to dwindle. 
 Over the last several years, however, the trend has swung the other way, and Mr. Goldberg is not alone in speculating that as neighborhoods turned over from more elderly residents to younger couples with children, the pool clubs once again became attractive.
 Richard McDonough, manager of Downs Farm Pool in Cherry Hill for the last eight years, said: "As families got older, people dropped their membership. I think there is a transition going on now." 
 In addition, there is a sense that the sluggish economy and concerns over extensive travel in the aftermath of 9/11 have kept people near home and at their neighborhood watering hole.
 So once again, swim clubs have gone from sending out marketing brochures hawking memberships to asking people to be patient about sitting on the waiting list for a year or two. Woodcrest, for instance, has been at its limit of 600 families for two years, and this summer 25 families are on the waiting list.
 The situation is similar at the Erlton Swim Club here, where 300 families can join. The pool had vacancies from 1995 to 1998, but now 40 families are waiting to get in, according to Dale Keith, president of the pool's board, and the pool has canceled its program of August-only memberships.
 In Long Branch, the waiting list at the Promenade Beach Club has grown for the last three years, and 100 families are now waiting to join a club that takes about 1,800 members. The Westfield Memorial Pool, with 9,600 members, has also had a ballooning waiting list over the last four years -- with up to 300 names now on it. And the owner of the Montclair Beach Club, Robert Cole, said his club now has a two-year wait to get in.
 "I've seen our waiting list grow," Mr. Cole said, noting 75 people are now on it. "I never called it a waiting list before. I'd just say to people, 'Try again next year."'
 In neighboring Glen Ridge, 400 families pre-paid the $960 for memberships to a new pool club that is scheduled to open late this month, and about 65 people are already on the waiting list. Michael Potters, who is on the executive committee for the Glen Ridge Pool, said his neighbors in the town of 7,200 seemed hungry for a place in town where families could go and spend time together.
 "People do want to stay home," said Mr. Potters, whose wife, Kate, was a founder of the new pool. "They want community and they want their kids with the friends from the neighborhood." 
 He said that in planning for the club, he had called several area pools and found that they were having boom years.
 "They all have waiting lists now," Mr. Potters said. "Everyone was healthy and viable. We had a hard time finding anyone who was struggling."
 Mr. Goldberg of Cherry Hill sounded a similar note. "We've gone up, and there are a lot of reasons for it," he said. "Most clubs have come back. It's community. People aren't running as much. People aren't flying as much and the economy isn't as good. They're staying closer to home."
 Many of the pool clubs in the Northeast were built from the late 1950's through the early 1970's, pool managers said, requiring bonds from $150 to $950 and yearly memberships costing $300 to $1,600.
 In the steamy days of summer, the pools -- usually open from early morning to 9 or 10 p.m. -- offer a place to cool off, gather with neighbors and not have to worry too much about the children. Many have swim teams for school-age children as well as a tennis court or two, Ping-Pong tables and a snack bar.
 For young families, the pool is a lifesaver. On a recent Saturday morning at Woodcrest, one wall was lined with homemade signs urging victory for the White Sharks swim team, and the pool was surrounded by cheering parents and brightly colored beach towels.
 More than 3,000 school-age youths are swimming for the 36 clubs in the Tri-County Swimming Association, which includes clubs in Camden, Gloucester and Burlington Counties, said Ron Kane, the swimming coordinator. "It's something for the kids to do," Mr. Kane said
 The spurt in membership should hardly be surprising. After all, in New Jersey, the number of school-age children rose to 1.34 million in 2002 from 1.26 million in 1998, and many of them are spilling into the pool clubs. And over all, New Jersey's population went to more than 8.6 million residents today from 7.7 million in the late 1990's, according to Dr. James Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers.
 "A driving force is the baby boom echo," Dr. Hughes said "It's the demographics that has caused the expansion of our school system."
 He explained the pool phenomenon this way: the baby boomers are now 39 to 57 years of age, and it is their children and their grandchildren who are filling up all the pools.
 "We thought there would be a baby bust echo or tyke trough," Dr. Hughes said. "It didn't materialize The stroller people have invaded the suburbs again. Since 9/11 there may have been lifestyle changes, and they want to stay closer to home."
 Numbers provided by the the United States Census also help explain the rush to the pool. Last year, almost 10.6 million children were at home with their stay-at-home mothers, up 13 percent from 10 years ago. Census surveys also showed that 55 percent of women who gave birth from July 1999 to July 2000 returned to work within a year, a proportion that was down 4 percent from 1998. In addition, computers have allowed people to work more from home, leaving them with flexible schedules and time to go to the pool.
 "It seems like we have a whole influx of younger people," said Mr. Keith at the Erlton Pool. "This year it really ballooned up. We have more people beating down our door than we have memberships."
 The wait can be frustrating, since the ability to join depends on someone else dropping out. 
 Earl and Lisa Fahnestock, who have lived in the Erlton area of Cherry Hill for years, decided they wanted to join the Erlton Swim Club this year because their daughter, Anne, 3, is hitting prime pool age. Mr. Fahnestock said he was "really bummed out" when he learned there were no more openings.
 "If no one cancels their membership," he lamented, "we won't get in."

HEADLINE: School Board Did Its Homework 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The June 22 edition of the Connecticut Section contained several letters from Westport residents concerning the start time changes in the Westport school system for next year.
 I do not believe those letters accurately represented the events leading to the decision to implement those changes. 
 The school budget process in Westport this year was an arduous one, with several town bodies demanding that the Board of Education present a budget with no more than a 5 percent increase. 
 With fixed costs, including negotiated salaries and skyrocketing insurance premiums accounting for approximately 85 percent of the total budget, the Board of Education decided to maintain current program and look for other ways to cut costs.
 All the board's meetings were publicized in advance and parents were notified by the P.T.A. that the budget process would be a difficult one. The meetings, and the discussion of the proposed early start times, were covered extensively in all three of our local newspapers.
 The superintendent of schools spoke about the proposed early start time at several P.T.A. meetings. The Board of Ed's commitment to maintaining program while looking for alternative budget cuts was discussed at length and in public, with little or no comment from those few people who attended the meetings.
 Many people in Westport understand the need to save money on buses by staggering the start times of our schools. This staggering of start times was initiated during the 2002-3 school year when Saugatuck Elementary School's start time was pushed back 30 minutes to align with the start time at the middle schools. As a matter of fact, the staggered school start times will save the town almost $500,000 annually if maintained.
 If the bus times were returned to the previous schedule, this might mean a cut of up to 10 teachers. In a year where the Board of Education has already voted to save money by cutting special education teachers and allowing class size in the elementary grades to creep toward the maximum of 25, many parents are willing to accept a 30 minute change in start time to prevent even more drastic cuts.
 In a perfect world, every adolescent would start school after 8 a.m. Unfortunately for the people of Westport, the Board of Education has been told by both the Board of Finance and the representative town meeting that this is not a perfect world, that the economy has changed, that people have lost their jobs and that tax increases must be held to the lowest in memory.
 I applaud the Westport Board of Education and the superintendent of schools for their innovative thinking in maintaining the essence of our school programs.

HEADLINE: A Lust for Bentleys During Hard Times 

 BODY:
With the New York region still mired in a recession and corporations, both large and small, announcing almost daily layoffs, I found "Bentley Mania" Long Island Journal, June 29 pretentious and in poor taste.
Maybe it's time that we stopped feeding the public-relations machines of these entities and wake up to the fact that people, regardless of whether they are personally and professionally coping with this protracted downturn in business, are just not interested in knowing that people like Gillis Poll are on their second or third Bentley. 
 I hold The New York Times in higher regard than People magazine and wish you would stick to articles of interest to Long Islanders instead of a select few who are insecure enough to want the world to know that their car is responsible for attracting attention from women. How truly pathetic.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Temporary Workers: A Barometer Of Recovery

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
AS the holiday weekend began, the percentage of unemployed Americans was at its highest level in more than nine years.
 Since February of 2001, 2.6 million jobs have been lost, the Labor Department reported last Thursday. But analysts are predicting a stronger economy in the second half of 2003. When and if hiring picks up, temporary workers are likely to be added first. 
 Greg Cappelli, business and professional services analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, took some time last week to talk about the prospects for companies that place temporary employees. Following are excerpts from the conversation: 

Q. How important are temporary workers for the American economy?

A. At the trough of the last recession in the early 1990's, temporary workers represented 1.03 percent of the work force. It was not a terribly significant component of the labor force. That changed dramatically over the course of the 1990's. In April of 2000, temporary-worker penetration of the labor force peaked at just over 2 percent. Since then, it fell back to a low of 1.64 percent in April. The current penetration rate is 1.7 percent. Of the 2.6 million jobs that have been lost in this cycle, just under 550,000 have been from reductions in temporary staffing.
Historically, rising numbers of temporary workers are a leading indicator for the broader labor market. In general, temps are the first to be hired, and the first to be fired. And the June employment figures showed an increase for the second month in a row. That is a sign things could be starting to stabilize.

Q. Do you expect a pickup in employment in the second half?

A. Since the end of the Iraq war, the stocks have moved 20 percent to 30 percent in anticipation of an improving economy. But a lot of temporary labor companies are not seeing a big pickup in demand yet. Last summer, we saw an improvement from the temporary companies in that they said things have stopped getting worse. Then that ended. We hope we are closer to coming out of this, but there is still uncertainty.

Q. Many of these companies, including Manpower Inc., have moved overseas. How did that happen?

A. It stems from global companies wanting these staffing companies to follow them. Also, once you penetrate the market, Europe is a more user-friendly environment for temporary staffing.
Unlike the U.S., in a country like France, it is practically impossible to fire someone. Italy has only recently opened up to temporary staffing, and it is now growing like mad. In a country like the Netherlands, over 4 percent of the labor force is temporary workers.

Q. Do you see temporary workers becoming a bigger part of the American labor force?

A. Penetration grew very fast in the 1990's off a low base. Will it ever go above 3.5 to 4 percent of the work force? I don't think so. But as we come out of a recession, you could see revenue at these companies grow at double-digit rates. Longer term, that is probably not realistic.

Q. What are the business's profit margins?

A. It depends on what sort of jobs you are filling. At a company like Manpower, which fills most of its jobs in light industrial and clerical positions, gross margins are anywhere from 10 percent to 15 percent. At a company like Robert Half, which focuses on placing people in higher-paying temporary jobs, the margins are in the high 30 percent range.

Q. These are cyclical stocks. Is it premature to buy them?

A. We would like to see the broader data about the economy get better. But if you wait too long, you will miss the move. When the temporary labor markets pick up, six to nine months down the road, more permanent people get hired.
That said, not a lot of temporary workers get placed during the summer. Usually, the spring and the fall are stronger seasons.
We have the sector rated "market perform," which means we don't think it is going to beat the market. When the economy really starts to improve, it could be a "market outperform." It is a challenge making a call on that.

Q. Which of these stocks do you like?

A. We have outperform ratings on Resources Connection and Manpower, and we think Robert Half has a very good business model. Cintas, which is in the uniform market, has been a very solid company in the past and has been growing its market share. But growth has slowed because of the recession. The question is whether or not growth in the uniform market will get back to 15 percent to 20 percent, or be in the 10 percent to 15 percent range going forward.

HEADLINE: Saving The Drama For the Audience 

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON

DATELINE: SANTA MONICA, Calif. 

 BODY:
JERRY BRUCKHEIMER isn't the kind of Hollywood producer who is used to hearing, "No, sir."
 When he needed $2 million to redo the score of "Pirates of the Caribbean," studio executives gave it to him without question. After hating the pilot for "Without a Trace," the follow-up to his successful "C.S.I." franchise on CBS, Mr. Bruckheimer quickly called on his friends from feature films to overhaul the show. Even the actors in two war films he has produced, "Black Hawk Down" and "Pearl Harbor," were forced to train like real soldiers. 
 In fact, Mr. Bruckheimer runs his production company with military-like precision, a general able to mobilize armies of directors, production assistants and special-effects engineers at will. 
He gets what he wants because 17 of the 20 movies he has produced -- starting with the blockbuster "Flashdance" in 1983 and including "Armageddon" and "Top Gun" -- have earned more than $100 million at the box office worldwide. Those two decades of movies have grossed a total of $4.4 billion. Add video and soundtrack sales and the tally jumps to about $12 billion, according to his entertainment production company. Combine all this with the success of his television production arm, which created the popular "C.S.I.," "C.S.I.: Miami" and "Without a Trace," and Mr. Bruckheimer could well be the most influential producer working today.
And there are high hopes that the two movies being released this month -- "Pirates ofthe Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" and "Bad Boys II" -- will be smashes, too, along with "Cold Case," a new television show for the fall.
By all appearances, Jerry Bruckheimer has succeeded in both movies and now television by creating the contemporary version of an entertainment factory. His movies mostly follow a formula: boy or girl faces tough challenge and then triumphs, often blowing up many things in the process. His TV shows are largely crime-related. He generally leaves the day-to-day work to a band of trusted colleagues, then speeds up the final production line once a project is in hand. And, ultimately, he personally asserts a high degree of quality control, fine-tuning the music and sound and editing late into the night if necessary, so that each project has the style that audiences have come to expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer production.
"He does it better than anyone else in the world right now," said Jeffrey Katzenberg, a founder of Dreamworks SKG who is a longtime friend and colleague.
The brash movies that have made him famous and rich may have simple plots, but Mr. Bruckheimer himself is a puzzle. He exudes confidence but acknowledges a fear of failure. He appears self-effacing but refuses to give his age, which friends say is 59. He avoids mogul-worthy histrionics but usually gets his way. (As Ridley Scott, the director of "Black Hawk Down," describes a disagreement with him: "It was circling in the ring, but no one was taking punches.") And while Mr. Bruckheimer says he delegates authority, he concedes that he likes control -- so much so that he personally chooses the mostly pop songs that phone callers hear when they are put on hold at his office.
Still, in an industry dominated by the detail-obsessed, he manages to shuttle an idea from financing to filming and into theaters or onto television screens without the drama so prevalent in Hollywood. 
"If most people in America met him, they'd be shocked," said Leslie Moonves, the chairman and chief executive of CBS Television. "He's not the typical hot-shot producer."
Few people in Hollywood, though, begrudge his success -- shocking in a town where back-stabbing is as prevalent as Botox injections -- because he consistently works long hours with his faithful cadre of film editors, sound-effects wizards and music supervisors. Mr. Bruckheimer has made five movies with the director Michael Bay, including "Pearl Harbor" and "Bad Boys II," which is to be released on July 18. He has worked with Pat Sandston, who leads post-production work on his films, for more than a decade after they met while filming the nuclear submarine drama "Crimson Tide."
MR. SANDSTON recalled a night in 1998 during the making of Mr. Bruckheimer's top-grossing film, "Armageddon" -- about oil drillers who blow up an asteroid hurtling toward Earth. Mr. Bruckheimer, Mr. Bay and the composer Hans Zimmer were huddled in a studio at 2 a.m., fiddling with the movie's score only days before the premiere.
"Everyone was tired and had been up for weeks," Mr. Sandston said. "Michael asked, 'Do you think we are compulsive?' Jerry laughed and said: 'Yes. Everyone in this room is compulsive. We are grown men. We should be in our beds sleeping.' "
For Mr. Bruckheimer, it is an issue of quality control. "My name goes on it and I don't want to be embarrassed," he said.
That may sound odd from a man who has been derided by critics for years for making lowbrow commercial hits. But Mr. Bruckheimer knows his audience: Middle America.
Even the critically acclaimed "Black Hawk Down," a sober story of American soldiers killed in Mogadishu, Somalia, had commercial appeal, he said. And he hopes the same for the American release this fall of "Veronica Guerin," which chronicles the life of the Irish journalist who was killed by drug lords.
"If I made movies for critics, I'd be living in a small Hollywood apartment," he said. "Art is in the eyes of the beholder. If you love it and the critics hate it, does that mean you are wrong? I don't think so."
In other words, let the audience speak. At a test screening of "Pirates of the Caribbean" last Tuesday in Los Angeles, several hundred moviegoers cheered wildly as the lights went down in the theater and again as they went back up. At the back of the theater, Mr. Bruckheimer, wearing a jean jacket and boots, and with a half-eaten bag of popcorn in hand, blended into the crowd. 
That is an image he likes to project. "Jerry always tells his directors, 'I'm just a guy with my hand in the popcorn,' " said Nina Jacobson, president of the Buena Vista Motion Picture Group at the Walt Disney Company, which distributes most of Mr. Bruckheimer's films. "He has an uncanny ability to identify with the audience."
Initially, Mr. Bruckheimer said, he did not want to make "Pirates" because it is based on the Disneyland ride of the same name, and "rides aren't my thing." But he was persuaded to proceed after he found that he could hire Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, two of the writers of "Shrek," to revise the script.
Indeed, Mr. Bruckheimer has a reputation for hiring many writers to rewrite scripts, but generally with moneymaking results. "Armageddon," over time, had nine writers.
His only big bomb in recent memory was "Bad Company," the 2002 comedic thriller with Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock that audiences and critics agreed was neither comedic nor thrilling..
Still, he is paid well for any film: he receives a minimum of 7.5 percent of the total box office revenue -- and often more, according to industry executives.
And his new venture in television could make him even richer as he has unleashed his highly stylized movie-making machine into that medium. The fast pace fits his style. And unlike some film producers, he says he understands that it is the network executive who is the star, not the actors or directors. 
"There is nothing television executives hate more than film producers who come in with 'B movie' projects," said Mr. Moonves at CBS. "It bugs us when people come in and tell us they know our business better than we do."
In addition to his three TV hits this season, Mr. Bruckheimer has more shows in the works: "Cold Case," an extension of the "Without a Trace" brand; "Fearless," a series about an F.B.I. agent; and "Skin," the story of two young people whose fathers -- one a pornography mogul, the other a district attorney -- are at odds. All are expected to have their debuts in the next year.
"C.S.I." and "C.S.I.: Miami," meanwhile, have struck lucrative deals with cable networks for reruns.
Jonathan Littman, a former Fox executive, runs the television division. But even there, Mr. Bruckheimer's style permeates, in the shows' tight editing and dazzling special effects.
And Mr. Bruckheimer has always had an interest in the military. His ABC documentary series about soldiers in Afghanistan, "Profiles from the Front Line," offered a template for news coverage of the war in Iraq. 
"I wish I had a lot of those guys working here," he said of the soldiers he met. "It's 'Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am.' "
MR. SCOTT, the director, observed: "Jerry is a very well-organized and tidy-minded person," and that influences his perceptions. 
Mr. Bruckheimer spends little time on the set during a movie's filming. Instead, he plants himself in the editing room or with executives in charge of the soundtrack, the two places where he can exert the most influence. There, Mr. Bruckheimer "can be slavish and drives everyone to be the best that they can be," said Joe Roth, the founder of Revolution Studios, who worked as an executive with him on 10 films at Revolution and Disney.
Mr. Bruckheimer recalled one movie scene he found particularly troublesome in his career: the airplane crash in "Con Air," released in 1997. The scene initially appeared so fake, he said -- the airplane had to be dragged to simulate the crash -- that it took weeks to edit the film until it looked real. "Kangaroo Jack," a children's comedy set in Australia that was released by Warner Brothers this year, was initially panned by test audiences until new scenes were added with the talking kangaroo. 
"The studio said, 'It's not about a kangaroo,' " Mr. Sandston recalled. "We said, 'Now it is.' " The film was a modest hit, bringing in $83.7 million at the box office worldwide.
Mr. Bruckheimer applies the same tactics to his television. When he redid "Without a Trace," he added new music, titles and special effects until he was satisfied.
Meticulous as he is, he still likes to wrap things up as quickly as possible after a film is shot. For "Pirates," which will be released in theaters on Wednesday, he said he gave the crew only about 12 weeks to complete post-production work, much less than the industry average of 22 weeks.
Two weeks ago, he was at the studio until midnight with the director, Gore Verbinski, haggling over whether to cut two scenes. In the end, "it was only seven seconds" that were cut, Mr. Bruckheimer said, "but it was tighter."The next night, he listened intently to the movie's sound and gave notes to his staff about what he wanted changed.
HE says he does not watch his movies again after they are released because he sees too many things he would like to fix.
But such demands can take a human toll. Staff members, according to two people who have worked for him, rarely leave the office before he does, which can be as late as 11 p.m. His friend and director, Mr. Bay, threatened to quit four times while filming "Pearl Harbor," Mr. Bruckheimer acknowledged. And making movies as quickly as he does, said Mr. Sandston, "is a lot like war."
Mr. Bruckheimer was raised an only child in post-World War II Detroit, the son of a clothing salesman who emigrated from a town near Frankfurt. His mother, also from Germany and a bookkeeper, was married to Mr. Bruckheimer's father for more than 40 years.
After graduating from high school, Jerry Bruckheimer attended the University of Arizona, where he earned a degree in psychology in 1965. He returned to Detroit, where he worked at a local advertising agency and eventually began producing commercials. He moved to Hollywood and in 1972 received his first associate-producer credit for the little-known film "Culpepper Cattle Company."
He had limited success in movies in the 1970's but hit a cultural nerve in 1980 with "American Gigolo," which made Richard Gere a star.
Even back then, Mr. Bruckheimer had a reputation for being serious and self-contained, never saying more than was necessary. Mr. Katzenberg recalled an evening when Mr. Bruckheimer asked him to tag along on his first date with the woman who would become his second wife, so he wouldn't have to talk too much. 
Typically, his hobbies are on the sedate side. He has a 1,100-acre farm in Kentucky where staff members go once a year to ride all-terrain vehicles to practice shooting guns and to fish. And when he does visit movie sets, he brings his camera and snaps photographs, which he keeps in binders at the office and says he may publish someday.
His quiet nature is at odds with that of many other Hollywood producers who live more flamboyantly. That was the style of his production partner, Don Simpson, who died of a drug overdose in 1996, months after the partnership dissolved. In the 1980's, the two men produced some of that decade's biggest hits, including "Beverly Hills Cop" and "Top Gun." To herald their success, the partners drove matching Ferraris, a bit of overt extravagance for Mr. Bruckheimer. 
But Mr. Bruckheimer also began then to favor the simple black leather jackets he still wears today. And now he drives a less-flashy car, a BMW.
"He does it differently than me," said Joel Silver, the producer of the "Matrix" films who wears brightly colored shirts and is often the center of attention when he enters a room. "I tend to take the stage. He likes to be unassuming. But in the editing room, he is not transparent. The personality is a means to an end."

HEADLINE: Rhodes Scholars Are Split on a New Foundation for South African Awards 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: OXFORD, England, July 4 

 BODY:
The scholars were in casual dress, not gowns and mortarboards, and seemed well-heeled, as people in their position might be presumed to be, as they gathered to mark the centennial of an institution that has endured with a prestige sometimes denied to its founder, the British imperialist Cecil John Rhodes.
 For much of this week, around 1,000 former Rhodes scholars -- people, including former President Bill Clinton, who survived a rigorous selection process to win stipends from the diamond-laden Rhodes estate -- have gathered and mingled in this old university town and in London to celebrate 100 years of an institution that has produced prime ministers and magnates, generals and scholars. 
 But no academic moment is complete without its spat, just as no evocation of Rhodes's colonialism in southern Africa -- when he nourished an unfulfilled dream of building an empire from the Cape to Cairo -- is complete without some postcolonial wrestling with guilt and redemption.
This week, the themes intertwined anew in the figure of Nelson Mandela, the former South African president. By promoting a new Mandela Rhodes Foundation that will devote its resources to the education of South Africa's poor instead of the world's elite, Mr. Mandela contrived both to close a historical circle between his country's past and present and to find himself drawn into a controversy over what the custodians of Rhodes's legacy should be doing with Rhodes's money. 
"Payback would be too harsh a word," said Jakes Gerwel, the head of the new foundation, referring to the Rhodes Trust's decision to donate $1.6 million a year for the next decade to the new foundation. "Closing a circle is more poetic."
By committing the money, he said in an interview, the Rhodes Trust was showing a readiness to send some of its riches "back to the origins of the wealth that made the Rhodes Trust possible."
The creation of the new fund represents a remarkable shift in one of the world's most exclusive groups of alumni -- selected, according to Rhodes's will, for their academic excellence, leadership and physical vigor. According to the trust, Rhodes "specifically directed" that there should be no discrimination on grounds of race or religion in choosing the scholars. He also said in his will that candidates should not be "merely bookworms." But the scholarships were long limited to men from the United States, Germany and countries in the British Empire at Rhodes's death in 1902. Women became eligible only in the late 1970's.
But not everyone agrees with this latest change.
Some of the current Rhodes scholars -- 92 are admitted to Oxford every year -- complain that the Rhodes Trust and its chief executive, John Rowett, have devoted too much time and money to the Mandela Rhodes Foundation, to the detriment of present-day scholars.
"There are those who disagree with the whole Mandela Rhodes initiative," Mr. Rowett said. "We have to say: we beg to differ. We make no apology whatever for saying that now is the time for Africa."
That, certainly, was the view of Cecil Rhodes.
Arriving in southern Africa in the late 19th century, Rhodes grew phenomenally rich from diamond mines and built a political power base fueled by what biographers have called an insatiable lust for power -- even to the extent of having a country, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), named for him.
His wealth, Rhodes's critics say, was built on the master-and-slave economic forerunner of apartheid, the system of racial segregation that prevailed in South Africa from 1948 until the end of white minority rule in the 1990's. By contrast, Mr. Mandela, who was imprisoned for 27 years, spent his life fighting that system of white supremacy. So the combination of the two names in a single breath is seen by some scholars as lyrical evidence of something more profound in South Africa's quest for racial reconciliation.
"I have a personal belief that it's very appropriate and almost inspirational that the Rhodes Trust is looking outward and looking forward," said Jasmine Waddell, 25, a Brown University graduate and a current Rhodes scholar.
By fusing the two names, said Mr. Gerwel, the head of the foundation, the Rhodes legacy -- long denied by many as an emblem of exploitation -- "has been admitted into the collective memory" of South Africa.
Others have a different take.
According to British news reports, a letter circulated by about 115 Rhodes scholars complained that the focus on South Africa had distracted Mr. Rowett from his responsibilities to current scholars and had diverted funds that might have been used to allow them to extend their studies into a discretionary third year.
Some scholars who supported that letter declined to comment publicly today. And in a letter to a British newspaper this week, two of the protesters, Kim Mathiesen and Murray Wesson, insisted that the statement "in no way undermined the formation of the Mandela Rhodes Foundation."
All the same, as Mr. Rowett mingled with scholars from the 1960's and 1970's in tents set up on the pampered gardens below Rhodes House, he acknowledged that preparation for this week's centennial had added to his burdens. There had been a dinner for 2,000 people, including Prime Minister Tony Blair, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Mandela, in London, and an earlier celebration for 1,000 in Cape Town.
Just after Mr. Rowett spoke to a reporter, Mr. Clinton, a Rhodes scholar from 1968 to 1970, arrived at Rhodes House to meet others from the same generation of scholars.
What had made the real difference in the trust's ability to extend its generosity, Mr. Rowett said, was "the downturn in the markets."
According to York Membery, a spokesman for the Rhodes Trust, the fund now stands at the equivalent of about $220 million, compared with about $340 million a couple of years ago. So would the debate over the stipends overshadow the centennial?
"In the longer view of history," said Joseph S. Nye Jr., the dean of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government and himself a Rhodes scholar from 1958 to 1960, the idea of "Mandela and Rhodes put together with a hyphen is going to mean more than any complaints that slightly disgruntled scholars of this generation might have."

HEADLINE: New U.S. Focus Is Put on Details In Mideast Plan 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 5 

 BODY:
While meeting with Palestinian leaders a week ago, Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, listened intently to complaints about the Israeli fence walling off Palestinians in the West Bank. The next day, she raised objections to the fence with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.
 American and Israeli officials say Mr. Sharon politely rebuffed Ms. Rice, at least for now. 
 The exchange, administration officials say, illustrates their new willingness to prod Israel and to get involved in the minutiae of the negotiations. 
A senior official said that in fact more pressure on Israel to stop construction of the fence is certain in coming weeks. "The very fact that Condi Rice raised the issue of the fence with Sharon is significant," said an administration official. "We will be back on this issue if things don't improve." 
The exchange between Ms. Rice and Mr. Sharon also shows, administration officials say, a decision to direct pressure from both the White House and the State Department, which had long been warring over Middle East policy.
The week before Ms. Rice's visit, for example, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was there pressing for an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, even to the point of discussing individual checkpoints on maps of the area.
Diplomats on all sides took note of the careful one-two punch delivered by the two top aides to President Bush. "This is the World Wrestling Federation, and we have a tag team on the Middle East," said a senior State Department official. "For a long time, we've been undercut by the perception that State, the Pentagon and the White House were not aligned. We've worked hard to change that perception."
There was a time in the first months of 2001 when Mr. Bush, Ms. Rice and Mr. Powell all disdained what they said was the obsessive entanglement of the Clinton administration in Middle East negotiations. Administration officials all refused appeals from countries in the region to get more involved.
Now administration officials say their new muscular approach has paid off with the first sign of progress in years -- not simply the Israeli withdrawals from Gaza and Bethlehem, but the first tentative cooperation in a long time on security issues and what steps to take next. 
American, European and Middle Eastern diplomats all say that the American pressure has been cautious so far, and will have to become more assertive in coming weeks.
The next test, they say, will be over the administration's willingness to take further steps: stopping installation of the barrier fence, pulling back more forces in the West Bank and dismantling, or at least freezing, settlements there and in Gaza.
Israel is considered unlikely even to consider such steps without seeing the Palestinians crack down first on Hamas and other militant groups -- steps that Washington, too, is demanding. The problem is how to arrange further reciprocal steps, and in what sequence -- and whether the United States is willing to mediate or orchestrate each new move.
The latest phase of the Middle East peace efforts began in mid-March, with Mr. Bush's formal adoption of the peace plan known as the "road map."
That plan, negotiated with Europe, the United Nations and Russia, calls for reciprocal concessions by Israel and the Palestinians, leading to a Palestinian state in three years. Mr. Bush resisted adopting it until pressure mounted from Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain on the eve of the Iraq war.
"I saw Bush on TV in the Rose Garden and he looked like someone was holding a gun to his head," said a diplomat in the Middle East, recalling the announcement on March 14 on adopting the plan. "Now he's looking like a seasoned negotiator."
To longtime observers of the Middle East negotiations, the most intriguing aspect of the new internal alignment in the Bush administration is that Mr. Bush has enlisted the White House in a swerve toward a greater willingness to be tough toward Israel, as Ms. Rice was on the Israeli security fence. How much that toughness will be sustained is a matter of conjecture right now.
Until recently, it was the State Department -- responding to the views of European and Arab allies whose support was needed for the war with Iraq -- that favored seeking concessions from Israel even as the Palestinians were pressed to stop their uprising and attacks.
After Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Bush plunged into the volatile politics of the Islamic world. Despite engaging with its leaders -- whether in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt, or among the Palestinians -- he was said to ally himself more with Mr. Sharon and his supporters, including many at the Pentagon and the office of Vice President Dick Cheney, who emphasize cracking down on terrorism.
By mid-2002, in his most important speech on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr. Bush declared himself in favor of a Palestinian state. But he said the administration would no longer deal with Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, which delighted Mr. Sharon and his conservative supporters in Israel and the United States.
Throughout this period, administration officials say, Secretary Powell contended that while tough measures were needed on terrorism, the Israeli-Palestinian crisis was political in nature and ultimately needed a political solution. 
This view did not prevail until the Iraq war and its aftermath, many officials say, when Arab and European supporters of the war took the same view and the installation of Mahmoud Abbas as prime minister made it possible for the United States to resume its contacts with Palestinian leaders.
Along with the evolution of Mr. Bush's thinking has been the evolution of the role played by Elliott Abrams, a conservative former Reagan administration official recruited by Ms. Rice last year to direct Middle East affairs at the National Security Council.
At first, the Abrams appointment stirred consternation at the State Department. Mr. Abrams, a combative advocate of Israel's interests, had after all opposed the Oslo peace efforts in the early 1990's, warning that Mr. Arafat could not be trusted.
Mr. Abrams is still said to take Israel's side on such issues as the need for a hard line on Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups, and tough demands on the Palestinian leadership to stop the incitement of violence. 
But earlier this year, Mr. Abrams was among those around Mr. Bush advocating that Israel accept the road map peace plan, in the face of Israeli objections and opposition by many American conservatives, including Tom DeLay, the House majority leader, and several Jewish and evangelical Christian groups.
Mr. Abrams has also recently questioned the Israeli policy of proceeding with the fence, officials and diplomats say, on the ground that it is provocative to Palestinians. 
A top official said Mr. Abrams now advocates direct economic aid to the Palestinian Authority to shore up Mr. Abbas and Salam Fayyad, the Palestinian finance minister.
Among other things, this change has dismayed some hard-line supporters of Israel in the United States. A group of 25 Jewish leaders met with Ms. Rice last Wednesday, and, while many were supportive, some of the conservatives questioned her skeptically about the latest policies, in particular the decision to provide more aid to the Palestinians.
Aides to Mr. Sharon in Israel say that, although Israel disagrees with some recent American suggestions, such as the one to stop construction of the fence, relations remain cordial.
Mr. Sharon has been described in the past as disdainful of the peace plan, declaring it to be a product of the State Department and its thinking.
He and his aides raised nearly 100 objections to it, then reduced these to 14 and then accepted the document with the vague promise that Israel's concerns would be taken into account as the plan was carried out. 
Early in the Bush administration, Mr. Sharon made a point of trying to forge ties with Mr. Bush's conservative inner circle, particularly I. Lewis Libby, Vice President Cheney's chief of staff.
In an unusual step, he circumvented the State Department by sending a private emissary, Arie Genger, a former business partner, to the White House but not the State Department, said several officials knowledgeable about the subject. Now, they say, Mr. Genger has slipped into the background but is still involved as a "back channel" to the administration, they say. 
Israelis assert that, despite a difference of views on some matters, the Bush administration and Mr. Sharon's team have close ties. "We don't agree on everything, that's for sure," said an Israeli official. "But if we disagree, we disagree, and we don't feel pressure on issues of our security."
As for the administration's micro-managing of the process, few experts are surprised at such a turn of events. 
"Guess what?" said Dennis Ross, the former Middle East negotiator in the Clinton years. "Once you're into it, you have to get into the details. You can't deal with the Middle East at the level of a slogan. You deal with it in ways that reflect the reality on the ground."

HEADLINE: Shinnecocks Defy the State Over Casino 

BYLINE:  By JULIA C. MEAD

DATELINE: SOUTHAMPTON 

 BODY:
A TEMPORARY restraining order signed by a judge last Sunday at Attorney General Eliot Spitzer's request failed to deter the Shinnecock Indian Nation from breaking ground on Monday morning for a casino in Hampton Bays. In an ebullient ceremony attended by about 250 tribe members, their leaders said repeatedly that they would not be turned from their chosen path to economic self-sufficiency.
 The Shinnecocks gathered in a clearing in the woods near where they plan to build a 65,000-square-foot casino, which will also include a bingo hall. They prayed, sang, drummed, applauded and shouted until the sounds of their defiance echoed off the trees. 
 "Our documentation is ready!" shouted Lance A. Gumbs, one of three elected tribal trustees, waving legal papers. "Our history stands for itself, and we will take this to the next level." The audience cheered as Mr. Gumbs explained that the papers, filed on Tuesday, seek to move the attorney general's case from State Supreme Court to federal court. 
Many tribes, including the Mashantucket Pequots in Connecticut, the owners of Foxwoods casino, sued in federal court to win federal recognition and later, for the right to operate a casino. 
Denis J. McElligott, the assistant state attorney general in charge of the Suffolk County office, said that Mr. Spitzer was acting on affidavits from the State Department of Environmental Conservation and the state Racing and Wagering Board, which contend that the Shinnecocks lack authority to open a casino. 
Since reports began circulating last winter that the 1,500-member Shinnecock tribe was planning a casino, state officials, including members of the governor's staff, have repeatedly said that an Indian nation could not open a casino unless it was federally recognized as a tribe and won legislative approval for what is known as a gaming compact, which would have to be negotiated with the governor. A bingo hall would not need a compact but would require a state permit, Mr. McElligott said.
The Shinnecocks, who own an 800-acre reservation surrounded by the Town of Southampton, are recognized as a tribe by the state, but their application for federal recognition is pending. Still, they claim the right as a sovereign nation to do what they please with their land.
At Mr. Spitzer's request, Edward D. Burke Jr., an acting Supreme Court justice who lives in Southampton, signed the temporary restraining order on Sunday. That afternoon, Mr. McElligott went to the Shinnecock reservation to serve the papers himself.
The order prohibits "any steps whatsoever to build and/or construct any structure intended to be used as a gaming facility" on tribal lands, including the 79-acre Hampton Bays parcel known as Westwoods, until the case is heard in State Supreme Court in Riverhead. On Wednesday, Justice James Catterson said that state courts had no jurisdiction in the case until a federal judge rules on the Shinnecocks' petition to move the case to federal court. 
The restraining order also bans the Shinnecocks from advertising or buying equipment for their casino and bingo hall. Mr. McElligott said on Wednesday that his office would decide later whether to file a motion asking a judge to hold the Shinnecocks in contempt since they went ahead and held groundbreaking ceremonies on Monday. 
Neighbors and town, state and federal officials have been outspoken in opposition to the casino, which would be in a residential neighborhood. They contend that it would create traffic problems. 
Shinnecock leaders confirmed last month that they intended to build a casino and began running newspaper and radio ads explaining their side of the issue: that a casino would make the tribe self-sufficient and would bring jobs and revenue to the surrounding area. 
 On Monday, just a handful of neighbors watched from Newtown Road as members of the tribe arrived for the ceremony.
A drawing of the casino showed a one- and two-story log building with a gabled roof. It resembles the tribe's museum and cultural center, a smaller 5,000-square-foot building on Montauk Highway. A floor plan showed a section for bingo, but most of the ground floor would be devoted to slot machines and gaming tables. 
Tribe members said the casino, parking lots and driveways would cover some 15 acres south of Newtown Road. A proposed access road from Sunrise Highway would require state approval.
In his speech, Charles K. Smith II, the chairman of the tribe's trustees, said gambling profits would be channeled into education, jobs, medical care, better housing and other services now lacking on the reservation. He did not provide any projected income figures. 
"We need to do what we have to do for self-reliance," he said, adding that since the tribe had no other significant source of revenue, "the burden is getting harder and harder on each and every one of us."
Seated in the audience, Mr. Gumbs's 82-year-old mother, Harriet, a tribal historian, said the tribe's newfound assertiveness was long overdue.
"They have a nerve," she said of the public officials who oppose the casino. "We gave them the town to begin with, and they have been taking and taking and taking until we have just our reservation and our little woods." 
"But we no longer feel we have to be the last people on the totem pole," she continued. "We are embarking on one of the greatest things our nation has ever tried to do: we're creating our own self-reliance."
On Monday, as a bulldozer backed into the woods from Newtown Road, the Rev. Holly Haile Davis, a member of the tribe, exclaimed: "Yes! We have turned a page in history. Today's the day! Today's the day!"
With the bulldozer parked in the woods, Mr. Gumbs, Mr. Smith and the third trustee, James W. Eleazar, each drove a shovel into the ground. "Applaud yourselves for the hard work you have done, for the hard work you are about to do," Mr. Smith told the crowd.

Wary After a Slump, Hotels Keep Prices Down

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
THIS summer is shaping up as a time for hotel bargains around the country.
 With the war in Iraq over, the threat of SARS fading and tentative signs of economic revival, travel industry experts say they expect hotels in the United States to begin recovering from one of their worst slumps in decades. 
 But, they say the hotels are so shell shocked after two years of dispiriting occupancy rates hovering at about 60 percent, that they will probably not try to increase their rates anytime soon.
 With discounting widespread, said Bjorn Hanson, a consultant on the hotel business at PricewaterhouseCoopers, the safe business approach is to keep on discounting. "The fear is that should an individual hotel not offer discounts, the hotel next door will continue to discount, and all the business will go there," he said. 
 Moreover, he said, the industry worries that the market is so fragile that if discounts were abandoned, Americans would simply stay home. 
 By late June, hotel prices around the country were averaging $82.22 a night, according to Smith Travel Research, down from an industry peak of $89.43 in late October 2000, but not as low as in the months immediately following the Sept. 11 attacks, when prices dipped into the high $70's.
 In Boston, the average daily cost of a room was $120.27, down 6.2 percent from a year earlier. In San Francisco prices were down 12.3 percent to $123.83 and in Miami the daily rate was $82.73, nearly 4 percent cheaper than a year ago. In New York, prices were down 4.6 percent to $162.65.
 According to the latest data from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Bureau, rooms in Las Vegas were going for an average of $83.42 in April, down less than 1 percent from a year earlier. John Piet, the bureau's senior researcher, said some hotels were offering rooms for as low as $29 to attract players to their casinos and shows.
 "There are some great deals out there, especially for leisure travelers," said Adam Weissenberg, a partner at Deloitte & Touche, who specializes in the hotel and restaurant businesses.
 The low prices might suggest to the really frugal that if they could figure out where the hotel business has been worst, they could get the best of all possible prices. But Mr. Hanson said that such a strategy probably would not work. 
 Yield management, the use of computers to vary prices to fill the most rooms, has become so fine-tuned, Mr. Hanson said, that on some days, rooms in cities with relatively high occupancy rates may be selling for less than those where business has been miserable. "Rates are all over the place," he said.
 In those circumstances, people who are willing to make a few phone calls will get the best deals.
 The price one ultimately pays, Mr. Hanson said, can be significantly lower than run-of-the-mill bargains. But true bargains can take a lot of work.
 First, Mr. Hanson says, scan some Web sites for hotel bookings like Hotels.com, Hotwire.com, Priceline.com and Travelocity.com, to get a feel for prices. Then, pick a hotel and a price and phone the hotel. "Say, 'It's a little more than I wanted to spend, can you do something for me?"' Mr. Hanson said. "And about a third of the time the answer will be yes."
 To drive the price down even further, Mr. Hanson said, repeat the process every three or four days with the same hotel. "If you find a lower rate and the hotel accepts it, you cancel the original reservation and make a new one." he said. Hotels didn't usually object to a switch for a lower price, he said, because they don't want to lose the business.
 But, though the price may be right for a hotel room this summer, in many cases, the frill is gone. 
 Striving to bolster their bottom lines, travel analysts said, many hotels have been cutting amenities. The coolest, most extreme services are the first to go: dog-walking concierges, for example. Twenty-four-hour room service has become daytime room service or, in some cases, limited menu offerings during late-night hours, said Robert Mandelbaum, the director of research for the hospitality group of PFK Consulting in Atlanta. 
 Some hotels are charging for services that once were free, like newspaper deliveries and use of the gym.
 But mindful of the customer alienation that airlines have suffered, hotels are striving to maintain their tone, Mr. Weissenberg said. Still, he added: "You may have to wait a ring or two for someone to answer the phone at the front desk."
 For hotel owners, the picture has been grim. In 2000, the industry's last good year, average annual revenue per room rose 7.7 percent to $41,335, according to PFK Consulting, and profits before taxes rose 10.1 percent. The next year revenue dropped 9.9 percent and pretax profits fell 19.4 percent. In 2002 revenue fell another 4 percent and pretax profits fell 9.6 percent, PFK Consulting said. 
 PFK is predicting an industry profit this year, but mainly as a result of cuts in expenses. "We think room rates are not going to grow substantially in 2003 and 2004," Mr. Mandelbaum said. "It may not be until 2005 that we see a recovery in rates."
 And that assumes that nothing really bad happens to drive Americans back into the comfort of their homes.

The online journals known as Web logs are finding favor as an efficient way to communicate within the workplace.

BYLINE:  By William O'Shea 

 BODY:
For Nicholas Tang, the deluge of work-related e-mail messages became overwhelming. "It got to the point where I was getting hundreds of e-mails a day, sometimes more than a thousand," said Mr. Tang, director of operations at Community Connect, a company in New York that operates AsianAvenue.com and other online communities with an ethnic focus. 
 For several years Mr. Tang viewed this daily surge of e-mail messages as an unpleasant but necessary part of his job managing a team of eight engineers. Then, a few months ago, he began using an alternative to e-mail, a Web log. 
 Web logs, or blogs as they are known, are a type of frequently updated online journal, often featuring excerpts from news articles and links to other blogs. So far, Web logs are best known as a medium for communicating with the general public -- like the blog by the noted journalist Andrew Sullivan (www.andrewsullivan.com), which is devoted to culture and politics, and sites like the Veg Blog (www.vegblog.org), which is about all things vegetarian. In the corporate context, some chief executives, for better or worse, have adopted blogs as a way to share their personal wisdom with the wider world.
But a growing number of businesses, government organizations and educational institutions are using Web logs to manage and improve the flow of information among employees. These blogs, not accessible to the public, typically allow many people to contribute entries that can be read by others in the organization.
It may be too soon to tell whether the corporate blog will emerge as a genuinely useful tool for business communications or simply another way for bores and blowhards to blather. But a growing circle of adopters, like Mr. Tang, swear by their blogs.
At Community Connect, Mr. Tang's engineers use a service called LiveJournal to post updates about tasks like fixing server computers or configuring software. Hitting the upload button sends the text to a private site, viewable by the authors and their managers, including the date and time of the postings and, often, links to relevant Web pages. 
"When I want to know something I check the Web log," Mr. Tang said. "It saves me the trouble of e-mailing people or yelling across the room to get a status update." 
Mr. Tang has also used blogs to coordinate group projects, like the recent process of interviewing job candidates for a programming position. The various people at the company who spoke to each candidate posted their comments on a password-protected Web log. 
"One person wrote that a candidate was 'quiet,' " Mr. Tang recalled. "There was a whole discussion about this. 'What does that mean? Is it a bad thing? Does it mean he's antisocial?' There was more back and forth with the interview process. It helped everyone to get on the same page more quickly." 
Because of their informal nature, blogs can lead to digressions. Shirley Palma, a Community Connect systems administrator, said that after meeting one job candidate, a woman posted this message on the interview blog: "I think he's so cute! I want to take him home!" 
Ms. Palma noted that "it was in a motherly way; she didn't mean anything by it." But the remark prompted a male colleague to blog back, "I think if I said that it would be considered sexual harassment." 
The cute candidate ended up getting the job, having been praised by others on the blog for being easygoing and an apparently fast learner. "We interviewed lots of candidates," Ms. Palma explained. "Can you imagine remembering 10 people after the fact? The blog helped keep track of everyone." 
Google, the provider of Internet search services, has become a big user of blogs for communication among its employees and managers -- a result of the company's acquisition of Pyra Labs, the creator of the Blogger Web log service, earlier this year. On one internal blog, called Google Love Notes, the customer service staff posts thank-you notes from users. One is from a woman who nursed her sick dog back to health after researching the illness on Google; the posting includes a photograph of the healed dog frolicking in a stream. Another came from a woman who was able to find a long-lost love through Google -- and who happily reports that she wound up agreeing to marry the man's brother. 
"It's a good pick-me-up," Jason Shellen, a Blogger manager at Google, said of Love Notes. 
Less relevant to the corporate mission was a posting on a blog operated by Notiva, a Silicon Valley software company, by a staff software designer who posted photographs from his vacation to France. Another employee posted the official rules for foosball. 
But Tim Dawson, Notiva's director of system architecture, says he does not mind if people have fun with the blogs, because he sees how valuable the medium can be for sharing information about software bugs and fixes. "We went from 11 people to 50, and that all happened in the space of 15 months," Mr. Dawson said. With the blogs, he said, new employees "can come in and see what's out there."
The telephone and wireless giant Verizon Communications uses a Web log to collect news and intelligence about the industry and competitors. "We used to spend lots of time e-mailing articles around but not keeping track of them," said Sean Byrnes, the lead architect on Verizon's project for Wi-Fi wireless Internet access. His group now consolidates such information in a series of topic-specific blogs.
But opening a pipeline to comments from employees can produce a torrent of information, essentially defeating the purpose of the tool. "You reach information glut very quickly," Mr. Byrnes said. 
And the free flow of information does not necessarily promote communication, says David Jarvis, an analyst at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center in Newport, R.I. The center is running an experimental program using Web logs to explore how naval technologies can be applied to homeland defense. The blogs are meant to disseminate news, project updates and new ideas. 
"People are going to the blogs every day as a source for news," Mr. Jarvis said. But, he added, "I am disappointed in the tool," because the hoped-for exchange of ideas among departments has not spontaneously developed. "You need specific goals," Mr. Jarvis said. 
Typically, though, such experiments are not expensive to mount. LiveJournal's blogging service costs companies $25 a year. Corporate editions of Manila, a Web log program produced by Userland Software, costs $899 a server computer, but one server can accommodate hundreds of people. TeamPage, a corporate Web log program offered by Traction Software, begins at $10,000 a server, but small-group versions cost much less. 
As business interest in Web logs grows, more companies are moving into the market -- or expanding into it, in the case of software developers that had focused on personal Web log tools but are now aiming at teams and organizations. One such company, Six Apart, plans to begin selling its corporate product in the next few weeks. And 20six, a British company, plans to introduce blog software for teams in the fall. 
Time will reveal how many Web log software companies the market can support. But corporate blog enthusiasts like Mr. Tang, of Community Connect, are convinced that the medium is here to stay. 
"People are starting to use Web logs to archive data that would have otherwise been lost," Mr. Tang said. He noted that much of the company's internal communications had been via instant messaging -- and was lost as soon as the correspondents closed their chat windows. Now, though, employees are starting to post transcripts of relevant discussions on the Web logs, he said. 
"It's not just making life more convenient," Mr. Tang said, "but actually giving us something new we didn't have before."

HEADLINE: Capturing the Cultural Revolution 

BYLINE:  By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: PARIS, July 6 

 BODY:
It was Li Zhensheng's job in the late 1960's to photograph the happy face of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution for a provincial Chinese daily newspaper. But as he dutifully fed the propaganda machine with uplifting images, he gradually understood that he was also recording history, and so he took a major risk: on his assignments, he began including disturbing aspects of the revolution and then hid the negatives under the floorboards of his home.
 Now, more than three decades after the Cultural Revolution began, Mr. Li is for the first time making public his remarkable visual testimony of that violent and chaotic era. A selection of 152 images are on display at the Patrimoine Photographique here through Sept. 21. Mr. Li has also published a book, which includes 285 pictures and a memoir of his life until 1976, when the decade-long revolution ended. The book, "Red-Color News Soldier" (Phaidon), is to be published in the United States in September. 
 Although other pictures of Red Guard abuses in Beijing have documented the social upheaval accompanying the Cultural Revolution, what distinguishes Mr. Li's collection of 30,000 negatives is that it shows in shocking detail what was happening at a grass-roots level in a remote Chinese province far from Western eyes. His work also reflects the instincts of a journalist and the eye of an artist. 
In the exhibition and the book, he brings to life the fanatical joy of rampaging Red Guards, many of them teenagers, and the coldblooded humiliation and even execution of "enemies of the people." Only once, during a 1966 visit to Beijing, did Mr. Li photograph Mao himself, but Mao is ever present in photographs, in statues, in the little red book of his sayings and in spirit.
Today Mr. Li looks back and sees a different China. The excesses and leaders of the revolution were denounced after Mao's death in 1976. Communist capitalism is now entrenched. Mr. Li, 63, lives in New York and Beijing. He is confident that his book will soon also be published in China. 
But in his book and in a recent conversation through an interpreter, it was apparent that Mr. Li had not forgotten the past. As a teenager he showed a talent for painting, but he chose to become a cinematographer. When his film school was closed in 1963 he was assigned as a photographer on The Heilongjiang Daily in the northern city of Harbin. After his first day's work, he wrote in his diary: "I am not going to die in Heilongjiang Province."
With China still in turmoil after the catastrophic Great Leap Forward economic program that began in 1958, its government was trying to reawaken revolutionary fervor. Soon Mr. Li was required to join the Socialist Education Movement, which sent urban youths to the countryside -- in his case to Acheng County, 30 miles southeast of Harbin -- to experience peasant life. There he trained with a local militia, farmed and took part in self-criticism sessions.
But he also took pictures. They show the expected images -- peasants working and holding endless sessions studying Mao's teachings -- but also more arresting ones of gatherings in which "antisocial" peasants were publicly denounced for cheating and forced to stand for hours with their heads bowed in the kowtow position to beg forgiveness. Even these early images reveal Mr. Li's sense of composition, his understanding of lighting and his ability to convey emotion.
Then, with Mr. Li back at his newspaper, history suddenly accelerated with Mao's proclamation of the Cultural Revolution in May 1966. "I was excited like everyone else," Mr. Li said. "The happiness was real. We felt lucky to be living the moment. Mao had said it should be repeated every seven years and we thought we'd be lucky enough to live several cultural revolutions. We all believed in Mao."
Just as political leaders in Heilongjiang Province were soon overthrown by Red Guards, Mr. Li's editors were ousted. "I noticed that people wearing a Red Guard armband could take photographs freely," he writes. Inside the newspaper, he promptly formed a self-appointed Red Guard unit called the Red Youth Fighting Team and acquired an armband. "After that, whenever I wore it I could take all the photographs I wanted and no one bothered me," he notes in his book.
Yet within weeks, he recalled, he grew alarmed over Red Guard excesses, which he witnessed and photographed: the ransacking a Russian Orthodox Church and a Buddhist temple, raids on private homes, ceremonial book burnings and attacks on individuals. "As a young man with a good education, I did not think this was normal," he said. "So while we photographed the joy, violent and cruel scenes were more and more evident."
His newspaper published only positive images of the Cultural Revolution, but Mr. Li photographed everything. "I had had a teacher, a famous photographer, Wu Yingxian, who said we were not only witnesses of history but also recorders of history," Mr. Li said. "I felt the positive images were only part of history, so I also photographed the negative scenes so that one day there would be a complete history."
So, while showing cheerful youths waving flags and holding little red books, Mr. Li captured moments when ousted senior officials were being abused and humiliated in front of crowds, their heads shaven, ink or paint splashed on their faces, insulting signs hung around their necks and cloths stuffed into their mouths. Some were forced to wear paper dunce caps covered with slogans.
In 1968 Mr. Li began hiding negatives of such scenes in his modest home. Their images included an execution of six ordinary criminals and two dissidents. "On the barren ground of the Huang Shan Cemetery, they were lined up, hands tied behind their backs, and forced to kneel," he writes. "They were all shot in the back of the head." Mr. Li, who documented each step, adds: "No one asked me take close-ups of the bodies, but that's what I did."
By then, the situation in Harbin was still more confused as different bands of Red Guards fought for power in Mao's name. At The Heilongjiang Daily late in 1968, Mr. Li was accused of various crimes, including being a "newly born bourgeois." First he was demoted, and then, in September 1969, he and his wife, Zu Yingxia, were sent to the Liuhe May 7 School in the countryside for "rectification."
"Things there were more and more foolish," he said. "Everyone was cold and someone would shout, 'Anyone cold?' And we replied, 'No, because we have a red sun in our hearts that is very warm.' 'Is the work difficult?' someone else would shout. 'No, not at all. It was far worse for those on the Long March.' "
When Mr. Li and his wife left the school in May 1971, the Cultural Revolution was foundering. His negatives remained safely hidden. One year later he was back at his newspaper job and was able to photograph the official visit to Harbin of the exiled Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia. Mr. Li said that he finally felt safe by 1976, after Mao's death and the ouster of the Gang of Four, the radical Communist leaders blamed for the worst turmoil and persecutions of the Cultural Revolution.
Only then did he begin to organize his hidden photographs. "At that moment, I believed that the politically negative images would one day be presented in public," he said.
In 1982 he began teaching at a Beijing university, and it was there, in 1988, that 20 of his images were first exhibited. "A competition was organized of three decades of photos, 10 years before, 10 years during and 10 years after the Cultural Revolution," he said. "But they couldn't find any for the revolution's years. I didn't want to participate, but the organizer begged me and I sent a series called, 'Let the past speak to the future.' I won the top prize."
Among those who discovered Mr. Li's pictures then was Robert Pledge, president of Contact Press Images, a photo agency. The two men hoped to work together, but that notion was dashed in 1989 by the repression in Tiananmen Square and the political clampdown that followed. But in 1996, after Mr. Li was invited to lecture in the United States, he again met Mr. Pledge. And in subsequent trips, he gradually carried all his negatives to New York, at first surreptitiously, later with little fear that they might be seized. 
"Li estimates that he took 100,000 photographs between 1963 and 1976," Mr. Pledge said. "He had already eliminated one-third. Of the 60,000 remaining, many were of daily life. There were 30,000 with historical and journalistic interest related to the Cultural Revolution."
For the book, Mr. Li and Mr. Pledge decided that the photographs should be accompanied by a personal essay and historical background. 
Jacques Menasche, a New York-based journalist who helped draft Mr. Li's memoir, also wrote a chronology of the Cultural Revolution. Jonathan D. Spence, an authority on China at Yale University, wrote an introduction.
As the exhibition opened here on June 27, Mr. Li said he felt vindicated. Thanks to what he describes as his "rebellious nature," having defied a system that no longer exists, he can now "show the world what really happened during the Cultural Revolution." But he still wants that world to include young Chinese. "Only when they see these pictures," he said, "will they know that what they have been told is true."

HEADLINE: Shares Are Up, But Lawsuits May Unsettle AOL's Future 

BYLINE:  By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK 

 BODY:
The shareholder lawsuits accusing AOL Time Warner of accounting fraud are just getting started, but a slip-up by a federal judge may have offered an early clue to the outcome.
 In what one legal scholar called "the judicial equivalent of a Freudian slip," Judge Shirley Wohl Kram of United States District Court in Manhattan responded to a preliminary letter from shareholders' lawyers by ordering AOL Time Warner to turn over millions of pages of documents before the lawyers filed a formal motion or the company had a chance to respond. When AOL Time Warner's lawyers complained, she quickly rescinded the order. 
 Judge Kram's slip does not establish how she may ultimately view the case, but securities lawyers called the move a bad sign for the company. Her readiness to order the disclosures immediately -- an unusual step in any case -- suggests how credible she considers the suit, which asserts that AOL executives used bogus transactions to inflate advertising revenue around the time the company acquired Time Warner. 
"I think the defendant should sense that they are facing an uphill battle," said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at Columbia Law School. 
One year after AOL Time Warner disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department were investigating its accounting, the company's share price is up more than 50 percent from its lows last summer, to $16.30 a share last week, and some analysts are again recommending the stock.
But the investigations and lawsuits remain among the biggest questions hanging over the company. Costs could well be higher than many expect, in part because the accusations involve statements made around the time that AOL, led by its chairman, Stephen M. Case, bought Time Warner in 2000.
S.E.C. fines or settlements are typically relatively minor, up to tens of millions. But shareholder suits can end up being far more costly. Almost all shareholder suits that survive a motion for dismissal end in a settlement rather than a trial.
The average settlement of a class-action suit seeking more than $5 billion in damages in the last eight years was 2.8 percent of the plaintiffs' estimated damages, according to the consulting firm Cornerstone Research. In the case of AOL Time Warner, the total damages claimed might range from $30 billion to $100 billion. But the percentage in settlements can go far higher in prominent cases. The most expensive payment was made by the real estate and travel services company Cendant, which three years ago paid $2.85 billion to settle shareholder suits over accounting problems in a previous acquisition.
Samuel D. Heins, a Minneapolis lawyer suing AOL Time Warner on behalf of the Minnesota State Board of Investments as the lead plaintiff in the class-action suit, declined to comment on possible settlements.
But legal experts say that the settlement in this case may well exceed previous benchmarks and formulas because of the political impetus among judges and regulators these days to crack down on corporate fraud.
"There has been a regime change," said Joseph A. Grundfest, a law professor at Stanford and a former member of the S.E.C., adding that "settlements are more difficult for companies to negotiate in the post-Enron environment." 
A spokeswoman for AOL Time Warner declined to comment. The company disclosed last year that it had overstated its financial results by $190 million over 21 months beginning in the fall of 2000. It said it had inflated the results through a series of bogus "round-trip" deals, in which it appeared to pay another company for goods or services but then recycled some of the payments back to itself as revenue and profits. 
Then, this spring, AOL Time Warner disclosed that the S.E.C. was questioning its accounting in a further $400 million in payments from Bertelsmann as another possible form of a round-trip deal. AOL is still defending its accounting for the Bertelsmann payments in talks with the S.E.C. (Legal experts say the commission is likely to block other moves requiring its approval, like AOL Time Warner's planned initial public offering of its cable division, until the matter is resolved.)
AOL Time Warner's acknowledged overstatements amount to 1.9 percent of its cash flow over the period. And the company has only restated payments that took place after shareholders approved the acquisition of Time Warner in June 2000. To prove securities fraud in the normal course of business after the merger closed, shareholders' lawyers would have to show that company executives intentionally or recklessly misled investors. 
But in the complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, shareholders' lawyers argued that to take advantage of the Internet boom, and then consummate the merger, AOL was deceiving investors in a significant way as early as January 1999.
The timing could make a crucial difference in the case. Securities laws impose stricter requirements on companies issuing new shares, as AOL did in acquiring Time Warner. Proving fraud in issuing new shares only requires evidence of significantly misleading statements, regardless of the executives' knowledge or intentions. "It shifts the balance of advantage very much to the plaintiff," Professor Coffee said.
"Plaintiffs have an easier burden leading them to be able to extract a bigger settlement," said David Tabak, a vice president at National Economic Research Associates, which tracks class-action settlements.
The largest overstatement that AOL Time Warner has acknowledged occurred in the third quarter of 2000, after shareholders approved the merger in June 2000, but before it closed in January 2001. The company has said that improper accounting added $30 million, or about 5 percent, to AOL's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a common measure of performance. 
Lawyers for shareholders are expected to argue that the real date for the issuance of new shares in the merger was at its closing, after those acknowledged overstatements. But the complaint also contends that bogus round-trip transactions were more significant than their share of the company's revenue suggests. The bogus deals specifically inflated the AOL Internet service's highly profitable online advertising and commerce revenue, which analysts and investors considered the main propeller of the company's growth and the principal reason to buy its shares. 
Drawing mainly on news reports, company statements and related lawsuits, the complaint cites at least three reciprocal or round-trip deals -- with Sun Microsystems, Gateway and Hughes Electronics -- that it says improperly inflated AOL's results and prospects even before the shareholders approved the deal. 
AOL Time Warner has said that it accounted properly for all three transactions. Legal experts say its lawyers are likely to argue that the effective date for issuing the shares was when shareholders approved the deal, in June 2000, not the closing six months later. Most of all, they are expected to argue that investors cannot contend they were deceived by a pattern of reciprocal payments because these were fully disclosed.
Indeed, Robert W. Pittman, the former president of AOL and chief operating officer of AOL Time Warner, had made the two-way deals a point of pride, often boasting that AOL tried to sell advertising to anyone it paid for goods or services.
When it comes to settlement talks, lawyers for AOL may argue that its shareholders lost far less than those of Lucent Technologies, where the share price fell to less than $2 from more than $60 after hidden financial problems came to light. In March, Lucent agreed to pay $315 million to settle a shareholders' suit, a favorable post-Enron benchmark.
Still, lawyers for Lucent shareholders said at the time that the size of the payment was limited mainly by Lucent's ability to pay. But AOL Time Warner remains large and profitable. The company declined to comment on its insurance policies, but they will probably cover some of any settlement, although most policies have ceilings far below the size of major payments like Lucent's or Cendant's. 
In any event, some settlement is almost certain since Judge Kram appears unlikely to grant a motion for dismissal. As she wrote in her original order, the lead plaintiff "is not in any sense engaged in a fishing expedition or an abusive strike suit," suggesting that it was a matter of time before its lawyers got their hands on those millions of pages of documents.

 The prince, Walid bin Talal, has approached some of Le Meridien's largest investors about a turnaround plan that would provide the company with $:125 million ($208 million) in capital, executives close to the negotiations said yesterday. 
 Le Meridien owns 135 prominent hotels and resorts worldwide, including the Grosvenor in London and the Venetian in Las Vegas. The company was purchased by a group of investors that included a private equity firm, Terra Firma Capital Partners, in August 2001, shortly before travel plummeted as a result of the Sept. 11 attacks. Since then, saddled with heavy debts and high costs, Le Meridien has struggled to pay its bills. 
The hotel chain missed a $:20 million ($33.3 million) payment due last week to the Royal Bank of Scotland. The bank, in turn, has threatened to give Le Meridien's British hotels, which it owns and leases to the hotel company, to another chain. A spokesman for Terra Firma would not comment.
Prince Walid, who is a nephew of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, earned a reputation for shrewd investing in downtrodden companies with his purchase of Citibank shares in the early 1990's. Bad real estate deals had driven the shares down then to less than $10, and the prince made billions when the share price of the successor company, Citigroup, rose through the late 90's. His investment vehicle, the Kingdom Holding Company, has stakes in other hotel chains, including the Four Seasons.
If the prince decides to invest in Le Meridien, he and his investing partners will be competing with Lehman Brothers. The brokerage firm, which has lent Le Meridien about $400 million, has been discussing a plan with other banks to put about $167 million into the company to keep it solvent. On Thursday, Lehman Brothers and Le Meridien each gave the Royal Bank of Scotland $:2 million ($3.3 million) toward the overdue payment.
Merrill Lynch and CIBC, with about a dozen other banks and financial companies, have lent Le Meridien an additional $1.2 billion and can therefore be expected to play a major role in the company's future. Under the terms of the Lehman plan, these banks would have to accept lower interest rates for the loans they hold, and any would-be rival could appeal to the banks by offering them more for their loans. A Lehman spokesman could not be reached for comment.
In October 2001, the prince was rebuffed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York when he offered to make a $10 million donation to a World Trade Center fund. The prince had said that the United States should take a more balanced view on Israeli-Palestinian matters. 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 11, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Monday about a proposed turnaround plan for the financially struggling hotel chain Le Meridien misstated its relationship with the Venetian Casino Resort in Las Vegas. While the Venetian has a marketing relationship with Le Meridien, it is owned by Las Vegas Sands Inc.

PERSON: Robert M. Batscha 

HEADLINE: Robert M. Batscha, 58, Dies; Archived Television and Radio 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Robert M. Batscha, who worked to preserve, archive, study and permanently exhibit two of the more ephemeral modes of mass communication as the longtime president of the Museum of Television and Radio, died Friday in Manhattan. He was 58.
 The cause was cancer, said Diane Reed, the director of public relations for the museum. 
 In his more than two decades as president of the museum, Dr. Batscha vastly expanded its collection, moved it to Midtown Manhattan, opened a branch in Beverly Hills and brought together industry leaders, stars and academics at seminars.
Museum visitors can listen to Franklin D. Roosevelt's fireside chats or Orson Welles's "War of the Worlds." They can watch tapes of the lunar landing, the Nixon-Kennedy debates, "Beverly Hills, 90210" or "The Sopranos." And they can rerun famous commercials. 
Dr. Batscha long argued that television was worthy of study and that old programs, those that recorded history and those that highlighted the frivolous aspects of popular culture, were museum pieces. "Criticizing TV is second only to watching TV as an American pastime," he said in 1992. "Now, we want to give TV its day in the sun. It's a medium that has got to be recognized."
The museum was founded in 1975 by William S. Paley, the television pioneer and former chairman of CBS. It was originally the Museum of Broadcasting; the name was changed to the Museum of Television and Radio in 1991 so it could include programs transmitted by other means, including cable and satellite. 
Dr. Batscha, a political scientist by training, became the museum's president in 1981. 
Born in Rochester, N.Y., and raised in New York City, he graduated magna cum laude from Queens College and received a Ph.D. in political science from Columbia University. Before going to work at the museum, he was a senior consultant at the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. 
When he arrived at the museum, it occupied two floors in a converted office building and its catalog included about 5,000 titles. It now has 120,000 titles.
Dr. Batscha became a prodigious fund-raiser, and he oversaw the museum's expansion on two coasts. In 1991, the museum moved into a tower at 25 West 52nd Street. In 1996, it copied its entire collection and opened a branch in Beverly Hills. 
The museum is financed by the radio and television industries, corporations, foundations, individuals and government agencies.
The chairman of the museum's board of trustees, Frank A. Bennack Jr., said Dr. Batscha had expanded not only the museum's collection and display space, but also its mission. "When you put it together, he was the architect of something that very faithfully carried out the mission envisioned by Mr. Paley, but clearly expanded on it," he said.
Dr. Batscha is survived by a son, Eric, 21, of Manhattan, and by a former wife, Francine Sommer, also of Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Dry Prospects 

 BODY:
It was so wet in the Northeast last month -- the wettest June in a century -- that it was almost hard to believe it was dry anywhere else in the country. Yet it is dangerously dry in some places, as the wildfires in Arizona have demonstrated. The depression many New Yorkers felt as rain fell day after day was an unimaginable luxury in most of the West, where a drought that has already lasted five years is limbering up for another summer. 
 There has been a little relief here and there, along the Front Range in Colorado, in portions of southeastern Montana and northern and eastern Wyoming, where snow and rain fell recently. But in the Southwest, the drought looks chronic and perpetual, and it is reinforced by brutal competition between farmers and metropolitan areas for scarce water resources. A city like Phoenix, which depends on the snowpack feeding the Colorado River hundreds of miles away and which gets less rain in a normal year than New York had in June, could begin to look like an unsustainable proposition. 
 The Interior Department's Bureau of Reclamation has issued a new report called "Water 2025," intended to guide local and regional planning for water use in the West. It comes not a moment too soon. The ongoing drought inspired the project, but so has the dramatic population growth in arid regions over the past decade, particularly in Nevada and Arizona. If the West were still sparsely settled, the severity of the drought would be serious enough. Now, the drought is bearing down on an enormous number of people -- cattle ranchers, farmers, vacationers and city dwellers alike. Brown lawns aren't the same, in economic impact, as parched rangeland, desiccated farmland or ashen forests, but they make themselves felt nonetheless. What "Water 2025" recognizes is that unless the right plans are made, the potential for future conflict over water rights is very high. 
The water-starved West can no longer bet on "normal." Even normal precipitation from here on out will not quickly do away with the effects of such a prolonged drought. Drought plans have been adopted all across the West, and even Arizona, which has been slow to act, is developing one. What those plans describe for the foreseeable future is a new reality, a reality of careful water usage, careful storage and even more careful conservation.

HEADLINE: Feeling Shortchanged by a City in a Crunch 

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
For 35 years, whenever a neighbor or friend has walked into the Francisco Funeral Home, members of the Francisco family have been there to offer their kind of Ozone Park compassion -- a gentle hug, a feathery pat on the hand and a mention of the correctly remembered name of the deceased's mother or father. 
 But these days, the family is looking for a little compassion of its own. On the rare occasion when the three generations of Franciscos can steal enough time from their hectic schedules for coffee or lunch in the funeral home's reception room, they complain that the city, intent on taking care of its own fiscal problems, has turned a deaf ear to people like them. 
 "What did they do, forget about us in Ozone Park?" asked Antoinette Francisco, 84, the iron-willed family matriarch, who lives above the funeral home and sometimes pads through in a house dress and slippers to join the others at the table. She is mad enough to spit because she has been trying for years to get the city to trim dead branches from a maple tree on the sidewalk beside the funeral home. 
In a city as large as New York, the everyday concerns of ordinary people can easily get lost. But when examined on the scale of a single block, like this one in Queens, they give a vivid sense of just how New Yorkers are coping with the burdens imposed by the city as it grapples with its biggest fiscal challenges in years.
Such close-up views also show how difficult it may be for city officials to satisfy New Yorkers, who have been hit in the last few months by higher taxes, transit fares, tolls and rents.
The Franciscos, who know the importance of service because they have all been in the business of providing it, were relieved last month when the city averted most of the cuts in services it had threatened. But they still wonder why, when they keep paying more in taxes, the city does not seem to have enough money to take care of the things that matter to them. 
For Leslie and Ralph Francisco, who run the funeral home, the city's cost-cutting over the last eight years has meant spending precious time driving not to funerals and burials but to a Manhattan records office to register death certificates. 
Their eldest son, Ralph Jr., a paramedic, and his wife, Erika, a nurse, are expecting their first child. But forced overtime because of staffing cuts has pushed them further into an income bracket that makes them ineligible for the city's moderate-income housing programs, and puts their first house further out of reach. 
The Franciscos' other son, Richard, plans to become engaged soon, but his limousine business has been hurt by the economic downturn, and he fears that the mix of tax increases and 4,000 layoffs imposed by the Bloomberg administration will make the city a less desirable place to live and work. 
And then there is Ralph Sr.'s mother, Antoinette Francisco. The gauge of her feelings about the city is a simple tree. 
When Mrs. Francisco and her husband, Salvatore, opened their first florist shop in 1945 in rented space on the northeast corner of 103rd Street and 101st Avenue, a skinny maple was already growing alongside the white house across the street.
Years later the Franciscos bought an empty lot on that block and built their own florist shop. And when the white house with the tree, cater-corner from the soaring sandstone facade of St. Mary Gate of Heaven Roman Catholic Church, went up for sale, Mrs. Francisco and her husband bought it. They eventually converted the first floor into a funeral home for their son Ralph's new business, and adopted the maple as their own. 
As the family's enterprises grew, so did the tree. They acquired more property on the block, and the funeral home prospered, its white stone exterior and delicate awning on 101st Avenue becoming a familiar beacon for generations of families. 
A few years ago, the maple's top branches turned black, and Mrs. Francisco, a widow now, called the Parks Department to have someone take care of it. After working in the flower shop for so many years, she could not stand to see the tree go untended.
The Parks Department put her name on a list and told her to wait. So she waited. 
And she waited. Last month she complained to her city councilman, Joseph P. Addabbo Jr.
Mr. Addabbo, chairman of the parks committee, said in an interview that the city's $2.7 million tree maintenance budget had been slashed, and that it looked for a while as if none of the city's trees would be pruned this year. But when the City Council and the mayor reached a budget agreement last month, the tree money was restored.
Mr. Addabbo has ordered his staff to review all requests for tree pruning, but he said it would not be reasonable for anyone to expect crews to show up immediately. "We're still in bad financial times," he said. 
The budget restorations did not impress Mrs. Francisco. "They haven't got the money, and then all of a sudden they've got it?" she asked. "What is that?"
While the other members of the family are happy that thanks to the budget agreement libraries will remain open and garbage will be picked up twice a week, they still feel shortchanged.
"We pay all these taxes," said Leslie Francisco, who devotes substantial volunteer time to community service, "and what do we get?" 
One thing they do not have yet is the modern system for registering death certificates that the city promised years ago. When faced with an earlier fiscal crisis, in 1994, the city decided to close vital-records offices in every borough but Manhattan. 
As a result, either Ralph, 60, or Leslie, 56, who live just a few blocks from the funeral home, spends more than an hour driving into Manhattan to file a death certificate for each funeral. Once there, they often have to wait in line another hour. The city reopened a burial desk in Brooklyn last year, but it takes the Franciscos almost as much time to get there as to Manhattan, and the lines are sometimes longer.
Eight years ago, at the urging of the Franciscos and other funeral directors, the city agreed to develop a computerized registration system. About $3.2 million was spent to design one, according to an audit released on June 23 by the city comptroller. Then the plans were abandoned when the prototype system developed serious problems, like registering some men as having been pregnant when they died. The city now plans to spend $1.8 million more for project design. The comptroller's audit called the aborted plans "a monumental waste" of taxpayer dollars.
So Mr. Francisco had to make the dreaded trip into Manhattan again on a recent Monday to file a death certificate. "It's ridiculous, a complete waste," he said, his voice rising above the hush of the funeral parlor.
Leslie Francisco, a lifelong New Yorker, sees the boondoggle over the computerized death certificates as a symbol of the city's diminishing ability to respond to the real needs of real people. "I really have a hard time saying I see things getting better," she said. 
New York's future also looks rather bleak to the latest generation of Franciscos. Ralph Jr., 32, a paramedic for the Fire Department, and his wife, Erika, also 32, a registered nurse at St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital, have been living in one of his grandmother's houses alongside the funeral home since they were married in 2001.
They have been saving to buy their own house, preferably in the neighborhood, but have not found anything they can afford. 
With Erika expecting their first baby in January, they are afraid to take on too large a mortgage because she will have to stop working for a while. The average price of a house in Ozone Park and other Queens neighborhoods they considered is more than $350,000. But right now they make too much money to qualify for any of the city's moderate-income housing programs. 
Mr. Francisco is especially frustrated because the mandatory overtime he was forced to take after layoffs left the Fire Department shorthanded pushed his salary even higher above the qualifying threshold for the city's housing programs, and thrust him and his wife into a higher tax bracket. 
Last month they thought they had found a good deal when they read a newspaper advertisement for refurbished government-owned town houses in Harlem. Six of the 23 buildings are considered moderate-income housing, with prices starting at $331,000. But buyers must have a combined household income of no more than $60,000. Erika's salary alone exceeds that, Mr. Francisco said, and the starting salary for a Fire Department paramedic is more than $40,000. 
For buyers at their income level, prices for the town houses shot up to $689,000. "It's crazy," Mr. Francisco said, throwing up his hands. "Who can live in New York on a combined income of less than $60,000 a year?"
David A. Jackson, an assistant commissioner in the division of home ownership at the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said that he was aware of the difficulties facing working New Yorkers with moderate incomes, and that despite the tight city budget, work was being done to provide housing "for people like that." 
Mr. Francisco's younger brother, Richard, 25, may soon join the ranks of people like that. He lives in one of his grandmother's buildings and runs a limousine service from an office next to the funeral home. 
He plans to be engaged soon, but the economic slowdown and fiscal crisis have hurt him. As families try to economize on funerals, fewer people spend money on limousines. At the same time, Mr. Francisco says, the Bloomberg administration's tax increases -- especially the rise in the sales tax -- might backfire, driving out businesses and consumers alike. 
"Give it time, six months to a year, and you're definitely going to see a change for the worse," said Mr. Francisco, who has already begun exploring the option of living in Westchester County or on Long Island after he marries. 
This spring, Mr. Francisco got himself a bulldog he calls Hunter. He put a spiked collar on the dog, and on warm afternoons when there are no funerals, he walks Hunter on 103rd Street, keeping the dog away from the flowers by his grandmother's trees. 
When he sees the woeful condition of the maple, he too wonders what happened to the trimmer the city was supposed to send. 
"Maybe it's the rain," he said sarcastically, glaring at the forlorn maple. "Yeah, the rain."

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 JacobHacker's warnings about the Medicare drug bills before Congress are well taken ("How Not to Fix Medicare," Op-Ed, July 2). 
But he doesn't offer a solution to the problem of paying for drugs. The projected cost of $2 trillion over the next decade is an unaffordable burden for both the elderly and the government. 
 Drugs are expensive because the government provides patent monopolies to drug companies. If the government directly financed biomedical research and allowed all drugs to be sold in a competitive market -- as is currently the case with generics -- drugs would be affordable for all, not just the elderly.

HEADLINE: Civil Rights, The Sequel 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
It's been more than 30 years since Whitney Young Jr. died and his name is no longer particularly well known, which is a shame.
 Mr. Young was the executive director of the National Urban League and one of the big four civil rights leaders of the 1960's, along with Martin Luther King Jr., Roy Wilkins and James Farmer. 
 He drowned at the absurdly young age of 49 during a visit to Nigeria in 1971. More than 6,000 people attended his funeral at Manhattan's Riverside Church, and thousands more lined the streets of Harlem to view the funeral procession. Mr. Young had been a giant in the movement and it was widely recognized that his death represented a terrible loss. 
What was not understood at the time was that an incredible decades-long slide into the horrors of violence and degradation for millions of African-American youngsters was already under way. More than three decades later we still haven't stopped the descent.
It is now absolutely normal in many circles for young black men and women (and, for that matter, little black boys and girls) to refer to one another as niggaz and bitches and ho's. Doing well in school is frequently disdained as a white thing. Doing time in prison is widely accepted as a black thing, and no cause for shame.
Few people are surprised to hear that a gathering at this party or that club degenerated into the kind of violence we used to associate with the O.K. Corral. Homicide, drugs and AIDS are carving the heart out of one generation after another, and suicide among blacks is on the rise.
Just before I sat down to write this column I happened to glance at an article that was on the front page of last Thursday's Boston Globe. Beneath a color photo of a black toddler, the article began:
"A 3-year-old girl remained in critical condition last night after a former high school basketball star allegedly ended a shouting match with a woman by spraying her Dorchester house with bullets, hitting the child in the back and severing her spinal cord."
My question is a simple one: When are we going to stop this?
I'm waiting for the mothers and the fathers, the aunts and the uncles, the older brothers and the older sisters to step forward and call a halt to the madness, to say: "Enough! This is not what we're about."
I mentioned Whitney Young Jr. because I had a conversation a few days ago with Marc Morial, the former mayor of New Orleans who has just taken over as head of the Urban League and is hoping to raise its profile to a level comparable to the glory days of the Whitney Young era.
He plans to lay out his agenda in a keynote address to be delivered later this month at the league's annual convention.
My suggestion: Hammer home the need to stop the self-destruction that continues to block the advancement of millions of black Americans.
I know there are serious economic problems, particularly the absence of good jobs, that are holding some people back. And I know about the abuses in the criminal justice system and the continuing plague of racism and discrimination. I've written reams about all of these things.
None of them are good reasons for parents to turn their backs on their children, for children to turn their backs on school, for a young man or a young woman to pick up a needle and plunge it into a vein, for a gunman to put a bullet into a rival's head or a neighbor's spine, for blacks to view themselves as niggers and whores, for entertainers to sing of the joys of rape and murder.
The paradox of black life in America over the past half-century is that so much real progress and such wholesale tragedy should have occurred in the same place at the same time. The task now is to reinforce the progress and bring the curtain down on the tragedy.
Young leaders like Mr. Morial (he's 45) and venerable institutions like the Urban League (it's 93) are perfectly positioned to begin the coordinated effort that's needed for this fight, which is the most serious to face black Americans since the demise of legal segregation.
Those who are looking to government to lead this effort are deluded. George Bush and Clarence Thomas will not be riding to our rescue.
What's required is nothing less than round two of the civil rights movement, the goal being to create a safe and constructive and nurturing environment in which all black Americans can thrive.

HEADLINE: South Is Posing '04 Questions For Democrats in the Senate 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, July 3 

 BODY:
The difficulties faced by Congressional Democrats in holding their strength in the Senate and House next year -- let alone regaining majorities -- are on vivid display in Georgia, a state that figured prominently in the party's loss of Senate control in 2002.
 Zell Miller, a Democrat, is quitting the Senate, and no prominent party member has yet stepped forward to contend for the job. But at least four Republicans, two House members and two businessmen, have begun campaigns to take the seat out of the opposition column. 
 "I think there is an excellent opportunity for a Republican to become the next United States senator from Georgia," said Representative Mac Collins, one of those who hope to succeed Mr. Miller.
Georgia is not the only Southern state where the Democrats face problems. It is unclear whether Democratic incumbents will be on the ballot in South Carolina, where 81-year-old Ernest F. Hollings has hinted at retirement, or North Carolina and Florida, where Senators John Edwards and Bob Graham are running for their party's presidential nomination. Their decisions on whether to seek re-election to the Senate will help determine how many open seats Democrats will have to defend in a region where President Bush is riding high. 
"In that part of the country in a presidential year it is kind of a perfect storm coming together for the Democrats, and it could get ugly for them," said Stuart Rothenberg, a nonpartisan analyst of Congressional races.
Nationally, Democrats have more Senate seats in play than Republicans, 19 to 15, and they concede that the South poses a challenge given Mr. Bush's strong showing in most Southern states in 2000.
But they see opportunities in Illinois, where Republicans have a troublesome open seat of their own, as well as Pennsylvania and a handful of other states where the party would like to make a serious run at incumbent senators. In Alaska, the former governor, Tony Knowles, a Democrat, could announce soon that he will oppose Senator Lisa Murkowski. She was appointed to the vacant Senate seat last year by her father, Frank Murkowski, when he left the Senate after being elected governor.
"I am not quivering in my boots," said Senator Jon Corzine, Democrat of New Jersey, who is coordinating his party's Senate campaign operation. "I think we just have a tough, hard competitive election coming up."
But unlike in 2002, when the fight for the Senate was fought across middle America in states like Missouri, Minnesota and South Dakota, next year the South will get much of the attention.
"This is where the battle is this time," said Representative Johnny Isakson, a House member from the suburbs north of Atlanta who has already raised almost $3 million for a Senate run, his third statewide race. "No question about it."
Georgia was a significant setback for Senate Democrats in 2002 when Saxby Chambliss, a Republican with ample help from Mr. Bush and an emphasis on domestic security, defeated the incumbent Democrat, Max Cleland. The governor, Roy E. Barnes, another Democrat, also lost in a surprise, sending the state party reeling.
Mr. Miller, a popular former governor who often sides with Republicans, announced in January that he would not be going back to the Capitol after serving only the four years of the unexpired term of Paul Coverdell. Since then, a handful of Democrats holding statewide office have looked at the race and passed. They appear unwilling to give up their secure posts, content to bide time for a governor's race in 2006. One state senator, Mary Hodges, has said she will seek the party's Senate nomination.
"That tells you something about the state of play of the Georgia Democratic Party these days when you don't have Democrats lining up for an open Senate seat," said Merle Black, a political science professor at Emory University.
State and national officials are continuing to recruit and to put forth several names, including Representative Jim Marshall, who was elected last year to his first term in the House; Mayor Shirley Franklin of Atlanta; and a few wealthy people who would be able to underwrite much of their own campaign. Democrats promise the party will have a credible contender. And they say that what looms as a hard-hitting Republican primary could improve their prospects if the party can coalesce behind a contender.
"This time next year, there will be a fully funded, totally engaged Democratic Senate candidate running," said Jeff DeSantis, executive director of the state party.
But that person might have some catching up to do. Besides the two lawmakers, two businessmen are seeking the Republican nomination for the Senate race -- Herman Cain, a motivational speaker and the former head of the Godfather's pizza chain, and Al Bartell, who last year lost a bid for lieutenant governor.
All are raising money and putting together organizations. Mr. Isakson and Mr. Collins are already engaged in a spirited exchange over who has the real conservative credentials in the race. Mr. Isakson, 58, a former real estate executive who is likely to have a spending advantage, is emphasizing his long roots in state Republican politics and arguing that his voting record in Congress should dispel any claim by his opponents that he is somehow moderate.
"I was Republican when Republican wasn't cool," Mr. Isakson said after an appearance at a Kiwanis meeting.
Mr. Collins, a trucking company founder from the center of the state, is making a case for his ties to working Georgians and his appeal in rural areas outside Atlanta, an approach that helped Sonny Perdue triumph last year in his race for governor. "We are in touch with more of the people than a lot of folks who will enter this race," Mr. Collins, also 58, said in an interview.
Senator George Allen of Virginia, who is running the Republican campaign operation, would prefer not to referee a lot of disputes that he knows could make the general elections more difficult. "We don't need to be cutting each other up to help the Democrats," Mr. Allen said. Still, he would rather have too many experienced candidates than too few. And he views the Southeast as the key to keeping the thin Republican majority or padding it.
"We have got to come out of the A.C.C. with a winning record," he said, referring to the Atlantic Coast Conference, one of the region's popular collegiate sports leagues.
The Republicans already have candidates running in North Carolina and South Carolina who are in to stay, no matter what Mr. Hollings or Mr. Edwards does. In Florida, which was famously divided the last time Mr. Bush ran, two Republican candidates are in gear and as many as five Democrats are waiting in the wings if Mr. Graham does not run for the Senate again.
Mr. Allen acknowledges, however, that just as Georgia is confounding Democrats at the moment, Illinois is proving ticklish for Republicans as they look for a substitute for Senator Peter G. Fitzgerald, who is retiring rather than run in an increasingly Democratic state.
Democrats think they can score there as well as against Senator Arlen Specter in Pennsylvania and are looking at Kentucky and Missouri, among other spots. Republicans would like to knock off two Democratic leaders, Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Harry Reid of Nevada, in states that went for Mr. Bush in 2000.
With the election 18 months off, the House picture has yet to take shape with few seats coming open through retirements. Democrats will face a challenge against a well-financed and practiced Republican operation intent on holding its control of the House.
In the Senate, Mr. Corzine says the soft economy and rising joblessness should give Democrats potent ammunition against Mr. Bush and the Republican Congress.
Mr. Allen says the accomplishments of the Republican-led Senate -- tax cuts and a possible Medicare drug benefit among them -- should help make the case for Republicans. "I would rather have our team and our issues going into this election than theirs," he said.

HEADLINE: New Threats and Opportunities Redefine U.S. Interests in Africa 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 6 

 BODY:
President Bush will leave Monday night for a five-nation tour of Africa, turning to a continent that his administration increasingly sees as a source of both threats and opportunities and no longer one that can be left at the bottom of the foreign policy to-do list.
 The official focus of the five-day trip -- which was originally scheduled for January but was postponed as the president prepared for war with Iraq -- is on fighting poverty and disease and promoting democracy. But it has taken on a new cast in recent weeks as Mr. Bush has assertively called for changes of government in Zimbabwe and Liberia and moved to the brink of sending American troops to Liberia as peacekeepers. 
 In his first trip to sub-Saharan Africa as president, Mr. Bush will visit Senegal, South Africa, Botswana, Uganda and Nigeria before returning home on Saturday. Each of those countries is an economic or political success by African standards, and Mr. Bush's presence is intended both to celebrate their progress and to encourage other African nations to continue the struggle toward free elections and free markets. 
His trip comes at a time when Africa is looming larger in calculations of American interests. In the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the United States is eager to keep poor nations with shaky governments from becoming breeding grounds and safe harbors for terrorists. It sees Africa as the world's last largely untapped market. It holds out hope that Africa's substantial oil reserves could play a larger role in fueling the American economy and perhaps serving as a counterweight to the influence of OPEC.
At a time when Mr. Bush is widely viewed, at home and abroad, as focused primarily on projecting American power and defending its interests by military means, administration officials say the president is determined to show another face of his foreign policy. They said the United States should be known as much for battling AIDS, helping villages get clean drinking water, supporting education programs and encouraging the resolution of armed conflicts as for exercising its military power.
The president "understands that America is a country that really does have to be committed to values and to making life better for people around the world, that that's what the world looks to America to do," said Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, in a briefing with reporters on Thursday. "It's not just the sword, it's also the olive branch that speaks to those intentions."
It is striking to African leaders and to many analysts in the United States that Mr. Bush, a conservative Republican who won less than 10 percent of the black vote in 2000 and has fought to hold down social welfare spending at home, has pushed this year for large spending increases to fight AIDS in Africa and to help poor nations nurture their economies.
They said they saw in Mr. Bush's engagement with Africa the hand of his two senior foreign policy advisers: Ms. Rice and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, the two highest-profile African-Americans in government. Neither Ms. Rice nor Mr. Powell has made a secret of the desire to have Washington play a more active role in a part of the world that American foreign policy long addressed only fitfully or as a pawn in the cold war and to acknowledge more fully the ties between Africa and the United States.
"Africa is part of America's history," Ms. Rice said. "Europeans and Africans came to this country together, Africans in chains. And slavery was, of course, America's birth defect. And we've been trying to deal with the consequences of it ever since."
There is still considerable skepticism, in Washington and in Africa, about the depths of Mr. Bush's commitment, diplomats and analysts said. There is concern among some Africa hands that Mr. Bush's interest will wane after he makes the point to the world that he is more than the unilateralist gunslinger he is often, fairly or unfairly, made out to be. With presidential politics increasingly coming to the fore at the White House, there is also grumbling among advocacy groups that the trip is little more than a way for Mr. Bush to flesh out his "compassionate conservative" platform for his re-election race.
Even diplomats and analysts who say Mr. Bush's interest appears genuine suggested that it is fair to question whether the trip, by a president who has never relished foreign travel, will be anything more than dutiful.
"Is this for real, or is this tourism?" asked Chester A. Crocker, who was assistant secretary of state for Africa in the Reagan administration, at a Brookings Institution symposium on Africa last week.
Administration officials say Mr. Bush's commitment is indeed substantial. They point to quiet but promising efforts made by the administration to broker a peace deal in Sudan. They mention the Pentagon's interest in forging closer military ties with friendly nations, and Mr. Bush's call last month to extend what economists say has been one of the most important elements of policy toward Africa, the African Growth and Opportunity Act, a trade law that allows many African products to be exported to the United States without duties and quotas.
"The president takes seriously Africa, African leaders and the potential of this continent," Ms. Rice said.
There are clearly risks for Mr. Bush, especially as he confronts more directly the problems of countries like Zimbabwe, whose economy is collapsing under the increasingly autocratic rule of President Robert Mugabe. If he sends troops into Liberia as peacekeepers, he will be putting American lives on the line for a nation that has been the site of brutal fighting and the source of considerable instability in the region for years. He would also be reviving the specter of Somalia, where 18 American soldiers died in a failed attempt at peacekeeping in 1993.
Somewhat to their own amazement, many advocacy groups that labored for decades to persuade the United States and other wealthy countries to do more for Africa say Mr. Bush appears intent on really making a difference.
"This trip needn't be just about tourism because there are the beginnings of an historic change in policy toward Africa, permitted by a Republican Congress, we hope, and led by, extraordinarily enough, a Republican president," said Jamie Drummond, executive director of DATA, a nonprofit group that calls for more assistance for Africa. "That's put us in a fascinating situation."
Mr. Drummond said the real test would be whether the president could win from Congress an agreement to finance fully the two programs that are the centerpieces of his Africa policy. One is a five-year, $15 billion plan to fight AIDS in 14 countries, 12 of them in Africa. The other, called the Millennium Challenge Account, is a pledge to channel $10 billion over the next three years to poor countries that can show that they are making nuts-and-bolts progress toward democracy and capitalism.
Budgets for both programs, however, are likely to be cut in the coming week below the levels sought by the White House. Even as Mr. Bush is putting a spotlight on the programs in Africa this week, a House appropriations subcommittee is planning to trim them back, both because of a budget squeeze and because Republicans on the subcommittee said the administration had not gotten either program fully up and running.
Asked about the $3 billion for next year sought by legislation creating the AIDS program, Representative Jim Kolbe, Republican of Arizona, the chairman of the subcommittee, said, "We're not really prepared in the first year to spend that vast amount on bilateral programs."
Mr. Kolbe said that he was a "big believer" in the Millennium Challenge Account program, but that the administration did not have people and systems in place yet to administer it. "We're not going to be able to do everything in that area, but we're going to do a lot," he said.
Ms. Rice said the president would take on his own party over the issue if necessary.
"The message to Congress is that the president requested funding at the levels he thought necessary to get the job done," she said. "And we are all of us actively engaging with the Congress to try and get full funding."

HEADLINE: President Bush's Africa Trip 

 BODY:
American presidents do not travel to Africa often. President Bush's five-day, five-nation visit, starting today, marks a significant step in America's deepening relations with the continent. For too long, Washington and other Western capitals treated Africa as if it were condemned to war, poverty and preventable epidemics. Mr. Bush understands that Africans are entitled to a better future, and that America can help them achieve it. 
 Turning that vision into reality will take more than whirlwind tours and inspiring speeches. Mr. Bush must press Congress to provide ample financing for his multiyear AIDS and development initiatives. He should also speak plainly with African leaders about steps they themselves need to take. More than 11 percent of the world's people live in sub-Saharan Africa. Their future depends on how well their countries handle the intertwined problems of H.I.V.-AIDS, ethnic and civil conflict, corrupt and abusive government and economic growth too feeble to provide jobs for rising populations. In each of the countries Mr. Bush is visiting -- Senegal, South Africa, Botswana, Uganda and Nigeria -- one or more of these issues belongs high on the agenda. 
 Senegal is a strong democracy, though plagued by a low-grade separatist insurgency in the Casamance region. Despite this, Senegal has set a healthy example in a deeply troubled neighborhood and has participated in efforts to negotiate peace in Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast and Liberia. 
South Africa has one of the continent's most developed economies and biggest H.I.V.-AIDS problems. President Thabo Mbeki is sub-Saharan Africa's most prestigious leader. But his failure to confront the AIDS pandemic has caused public health damage at home and hurt efforts elsewhere to overcome the stigmatization that undermines effective prevention and treatment. If Mr. Bush can persuade Mr. Mbeki to follow a more enlightened course, America's AIDS assistance programs will save more lives. Mr. Mbeki has also failed to do all he should to help resolve the crisis in neighboring Zimbabwe, where President Robert Mugabe has clung to power through repression and fraud. 
Botswana is blessed with mineral wealth, a relatively small population, vigorous democracy and enlightened environmental policies. But it is cursed with Africa's highest H.I.V. infection rate, with two of five adults affected. In contrast to Mr. Mbeki, President Festus Mogae has worked hard to contain the disease. Even more energetic steps could be taken, modeled on the anti-AIDS campaign led by Uganda's president, Yoweri Museveni. By mentioning AIDS in almost every speech and carrying the campaign into every village, Mr. Museveni has gone far to destigmatize the disease. That has helped reduce the infection rate by two-thirds, a remarkable life-saving achievement. Mr. Museveni's leadership would be far more impressive if he permitted opposition parties and free elections, a point Mr. Bush should insist on. 
The Bush visit concludes in Africa's most populous country, Nigeria. President Olusegun Obasanjo has been a consistent opponent of military dictatorship, but his first term as an elected civilian ruler was extremely disappointing. He has failed to crack down on corruption and army human rights abuses, neglected the economy and done little to heal dangerous religious and ethnic divisions. Now Mr. Obasanjo has become actively involved in efforts to bring peace and a transitional administration to Liberia. Yesterday the Liberian leader, Charles Taylor, said he would accept Nigeria's offer of safe haven. Mr. Bush needs to tell Mr. Obasanjo that he would be a more credible advocate of good governance abroad if he did more to practice it at home.

HEADLINE: After Upheaval of Scandal, Tax Office Is Still Under Fire 

BYLINE:  By ERIC LIPTON

 BODY:
The same morning in February 2002 that Martha E. Stark walked in to start her job as the head of New York City's Finance Department, 15 of her tax assessors were indicted on bribery charges. If things did not get worse, they did not get much better.
 Ms. Stark, appointed commissioner of finance by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, found a department plagued by, among other things, an incomprehensible set of rules that made it nearly impossible for the public to figure out just how the city calculated most real-estate tax bills. And her department, she learned, was stuck with computer systems so antiquated and vulnerable to manipulation that they all but invited more corruption. 
 The chaos was no minor matter. Ms. Stark's agency is the single most important revenue generator in the city, collecting more than $16 billion annually in local taxes, as much as the gross national product of some small nations. And the city, facing huge deficits, needs every penny of it. 
In the year and a half since she arrived, Ms. Stark said, she has linked her agency into a state-of-the-art computer mapping system that will allow property tax assessors to use aerial maps to monitor new construction. She has also imposed limits on contacts between assessors and property owners and started to rotate assignments within the department, both measures intended to prevent yet another corruption scandal.
"There is a lot more to do," Ms. Stark said one recent Friday evening in her fifth-floor office at the Municipal Building. "But I feel like I've accomplished a significant amount."
Others are not convinced. Elected officials in Albany say a package of legislative reforms intended to help collect some of the hundreds of millions of dollars lost to corruption and to improve the training of city workers failed to get enacted, in part, because of insufficient lobbying by the Bloomberg administration.
Some officials in the Finance Department itself, as well as the expert whom Ms. Stark hired this year to help overhaul the agency, but who then quit in despair, say her efforts have been timid or, worse, counterproductive. The agency, they say, is in worse shape now than when Ms. Stark started, in no small part because of a recent round of layoffs and a restructuring plan that some have called naive.
"You have a lot of different interests raising red flags," said State Assemblyman Brian M. McLaughlin, a Democrat from Queens who is chairman of the Assembly's Real Property Tax Committee.
What all parties agree on is that the remaining work necessary to fix the city's property tax assessment system is enormous.
The Finance Department is charged with collecting a long list of different sources of revenue, including parking tickets and business taxes. Most important, the agency assesses and collects the property tax.
New York City's 984,000 pieces of property -- from single-family homes to apartment buildings, office towers and shopping centers -- are supposed to be evaluated each year to determine how much the owner must pay in property taxes.
The corruption scandal involved 15 of the 38 assessors working in Manhattan, who were accused of taking millions in bribes over a 35-year period to cut property taxes for the owners of office towers, residential buildings and warehouses, costing the city $160 million in just the four years prior to their arrest. All 15 have resigned or been dismissed and, after being convicted of charges including conspiracy and bribery, were sentenced to jail terms ranging from 4 to 41 months, city officials said.
But the trouble extends beyond this high-profile case, according to some critics.
One of the antiquated computer systems is used to do automated appraisals on one- to three-family homes, which make up 70 percent of all the city's pieces of real estate. Linda Yancey, hired by Ms. Stark this year as the assistant commissioner for the property division, and who served for several months, said the data maintained in this computer system and a formula it uses to process the data are both so flawed that it routinely generates assessments for homes that are inaccurate.
The result is that one home in Queens might be assessed at a value that is much higher than a nearly identical home in a similar neighborhood in Brooklyn, Ms. Yancey said.
The city also has far fewer assessors -- it currently has a total of 132 after 20 were laid off in May, compared with more than 300 in 1991. Assessors, Ms. Yancey also found, lacked essential equipment, items as basic as phones and tape measures. Finally, she determined, the city was routinely failing to move fast enough to add recently constructed or expanded city buildings to the property tax rolls, losing out on millions of dollars in potential revenue.
When Ms. Stark hired Ms. Yancey, she called her someone with a fresh set of eyes, and great experience, most of it in upstate New York, as an assessor and teacher.
What Ms. Yancey's eyes found shocked her. "I am surprised that the city has not had a tax revolt," Ms. Yancey wrote in a letter to the New York City Council last April, shortly after she resigned. "The quality of assessments is so poor now that it is a wonder that the tax roll could be considered legal."
Leaders of the union that represents the city's tax assessors have also expressed concern about Ms. Stark's reform efforts. They charge that the tax exemptions recently given to builders of multifamily homes in the city may not have been justified. The tax-break program is intended to promote the construction of moderate-income housing -- as a certain number of units within each building must be occupied by people with modest incomes -- but the assessors say they were not given enough time to check each of the applications to ensure the exemptions were warranted.
"There has been a lack of oversight and a lack of sufficient staffing to make sure that exemptions are being given to property that deserve them," said David Moog, president of the local union of city assessors and appraisers. "And this problem has only gotten worse in the past year."
Assemblyman McLaughlin, in part because of such complaints, has announced he will open an investigation into the city property tax assessment system.
Ms. Stark called the complaints "outrageous and destructive."
"The city does a timely job of adding new construction to the tax rolls," she said. Tax exemptions are properly screened before they are granted, she said, and the Bloomberg administration stood behind the legislative bills intended to help remake her agency, even if she was disappointed that just one of the five proposals was enacted.
Ms. Stark also provided an analysis of city assessments of one- to three-family homes, which showed that in all but Manhattan, the full-market values the city assigned to them, on average, are close to actual sales values. Her spokesman said that the department needs to do a better job on homes in Manhattan.
Ms. Stark's most prominent initiative to date -- to revamp the way office buildings and other commercial properties are assessed -- has struggled so far.
The problem she faced was that building owners have routinely ignored a city requirement that they submit information on how much money they make by renting out their buildings, figures that the assessors are supposed to use in calculating how much the property is worth. At other times, they submit information that is out of date. This has meant that the assessors have to make their own judgments on the likely income or expenses in a certain building, guesswork that left the city assessors vulnerable to being improperly influenced by property owners.
To remedy these problems, Ms. Stark proposed something fairly radical: eliminate the annual reports and rely instead on data generated by real estate and consulting firms that publish surveys of office vacancy and income and expense data for groups of buildings by neighborhood. Using this publicly available data and a computer, assessors could more quickly and reliably arrive at assessments for office buildings.
The proposal, first floated by Ms. Stark in September 2002, was immediately condemned by the real estate industry. "Dumbed-down, inaccurate assessments," is what this approach would produce, said one real estate lawyer, who asked not to be named because he did not wish to openly criticize the city.
The Association of the Bar of the City of New York went on the record, saying that Ms. Stark's plan was "ill advised and contrary to law." The commissioner has since backed down, suggesting now that the annual reports of income and expenses still be used in arriving at the assessment, but that the information no longer be kept confidential, so that the process is at least not as obscure.
But even a compromise change in the system has yet to be put into practice. Ms. Stark, a lawyer who first worked in the Finance Department during the Dinkins administration, said she never figured that remaking the agency was going to happen overnight.
"Important projects take time," she said. "What you've got to be is steadfast and determined."

HEADLINE: Japanese Stay on Sidelines As Nikkei Stages a Big Rally 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 7 

 BODY:
A funny thing happened on the way to Japan's stock market rally: the Japanese did not show up.
 Since the end of April, when the Nikkei 225 hit a two-decade low, Japan's benchmark index has soared nearly 30 percent. But Japanese banks, life insurers and consumers, who hold the world's largest pool of savings, have mostly stood on the sidelines, even selling into the rally. 
 Instead, foreign mutual funds, hedge funds and other institutional investors from overseas have piled into the market here, investing 10 times as much money in Japanese stocks as local investors did in June, according to Finance Ministry figures. Since late April, the 57 United States-based Japanese equity mutual funds that AMG Data Services tracks have increased their investments by 61 percent, to $2.54 billion. 
The buying continued today when the Nikkei 225 index jumped another 2.6 percent, hitting a 10-month high of 9,795.
The divergent behavior of locals and foreigners is no small curiosity. Unless Japan's pension funds and investment trusts begin buying shares, too, the current rally could peter out before it really gathers momentum. If the nascent recovery falters or Japan's banks swoon again, foreign investors, who make up about 18 percent of the market, could lose confidence and start selling their shares.
Getting the locals on board, though, will not be easy, because their agenda differs from that of the foreigners. Many American and European fund managers looking at the global investment landscape say Japanese stocks are cheap, particularly blue chips like Matsushita Electric Industrial and Honda Motor. They are also encouraged by the recent 2 trillion yen ($16.7 billion) bailout of Resona Holdings because it signaled that the government would not let the country's financial system spin out of control, thus protecting shareholders.
While Japanese banks and insurers might agree that stocks are inexpensive, the government wants them to reduce their holdings to no more than 100 percent of their capital by 2004. To meet this goal, they must sell about another 4 trillion yen ($33.9 billion) in shares and shift the money into bonds and other less risky assets. The government and central bank have set up funds to make it easier for financial institutions to unload these stocks.
For their part, many Japanese companies are returning huge parcels of stock they have managed on behalf of the government's public pension system. A growing list of companies are also setting up 401(k)-style funds that shift the responsibility for managing pensions to workers.
Then there are the incentives that drive fund managers on both sides of the Pacific. American and European investment managers are paid bonuses based on how well their funds outperform the leading benchmarks, a system that pushes them to take bolder stakes. Japanese fund managers, who receive most of their compensation in the form of salaries, are more comfortable simply matching the broader market's performance.
This approach helps explain why in 1998, foreigners were also the first to dip back into the market after the government assembled a record 24 trillion yen ($200 billion) stimulus package and an even larger bailout of the banking system. It was only in 1999, after the economy had rebounded and the Nikkei 225 approached 20,000, that local investors felt secure enough to return to the stock market.
Unfortunately for them, the rally sputtered in early 2000 and, as foreigners headed for the exits, Japanese fund managers were forced to absorb huge losses.
"Psychologically, Japanese investors are very scarred," said Marc Desmidt, managing director at Merrill Lynch Investment Managersin Tokyo, which manages $7.8 billion in Japanese equities. "Now, if they see the market bounce up, they take their money off the table."
This caution has even affected the government, which typically tries to seize good news to trumpet its own policies. Last week, the chief cabinet secretary, Yasuo Fukuda, tried to play down the Nikkei's recent gains, warning that rising stock prices do not necessarily mean the economy has fully recovered.
Indeed, there are plenty of reasons to remain wary. The economy barely grew in the first quarter, and unemployment remains stubbornly high. Though interest rates are near zero, banks continue to reduce their loan books, which prevents the creation of new jobs. Companies are also under pressure to cut costs to offset the five-year decline in prices, which, perversely, may make the economy worse in the short term.
"Japanese have become used to deflation and think it won't disappear soon because there is still so much restructuring that needs to be done," said Katsumi Minai, a manager in the global investment department at the Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Company.
Still, if the Japanese stock market continues to improve, local investors are bound to take notice and increase their stakes. That will probably happen in October, when the second half of Japan's fiscal year begins. The crucial question is whether the rally will have exhausted itself by then, or will gain renewed momentum from the extra infusion of cash. If history is any guide, some fund managers say, the locals may have already missed the biggest gains.
"Japanese investors are late participants," said Atsuto Sawakami, who runs the Sawakami Fund, which has 49 billion yen ($415 million) in Japanese equities. "They are always the last ones in and the last ones out."

HEADLINE: Jobless but Not Hopeless 

BYLINE:  By Robert C. Pozen; Robert C. Pozen, a visiting professor at Harvard Law School, is the Massachusetts secretary for economic affairs.

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
When the United States unemployment rate climbed to 6.4 percent last week, the highest point in almost a decade, analysts were generally glum about the prospects for job seekers. They were being far too pessimistic, however: a close look at four other economic indicators point to the end of what some have called the "jobless" recovery. These indicators show significant declines in the rate of job losses -- and positive signs of new hiring in growing industries. 
 First, a set of surveys of corporate chief executives taken over the last month reveal that more than one-third of them are planning to hire in the third quarter and very few are planning to lay off workers. These surveys, conducted by the Center for State and Local Policy at the University of Massachusetts, polled 400 chief executives in Boston, Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco. The key question posed was this: In the next three months, the third quarter of 2003, will the number of employees at your company increase, stay the same or decrease? In total, 36 percent said the number would increase, 54 percent said stay the same, and 10 percent said decrease. These answers are quite upbeat compared with the employer pessimism that prevailed early in the year. 
 Second, in May and June, the Labor Department reported a rise in the number of temporary workers -- often a first hint of a rebound. Temporary workers are generally the first to be fired as times get bad and the first to be hired as times become good. In April, 1.6 percent of all workers were temporary employees, but that figure rose to 1.7 percent by June. This rise may be small in magnitude, but it represents a significant trend and a practical opportunity for unemployed workers.
Third, the number of wage and salary workers in the non-farm sector has actually risen by 266,000 since Jan. 1, according to the Labor Department's household survey. This rise contrasts sharply with the large loss of 1.4 million of those workers in 2001 and 2002. This sharp contrast strongly suggests a turnaround in the labor market, despite reservations about the statistics in the household survey. (The numbers for the total civilian population used for extrapolation in the survey sample haven't been adjusted for the call-up of reservists for the war in Iraq; but the absence of this adjustment probably accounts for only half of the increase.) 
Finally, the survey of employers also done by the Labor Department shows a modest decline of 30,000 jobs from May to June. This represents a big improvement in the rate of job decline over 2001 and 2002, a period when employers reported whopping losses of 2.2 million jobs -- an average loss of 90,000 jobs per month. 
In short, when the Federal Reserve Board talked in late June about "labor and product markets that are stabilizing," it was making an important point -- in its characteristically obscure and understated manner. The rates of change in recent Labor Department surveys, reinforced by the optimism in the recent set of chief executive surveys, strongly suggest that the job market is about to turn the corner. The trend in these surveys may mean an end to the "jobless" recovery as more Americans find work outside manufacturing -- in areas like education, health care and credit services.
The hot market for housing sales and mortgage refinancing means that jobs related to providing mortgage credit are growing. Because of retirements, high schools will be looking for new teachers, especially in math and sciences. And as the American population ages, more nurses will have to be trained, and so will pharmacy and radiation technicians. 
So job seekers should be flexible -- prepared to take temporary work that may lead to a permanent job, and ready to retrain in response to employers' evolving needs -- at this turning point in the labor market.

HEADLINE: The Pop Life; 
Just Can't Get Enough of That Romantic R&B

BYLINE:  By NEIL STRAUSS 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, July 6 

 BODY:
"It's like Mardi Gras," Alfred Moses Jr. said as he tried to edge his airport shuttle van through the crowded streets of the French Quarter here. "This sure brings a lot of business down here." 
 The two events that New Orleans is best known for are Mardi Gras and the Jazz and Heritage Festival, each a pilgrimage for a different type of reveler. But with much less fanfare a third event, the Essence Music Festival has also been closing down Bourbon Street for a few days every year, drawing tens of thousands of tourists looking for fun, music and alcohol in to-go cups. 
 Now in its ninth year, the festival has attracted headliners like the Isley Brothers, Aretha Franklin, the O'Jays, Mary J. Blige and Boyz II Men. But these are familiar national touring acts, and the festival itself is linked not to the city's culture -- as Mardi Gras and the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival are -- but to a magazine, Essence. So to an outside observer, the Essence festival doesn't seem unusual at first glance. But step inside the Louisiana Superdome, where three nights of concerts took place this weekend with performers like Stevie Wonder, Anita Baker, Yolanda Adams and Smokey Robinson in front of some 35,000 fans, and it becomes immediately clear that this is not a concert but an experience. 
"Just wait until the closing night, with Frankie Beverly and Maze," said the mayor of New Orleans, C. Ray Nagin, as he ate dinner backstage on the first night of the festival. "When you see the entire stadium floor doing the slide, it's unbelievable."
Essence, the 33-year-old lifestyle magazine for African-American women, with one million circulation, caters to an audience that is largely neglected by Hollywood and the mainstream culture industry. If one looks at the charts, Frankie Beverly and Maze, for example, have never had a Top 40 single. But to see the stadium full of people on their feet singing along and doing the electric slide to "Joy and Pain" on Saturday night was to realize that the music has had an impact that can't be captured on a marketing-research spreadsheet.
"When this festival started in 1995, rap was the biggest thing in music," said Quint Davis, a producer of the festival. "But we didn't have any rap. We had Luther Vandross and Patti LaBelle and B. B. King, and we drew 100,000 people. And this came as a shock to the industry. The gathering of the Essence family of successful African-Americans who are middle and upper class hadn't been seen in New Orleans -- and perhaps anywhere else. I don't think people realized the large-scale economic influence of this community."
Edward Lewis, the co-founder of Essence, said the festival was the largest gathering of African-Americans in the country: "I try to tell people what it's like, but am not able to put into words the experience of being here and seeing this shared family from all over the country and the Caribbean. People come dressed to the nines to have a good time."
The discerning Essence Festival audience, however, is not the easiest crowd to play to, as Erykah Badu, the idiosyncratic soul singer, found out on opening night. She strode slowly onstage with a stick of clove-smelling incense burning in her mouth, calm and in control. But her cool facade soon cracked as the audience sat still and responded only tepidly to her singing. 
"What are you yawning for?" she asked one audience member. "You're too old to be here anyway."
To get the audience on its feet, she played songs by Dr. Dre and Zapp from her CD player, but it helped only marginally. "I hope you all don't treat Stevie Wonder like this when he's out here," Ms. Badu said. Then she added that he wouldn't know anyway since he can't see the audience.
The lesson here is that you can't demand an audience response. You must work for it. When it was Mr. Wonder's turn to perform, that's exactly what he did. Despite some technical glitches early in his set that might have soured a more temperamental performer, Mr. Wonder, performing his only scheduled concert of the year, was soon in a radiant mood. After a slower new song, "True Love," he found his pace and tore into hit after hit. For "Do I Do," he even climbed on top of his piano bench. In a set that stretched until after 3 a.m., he often improvised nonsense words and slightly naughty rhymes like a gleeful schoolchild, pausing between songs to sip honey out of a plastic bear.
A shirtless LL Cool J, performing his early hits the following night, was also effective in bringing the audience to its feet.
In the conference rooms of the arena, four additional stages were set up for smaller performances. Among the highlights were the indefatigable Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers, the unearthly Bobby Blue Bland, the old-school rap of Doug E. Fresh and Biz Markie, and a back-to-his-roots Keith Sweat. 
Mr. Vandross was originally scheduled to headline the festival on the second night, but still recovering from a stroke, he was unable to make it. His band members did show up, and a variety of guests joined them for a tribute. Many of the younger pop stars, like Ashanti, Faith Evans and Jaheim, may all have good voices, but few were able to turn what seemed on the surface like cliched lyrics into affecting love songs. Usher worked admirably with "A House Is Not a Home" and "Never Too Much," but in the end came off as overwrought. 
In the end, Gerald Levert stole the show when he joined Ms. LaBelle for "If Only for One Night." Dressed in a pink shirt and a white suit with a matching pink handkerchief, he added playful energy to a tribute that for all its peak moments sometimes drooped.
Instead of engaging in histrionics to show how hard he was singing, he chose to goof off, like a comedian in a Luther Vandross karaoke show. But vocally he still delivered, sometimes with improvised jokes that sent peals of laughter echoing through the stadium. After the song's emotional crescendo, he dropped to his knees in front of Ms. LaBelle and ran the tassles on her canary-yellow dress through his hands as he bellowed, to her surprise, "I wanna play with your shingles, baby."

HEADLINE: In Sound's New Economy, Fewer Old Salts; 
Lobstermen Are Giving Way to Leisure Fishing and Shellfish Hatcheries

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: NORTHPORT, N.Y., July 6 

 BODY:
The traditions and values of earning a living from the waters of Long Island Sound find their purest expression around dawn. That is the moment of departure, the fisherman's great daily leap of faith: one little boat with a little crew sailing out of a mist-cloaked harbor to catch what nature and luck might bestow.
 But in the new marine economy of the 21st century that is unfolding all over the Sound's 110-mile arc from New York City to southern New England, luck is not what it used to be, and neither is nature. Predictable business models are in. Trusting to the beneficence of the sea? As dated as a tour before the mast. 
 For a glimpse into this new economic order, consider Chef Brett's Famous Crab Cakes. Until the late 1990's, Northport Fish and Lobster, where the cakes are sold, was a no-frills joint. Boneless filet was as fancy as it got. Lobster wholesaling was the volume business. As many as 9,000 pounds of wriggling lobsters passed through the store's tanks in a day, six days a week, bound for restaurants and markets all over the East Coast. 
Then, in late 1999, the Sound's lobsters began to die, for reasons that scientists have still not fully explained, and Northport Fish was thrown into crisis. So the owner improvised, reinventing the shop as an upscale catering and prepared foods business, and hired a trained chef, Brett Kaplan, to lead the transformation. Mr. Kaplan's crab cakes, selling for $2.50 a pop -- made from Maryland crabs, by the way -- became a best seller, supplanting the local lobsters. The lobstermen who once arrived in a daily cavalcade to sell their catches drifted away. 
"I felt for the lobster guys because I was kind of in the same boat," said Eric Gusew, Northport Fish's owner. "But I had ways to change my livelihood and adapt, and they didn't. I moved on."
Moving on is a sentiment one hears a lot these days in towns around the Sound's shore. The Sound generates at least $5 billion in economic activity, according to a study in the early 1990's commissioned by the federal government. But the mixture of that economy is evolving to a new place because of changes in the environment -- the result of deliberate human management and population growth. The question of who will win and who will lose is now playing out on the water and on the land.
Managed marine farming of shellfish like oysters, clams and scallops has surged, for example, even as the lobster trade faded. Hatchery-raised shellfish, sheltered from the vicissitudes of the wild, account for about half of the Sound's production, industry officials say, up from about 5 percent a decade ago.
The tourism and leisure trade -- from sport fishing to pleasure boating to vacation-home development -- also increasingly dwarfs the commercial fishing business of old. Where the two conflict, as they do more and more on the Sound's crowded waters and shores, residents and economists say, the recreation trade has the numbers and financial clout to put its agenda first.
Trends on land are accelerating those changes. Older residents in Northport, just a short hop east from the Nassau-Suffolk line, still remember it as a sleepy fishing village. But now it is an extended suburb of Manhattan, 35 miles to the west, and the many new long-distance commuters are changing the fabric that the fishermen helped define. The new people, residents say, were drawn by the pretty harbor and the small-town feel, not by the clamor and pungent smells of a fishing port.
And as the newcomers were filing in, the fishermen were filing out. Where there were 30 to 40 lobster crews sailing from Northport in the late 1990's, there are now on many mornings only one or two who quietly pack up and chug out into the sunrise.
"There's the old salts that care, but the new people probably love not having them around," said Paul Eliades, the owner of Tidewater Marine Supply, referring to the lobstermen, many of whom, he admits, were his former customers. "You don't have all the guys with their lobster pots, and their trucks filled with bait -- it would stink for days down there." 
John Nixon is one of the expatriates of the crustacean chase.
Mr. Nixon, 40, began fishing when he was 15, but now runs his own handyman business, Nix Maintenance. He trims trees, refinishes driveways -- whatever is called for. His wife, Diana, is pregnant with their first child. The lobsters might come back, Mr. Nixon said, or they might not. But he probably won't be around either way. 
"I can't be playing games," he said at his father's house, a few blocks from the water. "I can't wait around. I'm done."
Down on the docks, only the die-hard fishermen like Peter Ringen are left. He does electrical contracting work in the winter to make ends meet, and said he intends to continue fishing because it's his life. Some days he makes money, and some days -- by the time he has paid for gas and the salary of a deckhand -- he loses. 
"I told my wife I'm going to keep lobstering until I'm totally out of money," he said. 

The New Geography
New Borders Drawn Under the Water
The traditional way to think about Long Island Sound's geography has been the obvious political one -- Connecticut is on one side and New York is on the other. The Sound is also the dividing line on most maps between New England and the Middle Atlantic region. 
But there is a new borderline: within the water column itself.
Out on the Sound's eastern edge, the Mohegan Tribe, owner of the Mohegan Sun Casino, has committed $7 million to a shellfish hatchery and aquaculture program that will grow oysters not on the bottom where they normally sit, but in suspended trays mounted 10 to 12 feet from the bottom, extending up to 10 feet or so below the surface.
"Aquaculture is the next evolutionary step from fishing," said Dr. Paul Maugle, the aquaculture director for Mohegan Aquaculture LLC. The tray system, which has been used in British Columbia and in Asia but never on the East Coast, Dr. Maugle said, allows the animals to grow in cleaner water, and protects them from predators like starfish and crabs that live on the bottom.
New economic forms have emerged as well. In Groton, not far from the Mohegans, a group of small shellfish-growers from Connecticut and New York have combined into what they say is the first cooperative shellfish hatchery in the world. 
"It's about predictability," said Jim Markow, the president of the Noank Aquaculture Cooperative, which is growing millions of oysters, clams and scallops in bins and tubs in a small building on the shore. "We can't come close to competing with nature," Mr. Markow said. "But it's steady, and you can build a business on it."
The rifts around these new borders can run deep. Many boaters and fishermen in eastern Connecticut, for example, strongly opposed the Mohegan aquaculture plan. They said that dividing up the water column would put into private control a piece of the water that is now public domain for use by all, and that it would interfere with navigation. Federal and state regulators disagreed and approved the project last August. It is now under construction.
A similar proposal for the waters off the coast of Westport has also drawn fire from boaters who say the racks will destroy the use of a sailboat racecourse that has been used since the late 1880's.
The Westport developer, Dr. John M. Garofalo -- an obstetrician who founded his company, Mariculture Unlimited, two years ago -- said he specifically patterned his plan after the Mohegan project. The leases he has signed with the state give him the right to use the bottom, and he contends that the use of the water column above that, which requires a separate approval from the state and United States Army Corps of Engineers, would be far enough below the surface -- 17 feet at high tide -- to be unobtrusive. 
"We're asking for the same thing, the same kind of gear as the Mohegans, and if they don't give it to us, they have to explain what makes us different," he said. 
The new economic terrain is even coming with its own brands. At the Noank cooperative, for example, breeders are working specifically with a type of hard clam species that grows a characteristic stripe on its shell. The stripe occurs in the wild in only about 1 percent of the population, but the Noank breeders are using that genetic strain, as ranchers once labeled their steers with a bar X, to mark the borders of their clam beds and act as easily checked sentinels for the health of the crop. 

At Sea
The Stripers Are Biting
On a recent gray afternoon off the coast of Milford, Conn., aboard the research vessel John Dempsey, David Simpson gently cradled a big striped bass in his arms. The fish had done its bit for science -- it was measured and weighed in at nearly 18 pounds -- and now it was time to return to the water. 
Other people on the boat were flinging fish over the side without hesitation. Mr. Simpson, a supervising fisheries biologist for the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, walked to the boat's side and gently launched the big fish back into water, head first. In a silver flash, it was gone into the deep.
The striped bass population in the Sound declined to almost nothing about 20 years ago, and now the fish's numbers are back and booming. The resurgence has been one of Mr. Simpson's career markers, and he said he has a soft spot for the fish. But it has also marked a victory for those who said the Sound could be managed.
Some scientists and government officials argued in the 1980's, when the stripers had all but disappeared, that the Sound's environment had become too polluted to support the fish's return. Others said the striped bass could be restored through wildlife management and fishing restrictions. The people who said the fish could return won the argument. Striped bass has never been harvested commercially, but they are economically vital to the Sound as perhaps the most sought-after fish by recreational fishermen who spend millions each year on equipment, gasoline and supplies.
"In 1984, when we started these surveys, if we caught one striper, we'd go, 'Whoa,' " Mr. Simpson said, standing on the deck of the Dempsey. "Now in just this one pull of net, we got, what, 120 pounds or more."
The "nature can be managed" lesson of the stripers has rippled in many places.
At the National Marine Fisheries Service laboratory in Milford, scientists are working on ways to trick scallops into skipping their winter naps. Scallops, rather like bears, go into a dormant hibernation-like period in winter. But then during their scallop wake-up call in spring, many are eaten or die for reasons not well understood. The goal at the fisheries lab is to get the scallops to spawn in the hatchery in winter, bypassing the dangerous dormant stage.
"Technically we know we can do it; the question is whether we can do it economically so that value justifies the process," said Gary H. Wikfors, a research microbiologist at the lab. "It's engineering and economics together to make the biology work."
In the new managed world of the marine food supply, researchers like Dr. Wikfors say the next frontier will be all about the subtleties. The methodology of growing oysters in labs and hatcheries is now second nature. The science of making them grow faster or fatter is still being fine-tuned.
One of the discoveries: Oysters do better when they are a little stressed out. In the perfect conditions of the hatcheries, growers have found, oysters tend to get a bit too laid back. Giving the oysters a break from their dull routine -- from say, sudden jolts of temperature change in their water -- tends to make them healthier, with stronger immune systems that can fight off disease.

On Land
The Human Impact Is Evaluated
There is a deep paradox in the heart of the Sound's new economy: an improving environmental picture over the last decade coincided precisely with a profound challenge to the rhythms of the old commercial culture. Just as things were starting to get better -- very good for the recreational boating, fishing and tourism industry -- the fishermen who had hung on through better and worse did not get asked to the dance. Most of the Sound's oysters were killed in the mid-1990's by two shellfish parasites called MSX and Dermo; the lobsters followed suit a few years later.
Ecologists say that raises major questions about what sort of impact human beings are really having on the estuary.
Improving water quality, for example, is a boon to the housing industry, as more and more people pay top dollar for a shore view and shore access. And some scientists, along with many fishermen, feel that more shore development changed the habitats for both lobsters and their bivalve cousins -- the oysters, scallops and clams -- and perhaps contributed to diseases that took them. 
Many lobster fishermen, in particular, are vehement in their belief that pesticides sprayed in the summer of 1999 to kill mosquitoes bearing the West Nile Virus killed the lobsters, as rainwater from the torrential downpour of Tropical Storm Floyd, which struck the region that September, washed the poisons into the Sound from the newly built-up areas. Some of the new fishery management entrepreneurs say they worry about some of the same things.
"A lot of the shoreline has been developed in the last 20 years -- loss of marsh grasses, new trophy homes, a lot more hardening of the shoreline, a lot more activity on the water," said Karen Rivara, a marine biologist and founding member of the Noank Aquaculture Co-op. "The water is not the same as it was."
The resulting question, ecologists say, is who really lives most lightly on the Sound -- the working class fishermen, or the affluent newcomers who work in offices, but grow a chemically treated lawn right down to the water's edge? And if the improvement of the Sound leads to even more sprawl on its shores, might the goals of environmental management turn into a kind of Catch-22 -- the more they work, the more they fail?
"If we succeed, we may not like where we wind up," said Roger Tollefsen, a chemical engineer and president of the New York Seafood Council.
And there is the question of how the Sound's changes affect the economies of the communities on land. In places like Northport, officials say, a more attractive Sound, with its resulting higher property values, is squeezing out less-affluent wage earners, from fishermen to teachers and carpenters.
"I think it's healthy for the community, for the village, to have economic diversity -- I don't want it all white collar," said Peter G. Panarites, the mayor of Northport. "But truthfully speaking, I think we are slowly losing the diversity, just like we're losing our open space."

Human Nature
Over many years of settlement, Long Island Sound has been a breadbasket and a dumping ground, a private playground for the wealthy and a symbol of environmental despair. 
But when people reached for a new definition -- a repaired, restored, managed Sound -- nature did not respond according to the rulebook. 
For every push to achieve a certain end, the whorls of the ecosystem have pushed right back, often in unexpected ways. 
This is the fourth of a summer-long series of articles on the evolving nature of Long Island Sound. The fifth article will visit a popular beach on Long Island, where boaters, picnickers and nesting diamondback terrapins -- and a scientific team studying the little turtles -- somehow coexist.

HEADLINE: Iran Confirms Test of Missile That Is Able To Hit Israel 

BYLINE:  By NAZILA FATHI 

DATELINE: TEHRAN, July 7 

 BODY:
Iran has successfully conducted the final test of a midrange missile, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry here confirmed today.
 The missile, called Shahab-3, was first tested in 1998 and has a range of 806 to 930 miles, which means it can reach Israel and American troops stationed in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. 
 The spokesman, Hamidreza Assefi, was responding to a report in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz last week, which said the test had been carried out just over a week before. 
"Apparently, the Israelis are late in getting the information," Mr. Assefi said at the Iranian Foreign Ministry's weekly news briefing. "The test took place several weeks ago, and it was a final test before delivering the missile to the armed forces. It was within the same range that we had declared before."
Iran contends that the missile relies entirely on Iranian expertise, but it is widely believed that the Shahab, or shooting star in Persian, employs North Korean technology. The United States Department of State imposed penalties on a North Korean company and five Chinese companies last week, saying they sold missile technology to Iran.
"We are very concerned, especially since we know that Iran is seeking to acquire the nuclear weapon," an Israeli government spokesman, Avi Pazner, said immediately after the Iranian confirmation, according to a report from Agence France-Presse.
"The combination of Shahab-3 and the nuclear weapon would be a very serious threat on the stability of the region," he added, according to the report. 
The United States said today that it had "very serious concerns" about Iran's missile programs and that it viewed them as a threat to the region and to American interests. But American officials said that the latest test flight was one of several in recent years and that it was not a particular surprise.
"We have long had very serious concerns about Iranian missile programs," said Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman. He said the United States had noted Iran's efforts to develop its missile abilities for nearly two decades.
He said that the missile program was "a threat to the region and a threat to U.S. interests in the region" but that it would be addressed with diplomatic, political and economic pressure with "like-minded countries" along with other Iranian activities, including its nuclear weapons program.
Last month, the International Atomic Energy Agency declared that Iran had secretly processed nuclear material. Iran has denied those accusations, insisting that its nuclear research is meant only for peaceful purposes like energy.
Foreign Minister Jack Straw of Britain, during a visit to Iran last month, said the European Union would cut trade ties with Tehran if it refused to open its sites to inspections.
Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, is scheduled to visit Iran on Wednesday. He is expected to urge the Iranians to sign a protocol that would allow the agency's inspectors to make surprise visits to nuclear sites and to take samples.

HEADLINE: Survey Finds Fraud's Reach In Big Business 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
Fraud and other kinds of economic crime have victimized more than a third of the companies surveyed by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and the law firm of Wilmer Cutler & Pickering over the last few months.
 About 36 percent of the companies whose executives completed the survey responded that they had been victims of asset misappropriation -- usually theft or embezzlement -- or some other kind of economic crime in the last two years. 
 The study also found that while executives feared that financial misrepresentation -- tampering with balance sheets or earnings reports -- was rampant, only two of the surveyed companies said they had suffered from such a manipulation. 
"One way of looking at that is the people who are in-house are like the rest of the public, in that there is a greatly heightened sensitivity" to games played with financial disclosures, said Andrew D. Kaizer, a partner at Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering who primarily represents institutions involved in investigations of economic crimes.
The survey was sent to several hundred of the nation's 1,000 largest companies and 91 responded; it was the United States component of a global survey of economic crime conducted for the first time by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Economic crime encompasses a range of activities, including cybercrimes, like attacks on corporate Web sites, and counterfeiting. The results are expected to be released today.
The survey found that half of the detected economic crimes at responding companies were found by auditors, but it did not distinguish between internal and external audits, Mr. Kaizer said. Another 36 percent of the frauds were reported by whistle-blowers.
Although 76 percent of the United States respondents were covered by insurance, fewer than half were able to recover from their insurers. And less than a third of insured companies affected by fraud collected more than 20 percent of the amount lost.
"The degree to which people have insurance and are unable to get recovery is a bit surprising," Mr. Kaizer said. He speculated that high deductibles or a practice of self-insuring might be the cause.
The results differed in a few areas from those of the study PricewaterhouseCoopers conducted in foreign countries. United States-based companies were found to be more likely to have some insurance coverage, for example, and executives in the United States were more worried about misrepresentation of a company's finances than their counterparts overseas. In companies in other countries, whistle-blowers were less likely to expose frauds, the study found.
The study of regions outside the United States, which has been conducted for three years now, also found that the reported incidence of economic crime had increased, rising to 34 percent of respondents in Western Europe in 2003 from 29 percent in 2001, and to 37 percent from 26 percent in Central and Eastern Europe, for example.
The average amount lost, according to the most recent survey results, was $2.2 million, and the highest levels of economic crime were reported in Africa and North America (including Canada and the United States).

How a Seed-Money Loan of $60 Turned Melanie Pico Into an Entrepreneur

BYLINE:  By ANDRES MARTINEZ 

DATELINE: CALINAN, the Philippines 

 BODY:
It is hard to imagine that there's anything cutting-edge about this hardscrabble town on the Philippine island of Mindanao, which is best known for the ferocity of its various antigovernment insurgencies. But just off the main road, down a dusty alleyway and past the naked children and the few stray dogs at play, Melanie Pico sits in her tidy, modest home acting out one of the hottest trends in global finance and development theory. She is an entrepreneurial client of a microfinancing organization.
 She looked up from her sewing machine to rattle off the arithmetic of her life. She clears 1 peso and 80 centavos in profit -- about 3 American pennies -- for each market shopping bag she produces from recycled cement wrapping. If the back pain doesn't get to be too much and she can sit at her machine for 16 hours in a day, she can stitch together as many as 420 bags. Her hard work brings in, on average, 3,000 pesos a week, the equivalent of nearly $60, a princely sum in a region where many farmers make do on a dollar a day. 
 Until recently, Ms. Pico, a 42-year-old mother of four whose husband works as a security guard, made less than half that amount. All it took to change her fortune was a $60 loan from the Mindanao Enterprise Development Foundation, a local microfinancing organization that promises clients a "hand up, not a handout."
"Sixty dollars may not sound like much to us, but in a place like the Philippines it can be enough to get a family going, allowing them to buy a cow or goods to sell in the marketplace," said Nancy Barry, president of Women's World Banking, a New York-based network and resource center for microfinancing organizations around the world. "The hope over time is that the $60 becomes $100, then $500, and before you know it, these clients are integrated into the mainstream economy."
The Mindanao development foundation is following the example of the famous Grameen Bank in Bangladesh by lending to groups of neighbors, who essentially guarantee one another's loans. It is focusing its group lending entirely on women clients, a trend in microfinancing. 
"Women manage most household economies," Ms. Barry said. "Low-income women think long-term. They plan not only for their children, but for their children's children, making them the bridge to the future and a good investment proposition." 
Ms. Pico is one of three in her group of borrowers. Once a week, they discuss their separate businesses and make payments on their six-month loan. "I keep a closer eye now on whether my neighbors work hard," Ms. Pico said with a laugh. The foundation says no group of borrowers has defaulted.
One of microfinancing's cardinal rules is that borrowers, though they may lack collateral, must be treated as serious business people, not charitable cases, so the Mindanao foundation charges 3 percent monthly interest. The rates reflect the fact that these organizations face high transaction costs. 
Prospective Mindanao borrowers are required to sit through 10 hours of rudimentary business training. "We are learning about business, about how to become more productive, so that we can improve our lives," Ms. Pico said. "My daughter Maricel is in college and someday, together, we will buy new equipment, put up a factory and hire people."
Nearby, Priscilla Magarin, a 43-year-old widow, invested the 3,000 pesos she borrowed from the Mindanao foundation in a typical village "sari-sari" variety store attached to her home. She makes anywhere from $4 to $8 a day.
That's not counting the intangible dividends. "If you have a business like this and run it properly, your standing in the community improves, and suddenly people are looking at women in a different way," she explained.
Microfinancing is a grass-roots development tool that works best when run as a viable business, independent of government. While the emphasis once was solely on making loans, the latest trend is to offer clients a range of financial services. Governments are rightly being exhorted to regulate microfinancing institutions as a legitimate part of the financial sector. The Philippines has done so, and the Mindanao foundation's clients participate in a savings plan, too.
Remittances, the private flows of money sent home to developing nations by workers overseas, are fast becoming the cherished "El Dorado" for microfinancing promoters, as they are for plenty of other development schemes. It is estimated that last year the amount of money sent home by migrant workers -- some $80 billion -- overshadowed for the first time the amount of total aid and credit (both private and public) extended to poor countries. In the case of the Philippines, long known for exporting labor, remittances are one of the few things the nation's economy has going for it these days, amounting to some $7 billion a year.
Outfits like the Asian Development Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank see a natural fit between remittances and microfinancing. The challenge for them, and for policy makers from Manila to Bogota, is to find ways to deliver on this promise, both by enabling microfinancing groups to help speed the transfer of funds to remote villages at a lower cost and by providing a pool of working capital for microfinancing. 
If microfinancing can indeed tap into these flows of capital in a significant way, overseas workers sending money home will have given their communities a "hand up" in more ways than one.

Information On-Ramp Crosses a Digital Divide

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. 

 BODY:
Children who show up this month for basketball camp at the Carl Russell Recreation Center here will find some unexpected drills on their schedule. 
 Aaron Bailey, the recreation center's director, plans to take advantage of breaks in the hoops action to send the campers to the center's newest addition, a computer room stuffed with 10 refurbished computers, all with high-speed Internet connections. The aim is to help make the youngsters as agile on computers as they are on the courts. "I might even send the campers in before I let them play basketball," Mr. Bailey told a visitor recently. 
 Mr. Bailey's center is being linked to 35 other sites around Winston-Salem -- recreation centers, churches in the city's poorest neighborhoods, libraries, schools and a homeless shelter -- in the first phase of WinstonNet, one of the most advanced and broadest efforts yet by public and private groups in an American city to bridge the so-called digital divide between the haves and have-nots. 
For years, community activists and politicians around the country have talked about the need to help people who have been left behind in the digital revolution because of poverty, disabilities or fear of new technology. Without computer literacy, the argument goes, disadvantaged groups will become more excluded in the high-tech economy. Yet many efforts have meant little more than making it possible for people to surf the Web from a library terminal. 
WinstonNet -- which is based on a fiber optic ring that surrounds the city center and links to Internet 2, the newest, highest-capacity piece of the Internet -- goes beyond providing free access to computers for those who do not own them.
It will allow any resident with a library card to have an e-mail account; transact business with the city, like payment of parking tickets; and store homework or other documents on a central server so they can be easily retrieved from any site on the network.
Documents can be stored in a private file, in a file available to a limited number of other users or in a file open to the public. Parents can gain access to school assignments and communicate with teachers by calling up Learning Village, a software program donated by the I.B.M. Foundation.
Perhaps most important, the plan focuses on giving first-time users plenty of computer training. Instructors at the WinstonNet site in the basement of the Union Baptist Church, for instance, helped teenagers from a nearby housing project learn to use computers in creating business plans for their own summer businesses. 
"The digital divide problem has been defined mainly in terms of access, but it needs to be defined more broadly as a matter of skill," said Karen Mossberger, an associate professor of political science at Kent State University in Ohio.
As a bonus, the training process can also open the door to mentoring disadvantaged youngsters. 
Winston-Salem officials say WinstonNet, in addition to doing social good, can be an economic catalyst for the city, best known as the home of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. The city is struggling to reduce its dependence on tobacco and manufacturing. 
The fiber optic ring will provide a broadband communications link for engineering and biotechnology businesses that need to send and receive huge masses of data. Targacept, an RJR spinoff that is developing medical products based on nicotine, is expected to connect to WinstonNet by the end of this year.
Tying so many organizations into the same system will make it easier to train many more users, said Johannes Boehme II, associate dean for academic computing at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine, who serves as WinstonNet's volunteer president.
"Very few communities do this holistically," Mr. Boehme said.
While that may be true, some social service organizations and communities had digital access programs long before WinstonNet. 
Boys and Girls Clubs of America, for example, has used $100 million in software and cash from Microsoft to create more than 1,000 community technology centers around the country where children use computers to do homework and learn skills like designing Web sites. 
The Blacksburg Electronic Village, a project of Blacksburg, Va., and the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, says it has helped 87 percent of the community's residents and most of its businesses become connected to the Internet, with more than 60 percent receiving low-cost high-speed connections from local cable and phone companies. 
And Atlanta estimates it has attracted about 15,000 residents, over one-third of them children, in the last two years to 15 community technology centers in poor neighborhoods. That program also includes a mobile computing center in a bus that carries 12 computers with wireless broadband connections to poor neighborhoods, according to William Lindsey, a spokesman for the Mayor's Office of Community Technology.
"We think we are making big strides to eradicate the digital divide," Mr. Lindsey said. 
But some experts have their doubts. Dr. Lynette Kvasny of Pennsylvania State University recently published a study that concluded that Atlanta's technology centers and a program in La Grange, Ga., offering free Internet access for subscribers to a city-owned cable television system, did little to improve the lives of the poor. The Atlanta model was criticized by some regular users of the centers for providing inadequate training, Dr. Kvasny said.
Some critics say the digital divide evolves so rapidly as technology advances that big initiatives, especially those driven by government policy, can lock users into obsolete technology. 
"It's misguided to look at it as a serious social problem that needs to be dealt with with aggressive subsidies," said Adam D. Thierer, director of telecommunications policies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian policy group in Washington.
In fact, Mr. Thierer said, computer technology is spreading to underserved segments of society unusually rapidly compared with other innovations. Nearly two-thirds of American homes now have a computer, according to Odyssey, a research firm based in San Francisco. 
But the gap between those who are able to use computers effectively and poorer citizens with little exposure may actually be widening, said W. Frank Newton, executive director of the Beaumont Foundation of America, which focuses on digital divide programs. 
Government has become less eager to pay to bridge that gap. President Bush has tried to eliminate technology access programs created by the Clinton administration in the Education and Commerce Departments to help communities bridge the digital divide. Just under $50 million of the cuts was restored by Congress in the spring after a lobbying campaign by a coalition of more than 180 groups. 
And while a controversial universal service charge on long-distance phone bills, established by Congress in 1996, helps some schools and libraries connect to the Internet, that multibillion-dollar fund cannot be used to finance broader projects like WinstonNet. 
State financing for such programs has also been sharply reduced because of budget problems, according to Kavita Singh, executive director of the Community Technology Centers Network in Cambridge, Mass.
WinstonNet began to take shape in flusher times. It grew out of Wake Forest University's drive in the 1990's to make itself a leader in using computers in education. Wake Forest has been giving every student a laptop since 1996. It decided in 1998 to replace the first-generation broadband lines connecting its medical school with the main campus on the other side of the city and a research center downtown, replacing them with the ultimate in broadband, a private fiber optic highway. 
That network, later sold to a telecommunications subsidiary of Duke Energy, had enough spare capacity to spur community discussions about who else might use it. Among the groups involved were Forsyth Technical Community College, which trains student volunteers to refurbish donated computers and wire them into the network; Winston-Salem State University, a historically black college that has extensive outreach programs into the city's most depressed neighborhoods; and several local government agencies.
"Turf was removed as an issue at the beginning," said Claudette Weston, who represented the library system in the meetings. "People came to cooperate." 
Each WinstonNet host site pays its own operating costs, including monthly fees to local phone or cable service providers for access to WinstonNet's broadband ring. Hosts are also responsible for developing their own filtering policies.
Now there are discussions about allowing individuals to connect to the WinstonNet system through local phone or cable lines, without going to a WinstonNet site. The local Habitat for Humanity group is proposing that all its renovated homes come equipped with WinstonNet access. 
"As people become more aware of it, the pressure will mount for more access," predicted Don Martin, superintendent of the Winston-Salem/ Forsyth County Schools. Mr. Martin said one possible WinstonNet expansion would create a site in the sprawling Hanes Mall south of the city. "One thing we've learned is that everyone can find their way to the mall."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
Reviving a global aluminum merger, and this time offering quite a lot less.

BYLINE:  By Floyd Norris 

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
COULD it be that the secret to completing a hostile bid in France is to first have a friendly one rejected by the authorities?
 Alcan, the Canadian aluminum giant, surprised investors yesterday by renewing a bid it made in 1999 to take over Pechiney of France. It is offering a lot less than it did nearly four years ago, but since then the stock market bubble has burst and Pechiney's place in the industry has slipped amid consolidation. 
 Pechiney, which learned of the offer a few days before the public, made clear yesterday that it did not like the idea, saying that the price "seriously undervalues" the company. There is every sign Pechiney will resist the offer. 
Still, it represents a 20 percent premium over Pechiney's share price before the offer was made, and Pechiney stock leaped as investors hoped that something would happen -- either an Alcan takeover or a counterbid by some other suitor.
Alcan dismissed any thought that French protectionism might get in the way of its offer. In an interview yesterday, Travis Engen, its chief executive, recalled that there was a lot of support for the proposed takeover in 1999 and added that "if you follow developments in France since then, they have moved further in the direction of opening capital markets."
The 1999 proposal fell apart the next year after the European Commission, the executive agency of the European Union, indicated what divestitures would be needed to satisfy it. Alcan and Pechiney walked away without even submitting a revised proposal. There were reports that the two companies could not agree on a proposal to try to meet the antitrust demands.
This time, two factors are different. First, if the offer remains a hostile one, there is no need for Pechiney to agree to the required divestitures. Second, Alcan knows what was demanded last time. And while it has not exactly said it would meet those demands, it came close to doing so yesterday.
"Based on the requirements made by the merger task force last time, we believe we can satisfy those requirements," said Michael Zaoui, head of European mergers and acquisitions for Morgan Stanley, one of the investment banking firms retained by Alcan.
French government approval is also required because Pechiney is a military contractor. And that is another place where the recent history could help. There was no trouble getting that approval last time, and to not get it this time would inevitably raise cries of protectionism.
Given the strained state of relations between Paris and Washington, it may also help that Alcan is a Canadian company, rather than an American one.
Hostile takeovers remain rare in Europe, and the few big cross-border ones that have been successful have involved bidders from European Union countries.
If this hostile bid were to succeed, it would be interpreted as an indication that trans-Atlantic mergers were easier to conclude than had been thought, and could produce offers for other companies, particularly if merger activity in the United States picks up.
Indeed, American companies might find European company prices attractive. Since the end of 1999, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is down about 32 percent. But in that time, many European indexes have fallen further, even though they did not rise as much in the good years. The benchmark French stock index, the CAC 40, is down 47 percent, measured in euros, and almost 40 percent measured in dollars, and even at those levels has outperformed the German market.
American companies wanting to buy European ones would find that cash prices are far lower than a few years ago and that all-stock transactions would be somewhat cheaper measured in shares.
For Pechiney shareholders, time has not been friendly. The 1999 proposal called for a three-way combination involving Alcan, Pechiney and the Alusuisse Lonza Group of Switzerland, now known as the Alusuisse Group. The Alcan takeover of Alusuisse went ahead after the companies met antitrust concerns, but the other part of the deal did not.
Yesterday's offer valued Pechiney at 41 euros a share; the bid in 1999 valued it around 62 euros. Alcan stock's price is down since 1999, but not nearly as much as Pechiney's. In this deal, Pechiney shareholders are being offered a combination of cash and Alcan stock, or a possible choice of either. Those who take Alcan stock would receive 1.5 shares for each Pechiney share. In 1999, the all-stock deal offered a ratio of 1.7876 Alcan shares to each Pechiney share.
In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Engen declined to say if Alcan was willing to raise the price it would pay. "We think we've made a bid that is quite fully priced," he said. "Demand and economic growth and metals prices are lower than they were then," referring to the 1999 offer.
Asked if he thought a competitive bid was likely, he replied, "Anything is possible," but added that he did not think Pechiney would be worth more to any other bidder.
To shareholders, let alone competitors in the aluminum industry, those questions are important. 
But for international capital markets, the most important question will be what happens if Alcan is not outbid, and if Pechiney management continues to resist the offer. An Alcan success would be seen as a sign that the European takeover market is far more open than many had thought.

HEADLINE: White House Seeks Revised Pension Rules 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is preparing this week to introduce long-awaited pension legislation that could reduce corporate pension liabilities by billions of dollars over the next two years, but would require companies to handle plans more rigorously after that. 
 At first, the proposal would increase the stress on the pension system because it would allow companies to put less money into their funds. After two years, however, companies would have to begin calculating their pension values in an entirely new way. In the past, companies have resisted this method, but independent analysts have praised it as more accurate and prudent than the current methods. 
 To keep shaky pension plans from unraveling during the initial two-year breather, the proposal would also bar companies with insolvent pension plans from promising greater benefits to their employees. 
It would require companies to start disclosing their pension assets and liabilities once a year, measured on a "termination" basis -- the most demanding of the various ways of calculating pension values. Companies currently disclose some pension information in the footnotes of their annual reports, but the accounting rules now allow for considerable blurring of the numbers. The pension accounting rules were written that way in 1985 in an effort to smooth away meaningless pension-fund volatility, but today the rules are widely blamed for distorting the true condition of company pension funds.
For some employees, the administration proposal would reduce lump-sum pension payouts. The reductions would apply only to lump sums from traditional defined-benefit pension plans, only about a third of which permit such payouts. Lump-sum payments from cash-balance pension plans and 401(k) plans would not be affected. 
The proposal, described yesterday by senior Bush administration officials, is expected to be added as an amendment to an existing pension bill in the House, sponsored by Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, and Benjamin L. Cardin, a Maryland Democrat. Certain elements of the administration proposal conflict with elements of the Portman-Cardin bill, and administration officials said those conflicts would have to be worked out separately.
The proposal comes after months of debate about how to keep traditional pension plans healthy at a time when they have come under greater pressure than they have since the government began regulating pensions in 1974. Companies have been warning that they cannot comply with the federal pension-financing laws in today's economic environment, and have threatened to stop offering pensions entirely if they do not receive some relief.
But even as companies have cast a shadow over the future of pensions, employees have developed a newfound appreciation for traditional pensions, after a long bear market that has eaten away at many 401(k) balances and other self-directed retirement accounts. Traditional defined-benefit pension plans offer predetermined lifelong payments that are guaranteed by the federal government and are not eroded when stock prices fall.
At the core of the administration's new plan to resuscitate the troubled pension sector is a proposal to replace the interest rate that companies must use to calculate the liabilities of their pension funds. This rate is controlled by statute and has been linked to the 30-year Treasury bond since 1987.
Companies have complained that the Treasury rate is now artificially low, making their pension obligations balloon. This is because of the way interest rates figure in determining how much money, in today's dollars, corresponds to the amounts that will be paid out in the future. When a company uses a low interest rate, it effectively assumes that its pension fund will compound slowly, making the overall liabilities look big. Using a higher interest rate makes the liabilities look smaller.
The administration plan would help companies by freeing them from the Treasury bond rate entirely. If enacted, it would allow companies to use instead a 20- to 30-year corporate bond rate for two years. Senior administration officials declined to specify which corporate rate they preferred, saying the details could be worked out during the rule-making process if the legislation is enacted. 
Because long-term corporate rates are higher than the 30-year Treasury bond, switching to a corporate bond rate would instantly shrink each company's pension's liabilities, at least on paper. The smaller liability measurements would, in turn, lead to smaller required pension contributions, tiding companies through their current financial difficulties. 
But after two years, the companies would be required to start calculating their obligations with a technique that would combine two new factors: workplace demographics and a corporate bond yield curve. 
Under this system, companies with many retirees and older workers -- like auto manufacturers -- would have to use the interest rate that applies to corporate bonds with shorter maturities. Such bonds normally have lower interest rates, so these companies would soon find their liabilities growing again. 
Companies with younger work forces, meanwhile, would be able to keep using the interest rates attached to longer-duration bonds, which usually have higher interest rates. So their pension contributions would not swell, at least at first.
Independent analysts favor this method, saying it would give a better picture of how big pension values are and when they will come due, substantially reducing the risk of plans collapsing unexpectedly. But when administration officials have floated bond-duration ideas in the past, they have met with hostility from business organizations in Washington. The business groups complain that yield curve concepts are complicated and will take time to carry out, and that they need pension relief immediately.
Administration officials stressed yesterday that their new proposed method would be phased in over three years, giving companies time to adapt. They also noted that the insurance industry already used duration-based valuation methods routinely, so the pension sector should be able to use it as well.

HEADLINE: Proposals Sought for Use Of Brooklyn Container Port 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
Port officials asked maritime companies yesterday to submit proposals for using the last active port in Brooklyn as the city proceeds with a separate study to determine its future.
 Expressions of interest in the container port, at Piers 9 to 11 in South Brooklyn, are not binding but would let officials judge the economic viability of maritime activities there. American Stevedoring operates the piers. 
 "This is for people out there to tell us are they interested in operating this terminal for maritime cargo uses and what those uses would be," said Peter J. Zantal, a general manager at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which oversees the piers. "Talk's cheap," he said, "and it's kind of getting to the point where if people really are interested, it is time to put their cards on the table."
The request comes as the city hashes out larger questions about the waterfront's future in a study of Piers 6 through 12. The study, being conducted by Hamilton, Rabinovitz & Alschuler, is to be completed by the end of September and has raised the possibility of other uses, including housing and cultural institutions. The Port Authority is giving up Piers 1 through 5, in Brooklyn Heights, for the creation of a park, and Carnival, the cruise line company, has indicated interest in putting a passenger terminal at Pier 7, near Atlantic Avenue.
Port Authority officials said some maritime companies had indicated that they would be interested in using Piers 9 to 11 and that they expected detailed submissions on those plans. Officials would not say which companies those were, but Mr. Zantal said proposals were expected from businesses like steamship operators and ocean carrier companies.
Sal Catucci, chief executive of American Stevedoring, already stung by the decision to study other uses for the piers that house his business, objected to this latest solicitation. He said that when the Port Authority agreed to his most recent lease, which expires in April, officials said they would investigate a variety of possible uses for the site. "Now they've gone out to find interest in the piers," he said. "They know that they don't have any."
Mr. Catucci said that he had transformed a failing venture into a thriving one and that he could do even more if he had the chance. Several companies were interested in leasing space, he said, but he added that the uncertainty over his future was costing him those contracts.
Many community development advocates also say they fear officials are insufficiently committed to promoting maritime uses for the piers.
Port Authority and city officials say they hope Mr. Catucci will be among those submitting proposals. Joshua J. Sirefman, chief operating officer of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said the responses would help officials shape a plan to encourage commercial and job growth, rather than coming up with the plan and testing it later. Officials, he said, are "working to understand the whole of maritime commerce in the context of the harbor, in the context of a changing waterfront and in the context of the neighborhoods that surround it."

 Longs Drug Stores Corporation, which operates in the West and Hawaii, said it offered buyouts to all its store managers as the company seeks to trim its work force by about 2 percent to centralize operations. 
Employees have until July 21 to accept a buyout and will leave between Aug. 1 and Sept. 2. Longs, based in Walnut Creek, Calif., has about 22,000 workers. In May, the company lowered its forecast for the year, saying unemployment in California and customer worries about the economy were hurting sales. The managers will be replaced with executives the company currently employs, he said.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: MONEY; 
Banking Overhaul and New Currency Planned for Iraq

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 7 

 BODY:
In a sweeping effort to revive the devastated Iraqi economy, United States officials announced today that they would replace the Iraqi currency later this year and restructure the central bank to give it new autonomy.
 The officials said the actions were intended to eliminate an unsteady currency that still bears the image of Saddam Hussein and remove the central bank from its longstanding subservience to political leaders -- a role that helped to spawn crippling inflation during the past decade. 
 To many Iraqis, the most important action will be the creation of a new currency that will allow them to exchange the 10,000-dinar notes that most Iraqi merchants refuse to honor at face value. Many Iraqis receive their salaries in the notes, and thus rely on them to pay for food and other necessities, but merchants typically do not accept them unless the customer is willing to exchange them for no more than about 7,000 dinars. 
The Iraqi dinar is currently exchanged at about 1,400 for every United States dollar. 
A common Baghdad sight in recent weeks has been Iraqis waiting for hours in 115-degree summer heat to exchange their 10,000-dinar notes for a thick stack of the 250-dinar notes that merchants will still accept.
But beginning Oct. 15, Iraqis can start exchanging the notes for new bills denominated from 50 dinars to 25,000 dinars. 
American officials said the decision to issue a new currency was also driven by a desire to remove Mr. Hussein's image and to end the dual monetary system that separated the Kurdish north from the rest of the country.
Also today, American officials announced that the budget for the rest of 2003 would be about 9 trillion dinars, or about $6 billion to $7 billion. Slightly more than half of that amount, or about $3.5 billion, will come from oil revenues, they said, and the rest from sources including money stolen by sons of Mr. Hussein and from frozen Iraqi assets. The current level of earnings from Iraqi oil sales is not clear.
The top American civilian in Iraq, L. Paul Bremer III, said in a public statement that 350 billion dinars would be spent on security and justice; 440 billion on improving the nation's heavily looted electricity system; 315 billion on public health; 385 billion on construction; 110 billion on water and sewer improvements; and 225 billion on improvements to the phone system and other telecommunications infrastructure. 
"With this budget, ministries will be able to spend money on important projects," Mr. Bremer said. "Many state companies will be able to begin operating again."
Officials hope their actions will calm many Iraqis who are increasingly angry with Americans over the breakdown of law and order as well as basic services like electricity and water. 
Increasing violence against American troops suggests that the United States may be facing some level of organized resistance from remnants of Mr. Hussein's government. 
In a 12-hour period Sunday and early Monday, an Iraqi gunned down a soldier outside a cafeteria at Baghdad University, while insurgents killed two soldiers in Baghdad neighborhoods in separate incidents. In nearby Ramadi, four soldiers were injured after coming under fire from rocket-propelled grenades in an attack that left at least one Iraqi dead and further inflamed local residents who have turned the town into a nexus of anti-American sentiment.
While American officials said today that the changes would mark the first time in a generation the central bank was independent of Iraqi political leaders, it appeared that they might retain veto power over monetary policy and other decisions. Meeting reporters this evening in Baghdad, senior officials with the Coalition Provisional Authority, which is overseeing nonmilitary operations here, would not answer questions about whether Mr. Bremer would still be able to countermand central bank decisions.
"The key to making this a success is making the Iraqis part of the policy-making process and of the inevitable process of tweaking the policies for greater impact once they begin to operate," said Tim Carney, a former ambassador to Sudan and Haiti who served as a senior American adviser during the first two months of the Iraqi occupation.
Coalition officials, however, emphasized that they had had extensive consultations with Massoud Barzani and Jalal Talabani, the leaders of the two large Kurdish factions in northern Iraq, about details of the rate at which Kurds would be able to exchange their currency. Their exchange rate, the officials said, would be one "Swiss dinar" -- the currency used in northern Iraq -- for every 150 new dinars. In the rest of the country, the exchange will be on a one-for-one basis. 
Occupation officials said the sharply different exchange rates did not mean the Kurds would receive a more favorable rate. Instead, they said, the rate reflected the much greater value of the Swiss dinar, which had not been subjected to the same inflation that devalued the dinar issued under Saddam Hussein and used in the rest of the country.
Under Mr. Hussein's absolutist rule, Finance Ministry officials forced the bank essentially to print money.
The officials said the contract for printing the notes would probably go to De La Rue, a large British printing company.

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH, N.C., July 4 

 BODY:
Senator John Edwards's fifth annual walk along the beach lasted only about a quarter-mile, what with a hot sun beating down and a horde of journalists in tow. But at every other step, it seemed, his constituents hit him with another complaint.
 Why didn't he support the troops? asked one soldier's mother. "I did," Mr. Edwards, a Democrat, assured her. Why didn't he do something about the economy? asked an out-of-work man. Mr. Edwards steered him to an aide who promised to help him find a job. 
 Then there were those who had a more pointed concern: where on earth did Mr. Edwards, a freshman senator, get off running for the Democratic nomination for president? 
"He just needs to stay in North Carolina more instead of running around the country," said Paul Stout, 51, a businessman from Asheboro. "He ought to stay at home like Elizabeth Dole for awhile, then test the waters. There's too many Democrats out there now anyway."
For Mr. Edwards, 50, his home state may not be the coziest place now.
He was elected by only a narrow margin in 1998 when he defeated a Republican incumbent, Lauch Faircloth. And these days some North Carolinians are irritated that he did not serve out a full term in the Senate before seeking higher office. Others object that he is hedging his political bets, by running for president while refusing to rule out a re-election campaign for his Senate seat.
"He needs to decide," said Brick McDermott, 26, a mortgage broker from Charlotte who was relaxing in the sand when Mr. Edwards walked by and said hello. "Having it both ways right now -- that isn't working."
The senator clearly does not agree and is sticking to his own timetable for his decision. "It's going to depend on what I think is best for North Carolina and what the dynamic is in the presidential campaign," he told the reporters trailing him. 
Perhaps those most frustrated with Mr. Edwards are the Democrats who would like to run next year to succeed him in the Senate, but are waiting on the sidelines to see if he will pull out of the race. As they wait, a Republican candidate is out in the field, lining up support as Mr. Edwards's standing in his home state steadily erodes in the polls.
The Democrats-in-waiting include Erskine B. Bowles, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, and Dan Blue, a former speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives who was the first African-American to hold that post. Both men ran for the Senate seat that was being vacated by Jesse Helms last year. Mr. Bowles handily defeated Mr. Blue in the primary but lost by a wide margin to Mrs. Dole.
Both men have urged Mr. Edwards to make his intentions clear by early September so they can begin organizing and raising money. By state law, Mr. Edwards could delay a decision as late as Feb. 27, the filing deadline for the primary -- after the results are in from many early presidential contests.
For now, Mr. Edwards is giving no green lights to other Democrats. "My position hasn't changed," he told reporters here after his walk. "Logic would tell you, I'm the incumbent Democratic senator," he said, "and our chances of holding the seat are obviously much better when an incumbent is holding the spot."
Mr. Edwards's advisers contend that putting off a decision is as good for the party as it is for him. "The best thing that could happen for the North Carolina Democratic Party, over all and also in terms of holding the Senate seat, would be for Senator Edwards to be the Democratic nominee for president," said the pollster Harrison Hickman, a North Carolinian working for the Edwards presidential campaign. "The second best thing would be for Senator Edwards to run for re-election. If you said he had to make a decision now, I don't think he'd say he'd run for re-election, so now you've given up your second-best possibility."
Still, there is reason for his would-be successors to feel a sense of urgency: Representative Richard M. Burr, a Republican who has the support of the White House, has already cleared the Republican field of any other competitors, amassed a war chest of $3.4 million, and begun reaching into Democratic ranks. He is recruiting Democratic fund-raisers and more conservative Democratic Party members from the eastern half of the state.
"We cannot afford to have peel-off conservative Democrats voting Republican when Bush is running," said Brad Crone, a Democratic consultant in Raleigh. "Senator Edwards needs to make a decision by Labor Day to enable those interested in pursuing the nomination an opportunity to campaign."
The real question, it seems, is whether Mr. Bowles will abide Mr. Edwards's delays much longer. Mr. Bowles did not respond to several telephone and e-mail messages. But some of his supporters and advisers say they now expect him to enter the race before Labor Day, with or without Mr. Edwards's blessing.
"As much as he is loyal to Edwards, every week that goes by that he's unable to engage fully in the campaign, he sees as a disadvantage," said one Democrat familiar with Mr. Bowles's thinking. "He's a former White House chief of staff, he's got a record of getting things done, and he wants to do this. He's not likely to sit around waiting for long for someone else to make a decision."
The tension between the two, who are friends and have supported each other's campaigns, is likely only to grow: Mr. Edwards's loyalists say that Mr. Bowles received the lowest percentage of any Democratic Senate candidate in generations, while Mr. Bowles's note that he also got more votes than Mr. Edwards did.
Mr. Edwards's presidential campaign is, of course, winning him an enviable amount of publicity in North Carolina. But the coverage is not always helpful to his standing with voters here.
In May, for example, he endorsed gay adoption, a position that could help him with voters in a national Democratic primary far more than in a North Carolina general election, political analysts say. And his lead over Mr. Burr in polls by The News & Observer in Raleigh, while still in the double digits, has been shrinking.
In the paper's monthly polls of the presidential race, Mr. Edwards is consistently drawing only about 40 percent in a statewide matchup with President Bush, though his aides point out that President Clinton was at about the same point in Arkansas in the summer of 1991.
As Mr. Edwards mulls his options and Mr. Bowles and Mr. Blue fidget, Mr. Burr, the Republican candidate, is hardly standing still. Not long ago he won the support of two Democrats who had helped Mr. Bowles exclusively last year. Mr. Burr said the two had raised more than $150,000.
No matter that the donors do not know for sure who the candidates will be. Mr. Burr says, flatly: "They're contributing to my race against John Edwards." He adds, "That's what I'm telling them."
As much as the uncertainty helps Mr. Burr, it is hurting Mr. Edwards, said Ted Arrington, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. "It looks like he's indecisive," he said. "People do kind of like a senator who's their senator because that's what he wants to be."
One of those people is James Llewellyn, 63, a retired judge who said Mr. Edwards had impressed him in his courtroom as a plaintiff's lawyer.
"I don't want him to be president," Mr. Llewellyn said after greeting Mr. Edwards on the beach."We need somebody to be campaigning for Senate right now."
Spiro Macris, a retired orthodontist active in local Democratic politics, questioned whether Mr. Edwards had paid his dues.
"I wish he had tended to the Senate a little longer," he said. "Maybe this is a training run. I was hoping, maybe this is our vice president."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; 
Finalists Chosen For Jergens Account

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
The Andrew Jergens Company has narrowed a review for the account of its personal care brands like Ban antiperspirant, Jergens lotion and John Frieda hair products. Although billings were not disclosed, Jergens and Frieda spent $90.1 million on advertising in major media last year, according to TNS Media Intelligence/CMR, a unit of Taylor Nelson Sofres. 
 Brad Kirk, vice president for marketing and strategic planning at Jergens in Cincinnati, confirmed a report on Adweek.com about the move. He identified the finalists as the New York offices of Arnold Worldwide, part of Havas; Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, part of the Interpublic Group; Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners, part of the Kirshenbaum Bond Creative Network; and the Wolf Group. Mr. Kirk declined to identify agencies that were eliminated. 
 The brands had been handled by Bozell in New York until it was merged by its parent, Interpublic, into a sibling, Lowe & Partners Worldwide in New York. The account was shifted to Lowe at the same time, leading Jergens to begin a review out of concern that conflicts could arise with a big Lowe client, Johnson & Johnson.
AAR Partners in New York is managing the review for Jergens, which is part of the Kao Corporation.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: POLITICS; 
IRAQIS WILL JOIN GOVERNING COUNCIL U.S. IS SETTING UP

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: SALAHUDDIN, Iraq, July 7 

 BODY:
Warning that increasing violence is rallying the remnants of Saddam Hussein's government, the main Iraqi political groups that supported the United States and Britain in toppling the Iraqi president said today that they would join the first postwar interim government later this month and press for greater powers under the occupation authority.
 The groups' decision marks the final stage of a two-month-long exercise in brinkmanship between former Iraqi opposition leaders and L. Paul Bremer III, the American occupation administrator, over how much power and authority the Iraqi leadership body will be given. 
 In Baghdad, Shiite Muslim tribes from central and southern Iraq met for the first time to discuss how they, as the country's religious majority, could help create a united Iraqi nation.
Also today, United States officials announced a plan to overhaul Iraqi financial institutions. They appointed a central bank chief, Faleh Salman, and took steps to give the bank autonomy from the country's political leaders. Starting in October, officials said, a new currency will replace the old dinar with Saddam Hussein's image on it. Page A14. 
It appears, though, that American officials may retain veto power over monetary policy and other decisions.
At the same time, several prominent members of the former opposition forces, including Massoud Barzani, the Kurdish leader, and Ahmad Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress, said they were urging United States military commanders in Iraq to allow the creation of an Iraqi national security force to help thwart attacks that are destabilizing the country.
"We always told the Americans that the most difficult stage would be after the war and that it is not good for them to be in the forefront," Mr. Barzani said after the daylong session in this city in northeastern Iraq. 
"They should keep their distance," he added, "and support Iraqi forces as they try to solve the problems themselves."
The Iraqi political figures say they have support for the force from Gen. John P. Abizaid, who is taking over the United States Central Command from Gen. Tommy R. Franks, and from Paul D. Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense.
The United States is training a police force for Iraq and a future army, but there is no third force, a Central Command official said tonight.
The force, its proponents said, would be a paramilitary army trained and equipped by the United States on a crash basis to confront the remnants of Mr. Hussein's Baathist government, which are believed to be responsible for killing 29 American soldiers since May 1.
Mr. Bremer swept aside plans made in May by his predecessor, the retired lieutenant general Jay Garner, to turn over significant powers to an Iraqi provisional government.
The United Nations resolution that recognizes the United States and Britain as occupying powers in Iraq calls for a swift transition to Iraqi rule, but Mr. Bremer initially said he preferred to appoint an advisory "political council" of Iraqis, taking a year or two to create a constitution and hold popular elections.
Today's decision comes as Mr. Bremer faces increasing pressure to put an Iraqi government in place to deal with a host of issues. Among them are the deteriorating security situation, in which guerrilla attacks on American convoys and bases have caused concern in the Bush administration about whether plans to build a new Iraqi state are working. Three Americans were killed on Sunday in separate attacks.
In negotiations with Iraqi leaders in the last several weeks, Mr. Bremer made a number of concessions, most prominently that they would have a governing role under the authority of the occupation powers. He promised, Iraqi political leaders say, to grant extensive powers to an Iraqi interim government, which will appoint and supervise an Iraqi council of ministers, set oil and other economic policies, issue a new currency, draft a budget and send ambassadors out into the world. 
Mr. Bremer has even designated the former Ministry of Military Industries building in central Baghdad as the future home of the interim government, so it will have offices separate from the occupation authorities.
In another symbolic gesture, Mr. Bremer began calling the new Iraqi ruling body a governing council, instead of a political council, in public statements in the last two weeks. 
It is expected to declare itself a leadership body later this month, after weeks of negotiations aimed at making it appear that its 25 to 30 members "emerged" after "consultations" among prominent Iraqi political figures and were not directly appointed by Mr. Bremer.
This fig leaf has apparently transformed attitudes among former Iraqi opposition figures, who were eager to take part in rebuilding the country, but fearful of risking their credibility with constituents.
"We need an Iraqi government, and we think now that the Americans realize that Iraqis are the only ones with the experience for maintaining security, administration and for filling the political vacuum," said Adel Abdul-Mahdi, whose grandfather served in the first Iraqi government in the 1920's and who now represents Ayatollah Muhammad Bakr al-Hakim's Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq.
One of Ayatollah Hakim's representatives made it clear last month that the group would not work with a "political council" that Mr. Bremer appointed. Other opposition figures made similar statements, saying they would boycott any interim administration that made them appear to be "lackeys" of the occupation powers.
Shiite leaders in southern Iraq have been particularly critical of Mr. Bremer's reluctance to grant Iraqis a significant role in transitional governance. Their frustration built to the point where Iraq's leading Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, issued a religious edict, or fatwa, demanding that Iraqis elect a constitutional drafting committee.
"Sistani's support is essential for the constitutional process," Mr. Chalabi said.
In a joint statement issued today, the seven members of the "leadership council" of the former Iraqi opposition indicated that their negotiations with Mr. Bremer were not yet concluded.
"The meeting welcomed the formation of a governing council, considering it a step in the right direction toward the formation of a provisional government," the statement said. Several Iraqis who attended the meeting today said that a decision had been made that they would serve on the governing council, but that negotiations continued on who would serve with them.
Mr. Bremer clearly has put forward his own slate of candidates, including Adnan Pachachi, 80, the elder statesman of Iraq's diplomatic corps, and Dr. Lena Abboud, 28, a gynecologist who was part of a delegation of Iraqi women who met with Mr. Bremer during his first month in Baghdad. 
Representatives of Iraq's tribal groups, along with Turkmen and Chaldean and Assyrian Christians, are also expected to join the roster.
Mr. Pachachi said in an interview in Baghdad during the weekend that Mr. Bremer had agreed that a majority of the governing council members would need to be Shiites, to reflect their 60 percent majority of Iraq's population.
"There needs to be a Shiite majority, if for no other reason than to avoid criticism, since the Shiites have been the most deprived of their rights," Mr. Pachachi said.
Today, Mr. Barzani expressed satisfaction in the new formulation. He and another Kurdish leader, Jalal Talabani, are Washington's closest allies among the former Iraqi opposition groups.
"Now the governing council will have real power and authority and there will be no puppets," Mr. Barzani said.

Iraqi Groups to Join Postwar Governing Council

United States officials, in a sweeping effort at reviving the devastated Iraqi economy, announced they would replace the Iraqi currency, which still bears Mr. Hussein's image, later this year and restructure the central bank to give it new autonomy. A14

Two officials overseeing the American-led effort to rebuild Iraq said the electricity and drinking water available in Baghdad and some other parts of the country remain below pre-war levels. A14

A tape recording broadcast on Friday was probably of Mr. Hussein, the Central Intelligence Agency said, providing the strongest evidence yet that he is still alive and calling for resistance to the American military occupation. A15

The White House acknowledged for the first time that President Bush relied on incomplete and perhaps inaccurate information from American intelligence agencies when he declared that Saddam Hussein had attempted to purchase uranium from Africa. A1

Liberian Leader Accuses U.S.
President Charles Taylor accused the United States of supporting his rebel enemies and pressed Washington to prove its commitment to Liberia by sending peacekeepers. He also added a surprising coda to his promise to step down, calling his exile a brief "cooling-off period" before a return to Liberian politics. A1

Successful Missile Test in Iran

HEADLINE: Conversing On the Arts By Clicking A Mouse 

BYLINE:  By JOHN ROCKWELL 

 BODY:
For those lamentably addicted, the Internet is creeping toward a total takeover of our lives. But maybe addictions can be ranked as more or less beneficent. 
 Certainly the presence of a Web site called ArtsJournal.com has added something important to cultural discourse. 
What ArtsJournal offers is a daily summary, with links to the complete articles from print publications or Internet magazines, of what its editor and founder, Douglas McLennan, deems the most important high-arts articles in the worldwide English-language press. 
If you trust his judgment, which seems pretty solid, he has created what he innocently calls "the best arts section in the world." 
This may come as a shock to loyal loggers-on to the better-known ArtsandLettersDaily.com, which got started in mid-1998, a year before ArtsJournal. With some 2 million "page views" a month, Arts and Letters has five times the readership of ArtsJournal, although everyone concedes that such figures are slippery to measure.
Mr. McLennan, 45, is a former music critic and arts reporter who lives in Seattle. While Arts and Letters Daily appeals to an intellectual and academic readership, ArtsJournal covers what newspapers cover: art thefts, orchestras going under, music downloading, theater companies building new buildings and the like. Mostly it is reportage, with only occasional reviews of major events. Mr. McLennan calls his site "a conversation about culture."
His audience, he says, consists of arts journalists, arts professionals (curators, music administrators, even actual artists) and educated people from all walks of life with an interest in the arts. 
The two sites were created during the dot-com euphoria of the late 90's, and both survived in large part because their financial expectations were too modest for them to crash very far. Mr. McLennan resisted temptation and has managed to putter along as a kind of gonzo outsider.
"Two months after I started, I got a buy-out offer of $1 million," he said in an interview in New York. "The woman on the other end of the phone said, 'We can make you a millionaire by Christmas.' " 
Mr. McLennan was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, studied piano in Canada and the United States and spent a year in Manhattan as a fellow in the National Arts Journalism Program at Columbia University. As a journalist he has worked mostly in Seattle, for The Seattle Weekly and The Post-Intelligencer, but devotes himself now to ArtsJournal and the myriad spinoffs his teeming brain is always devising.
Mr. McLennan confines the journal's links to the articles he highlights each day. But he has additional features, most designed to make a modicum of money, to keep the operation afloat and maybe even allow him to afford more than the minimal help he can now employ.
There is a subscription. (You get the summaries with or without links in your daily e-mail.) There is syndication. There are articles by Mr. McLennan providing an overview of continuing issues, with links to related stories. There will soon be an ArtsJournal streaming audio sideline. Just this week there are ArtsJournal-sponsored blogs by leading figures in the arts. And Mr. McLennan himself consults for various publications, writes freelance articles and is working with Minnesota Public Radio on a possible arts-news project.
He also toys periodically with turning the site from its current for-profit status into a nonprofit organization, allied with a foundation or other institution. But so far Mr. McLennan, an incorrigible lone wolf, hasn't found a partnership to his liking.
If there is a cloud on the horizon, it is the possibility that more and more publications will decide to sell their material, rather than give it away. The Wall Street Journal, for the most part, already does that, and hence does not really appear on either site.
"It's not particularly in their interest to cut us off," Mr. McLennan said. "I can be their biggest deliverer of traffic."
Mr. McLennan's main problem right now is figuring a way, economically and conceptually, to ease the burden of putting out the site onto others. Were he to fall seriously ill, that would be it. More imminently, he is planning a monthlong trip with his wife and daughter this fall to Africa.
"One of the nice things about the site is that you can do it anywhere," he said. "But you can't do it from where I'll be in Africa. I'm hoping to be able to hire two or three people.
"But while you would think doing the site would be easy, if you're looking at 1,000 stories a day, you have to have a sense of context to tell you which are important. It isn't easy."

HEADLINE: Imported Foods Become Costlier As Euro Dominates the Dollar 

BYLINE:  By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
PRESERVES and biscuits from France are going up in price. So are cheeses from Spain and prosciutto and pasta from Italy. The increases may amount to only 50 cents a pound wholesale for now, but retailers predict that if the euro remains strong against the dollar, consumers may begin to register sticker shock in the fall, especially around the holidays.
 Yesterday, the euro traded in the range of $1.13. About a year ago, it was less than a dollar. 
 Ron Tanner, a spokesman for the National Association for the Specialty Food Trade, the trade group that runs the Fancy Food Show, which was held last week at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, acknowledged that for many consumers of these specialty foods, a price increase would not exactly be a hardship.
"A good olive oil that now costs $32 a bottle instead of $29 does not make a huge difference to a high-end shopper," he said.
But at a time when Americans are watching household budgets, many exhibitors at the show, and the retailers who sell their goods, were considerably more cautious. 
"We've already raised some of our prices as much as 20 percent," said Steven Jenkins, a partner in Fairway markets, which imports manyproducts directly from Europe. "Our private-label imported olive oil is up a dollar a liter, from $5.99 to $6.99. But we have a very price-sensitive clientele, so we have to be careful."
A number of European companies, like La Compagnia dell'Olio, which sells luxury tuna products, sauces and olive oils from Sicily, say they are trying to absorb some of the increases, which include higher labor costs.
"We've been able to convince some of our producers to tighten up and hold the line, so on average our prices have gone up less than 10 percent," said Andrea Moccia, a representative of the company. 
He said that at retail a bottle of oil or a jar of tuna might increase from $26 to $28. 
Rosario Safina, whose company, Da Rosario, imports mushrooms and truffles, said he had raised his prices about 10 percent, so a tiny bottle of truffle oil that sold for $6.95 is now $7.50. The price of fresh chanterelles from Russia and the Baltic countries has gone from $9 to $12 a pound wholesale, he said. 
"Even though those countries have their own currencies, they price everything in euros," he explained.
Based on the economy in the United States right now, "this is no time to raise prices," said Dane Neller, the president of Dean & DeLuca. "Right now, we're managing to hold the line. We have to because sales are already soft on the luxury end, but sooner or later we may have to pass on the increases. European producers are also faced with commodity prices going up."
With some products, like Parmigiano-Reggiano and pasta from Italy, importers were able to buy in bulk months ago and lock in the prices. But when the supplies are depleted, they will have to purchase more, probably at higher prices. 
"We're promoting grana Padano and extra-vecchio Piave at $8.99 a pound instead of Parmigiano-Reggiano for $9.99," said Joe Macaluso, a buyer for Citarella. "And we're seeing our customers shopping more carefully, looking for value and choosing alternatives."
Some European producers have already raised their prices, he said, to compensate for a potential loss in volume in the American market.
At the show, Marty Campbell, a buyer for the Fresh Market in Greensboro, N.C., said he had been trying to hold price increases to a minimum but that he was concerned about the last quarter of 2003. "By then, we may have no choice," he said.
At Crystal Foods in Lynn, Mass., John Ciano, the president, said some shoppers are indifferent to the price increases, "but today there are many others who have become price-sensitive.
"Bush thinks that a weak dollar helps the economy because it helps our exports," he said, "but a policy like that hurts, too."

 HIGHLIGHTS

FRENCH ARTS WORKERS STRIKE -- The opening of the Avignon theater festival fell victim yesterday to a wave of strikes across France by technicians, actors, dancers and filmmakers resisting efforts to reduce their unemployment benefits, news agencies report. In Paris volunteers and the police were called in to make sure that a Rolling Stones concert for 60,000 fans in a stadium tonight would go on as scheduled. The labor dispute has already forced cancellation of some festivals and the disruption of the opera gala in Aix-en-Provence. In the face of the walkouts, France's culture minister, Jean-Jacques Aillagon, told France-Inter radio: "Every time a festival is canceled, the fallout is appalling, and their futures are often compromised. I believe I've gone to the limits of what is possible, of my responsibility. I will not take any new initiatives." Performers have rejected his proposal to maintain the current unemployment system until the start of 2004 while a settlement is negotiated. At the 57th Avignon festival, which usually draws more than 100,000 visitors, the board scheduled a meeting today to consider canceling the three-week event. In Paris workers responsible for loading and unloading the Stones' stage, lighting and sound gear stopped work in sympathy with the strikers. The police were summoned to remove 50 to 100 protesters barring access by the trucks to the Stade de France. A spokeswoman for the French leg of the band's "40 Licks" tour said, however, that volunteers and other personnel helped the equipment reach the stadium and asserted that the show would "go ahead whatever."

ART: A PAPER TRAIL -- The names are celebrated: Chagall, Degas, Ingres, Leger, Matisse, Picasso and Signac, to name a few. The time span is 150 years. The mediums are drawings, watercolors (like Signac's "St.-Tropez: Evening Sun," left) and pastels. The exhibition, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, is "Classic to Modern: French Works on Paper, 1800-1950, From the Permanent Collection." In 150 years of political, social and cultural upheaval in France, artists interpreted and reinterpreted their world. The exhibition, from tomorrow through Sept. 7, explores these reactions in five thematic groups: "The Body (Un)Wrapped," focused on the human form; "Head and Shoulders," examining portraiture; "Nature Denatured," about the world; "Orientalism," reflecting the artists' romance with the Orient; and "Labor and Leisure," juxtaposing nostalgia for a rural society with images of Parisians savoring the wealth of the industrial age at resorts, the racetrack and cafes.

IRAQ'S LOOTED ART -- The director of the Iraq Museum said yesterday that at least 10 percent of its contents had vanished. Speaking at a news conference at the British Museum in London, the director, Dr. Nawalaal Mutawalli, said some 13,000 objects had vanished from the museum's storage room, which has been only partly inspected, the BBC reported. In addition, he said, 47 pieces, 7 of them described as "very important masterpieces," had been taken from the exhibition room of the museum in Baghdad. The start of a thorough search of the museum was delayed until the staff could obtain a generator to provide electricity. The museum's director of research, Donny George, said about 1,500 missing treasures had been returned, many by local people who said they were safeguarding them until troops could protect the museum.

FILM: DELON RETROSPECTIVE -- In 75 films made in 50 years, he has gone from pretty boy to tough cop, contract killer, thief and ex-con. He is the French star Alain Delon (born 1935), left, a school dropout and Vietnam veteran who broke into movies in the role of a hit man in 1957 and achieved stardom in Rene Clement's "Plein Soleil" (1960), an adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's "Talented Mr. Ripley." In the years to follow, Mr. Delon starred in films like "Rocco and His Brothers" (1960) and "The Leopard" (1963) for Luchino Visconti, "Eclipse" (1962) for Michelangelo Antonioni, "Le Samourai" (1967) and "Dirty Money" (1972) for Jean-Pierre Melville and "Mr. Klein" (1976) for Joseph Losey. Mr. Delon also became a writer, director and producer. From Friday through July 21 and from July 30 through Aug. 7 at the Walter Reade Theater, the Film Society of Lincoln center will revisit his career in a two-part 18-film retrospective, "Man in the Shadows: The Films of Alain Delon."

MUSIC IN THE PARK -- A new free summertime music series makes its debut at 7 tonight. Running each Wednesday through Aug. 13, it is Madison Square Music, presented by the Madison Square Park Conservancy on the Oval Lawn of the 6.2-acre Madison Square Park, between 23rd and 26th Streets and Fifth and Madison Avenues. The opening attraction is the folk-rockers Dane Zanes & Friends.

HEADLINE: U.S. Pact Lifts South Africa Car Exports 

BYLINE:  By NICOLE ITANO 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, July 8 

 BODY:
This is a left-hand-drive country, where most cars have standard transmissions, and where even humble features, like the cup holder, have yet to be widely adopted. But such accessories, and others, like air bags, are standard in most of the more than 200 luxury 3 Series BMW sedans that roll off the production line in South Africa each weekday, in luminescent colors like Titanium Silver and Mystic Blue.
 More than 80 percent of the cars made at BMW South Africa's plant in Rosslyn, about 10 miles outside of the capital, Pretoria, are for export. Half of those, an estimated 25,000 this year, will make the nearly 9,000-mile journey, first by train and then by ship, to consumers in the United States. The cars will enter duty-free, under a preferential trade agreement intended to stimulate African economies. 
 South Africa historically has never appeared high on the list of the world's auto manufacturers. Since the end of apartheid in 1994, however, the industry has undergone a significant transformation -- from an inward, highly protected industry to an export-oriented one with average compounded annual growth of 39 percent in the last seven years despite the global economic downturn. 
This impressive growth has come from a base of almost nothing, since sanctions during the apartheid era prevented any exports. Considering that past, the auto industry represents one of South Africa's greatest post-apartheid economic successes.
With a large percentage of this production being exported to the United States -- 15 percent of new cars and 10.5 percent of car parts -- the sector also shows how preferential trade agreements like the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which President Bush is expected to highlight during his trip to the continent this week, can help promote investment and growth.
The program gives nonreciprocal, duty-free access to products from 38 African countries that meet certain criteria, like a market-based economy, political pluralism and adherence to the rule of law. AGOA, the widely used acronym for the trade pact, is scheduled to run until 2008, though Mr. Bush has indicated that he would like to see it extended.
Although South Africa's auto industry is still small in global terms, ranking only 18th in size, its transformation and expansion is a model for the kind of economic successstory the United States would like to promote in Africa. The automotive industry is South Africa's largest export sector under AGOA, and is one of the few industries to capitalize on the program. In 2001, the first year of the program, the industry's exports to the United States rose by 387 percent, to $359 million. Last year, they grew again, to $572.9 million.
"The growth in the industry in general has been quite phenomenal," said Nico Vermeulen, director of the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa. "AGOA has played a role by adding impetus to automobile exporters in South Africa to enter what is the largest automotive consumer market in the world, as far as vehicles are concerned."
The industry's experience, however, also shows the program's limitations. Despite hopes that it would help small businesses, it has generally been large multinationals like BMW that have benefited most.
Nor has South Africa's entry into the competitive, global market after the end of apartheid necessarily translated into more jobs at home. According the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa, which represents most auto workers, jobs in automobile and auto-component manufacturing fell by 16,200 between 1995 and 2001. Manufacturers say the cuts were needed to trim a bloated industry.
"We are delighted that some of the companies are now able to export, but the picture is not that rosy in terms of job losses," said Dumisa Ntuli, a spokesman for the union. "Employment has been precarious in most of these companies, despite the growth."
For much of its history, the South African automobile industry has largely been a domestic matter. Import tariffs that reached 114 percent during apartheid made it cheaper for companies to build local plants to assemble a variety of cars almost exclusively for sale at home. By the end of apartheid, small numbers of more than 40 different models were being produced here, a huge number for a country representing only 1 percent of the global car market.
"Seven years ago, the generally accepted viewpoint was that half the country's companies would be closed because they were producing at high cost and low quality," said Clive Williams, executive director of South Africa's National Association of Automotive Component and Allied Manufacturers, speaking of the businesses in his organization. "In retrospect, less than 10 percent have closed down and the rest have made an incredible transformation from being fat to being lean."
In 1991, with apartheid nearing its end, global sanctions against South Africa were dropped, opening up the possibility of exports. When South Africa's new government took over in 1994, it moved quickly to encourage a more modern and competitive industry, producing fewer models more efficiently. The effort reduced tariff protection while at the same time giving companies incentives to specialize and begin exporting.
The country's seven major car makers, which include major players like Ford, Toyota and DaimlerChrysler, began to streamline their factories, focusing on a smaller number of models to be sold locally and exported. Car-component manufacturers, which produced small numbers of a wide variety of parts, began looking for new markets.
BMW South Africa was one of the first companies to turn its sights to exports. In 1998, the company invested 250 million rand (about $45 million at the time) to upgrade the Rosslyn plant, transforming it from a factory that assembled about 12,000 cars and at least four different models, to one with the capacity to produce 60,000 ofthe popular 3 series sedans, in both right- and left-side-of-the-road versions. Also, unlike the old factory, BMW's new plant has the capacity to produce made-to-order cars with features like sunroofs and specialized stereo systems.
When the trade pact took effect in 2001, ending the 2.5 percent import tariff for most South African cars, BMW began exporting to the United States. Over the last five years, the company has more than quadrupled its business, with exports to the United States under AGOA producing half that growth.
The expansion has led the company to add a second shift at its factory and hire 900 new employees. Most of the parts, except for the engine and transmission, are made locally, and the company's managing director, Ian Robertson, said that component purchases have pumped an additional 3.5 billion rand (about $470 million) into the country's economy.
"In essence, we moved away from what we call a knockdown facility, which means a lot of components come in, in boxes, and are assembled using local labor, to now being primarily concentrating on one model that is primarily export-bound," Mr. Robertson said. "Eighty-two percent of our business is now export. Five years ago, nothing; today, 82 percent. So it's been a remarkable transition, but one I think that we've benefited from and I think the South African economy has definitely benefited from."
So far, BMW is still the only South African car manufacturer exporting under the pact, although at least two others are looking into the program and a number of component manufacturers are exporting to the United States under AGOA or the Generalized System of Preferences, another duty-free program.
Mr. Robertson said technology was the major reason more automobile manufacturing companies have not taken advantage of AGOA. Unlike BMW, other companies have not made the investments to allow them to produce right-hand-drive cars.
But with BMW's success, an increasing number of South African companies are looking to the United States. For its part, the South African government is working to inform local companies about export opportunities and connect them to buyers across the Atlantic.
"You just have to look at the statistical data to see that our companies are slowly waking to the fact that AGOA does open markets in the United States," said Gustav Meyer, senior manager for automobiles at Trade and Industry South Africa, a government agency involved in encouraging exports. "We considered the United States our biggest potential growth market."

HEADLINE: Consumer Debt Rises, Led by Credit Cards 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Consumer debt rose in May as shoppers made more purchases on their credit cards, according to Federal Reserve statistics released in Washington yesterday. 
 Debt like auto loans and creditcard balances grew $7.34 billion in May, following a rise of $7.83 billion in April, the Fed said. Total consumer credit excluding real estate loans stood at $1.76 trillion in May. 
 With the unemployment rate at a nine-year high of 6.4 percent in June and consumer spending rising at half the average rate of the 1992-2000 economic expansion, some economists question whether the rate of borrowing can be sustained. 
"The current pace of credit suggests that the consumer isn't alarmed by the skittish economic recovery," said Rich Yamarone, an economist at the Argus Research Corporation in New York, before the report's release. "Despite lackluster job creation, consumers continue to spend at a reasonably robust pace. This could prove worrisome if unemployment continues to creep higher." 
Before the report, economists estimated consumers in May added $4.8 billion in debt, based on the median of 43 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. 
In its initial April estimate, the Fed reported Americans accumulated $10.7 billion in new debt. 
The Fed's monthly consumer credit report does not track loans secured by real estate, like mortgages and home equity loans. Such debt increased 2.8 percent, to $6.219 trillion in the first quarter compared with the fourth, the Fed said last month in a quarterly report. 
Nonrevolving loans for vehicles and mobile homes, which make up almost two-thirds of household nonmortgage debt, rose 4.9 percent, or $4.18 billion, to $1.035 trillion, the Fed said. Auto sales in May dropped 2.4 percent from April, to an annual pace of 16.1 million units. 
Revolving loans, which include credit cards, rose 5.3 percent, or $3.17 billion, to $725 billion in May.

An Interstate Begets a Home Improvement Center

BYLINE:  By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

DATELINE: PLAINFIELD, Conn. 

 BODY:
Lowe's Home Improvement Centers is planning an $80 million, 1.4-million-square-foot distribution center on a 200-acre site here off Interstate 395, to serve its stores in the Northeast.
 Site plans submitted to town officials show a building that would cover almost 30 acres, and a similar expanse for parking 600 tractor-trailers and 600 cars. The development would straddle a portion of Lillibridge Road, which would be rerouted around the distribution center at a cost of $7 million. 
 All local approvals are in place, and town officials said the only regulatory approval still to be obtained is from the Army Corps of Engineers, a requirement because of wetlands in the area. That approval is expected later this month. 
Chris Ahearn, a spokesman for Lowe's, based in North Wilkesboro, N.C., which operates almost 900 stores in 45 states, declined to comment on the proposal until all the permits were in place.
Lowe's representatives have said at zoning hearings that the site's easy access to Interstate 395, less than a mile away, made it viable as a distribution-center site.
Plainfield town officials are excited about the potential tax revenue, particularly this year, when a budget shortage has resulted in layoffs of employees and cuts in services. First Selectman David C. Allard estimates that after property-tax abatements -- the land is in a state-legislated enterprise zone -- and after paying off a loan for a new road, the town will net $14 million over the next 20 years, or $700,000 a year, a substantial figure for Plainfield, which has an operating budget of $34 million.
Town and state officials said Lowe's had shown sensitivity to environmental concerns. When surveys discovered two species listed as endangered in the state, the Eastern spadefoot toad and the vesper sparrow, as well as a threatened species, the blue-spotted salamander, Lowe's redrew its plans.
The Plainfield town planner, Louis J. Soja, said he expected the project to draw the attention of some small manufacturers that sell to Lowe's, which might see advantages to being near the distribution center. The town has an industrial park less than two miles away, with about 15 lots of two to three acres still available, and the new road the town is to build will provide access to more industrial-zoned land, in tracts ranging from a few acres to 20 acres.
Michael A. Saad, Plainfield's director of economic development, said officials also sought to attract other development, stressing proximity to tourism destinations like Mystic Seaport as well as Indian casinos and new hotels. Ground is to be broken for a 68-room Super 8 motel next month, and a 120-room hotel is in the final planning stages.
Mr. Saad and Mr. Soja said they hoped the advantages that attracted Lowe's would draw other large retailers looking for distribution sites. "We feel we can be in a position to survive the ups and downs of the economy if we have diversity in the tax base," Mr. Saad said.
There are critics of the Lowe's project, though, who have organized a group called Save Our Town. 
Hector L. Rodriguez, a lawyer and president of the group, said the warehouse and driver jobs that will be created are not comparable to manufacturing jobs being lost because of the closing this summer of a Kaman Aerospace plant. And as hundreds of trucks a day leave the property, he said, traffic hazards will be created.
Mr. Rodriguez also criticized the town's use of eminent domain to obtain property in the path of the new road and questioned the estimates of tax revenue, which he said were inflated.
"They're holding this project out as the town's savior," he said, "but no one has been able to produce a document that commits to any level of tax revenue. This isn't progress, and this isn't economic development. This is not how you go about creating a tax base in town." 
Another member of the group, Christine M. Bernier, said she would see acres of rolling farmland in front of her house disappear as the Lowe's project is built. She said that town officials had dismissed opponents' fears of air and noise pollution from trucks and that bright lights from the round-the-clock warehouse operation would severely change the character of the neighborhood.
"This whole process has been exhausting," she said. "I can't believe that no one will help us."
But many townspeople, even in what will become the shadow of the distribution center, seem to be resigned to its construction. Claire Potvin, whose property backs up to the Lowe's site, said she was disappointed at the hip-high trees the retailer will plant as a boundary.
"I told them I'm 71 now, and I'll never see those bushes grow to block anything," she said. "By the time they're big enough to hide anything, I'll be six feet under. We don't like it, but I think we're going to have to learn to live with it."

HEADLINE: Charles P. Kindleberger, 92, Global Economist, Is Dead 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
Charles P. Kindleberger, an economic historian who advanced the study of international finance and helped to devise the Marshall Plan for Europe's reconstruction after World War II, died on Monday in Cambridge, Mass. He was 92.
 Professor Kindleberger won fame for originating the idea that global markets could not entirely police themselves. He wrote that leadership, as shown by Britain in the 19th century and the United States in the 20th, was essential to contain monetary crises. 
 He was also known for investigating the role of mob psychology in financial manias and panics, dating back to the tulip crisis in Holland early in the 17th century.
Unlike many academic economists of his time, Professor Kindleberger followed his education with a decade of practical experience in government, a period that spanned the end of the Great Depression and World War II. Decades later, his early grapplings with the problems of the American economy led him to write "The World in Depression: 1929-1939" -- a work that drew him solidly into the field of economic history.
"He brought into international economics some theoretical background but a great deal of worldly wisdom along with it," said Robert A. Mundell, a former student of Professor Kindleberger's who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in 1999 and is now a professor at Columbia University. "He had a very well-developed, quick and imaginative sense of the real problems of the real world."
Charles Poor Kindleberger II was born in New York City on Oct. 12, 1910. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1932 and completed his doctorate at Columbia University under James W. Angell, a monetary theorist, in 1937.
When the United States became embroiled in World War II, he interrupted a stint at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to seek a naval commission. Dissatisfied with his proposed posting at a desk job, he instead joined the Office of Strategic Services, the predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency, in 1942. He later became a major in the 12th Army Group in Europe, picking targets for Allied bombing based on enemy supply lines, and was awarded the Bronze Star by Gen. Omar Bradley.
After the war, Professor Kindleberger served as chief of the State Department's Division of German and Austrian Economic Affairs. He later spent long hours at the Pentagon helping estimate the costs of the European Recovery Program proposed in 1947 by George C. Marshall, then the secretary of state.
Congressional approval of the program, which came to be known as the Marshall Plan, coincided with Professor Kindleberger's move to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1948. He started as an associate professor and retired in 1976 as the Ford International Professor of Economics.
During his tenure, he was a consultant to the federal government several times, most often for the Treasury and the Federal Reserve. In 1985, he was president of the American Economic Association.
Though Professor Kindleberger's academic focus was often international, he was committed to education at home. He took a leave in 1967 and 1968 to visit the predominantly black colleges of the Atlanta University Center, where he taught courses and guided the development of economics curricula.
Professor Kindleberger wrote dozens of books, including a landmark textbook on international economics, first published in 1953, and a retrospective on the intersection of politics and economics in different countries, published in 2000. He also wrote an autobiography, "The Life of an Economist," in 1991.
"I have a strong impression that economics is a countercyclical industry that attracts adherents when times are troubled," he wrote. "Some are drawn to the subject by the opportunity to do good, to save the world, so to speak, by curing depression. The stronger drive in my view is curiosity. How does the economy work, and what has gone wrong?"
Professor Kindleberger was married to Sarah Bache Miles from 1937 until her death in 1997. He had lived in Lexington, Mass., since 1989. He is survived by two sons, Charles Poor III of St. Louis and Richard Stockton Kindleberger of Boston; two daughters, Sarah Kindleberger of Lincoln, Mass., and Elizabeth Randall Kindleberger of Machias, Me.; and five grandchildren.

Small Strivers Are Uprooted By Big Plans

BYLINE:  By DAN BARRY

 BODY:
CONSIDER the locksmith's story.
 Teddy Pazooki does not own a development company like Forest City Ratner. He has no pull with a state agency like the Empire State Development Corporation. He is not an executive with a media giant like The New York Times, although he reads the newspaper on occasion. 
 Mr. Pazooki is just a locksmith, which is misleading because no one is ever "just" anything. He is a native of Iran, a father of two, a Long Island homeowner. He also has a master's degree in applied science from New York University. But life is often about fumbling for keys, and the key he found opened the door to a locksmith's career.
For 21 years he worked out of a cubbyhole storefront at 262 West 41st Street, one block south of the 42nd Street glow and roar. His day's glitter came from the golden keys dangling about him; its music, from the grind of his key-making machine.
Above his machine's whir, though, Mr. Pazooki sometimes heard chatter: of plans to demolish half a city block, from 40th to 41st Streets on Eighth Avenue's east side, to help revitalize Times Square. But a recession quelled the talk years ago, leaving a clutch of small businesses to continue their Midtown striving.
There was Arnold Hatters, whose owners traced their Times Square roots to 1926. And B & J Fabrics, whose fine wares included the prophetically named "embroidered illusion." A barber shop here, a deli there, a couple of X-rated video stores -- and Teddy the locksmith, who relied on the foot traffic of commuters exhaled and inhaled daily by the Port Authority Bus Terminal.
But the chatter returned, louder this time. The Times wanted a new home; the state agency wanted to revitalize; the developer wanted to build. The city granted tax breaks to The Times, and Mr. Pazooki heard the rattle of other people's keys.
Last August the state took title through eminent domain. For the public good, the blight of that half-block would be demolished and a soaring skyscraper would rise in its stead. For the public good, the locksmith, the hatter and the rest had to find another mooring in the Manhattan roil.
The state presented modest financial packages to help the stores relocate. But it provided no compensation for the loss of future business; under New York law, dislocation does not affect the intangible "good will" between merchants and customers. 
Nonsense, said M. Robert Goldstein, a lawyer and expert in eminent domain who represents Mr. Pazooki. "If you move them a couple of blocks away, their customers don't know where to find them. It's not convenient anymore."
Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said that hundreds of businesses uprooted by the Times Square revitalization have thrived at new locations. But he acknowledged that one or two always fall through the cracks. "It's unfortunate," he said.
Of the dozens of affected businesses, four remain on site, and they will be gone in a matter of weeks. Arnold Rubin, the hatter, is moving a few blocks south on Eighth Avenue, but he is so upset -- with the state, with The Times -- that with all due respect he did not want to talk about it.
Catherine J. Mathis, a Times spokeswoman, said the company regretted the disruption suffered by "some businesses that make a positive contribution to life in Manhattan." She added, "We certainly hope the businesses and their owners prosper in their new locations."
THE rest of the shops fled months ago, pulling down one last time the gates that bear the now-hollow warning, Post No Bill. To preserve "good will," some posted their new addresses. Others said goodbye; "It has been a pleasure repairing your shoes," said the note outside a shoe store called, simply, Shoe Store.
Mr. Pazooki moved in December to 304 West 39th Street, just two blocks south of his old store. Again, "just" is relative; two blocks in Manhattan is 20 miles anywhere else. The Port Authority parade no longer passes by his storefront, reinforcing one of the truths of this city: there is always another locksmith.
He is paying $1,300 more in rent and doing two-thirds less in business. "What time is it, 11 o'clock?" he asked the other day. "Stay until 1 and see how many come in. One, two, none."
This Times employee asked how he felt. "How would you feel?" he answered, with a grace that forgave the stupidity of the question. "I'm 57 years old."
Standing there, eyes down, Mr. Pazooki looked out of place in his own store, a locksmith who had lost his key.

S.E.C. Seeks to Keep Ban on Old Advisers' New Role in Bankruptcies

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Wall Street firms are famous for profiting in good times and bad. But their efforts to persuade Congress to let them earn fees advising the same companies in bankruptcy that they counseled in better days have met with opposition from their chief regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 William H. Donaldson, chairman of the S.E.C., has written a letter expressing his agency's opposition to a proposed change in the bankruptcy law passed by the House in March. A provision in the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2003 would allow investment bankers that have done business with a company to advise it even after the company has filed for bankruptcy, removing a restriction that has been in the bankruptcy code for decades. 
 The objections of the S.E.C. to the provision, which has been backed recently by lobbyists for the securities industry, may well doom its chances of inclusion in the bankruptcy bill now before the Senate. 
When the House passed the bill four months ago, it quietly removed the restriction barring parties that had been involved with a company, including investment bankers that had sold its securities, from advising it in bankruptcy. The restriction was intended to ensure that an adviser to a company in bankruptcy would be neutral and have no interests of its own at stake. Because advisers to a bankrupt company must go back and re-examine old transactions, conflicts could arise if the same firm that advised a company before its bankruptcy was hired to scrutinize that advice after the company collapsed. 
The S.E.C.'s view on the proposed change to the bankruptcy code was outlined in a May 22 letter to Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Paul S. Sarbanes, the Maryland Democrat and ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee. 
The two men had sought the commission's thoughts on the provision in an April 10 letter to Mr. Donaldson.
In his letter, which was provided by an aide to Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Donaldson said that Congress should proceed "very cautiously" before loosening any conflict-of-interest restriction in the bankruptcy bill.
Conveying the view of the commission, Mr. Donaldson wrote, "While we recognize that this one-size-fits-all statutory exclusion is controversial, we believe that it would be a mistake to eliminate the exclusion in a similar one-size-fits-all manner at a time when investor confidence is fragile." 
The letter echoes testimony made by Mr. Donaldson in April before the Senate Banking Committee. He said then that although the commission had reached no conclusions on the matter, he thought it would be a mistake to change the law. But because the letter represents the opinion of the entire commission, it will carry considerable weight. 
A spokeswoman for Mr. Donaldson declined to comment further on the letter.
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Sarbanes said the bill that passed the House "carries with it tremendous potential for conflict of interest and just on its face it certainly gives an appearance of conflict of interest. I think this is a pretty raw and wrong provision. We've had this definition of disinterestedness in the bankruptcy law now for quite some time." 
The requirement that advisers to companies in bankruptcy be disinterested has been reviewed several times over the last 30 years and maintained. In 1997, for example, the National Bankruptcy Review Commission found that "strict disinterestedness standards are necessary because of the unique pressures inherent in the bankruptcy process."
Proponents of the bill, which was introduced by F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said that it was inefficient and costly to bar investment bankers who were familiar with a company's inner workings from advising it in bankruptcy. Allowing former advisers to provide services to a company in bankruptcy would also expand the pool of professionals available to the company, these people said.
As the issuance of securities -- and the fees associated with such deals -- have declined in recent years, securities firms have sought the business of advising companies in bankruptcy. And the number of public companies filing for bankruptcy protection hit a record last year. It would be a boon to all of Wall Street if the restrictions on who can advise companies in bankruptcy were removed. 
Not surprisingly, Congressional aides said that the Securities Industry Association had been lobbying lawmakers hard on the issue in recent months. James D. Spellman, a spokesman for the association, said in a statement: "We are asking for reforms that create a level playing field by giving the bankruptcy judge an expanded pool of candidates to choose from in deciding which one best qualifies as a 'disinterested party.' There would be greater competition among the potential advisers. 
"The House has passed the bill," he continued. "It's time for the Senate to act and provide companies seeking bankruptcy with the quality of advice they need to rebuild their businesses, save the jobs of their employees, and restore value for their creditors and shareholders."
But Mr. Leahy said yesterday, "Rebuilding investor confidence is still important to the economy, and the last thing we should be doing now is to weaken conflict-of-interest standards for investment bankers. Chairman Donaldson's advice is timely, and Congress should listen to it."
