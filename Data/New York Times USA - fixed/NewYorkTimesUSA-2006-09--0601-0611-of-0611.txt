HEADLINE: Change in Goldman Sachs Index Was Factor in Gas Price Drop

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 29 

 BODY:
Politics and worries about oil supplies may have caused gasoline prices to go up at the pump earlier this year, but one big investment bank quietly helped their rapid drop in recent weeks, according to some economists, traders and analysts.
 Goldman Sachs, which runs the largest commodity index, the G.S.C.I., said in early August that it was reducing the index's weighting in gasoline futures significantly. The announcement did not make big headlines, but it has reverberated through the markets in the weeks since and some other investors who had been betting that gasoline would rise followed suit on their weightings. 
''They started unwinding their positions, and those other longs also rushed to the door at the same time,'' said Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. 
 Wholesale prices for New York Harbor unleaded gasoline, the major gasoline contract traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, dropped 18 cents a gallon on Aug. 10, to $1.9889 a gallon, a decline of more than 8 percent, and they have dropped further since then. In New York on Friday, gasoline futures for October delivery rose 4.81 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $1.5492 a gallon. Prices have fallen 9.4 percent this year.
 The August announcement by Goldman Sachs caught some traders by surprise. The firm said in early June that it planned to roll its positions in the harbor contract into another futures contract, the reformulated gasoline blendstock, which is replacing the harbor contract at the end of the year because of changes to laws about gasoline additives. 
 Later in June, Goldman said it had rolled a third of its gasoline holdings into the reformulated contracts but would make further announcements as to whether the remainder would be rolled over. Then in August, the bank said it would not roll over any more positions into gasoline and would redistribute the weighting into other petroleum products. 
 Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Some traders speculated that Goldman might have been concerned about the liquidity of the reformulated contract and whether other traders would embrace it because there were so few contracts outstanding. The open interest, or number of futures contracts taken out, has increased ninefold in the reformulated contract since then. 
 Unleaded gasoline made up 8.72 percent of Goldman's commodity index as of June 30, but it is just 2.3 percent now, representing a sell-off of more than $6 billion in futures contract weighting. 
 Like many market indexes, trading in the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index is publicly available, allowing individual investors and third-party asset managers to participate in that market. The $100 billion invested comes from brokers, fund managers and individuals, probably including some of the same people who were hurt by high gasoline prices earlier in the year. 
 Goldman's announcement on Aug. 9 was not the only downward pressure on prices that week, market participants stress. And while it may have played a part in sending prices down, the market would never have continued its downward trend unless supplies had loosened up, they say. 
 Also during that week, climatologists revised their hurricane forecasts, easing fears that oil supplies could be disrupted. And BP said it would still produce some oil from its field in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, where leaks were being repaired. Meanwhile, the peak gasoline season was ending, and new supplies of ethanol were coming online. 
 The week started with ''everyone talking about $4 gasoline and ended with the market down sharply,'' said Phil Verleger, an independent economist in Aspen, Colo. 
 In following weeks, ''traders all tried to push themselves through that door,'' Mr. Goldstein added.
 ''We saw gasoline fall 82 cents in the wholesale market over a four-week period, which is unprecedented,'' he said. Mr. Goldstein said that the decline in gasoline prices helped send prices of the whole group of energy-related products down. 
 Now, rather than highs, these products are hitting lows -- natural gas, for example, traded on Wednesday at its lowest price in four years.

HEADLINE: That's Why They Call It Work

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
MORE than half of all employees say they have ''high levels of stress,'' extreme fatigue and/or feel out of control. Half say they miss one or two days of work a year because of stress, and 46 percent say they come to work ''one to four days a year when they are too stressed to be effective.''
 ''The consequences of [excessive] stress are straight-forward: physical illness; increase in health care costs; heightened turnover, loss of productive employees and loss of collegiality,'' said Ronald G. Downey, a Kansas State University professor, who is quoted in the article Stress Management in H.R. Magazine. 
 Other experts cited added that stressed-out workers were more likely to make mistakes and were less creative.
 Recognizing all this, Kathryn Tyler writes that companies are trying to take various steps to make the workplace less pressure-packed. The solutions range from having an onsite concierge to run errands so that employees won't have to before or after work, to increasing the use of flex time, and reminding workers to take all of their vacation time.
 But perhaps the best idea for relieving stress is also the simplest. ''Providing training to help employees do their jobs better can be an important way to reduce stress,'' Ms. Tyler writes. ''Equally important is providing training to managers, especially those whose deficient supervisory skills may be causing stress for subordinates.''
 Paul J. Rosch, president of the American Institute of Stress, said ''most job stress has to do with workers' impressions that they have little control over their work.''

DON'T WORRY, BE HAPPY -- ''The most popular class at Harvard isn't Intro to Econ or Survey of Dead White Poets,'' Lauren Bradshaw writes in Glamour. It's the Positive Psychology seminar taught by Tal Ben-Shahar who gives students research-based ways to live a more satisfying life. ''In other words, it's a course on how to be happier.''
 Among the teachings: 
 Find what makes you happy. ''Make three lists of activities: ones you're good at; ones that feel pleasurable, and ones that are meaningful to you.'' Look for any item that appears on all three lists. ''An hour of that activity can boost your outlook for a week,'' Mr. Ben-Shahar said. 
 Failure is O.K. The most successful people are also the ones who have failed the most, so stop trying to be perfect.
 Don't fake it. If you are anxious or unhappy don't pretend otherwise. ''Always saying 'I'm fine' when you are not is a harmful habit,'' Mr. Ben-Shahar said. ''Only two types of people don't experience sadness or fear: psychopaths and dead people.''

IT ADDS UP -- Ever since the Russians launched Sputnik, leaders have bemoaned the fact that America is not producing enough people trained in math.
 Writing in Edutopia, which is published by the George Lucas Educational Foundation, Espen Andersen, associate professor at the Norwegian School of Management, offers a simple, straightforward solution to the problem: Instead of trying to convince students that math isn't hard, boring or irrelevant, appeal to their ego and sense of greed.
 In offering ''12 excellent reasons to learn math,'' Mr. Andersen goes out of his way to stress the financial benefits. For example, ''you'll make more money,'' he says citing the availability of high-paying jobs in engineering, statistics and technology. ''Math will get you a job in the cool companies, the ones that need brains.''
 And in addition to making more money, he writes, those with an understanding of math will be less likely to lose some.
 ''When hordes of idiots throw their money at pyramid schemes, it is partially because they don't know enough math,'' he writes. ''If you know a little bit about statistics and interest calculations, you can see through economic lies and wishful thinking.''

FINAL TAKE -- So much for training, education or computer security for that matter: Health magazine reports that 71 percent of people in a British study were ''willing to trade their office computer password for a candy bar.'' PAUL B. BROWN

Financial Impact of Film Piracy
 A new report from the Institute for Policy Innovation, a conservative Texas-based research group, has found that motion-picture piracy not only hurts the movie industry but also results in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs outside the industry and costs billions of dollars in lost wages, lost tax revenue and diminished overall economic output. The report was released yesterday at a Washington news conference held in conjunction with the United States Chamber of Commerce's third annual antipiracy and counterfeiting summit. As a starting point, the report, written by Stephen E. Siwek, used a study commissioned by the Motion Picture Association of America in 2004 and released in May that determined what revenues movie companies would have earned if pirated products had not been available; it found a loss of $6.1 billion in 2005. According to the new report, a domino effect ensues, affecting many other industries.

Nashville Celebrates Bluegrass
 
 Tim O'Brien's ''Look Down That Lonesome Road'' won song of the year at the 17th annual International Bluegrass Music Awards, presented onstage at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville on Thursday night. Mr. O'Brien, right, also walked away with the award for male vocalist of the year. For the eighth consecutive year, Ricky Skaggs and Kentucky Thunder was the instrumental group of the year, and this year's top vocal group was Doyle Lawson and Quicksilver. The event was part of the World of Bluegrass festival, which has taken over Nashville since Monday. Events continue this weekend and include today's Fan Fest, a marathon concert at the Nashville Convention Center that will include appearances by the Grascals (entertainer of the year at Thursday's awards show) and Hot Rize, Mr. O'Brien's Colorado-based band.

Harsh Words for Bush From Oliver Stone
 At the San Sebastian International Film Festival in Spain on Thursday, the director Oliver Stone, left, strongly criticized President Bush, The Associated Press reported. ''We have destroyed the world in the name of security,'' he said before a screening of ''World Trade Center,'' his latest film, which stars Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena as Port Authority police officers trapped in the rubble on Sept. 11, 2001. ''From Sept. 12 on, the incident was politicized, and it has polarized the entire world,'' Mr. Stone said. Also at the festival, the Iranian director Bahman Ghobadi said it had become hard to work in Iran, where his film ''Half Moon'' was banned because a woman sings in it.

HEADLINE: Must We Pay More to Live Longer?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''The Choice: A Longer Life or More Stuff'' (Economix column, Business Day, Sept. 27):
David Leonhardt notes that ''an affluent society should devote an ever-growing share of its resources to the health of its citizens.''
 That's exactly right. The ''crisis'' is not about spiraling health care costs. It's about corporate greed. And perhaps when industrial dinosaurs like General Motors come to realize that the health of their workers is at least as important as the return paid to shareholders, we'll realize that the bottom line is as much about life as it is about money. 
 What we can no longer afford isn't healthy workers. It's a system that values profits over prosperity. 
 Isn't it about time that we figured out that the wealth of a country lies in the well-being of all its citizens rather than in the bank accounts of its wealthiest members? 

Matt Harris
Seattle, Sept. 27, 2006

To the Editor:
 A ''choice'' between skyrocketing health care costs and a loss of life expectancy is a false choice. 
 Yes, a baby born in the United States today can expect to live about a decade longer than one born in 1950. But babies born in, for example, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, Australia, Japan and much of Western Europe can expect to live even longer than those born here in the United States, all with lower health care spending per person. 
 Improving inefficiencies in our health care system and ensuring universal affordable health care so that expensive emergency rooms don't become de facto doctors' offices for the 46 million uninsured Americans can help move us in the right direction without shaving years off our lives.
 On the ridiculousness of the equation that excessive consumption equals patriotism: hear, hear!

Janet Larsen
Washington, Sept. 28, 2006

The writer is the director of research at the Earth Policy Institute.

To the Editor:
 It should be noted that most advances in Americans' life expectancy in the last decades have come from improvements in public health, like universal immunization for disease and improved hygiene, and not from medical care. 
 Also, while the United States spends more per person on medical care than any other country, on many indicators of population health, like infant mortality, the United States performs well below many so-called poor countries. 
 Thus, paying more for medical care does not always translate into better health. 
 David Leonhardt is correct about one thing: our present health system is unsustainable as it is currently configured.

Rose Young
Pinehurst, N.C., Sept. 27, 2006

To the Editor:
 David Leonhardt notes that many if not most of the cost increases associated with health care are reasonable and justifiable, both in their origin and in the consumer's willingness to pay them. 
 Yes, the technology cited has improved our general health and our life expectancy. But I would highlight the dangers of taking this situation too much for granted. 
 There may be a middle ground. The human body is a truly amazing machine, capable of surprising adaptation and resilience, and we need not aid it as often and as obsessively as our addiction to the health care industry indicates we do. Some restraint could very likely save us money in both the long and the short run.

Lance Labun
Hanover, N.H., Sept. 27, 2006

To the Editor:
 David Leonhardt says better health care requires a bigger share of resources. But is that true, given the economics of scientific and technological innovation? For example, the $800 computer I bought last month is more powerful than the $1,500 computer I bought three years ago.
 We should be careful not to confuse correlation with causation: for instance, that life expectancy is up because we spent more. Life expectancy in the United States trails many affluent countries that have lower expenditures. These countries have universal coverage paid for by a single party, their governments. 
 We should stop thinking of health care as a benefit to be earned from work and bought through middlemen (private insurers), and start treating it as a human right and a universal entitlement.
 Getting medical care isn't like shopping for a shirt at the mall. It takes a smart universal single-payer system to foster innovation and competition among biotech companies while coordinating quality care from hospitals and doctors for everyone. 

Marcus C. Tye
East Quogue, N.Y., Sept. 28, 2006

The writer is chairman of the psychology department at Dowling College.

To the Editor:
 David Leonhardt's column about increasing life spans and health costs is the best illustration yet of a broader economic problem: the failure of our inflation yardsticks to comprehend quality improvements in basic goods and services. 
 Instead of focusing on the ever-rising tide of money flowing into medical care, why not make a few basic adjustments to the Consumer Price Index to account for the large increases in life span Mr. Leonhardt mentions? This would put spiraling medical costs in the proper perspective.

HEADLINE: Wisconsin's Crown of Cheese Lies Within California's Reach

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

DATELINE: MONROE, Wis. 

 BODY:
In a small yellow building tucked into rolling fields of corn and cows, men in aprons and rain boots stand guard over two enormous vats of thick white goop, no longer milk but not yet Muenster cheese.
 People have toiled in these rooms, foggy with the smell of warm milk, for 116 years, which helps explain why Ivan Gobeli spits out an expletive at the predictions that California will soon overtake Wisconsin as the nation's top cheese producer.
 ''You have to understand, my God, this is good stuff,'' said Mr. Gobeli, as he stepped outside the Franklin Cheese Factory, where he started as an apprentice in 1957 and then ran for decades before he retired.
 As if California's capture of the top milk production title more than a decade ago was not demoralizing enough for Wisconsin, which still proclaims itself America's Dairyland right on its license plates, the cheese crown is now at serious risk, too, perhaps changing hands as early as next year. Last year, Wisconsin made 2.4 billion pounds of cheese, while California crept ever closer, finishing with 2.14 billion pounds -- triple the amount it made 15 years ago. 
 For Wisconsin, this is more than a simple battle over a commodity or a listing in an obscure federal agriculture publication. Cheese is the state's history, its pride, its self-deprecating, sometimes goofy, cheesehead approach to life.
 ''Cheese really is part of our identity,'' said Terese Allen, a former president of the Culinary History Enthusiasts of Wisconsin who writes about the state's culinary folklore. ''Cheese is the perfect illustration of the Wisconsin personality -- casual, fun people who like to make fun of things, including ourselves.''
 And so, by turns, the prospect of California's dominance has sent Wisconsinites into various stages of cheese grief: denial (cows like cold weather, they say, and the hot West Coast climate will never produce the tasty pastures grown for them around here); condescension (many of California's top cheese-making minds were imported from Wisconsin, they say); and, eventually, resigned indifference (it is the taste, the quality, they conclude, not the quantity of cheese that should matter most).
 Wisconsin's long affair with cheese began when its wheat crop faltered. In the mid-19th century, farmers realized that depleted soil and insect infestations made raising cows more manageable, and the state's many immigrants from places like Germany and Switzerland, who brought cheese-making methods from the old country, got to work. 
 By 1922, 2,807 cheese factories had sprung up around the state, one at nearly every rural crossroads, said Jerry Apps, the author of ''Cheese: The Making of a Wisconsin Tradition'' (Amherst Press, 1998), which opens, simply enough, this way: ''Say cheese and you say Wisconsin.'' 
 But as it became easier to transport milk long distances, the number of factories shrank, Mr. Apps said. And, as with so many other elements of the farm industry, as time went on, some of the littlest factories closed as the biggest ones grew bigger. There are now 130 factories. 
 Still, Wisconsin, which had overtaken New York in cheese production by 1910, has continued to reign as the nation's largest and proudest producer. (New York is now fourth, and Idaho is third.) 
 Wisconsin boasts the nation's only ''Master Cheesemaker'' certification, for its most accomplished veteran makers (there were 47 as of April) and one of the earliest cheese-making education programs, at the University of Wisconsin. 
 But in recent decades, California began expanding its milk and cheese production at an astonishing pace. Signs of the growth began popping up all around: 21 awards to California cheeses in the prestigious American Cheese Society competition in 2002, for example, and a $21-million-a-year national advertising blitz starring talking ''Happy Cows'' from California, including images of a seemingly miserable cow making a break from a snowy, blustery field for sunnier pastures out West and the slogan, ''Great cheese comes from happy cows.'' 
 The commercials were even broadcast on television stations in Wisconsin, a fact that some cheese makers here considered an audacious (and not particularly Midwestern) act of aggression, and one that led several of them to question whisperingly just how ''happy'' the cows in California really could be, considering the heat wave this summer that killed tens of thousands of them.
 Happiness notwithstanding, dairy economists predict California will win. Even John T. Umhoefer, the executive director of the Wisconsin Cheese Makers Association, a group more than a century old and devoted to advocating for its producers, quietly concedes the point. ''They won't roar by us, but they will pass us,'' Mr. Umhoefer said.
 This is where indifference has begun to seep in, and -- perhaps by way of defense -- a new battle emerges.
 Around Wisconsin, to the news of California's rising dominance, cheese makers say they are turning their focus to high-priced specialty, artisan and organic cheeses that take more time to produce, cheeses like Asiago, feta and blue cheese, and those with names newly dreamed up.
 ''We're moving on from this whole quantity thing,'' said Jeanne Carpenter of the state's Dairy Business Innovation Center, who said specialty cheeses now accounted for 15 percent of the state's production, up significantly from five years ago. ''Where Wisconsin is going to make its mark now is in the quality of the cheese.''
 Buried in this argument, of course, is the suggestion by people here that California is, by comparison, mass producing commodity cheeses at enormous factories, not using the old-fashioned methods like the Franklin Cheese Factory's, where men hover over the 75,000 pounds of milk that arrives before dawn and is, with the help of bacteria and enzymes and heating and cutting, transformed into 8,000 pounds of cheese. 
 California is making nearly the same amount of cheese as Wisconsin with far fewer factories, just 55 compared to more than twice that in Wisconsin. But California cheese officials say that they, too, are focusing on smaller operations that create specialty and artisan varieties. 
 A spokeswoman for the California Milk Advisory Board, Nancy Fletcher, said new research there showed that the state was not just cranking out chunks of mozzarella: 11.3 percent of California's cheese is of the fancy, specialty persuasion, Ms. Fletcher said, and the state now creates 250 varieties of cheese. 
 And so, the war for cheese prominence rages on, and Wisconsin's identity crisis looms.
 A few here suggest Wisconsin might be wise to begin considering substitute symbols -- something tied more, perhaps, to the state's vast production of cranberries, ginseng or brats, as bratwurst is known from Eagle River to Beloit. 
 If the term ''cheesehead'' was originally meant to convey some negative bumpkin image that outsiders (often from Chicago) had of those from Wisconsin, many who lived here, in turn, embraced it, defiantly chuckling at themselves. Foamation, the company in St. Francis that began manufacturing cheesehead hats in 1987 (and later ties, earrings, crowns, key chains, magnets and toilet seats), is having one of its busiest selling seasons in years.
 A new generation is buying the items, said an employee, Denise Kaminski. ''When you drive through Wisconsin, what do you see but cheese?'' she said. ''It's who we are, and that's not going away.''

HEADLINE: Fuel for Thought

 BODY:
If the world is going to reduce the quantity of greenhouse gases spewed into the atmosphere, every industry has to find ways to use energy more efficiently. One of the most common-sense proposals we have heard lately comes from Sir Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic airline. 
 As passengers on late-departing flights are only too aware, jets taxi between the gate and the runway sometimes for an hour or longer. And they do it with their giant engines burning fuel the entire time. Sir Richard proposes simply that an aircraft's engines remain off until the plane is ready for takeoff.
Under his proposal, tugs would pull the airplanes from the gates to a holding area near the end of the runway. This would reduce the pollution generated by the waiting planes. Not only does that help the effort against global warming, it also benefits the health of those living nearby. 
 Like any new system, there would be kinks to work out, such as how to power systems like air-conditioning or heating while the plane waited. The biggest hurdle of all may be bureaucratic, because of the many different companies and regulatory bodies represented at each location. But airlines should get behind the proposal because it would save fuel, which in the end would mean saving money.
 Virgin says it is working with London's Gatwick and Heathrow airports to try to get trial programs up and running. We hope that Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark get involved as well. An official at the Port Authority said it would embrace the opportunity, and pointed out that the authority has applied for a grant to acquire electric-powered tow vehicles. With a little cooperation, substantial reductions in airport ground pollution are within reach.
 When Sir Richard pledged last week to invest $3 billion over 10 years to fight global warming, some questioned whether it was one of his many publicity stunts. This new proposal should allay doubts about his commitment and seriousness. Ultimately, private enterprise must play a critical role in moving away from an economy powered by fossil fuels and toward a sustainable one run on alternative power sources. The more entrepreneurs like the brash Sir Richard get involved in green business, the faster we will end our reliance on petroleum.
 But the actions of private citizens and businesses do not absolve the government of responsibility to act decisively. The United States government still needs to regulate emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. Only when there is a price associated with polluting the atmosphere with carbon dioxide will the clean-energy businesses supported by people like Sir Richard really take off.

HEADLINE: Spitzer's 'To-Do List'

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
This 30-second commercial for Eliot Spitzer, the Democratic candidate for governor in New York, began running on Tuesday on broadcast and cable stations across the state.

PRODUCER -- Jimmy Siegel. 


THE SCRIPT -- Eliot Spitzer: ''O.K., starting Day 1, here's our to-do list: We're going to raise the standard of living for middle-class families by finally reducing their property-tax burden. We're going to raise employment by making it more affordable to do business here. We're going to raise test scores and graduation rates by investing in our schools. And we're going to raise the standards of fiscal responsibility by cutting the billions in waste necessary to pay for those things. Oh, there's one thing we're not going to raise: your taxes. You can take that to the bank.''

ON SCREEN -- Mr. Spitzer does not look directly into the camera, but speaks at an angle, as if there is an off-camera interviewer. Woven into his monologue are images of a young woman with children, abandoned storefronts and a young woman in a classroom. Saloon-style piano music plays in the background.

ACCURACY -- Mr. Spitzer has consistently laid out the agenda described here; the ad also reflects his take-charge style. His Republican opponent, John Faso, says the Democrat's promises for new spending -- $8 billion to $10 billion a year, the Spitzer campaign says -- cannot be financed without tax increases. Mr. Spitzer has emphatically denied that, proposing $11 billion in budget cuts and pledging to re-energize the economy.

SCORECARD -- Mr. Spitzer has been under pressure -- from reporters, newspaper editorial boards and Mr. Faso -- to lay out his top priorities. Given that many political commercials are free of substance, either overly rosy or intensely negative, Mr. Spitzer gets credit for telling the audience to hold him accountable for a to-do list. His priorities hew closely to voters' greatest concerns, according to opinion polls. A 30-second ad may not be the place for the details of his plans, but Mr. Spitzer risks appearing arrogant if he does not do a better job persuading voters that his budget numbers add up. Perhaps most important, Mr. Spitzer's evocation of President George H. W. Bush's famous pledge, ''read my lips -- no new taxes,'' invites voters to take him at his word. Mr. Spitzer is aware that Mr. Bush suffered mightily for breaking his. PATRICK HEALY

HEADLINE: Islamic Extremism And Our Response

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''The Grand Delusion,'' by David Brooks (column, Sept. 28):
If, as Mr. Brooks avers, Islamic extremism is not a result of ''short-term historical circumstances, but of consciousness and culture,'' why did the Bush administration and Mr. Brooks believe that 150,000 Western troops, even with billions of dollars, could change that in jig time? 
 Grand delusion indeed.

William W. Goetz
Bedminster, N.J., Sept. 28, 2006

To the Editor: 
 David Brooks says countries in the Arab world do not define their national glory economically. In fact, their arrogance stems directly from the money they receive from the West for their oil.
 Without the petrodollars flowing into these regimes, they would find themselves quickly at odds with their people, whose anger would be pointed at their leaders, resulting in the overthrow of these totalitarian regimes. 
 The ''grand delusion'' is that we can maintain our present level of oil consumption, attack regimes that were contained (Iraq) and talk about attacking other countries (Iran) when we do not have enough troops to maintain order in a country previously defeated (Afghanistan).
 President Bush said he was the ''decider''; I see him as the ''delusioner.''

Brian Gallagher
White Plains, Sept. 28, 2006

To the Editor:
 David Brooks implies that Democrats are as culpable as Republicans for our intelligence failures and the fiasco that is Iraq. 
 While President Clinton viewed terrorism as a grave threat, Republicans, drunk on their own power after the 2000 election, gave terrorism a low priority, preferring instead to focus on tax cuts. 
 After 9/11, it was Democrats who argued that we should focus on Al Qaeda rather than expend resources and international goodwill to oust a dictator. It was only after Republicans fanned the flames of nationalism that Democratic lawmakers acquiesced to Republican demands.
 The lesson is not that both political parties failed but that a government ruled by a single political party blinds us at the very moment when clarity and transparency are most in need.

Mark Cassell
Kent, Ohio, Sept. 28, 2006

To the Editor:
 David Brooks acknowledges that modern nations mark their greatness by economic wealth and that ''Islamic extremists will continue to compete and grow until mainstream Islamic moderates can establish a more civilized set of criteria for prestige and greatness.''
 Why, then, does Mr. Brooks continue to support the violence of war as a means of ending the violence of terrorism? Given his reasoning, wouldn't it be far wiser to divert the billions of dollars we are spending on the Iraqi disaster into the economic development of Palestine?
 Wouldn't viable ports, secure water sources, healthy agribusiness and manufacturing plants be more productive in the fight against Islamic extremists than military action?

Janet Ellingson
Salt Lake City, Sept. 28, 2006

To the Editor:
 David Brooks, by referring to the ''Wilsonian madness of trying to introduce democracy into the Arab world,'' muddies the water in two ways: he gives an unearned innocence to the neocons' invasion of Iraq while doing a grave disservice to Woodrow Wilson.
 Wilson sought to create the League of Nations in order to promote democracy and world peace; the neocons show disdain for the United Nations and try to impose democracy at gunpoint, threatening world peace. 
 Both projects may be naive, but only one is Wilsonian. The other is indeed madness.

HEADLINE: Bush and Kazakh Leader Play Up Partnership

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 

 BODY:
President Bush took another step in his delicate foreign policy waltz with the authoritarian government of Kazakhstan on Friday, praising the oil-rich Central Asian country as ''a free nation'' while welcoming its president, Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, to the White House for lunch. 
 During a brief joint appearance in the Oval Office, Mr. Bush said the two presidents pledged to ''support the forces of moderation throughout the world,'' while Mr. Nazarbayev, speaking through a translator, reiterated his commitment to ridding his country of nuclear weapons and said the two nations had ''truly become close partners.''
 Neither man mentioned the sore points in that partnership: the absence of free elections in Kazakhstan, which became an independent state in 1991; state restrictions on the news media; and its recent decision to shut down two prominent American democracy organizations -- a move that American officials are trying to reverse.
 ''We talked about our commitment to institutions that will enable liberty to flourish,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I have watched very carefully the development of this important country from one that was in the Soviet sphere to one that is now a free nation.''
 Despite that transition, Kazakhstan also poses a diplomatic challenge for President Bush, who has made promoting democracy a central component of his foreign policy. On Friday morning, in his latest speech on fighting terrorism, Mr. Bush touted his efforts to build a free nation in Afghanistan and to push Pakistan toward free elections.
 The White House views Kazakhstan, a state that has abundant oil and gas reserves and whose population is predominately Muslim, as a critical ally in promoting economic stability and security in that region. One-third of all foreign investment in Kazakhstan comes from the United States, and administration officials say the country has also been a strategic partner in Iraq and Afghanistan. It has a small ordnance removal team working in Iraq, and has given the United States fly-over rights so that military planes can take equipment to Afghanistan.
 An administration official, granted anonymity to talk about the meeting, said ''the issue of democracy was raised'' during the visit. The leaders later put out a joint statement in which they agreed to ''reaffirm the importance of democratic development'' in institutions such as an independent news media and free and fair elections.
 ''They're moving in the right direction,'' the official said, ''and we think that bringing them in close will give us greater prospects of expecting quicker progress.''
 Mr. Bush invited Mr. Nazarbayev to a small lunch rather than holding a state dinner -- a sign that Kazakhstan's leader is working his way into the president's inner foreign policy circle, but is not all the way there.

HEADLINE: Ex-Firebrand Ortega On the Comeback Trail

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Sept. 24 

 BODY:
Washington's old cold war nemesis, Daniel Ortega, is as divisive a figure as he ever was as a 30-something revolutionary who took on Ronald Reagan. 
 After three failed attempts to return to power in the last 15 years, El Comandante, as Mr. Ortega is widely known, is once again smiling down from campaign billboards across Nicaragua. Now 60 and balding with a slight paunch, he stands his best chance yet of returning to power in elections on Nov. 5.
Though opinion polls give Mr. Ortega about 30 percent support, he is the front-runner in a race splintered among five candidates. Yet the sentiment against him is broad and the scrambling to head off an Ortega victory is intense, and not just in Nicaragua.
 The prospect has stirred deep anxiety in the Bush administration, which envisions him as a new ally for President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela in challenging United States policy. Mr. Chavez has lent his support to Mr. Ortega, while Washington has sent word in no uncertain terms that aid will be re-evaluated if Mr. Ortega is elected. 
 The latest in a string of visitors to Managua was Representative Dan Burton of Indiana, chairman of the House subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs. While insisting that he was not telling Nicaraguans how to vote, he made it clear to local reporters that he opposed Mr. Ortega and that relations between Nicaragua and the United States would suffer should he win. 
 But Mr. Ortega's fiercest opposition is homegrown. He is not just a candidate. He is the main issue in the race. 
 Nicaraguan politics continue to revolve around the mustachioed former Marxist, who led the country after the leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front overthrew the Somoza family's four-decade military dictatorship. Continuing domestic divisions during his administration, including a rightist insurgency backed by the United States, left the lush countryside bathed in blood.
 ''This decision that the voters are going to take on Nov. 5 is a question of national survival,'' Eduardo Montealegre, the candidate of the Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance, said in an interview. ''With Ortega we're not going to survive.'' Mr. Montealegre, who served as foreign minister and finance minister in conservative administrations, has the blessing of Washington.
 Another candidate, Edmundo Jarquin, an economist and former Sandinista diplomat, criticized Mr. Ortega for being ''all about conflict,'' intent on riling the United States at every opportunity. 
 Still another, Jose Rizo, a former vice president from the pro-business Constitutionalist Liberal Party, said Mr. Ortega's first stint as president, in the 1980's, was marked by human rights abuses and a failed economy -- compounded, of course, by a trade embargo imposed by President Reagan.
 A fifth candidate, Eden Pastora, a former Sandinista leader once known as Commander Zero, trails well behind the others.
 The plethora of challengers has boosted Mr. Ortega's chances, especially since his party orchestrated a rules change several years ago allowing a presidential candidate to win with as little as 35 percent of the vote and a five-point lead over the nearest rival.
 That electoral math may allow Mr. Ortega to squeak out a victory in the first round of balloting. Should he fail to do so, his chances are considered slim in a runoff, in which the anti-Ortega vote would be likely to dominate, said Alejandro Serrano Caldera, a political analyst.
 For his part, Mr. Ortega regards himself as so much of a target that he avoided a televised debate earlier this month in which the four other candidates participated.
 Mr. Ortega wears heavy boots and a white collarless shirt on the campaign trail. He shakes every hand he can but strides quickly past reporters seeking to question him. His stump speeches are vintage Ortega -- passionate appeals to the poor in this country, one of the most down and out in the Western Hemisphere. But he says his Marxist days are a thing of the past. 
 After toppling Anastasio Somoza in 1979 and seizing power, the Sandinistas confiscated private property and formed alliances with Cuba and the Soviet Union. The United States responded by backing insurgents, known as the contras, intent on topping Mr. Ortega. 
 In 1990, after a long and destructive war, a peace agreement led to new elections, which Mr. Ortega lost to a coalition of opposition parties led by Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. 
 Mr. Ortega tries to soothe some audiences by insisting that his presidency would be different this time around. He speaks of his desire to tame ''savage capitalism'' by, for instance, renegotiating the trade agreement that Nicaragua and other countries in Central America have signed with the United States. 
 Still, he raised alarms recently when he criticized the election observers sent by the Organization of American States. The presence of many of his loyalists on the national electoral commission prompted fears of vote rigging.
 And when he gets out into the countryside, Mr. Ortega still insinuates heavily that the landless ought to get plots of their own.
 This somewhat ambiguous approach has won over some new converts, even as Mr. Ortega has fallen out with some longtime loyalists who consider him a sellout to the revolution.
 The years have indeed shown Mr. Ortega to be far less of an ideologue than he used to be when he railed against the West. A shrewd political operator by any measure, he has tried to widen his base by embracing old rivals, including some in the Constitutionalist Liberal Party of Arnoldo Aleman, a conservative former president.
 ''Ortega is like a pendulum who moves from one side to the other and is more pragmatic than ideological,'' said Carlos Chamorro, a political analyst and son of Violeta Chamorro. 
 Aiding Mr. Ortega's campaign more than anything is the suffering that many Nicaraguans endure. Despite some gains -- a big drop in the national debt and steady economic growth -- many feel left out of the country's recovery and are willing to give Mr. Ortega's populism another try.
 ''He'll be better this time,'' said Margarita de Jesus Calero, 58, a grandmother from Managua who stood in the sun the other day for a glimpse of her candidate. ''He has more experience. He knows where he wants to go now.''
 But the memories of the war years are too strong for others to forget, despite Mr. Ortega's talk of debt forgiveness and other subsidies for the poor.
 ''When he was president before, we didn't have food and our children were off fighting,'' said Maria del Carmen Cerda, 52, whose family is divided into pro- and anti-Sandinista factions. ''The only thing he gave us was sorrow.''
 Mr. Ortega's most prominent convert is Jaime Morales, a former member of the contra guerrillas. Mr. Morales has joined Mr. Ortega's campaign as the vice presidential candidate and sees a change in Mr. Ortega for the better. 
 He said he received compensation from Mr. Ortega several years ago for his house, which the Sandinistas seized in the 1980's and in which Mr. Ortega still lives. The compensation was part of Mr. Ortega's effort to heal old wounds, Mr. Morales said. 
 ''The Daniel Ortega of today is not the Daniel Ortega of years ago,'' he said. ''I can understand all the anxiety, but we have to stop living in the past.''

HEADLINE: Earmarks Find Way Into Spending Bill

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 

 BODY:
Less than a year after two bribery scandals produced bipartisan calls for Congress to overhaul the way it finances lawmakers' pet projects, the $436.6 billion military spending bill passed Friday is packed with them. 
 The bill, which accounts for about half of federal discretionary spending, includes only a small part of the expected costs of next year's military operations in Iraq. After the fall elections, President Bush is expected to request another supplemental spending measure to pay for the war, just as the administration has for the last three years.
Lawmakers nonetheless found room in the bill to pay for thousands of requests never sought by the Defense Department. These projects, or earmarks, included $2.1 billion for 10 additional C-17 Globemaster III cargo jets, which the Pentagon is trying to discontinue. They are made by Boeing in the home state of Senator Jim Talent, Republican of Missouri, who is locked in a tight race for re-election. 
 Lawmakers say earmarks can result in contributions to national security as well as to their districts' economies. The Defense Department complains that such projects divert billions of dollars from programs the Pentagon considers vital. But both sides agree that earmarks' merits are hard for Congress and the public to assess.
 The number of earmarks has tripled over the last 12 years, straining the ability of Congressional staff members to vet each one. The opaque language of spending bills makes it hard for outsiders to know where the money for each project goes. And it is often impossible to know which lawmaker requested a specific project.
 The total cost of earmarks is subject to debate. The House Appropriations Committee said the value of the ''member projects'' in the spending bill this time was $6.7 billion, down from $7.7 billion in the bill approved last year. The Congressional Research Service estimated the total cost of earmarks in last year's bill at more than $9 billion. Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan group, has identified well over 2,000 earmarks in this year's bill, roughly on par with last year's.
 Among the earmarks identified by Taxpayers for Common Sense were $1.7 million for photon research in upstate New York, care of Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles E. Schumer, both Democrats, and $1.2 million for prostate cancer research involving DNA, a pet cause of Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, who is chairman of the military spending subcommittee and once suffered from the disease.
 Lawmakers' projects have drawn new attention in the past year because they abetted the misdeeds of former Representative Randy Cunningham, a California Republican who accepted bribes in exchange for earmarking money for military contractors, and the lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who bribed lawmakers to insert earmarks into spending bills. 
 But as lawmakers head home for the fall campaign season, Congress has done little to alter the earmarking process. 
 ''The appetite is undiminished,'' said Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma and a frequent critic of earmarks. 
 Congressional leaders said they were proud of several broader elements of the spending bill related to the war in Iraq. It includes $70 billion as a bridge until the next supplemental spending request. It provides $22.9 billion to replenish and refurbish equipment for the Army and the Marines. And it pays for a 2.2 percent increase in military pay.
 In a shift from previous years, no new items were added -- ''airdropped,'' in the parlance of Capitol Hill -- in the conference held to reconcile the House and Senate versions of the bill. If the conferees had added items, an internal rule passed by the House earlier this month would have required the sponsors to take responsibility publicly.
 That did not stop the conference from adding $2.1 billion to pay for the additional C-17 Globemaster transport planes. Boeing, which makes the planes in Long Beach, Calif., and St. Louis, has lobbied for months to keep the military buying more. The Pentagon asked for a final 8 planes; the House and Senate bills added 4 more; and in closed conference, the leaders of the two appropriations committees decided to add 10, bringing the total to 22. Each costs about $200 million.
 Senator Talent heralded the earmark on Friday with a statement declaring, ''Senate approves Talent's request to keep the C-17 line open'' for ''our highly skilled workers in Missouri.''
