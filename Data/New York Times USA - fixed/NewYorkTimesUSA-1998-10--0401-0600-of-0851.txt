U.S.-Led Agreement Averts Serbia Bombing
The American envoy Richard C. Holbrooke announced an agreement with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia that averted the immediate threat of NATO air strikes and that could lead to a form of autonomy in Kosovo. A1 

President Clinton demanded serious progress toward compliance from Mr. Milosevic within the next four days to avoid air strikes. American officials asserted that they had used NATO successfully to avert a human disaster, do justice to the Kosovar Albanians and increase the Albanians' ability to control their lives. A10
 
The diplomatic career of Mr. Holbrooke remains in the hands of a group of Justice Department lawyers who are trying to determine if he violated Federal ethics rules. The inquiry has sidetracked Mr. Holbrooke's nomination to be the next chief United States representative at the United Nations. A10
 
Violence as Mideast Talks Near
Gunmen believed to be Palestinian militants shot and killed an Israeli and seriously wounded another outside Jerusalem two days before an Israeli-Palestinian summit meeting near Washington. A8

Charge of Spying for Moscow
A former code-breaking analyst at the National Security Agency was charged with spying for Moscow for the last three years of the Soviet Union's existence. The Government charged that from 1988 until 1991 David Sheldon Boone passed top secret documents to a K.G.B. officer and was paid more than $60,000. A5
 
Prodi to Try to Form Coalition
Acting Prime Minister Romano Prodi of Italy said he would try to form a government, four days after he was ousted after narrowly losing a confidence vote. Mr. Prodi will most likely try to form an alliance with a small center-right party to make up for Communist votes that split away last week, causing him to lose the confidence vote. A9
 
U.S. Lags in Panama Cleanup
The United States is balking at cleaning up some of the most hazardous of the jungle terrain surrounding the Panama Canal, ranges used for nearly a century to test explosives and chemical weapons. The United State is supposed to return the land to Panama in a little more than a year. A3

Budget Talks Continue To Avoid a Shutdown
Congressional Republicans and White House officials continued negotiations on a Federal budget as they faced their fourth deadline to avoid a Government shutdown. Sticking points included education, census sampling and contraceptive coverage in Federal health plans. Other issues, like I.M.F. financing, seemed close to resolution. A1
 
The White House reached an understanding with Congressional Republicans on the use of statistical sampling for the 2000 census, but Congressional Democrats were not sure they would go along with it. A18
 
Streamlining Clinton Inquiry
Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are considering folding most of the 15 counts outlined as impeachable offenses against President Clinton into two basic categories: lying under oath and obstruction of justice. A19
 
G.O.P. Pursues an Old Rival
The Republican whip, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, left, has urged the Electronic Industries Alliance to reconsider its hiring of a prominent Democrat, former Representative David McCurdy, as the lobbying group's president.

Fire Sprinkler Heads Recalled
The maker of a fire sprinkler agreed to recall millions of the devices already installed in schools, hotels and other buildings. The sprinkler heads, called Omega and produced by Central Sprinkler of Lansdale, Pa., have failed to activate in at least nine fires in three years and have high failure rates in tests. In March, the Consumer Product Safety Commission filed a lawsuit to force the recall of 10 million Omega heads. A company official said production of the Omega heads ended last month. (AP)

To the Editor:
Chinese employers might be accused justifiably of ageism and sexism (front page, Oct. 13), but are American companies very different? Although they may not be so bold as to stipulate in print what they are after, the outcome is probably often the same. As for middle-aged Chinese women's being responsible for the care of the very young and the very old, are things so different here?

HEADLINE: Kennelly, in Debate, Sees Two States, One Struggling

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Oct. 13

 BODY:
United States Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, who throughout her campaign for Connecticut governor has touched on many issues but never found a theme, tonight unified her concerns about the state's future by asserting that the prosperity trumpeted by Gov. John G. Rowland amounts to only half of "a tale of two states."
Mrs. Kennelly, a Democrat, used the second of four debates to present what amounted to a closing argument for her candidacy, and her staff said she planned to stick to the theme every day through the election on Nov. 3. 
 "In the Connecticut that John Rowland talks about, all is well," she said at the Old State House in Hartford, where she announced her candidacy 13 months ago.
But she said that other residents, particularly those with children, are struggling. "Mr. Rowland doesn't want to talk about that state -- it doesn't fit on a 30-second ad. But more and more people are being pushed into that other Connecticut every day."
Mr. Rowland, 41, who entered the race's homestretch with six times as much cash as Mrs. Kennelly, replied that one of the problems with her campaign was that she had emphasized the negative at a time when polls show most people are happy with the state's direction. He said all residents had benefited from his policies of cutting taxes and encouraging small businesses, which he said would cushion a recession by making the state less dependent on the defense and insurance industries.
"One of my goals as Governor over the next four years is to make sure that everyone enjoys the same quality of life," he said. "We're building up momentum, we're creating excitement, we're putting this state on the map and we're going to continue forward."
Mrs. Kennelly, 62, said her plans included a patients' bill of rights that would allow people to sue health maintenance organizations, and a scholarship plan that would provide a free state education to students who maintain high grades in high school and college. Those plans would improve the lives of people who are forced to work two jobs, find a college education to be out of reach, or have been denied health coverage, she said.
"That's why I'm running for governor: because we shouldn't be two Connecticuts," she said. "We should be one Connecticut."
After last week's debate with Mr. Rowland, which was only the second debate of her 23-year political career, both candidates were more aggressive tonight. Each repeatedly disputed the other's facts.
Sitting on a huge lead in polls, Governor Rowland hung back at the first debate and did not rebut many statements by Mrs. Kennelly that he later confessed had him itching to respond. "During the last debate, I let a few shots slide," he said tonight.
"Mrs. Kennelly has voted for every single major tax increase -- every single major tax increase -- over 17 years," he said. When Mrs. Kennelly tried to interrupt to dispute that statement, Mr. Rowland would not give up any of his time, and cut her off by saying, "It's my minute."

Hurt by Market Swoon, Merrill Lynch to Cut Jobs
Merrill Lynch said it would eliminate about 3,400 jobs, or just more than 5 percent of its global work force. About 2,000 of the staff reductions will be in the United States. The brokerage firm was the first American financial company to announce cutbacks primarily in response to the world's economic troubles, but other Wall Street firms are expected to follow.
Merrill Lynch also reported a loss of $164 million, or 49 cents a share, for the third quarter after taking a $430 million charge to pay for the job cuts. Page A1.
 
Intel Profits Surpass Expectations
Craig R. Barrett, president and chief executive of Intel, reported third-quarter results that surpassed analysts' expectations by 8 cents a share. Mr. Barrett said the results at the leading maker of personal computer chips reflected "growth across nearly all of our geographies and product lines, including strong microprocessor sales." C2. 

Results at Drug Companies Mixed
Two leading drug companies reported mixed results. Third-quarter earnings at Pfizer were 6 cents a share, below Wall Street expectations of 51 cents a share. But Johnson & Johnson met expectations with its earnings of 70 cents a diluted share. C4.
 
Stock prices fell after many companies, including Kodak, reported earnings. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 63.33 points, to 7,938.14, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 2.91 points, to 994.80. The Nasdaq composite index decreased 36.63 points, or 2.37 percent, to 1,509.45. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.09 percent, from 5.12 percent on Friday. C10.
 
G.M. Lost $809 Million in Quarter
General Motors lost $809 million in the third quarter, mainly because of a nearly eight-week-long strike that crippled its production in North America. C5.
 
Ford Motor announced plans for mass production of a new, gearless car transmission to be produced in a joint venture that could also become a new model for labor relations in the auto industry. C5.
 
Revenues at Kodak Disappoint
Shares of Eastman Kodak fell 13.39 percent, to $72.375, even though earnings rose 72 percent and were a penny above analysts' forecasts. Revenues, however, declined 10 percent, and sales overseas dropped by 17 percent. The market reaction reflects investor impatience with any whiff of bad news in the nervous stock market. Market Place. C9.
 
Bill to Increase Work Visas Revived
Congress revived legislation that would increase the number of employment visas for skilled foreign workers. Lawmakers also passed an act to protect technology and other start-up companies from lawsuits in state courts over stock price fluctuations. C3.
 
Bank Bill Passed in Japan
The lower house of the Japanese Parliament passed a bill that would allow the Government to inject $508 billion into banks. C6.
 
Bank Chief Rejects Rate Cut
Despite growing anxiety that global financial problems might soon affect Europe, the president of the new European Central Bank rejected demands for a reduction in interest rates or other forms of "policy activism" to spur economic growth. C6.
 
Meeting to Hammer Out I.M.F. Deal
The Clinton Administration and Congressional Republican leaders met to negotiate a deal to provide the I.M.F. with $18 billion in exchange for new restrictions on its loans. A11.

For Bottom Fishers, Nary a Nibble

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
AS the stock market lurches like an elevator out of control, a growing number of would-be apartment buyers are seeking to take advantage of the current uncertainty by making "take it or leave it" bargain-basement offers on co-ops and condominiums -- and getting nowhere, brokers say.
In the current market, where many apartments, especially the overpriced ones, have already come down a peg or two in price, brokers say that sellers are feeling squeezed by these bottom fishers. 
 "They've already reduced it, and that's where the insult comes," said Richard S. Orenstein, an agent at the Halstead Property Company.
Neil Binder, an owner of Bellmarc Realty, which has seven offices and 250 sales agents, said that his company's statistics show that apartments are now selling for prices that are 7 to 10 percent lower than they were in June. But for some bidders, he added, that isn't enough of a reduction.
"The buyers are acting like the world is about to end and sellers should be happy to get anything for their apartment," Mr. Binder said. "Well, it's no fire sale out there -- not with interest rates the lowest they've been in 30 years."
No one questions the buyer's right to make a low-ball bid, but their problem is that sellers are rejecting the offers. Elizabeth Stribling, the president of Stribling Associates, said that within the last week, she had even seen two bidding wars for co-ops, one that eventually sold for more than $700,000 and another for around $200,000.
Not only that, she added, "but we're seeing that even when deals fall through, negotiations with someone else begin quite quickly." But she agreed that, over all, apartment owners are becoming "more reasonable" and are negotiating more on prices, which she called a "very desirable thing."
Clark P. Halstead, the managing partner in Halstead Property, noted that after the 1987 plunge in stock prices, it took 18 months before Manhattan real estate dipped in price. He argued that there are many differences between then and now and that no one is sure the same kind of decline will occur. "People are remembering that prices did drop," he said, "but they're not remembering how long it took."
Some would-be buyers are "chumming the waters for spectacular fish, but they aren't catching any," Mr. Halstead said, continuing: "They don't realize that we don't have a ticker tape in the real estate office. People are nervous about the securities market, and they impute that shaky feeling to everything from pork bellies to houses."
Like Ms. Stribling, he recited some good news for sellers, like a $7 million house in the East 60's that sold for full price in the space of two weeks.
He also said that of all Manhattan's neighborhoods, those south of 23d Street, particularly Greenwich Village, TriBeCa and SoHo, have been least affected by nerves.
"Sales there continue unabated," he said. "It's very chic, and the people buying there are leaders, not followers."
Frederick W. Peters, the president of Ashforth Warburg Associates, an Upper East Side company that opened a downtown office almost two years ago, said he had not noticed that any one neighborhood was stronger than another.
"It's spotty everywhere," he said. "It depends on who your buyer is. The people who are financially secure, and know that real estate is a long-term choice, aren't anxious about whether they can save a few dollars by waiting a few weeks. The people who are more anxious are people who are heavily in the stock market and regard real estate as more of an investment than a home."
But Mr. Peters knows about offers that go straight for the jugular.
"It happened just yesterday," he said last Friday. "This was a nine-room estate sale on Park Avenue in the 80's. The listing price had just been reduced to $2,695,000, which is not a bad price for 3,200 square feet. Well, first the wife came; then the husband. They faxed over an offer for $1.6 million. It was just plain silly."
About the same time, another bargain-seeker made an offer on a glamorous Central Park West apartment priced at $4.5 million.
The man made what agents call a very aggressive bid: $2.5 million.
"What do you think the seller did?" Mr. Peters said. "He gave a Bronx cheer, and that was the end of it."

HEADLINE: THE POP LIFE;
Crossing Racial Boundaries, Rap Gains Ground

BYLINE: By NEIL STRAUSS 

 BODY:
"Glam rock is back!" proclaimed The Guardian of London recently. And the newspaper wasn't alone in its excitement. For months, record label executives and other culture watchers have been making similar pronouncements, and the evidence to back them up is legion: movies like "Velvet Goldmine," musicals like "Hedwig and the Angry Inch," acts like Marilyn Manson and Kiss, topping the pop charts, the signing of half a dozen 80's glam-metal bands at Columbia Records. Even theoretically it makes sense: pop musicians have been gloating that people are tired of alternative rock and its reaction against pomp and stardom, and that audiences want to be entertained by flashy anthemic rock spectacles.
So why is there only one rock album in the Top 10 this week? The glam revolution seems likely to follow swing, ska and electronica, all interesting sliver genres capable of sending just a few bands into the mainstream. In the meantime, all these musical styles are being steamrolled by a juggernaut genre that, despite deaths, prison sentences and internal feuding, just keeps growing: rap. 
 According to information released yesterday by Soundscan, a company in Hartsdale, N.Y., that monitors music sales, 9 of the top 15 albums on the pop chart are rap (if one includes the album by Lauryn Hill of the Fugees, which mixes rap and rhythm-and-blues). Last week the three top-selling albums in the country were all by rap acts -- Jay-Z, Outkast, A Tribe Called Quest -- followed by Ms. Hill at No. 4.
And in coming weeks, new records by the rapper Ice Cube, various Master P creations, and the Wu-Tang Clan members RZA and Method Man are expected to top the charts. In the meantime, rock stars aren't selling rock albums anymore. Some of the most anticipated albums of the year -- by the Smashing Pumpkins, Hole and Marilyn Manson -- are quickly sliding down the charts after disappointing first-week sales.
"When you look at Seattle, those bands had the momentum to keep rock going, but Kurt Cobain killed himself and Pearl Jam got into political stuff and Soundgarden broke up," said John McClane, a music executive who brought the rap label Death Row to Interscope Records and has made label deals at A&M Records with Ice Cube and the rapper Kurupt. Noting that hip-hop also sustained serious losses, he said the genre still had the wherewithal to recover and move into popular music.
"Rap is an accessible art form," Mr. McClane continued. "In my day, you listened to Aretha Franklin and Jimi Hendrix and you knew you couldn't emulate what they were doing. Now this generation is in awe of things they can do. Kids can emulate rap. And from a marketing point of view, Madison Avenue is using African-Americans to market their products. White kids are getting their beat on what hipness is from black kids again." For the last two years, black popular music has fueled the industry and rap has reigned supreme economically as well as culturally. Nearly three-quarters of rap albums are sold to white fans, according to Soundscan. Before piano, violin or guitar lessons, children are being schooled in hip-hop production: Toy stores have sections full of $10 plastic gadgets that they can use to sample their voices, trigger sound effects or sing along to crude hip-hop beats; in arcades, along with fighting and shooting games, there is a turntable where children can play at being a rap disk jockey.
On the musical front, rap's influence on suburban youth and mainstream music is nothing new. White popular music has been pillaging from black culture since the 1800's, when songwriters streamlined slave songs into popular tunes. Long before Run-D.M.C. and the Beastie Boys brought rap to the suburbs, punk rock musicians gravitated to its countercultural stance.
It is a tradition continued today in events like the Family Values tour organized by the thrash-rock group Korn, which consists of Ice Cube and several white bands, mostly working-class, small-town former heavy metalheads now dabbling in scratching, break dancing, rapping and hip-hop fashion. What seemed to be part of a passing trend, fitting chronologically between heavy metal and alternative rock as a conduit for youthful suburban rebellion, has not faded.
Rap, meanwhile, has increased its hold on popular music. This is partly because its influence has pervaded nearly every musical genre and partly because ever since Vanilla Ice and M. C. Hammer, there has been consumer quality control insuring that the rappers who rise to the top of the charts are also among the best and, in some cases, the most interesting characters in pop music at the moment.
Mark Shimmel, the chief operating officer of LaFace Records in Atlanta, which released the OutKkast album, also credits rap's ascendency to its ability to market through word of mouth.
None of this is by accident. Most of the recent successful black artists -- Puff Daddy, Master P, Jermaine Dupri, Jay-Z and Babyface -- are also entrepreneurs. Most own their labels, plan their marketing and, even in the case of hardcore records, strategize their career for mainstream success. To expand their audiences, Busta Rhymes is recording a version of Black Sabbath's metal classic, "Iron Man," with Ozzy Osbourne, and Puff Daddy has been working with everyone from Jimmy Page to the Foo Fighters. In the face of Top 40 radio's reluctance to play rap songs, Mack 10 recorded a lightweight ballad with Gerald Levert.
"That song was added by stations that have never played any of our records in 13 years," said Bryan Turner, the president of Priority Records, which releases music by Mack 10, Ice Cube and Master P. "It's scientific, almost. Something that comes right from the street has turned into an analyzed strategy on what records you can make that will give you a better chance to get more radio play to give you more sales."
The problem with rock, he said, is that musicians have no control over their work after they turn it in to the record company. "Why aren't there more rockers who own their own music?" he asked. "These rappers are in control of their own destinies."
Though this may seem like a good time to beat the rock-is-dead drum, popular taste is more complex than that. Billboard's chart of the most-played songs on radio is dominated by rock, with no rap songs in the Top 10. The stations that are thriving, which target an older audience than rap does, are actually Top 40 ones, reflecting the singles chart, which is dominated by pop rhythm-and-blues and rock, rather than rap.
Dave Hoeffel, vice president of the Friday Morning Quarterback, a radio trade publication, said radio programmers played less rap for several reasons: most advertisers don't target its audience, the albums don't last long on the charts, and stations tend to avoid genres like metal and rap, which exist "in their own parallel universe."
"The trend is to play the hits," he continued. "Looking at radio ratings, it's tough to ignore that Z-100" -- WHTZ-FM in Manhattan -- "went back to its roots in Top 40 and went through the roof. It's a situation of play the hits, no matter what they are."
The radio audience is passive: listeners are not buying albums by bands heard on the radio to the degree that rap fans will buy albums with good street buzz, which is one reason the phenomenon of one-hit wonders has returned. With a climate like this, some say, rap's dominance on the album charts shows no sign of abating.
"What we're waiting for is the new generation that says, 'Forget all that, I'm making music that I want to make and who cares about radio,' " Mr. Turner said. "That's the next stage in the cycle."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Ford Says Earnings Rose According to Expectations

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Oct. 14

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company announced today that its earnings from continuing operations rose roughly in line with expectations during the third quarter, as cost reductions and record sales of high-profit sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks in the United States offset losses overseas.
The General Motors and Chrysler Corporations released their earnings earlier this week, and the overall results show an American auto industry that still has a strong market at home but that is starting to lose money abroad. All of the Big Three have enormous cash reserves to tide them over during the next recession, with Ford announcing today the biggest bankroll of all, a record $22.91 billion as of Sept. 30. 
 Ford earned $1.00 billion, or 80 cents a share, in the last quarter, a penny above the average prediction of auto analysts, according to First Call. Ford stock dropped after the release of the earnings this morning, but then rallied with the rest of the market, closing at $45.8125, up $1.75.
Last spring Ford spun off its 80 percent stake in Associates First Capital, which had been one of the company's most profitable divisions. During the third quarter of last year, when Associates was still part of the company, Ford earned $1.13 billion, or 91 cents a share.
Ford's overall earnings fell 11 percent from that level during the last three months, but excluding Associates' 1997 results, they rose 10.4 percent for continuing operations.
Today's results marked the 10th consecutive quarter in which Ford has shown an increase from continuing operations -- a rarity in the auto industry, which has traditionally had huge profit swings. John Devine, Ford's chief financial officer, said that the company was "comfortable with" analysts' fourth-quarter estimates of $1.22 a share.
But Mr. Devine also warned that Ford was likely to take three one-time charges in the fourth quarter. Ford expects to write off part or all of its $150 million investment in Kia, the insolvent South Korean auto maker that is now being sold by its creditors in an auction that is likely to wipe out the stakes of Kia's previous owners. Ford is also likely to take a pretax loss of roughly $100 million for putting a transmission factory into a joint venture, as well as a still undetermined loss for a recently announced program to reduce white-collar employment through buyouts and early retirement, Mr. Devine said.
Most of Ford's profits in the third quarter came from its North American automotive operations, which earned $900 million, a 45 percent improvement from a year earlier. Mr. Devine said Ford benefited only slightly from the strike that crippled General Motors for nearly eight weeks this summer.
He said that Ford sold a rich mix of profitable sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks in the third quarter, having stopped production of a half-dozen slow-selling car models.
But Ford lost $273 million in Europe from July through September, nearly double its loss a year earlier. The company incurred high costs to introduce its new Focus small car, which replaces the Ford Escort. Ford also lost $44 million in South America, where it earned $133 million a year earlier.
James M. Irwin, an auto analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said that Ford's difficulties overseas were likely to lessen soon but not disappear. "South America is going to stay weak for some time, while Europe is going to bounce back very nicely with the Focus," he said.
Visteon Automotive Systems, Ford's auto parts subsidiary, had a 31.6 percent earnings increase, with profits climbing to $150 million. Ford Credit, which makes car loans and leases, had a 5 percent increase in profits, to $272 million.
Ford also owns 81 percent of the Hertz Corporation, the nation's largest car rental agency, and Ford's share of Hertz's third-quarter profits was $98 million, up 28 percent.

B ear Stearns Net Falls 60% Amid the Market's Downturn

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
The Bear Stearns Companies became the latest United States brokerage firm to post sharply lower earnings as the sudden reversal in stock and bond markets worldwide cut into the firm's trading and investment banking profits.
Net income for the three months ended on Sept. 30, the first quarter of the firm's 1999 fiscal year, fell 60 percent, to $64.1 million, or 40 cents a diluted share, compared with $161.6 million in the quarter a year earlier. The earnings were slightly below analysts' estimates of 43 cents a share. 
 The earnings report was the latest in what is expected to be a string of bad reports from Wall Street banks and brokerage firms. Analysts have described the turnabout in fortunes of big investment banks as one of the sharpest in history as the long bull market in stocks and bonds screeched to a halt.
Though down significantly, the results for Bear Stearns did not tumble as much as some other Wall Street firms that have reported profits this week. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette said its third-quarter profit fell 79 percent amid $234 million in trading losses. Merrill Lynch & Company, which has a much larger operation than either Donaldson, Lufkin or Bear Stearns, said profit from operations fell 75 percent. Merrill also plans to eliminate 3,400 jobs.
Bear Stearns is the sixth-largest Wall Street firm in terms of capital, but it has a much smaller international business than many of its rivals and does not do as much proprietary trading. It focuses instead on clearing, or processing securities trades. It has the largest such business in the United States.
Officials at the firm said their continued focus on their core client trading and clearing services as well as investment banking meant that they did not suffer the same kinds of losses other firms had, including trading losses in Russia and other emerging markets.
"There are not that many places in our business where you can make money these days," said William J. Montgoris, the firm's chief operating officer. But he said that even during the market plunge in August and September, one of Bear Stearns's main businesses -- arranging trades for clients and collecting the cash for securities sold -- showed better results in the latest quarter than in the last one. That is because clients trade even in down markets, though they are often doing more selling than buying. "Despite the downturn, we had positive revenues in every month," Mr. Montgoris said.
Still, nearly all other areas of the business were weak. Trading revenue fell 50 percent, to $391.5 million. The turmoil in the markets also hurt activity in mergers and acquisition advising and underwriting, sending investment banking revenue down 44 percent, to $121.8 million.
Bear Stearns said it did not expect to lay off any of its 9,400 staff members, though it did not rule out downsizing through attrition if weak markets continued. Mr. Montgoris used as an example the firm's response to the market selloff in 1987, when it shed about 10 percent of its work force over six months by deciding not to fill positions after they were vacated voluntarily.
Guy Moszkowski, a brokerage analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said Bear Stearns was likely to weather the downturn better than some of its rivals. "Bear does not feel that it's cost structure is out of whack and does not have to do a large staff reduction," he said. "And they did pretty well for this environment.
"They manage their risk positions carefully," he added. "Their clearing business is very profitable even when the fixed-income market is doing poorly. We could see them in position to rebound significantly when the markets come back."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Weaker-Than-Expected Retail Sales Push Bond Prices Higher

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices rose for a second day as a report showing weaker-than-expected retail sales suggested the economy was losing steam, reinforcing expectations for another Federal Reserve interest rate cut.
"The economy is going to slow, and the bond market is going to pay attention to that," said Paul Van Kampen, who oversees $1.3 billion of bonds at NCM Capital Management Group, in Durham, N.C. He favors intermediate-term Treasuries, which he said would rally when the Fed lowers rates again. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 30/32, to 107 10/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.03 percent, from 5.09 percent.
Retail sales rose three-tenths of a percent in September, less than the half a percent increase forecast by analysts. Excluding autos, sales rose one-tenth of a percent.
The bond gains follow a four-day plunge last week that increased 30-year bond yields 43-hundredths of a percentage point. That slide was touched off by a 14 percent decline in the dollar against the yen, and selling by hedge funds -- private investment pools for institutions and wealthy individuals -- which unloaded Treasuries to cover losses in other markets, traders said.
"People feel a little more comfortable" that the bulk of the selling by hedge funds is finished, said Dan Busiel, an analyst at Nationsbank CRT Services in Chicago. Even so, he said that "it's a little premature to think that this is over."
Yesterday, for example, BankAmerica said it planned to sell the $20 billion bond portfolio of D. E. Shaw & Company, a hedge fund that it had invested in and lent more than $1 billion. The portfolio includes $10 billion of Treasury securities.
Still, the reasons behind the rally that drove 30-year yields to 31-year lows of 4.72 percent Oct. 5 are intact, investors said. The United States economy is slowing, inflation is tame, and the Fed is likely to cut rates again soon.
In addition, turbulence in other financial markets will probably continue, forcing investors to seek the relative safety of Treasuries. "There is no strong reason to doubt that bonds remain the quality asset class," Michael Derks, the chief bond strategist at Nomura International P.L.C., said.

HEADLINE: U.N. Votes, 157-2, in Referendum to End U.S. Embargo of Cuba

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 14

 BODY:
In a General Assembly vote a record 157 countries today favored an end to the United States economic embargo of Cuba.
Only the United States and Israel objected. Twelve countries abstained. 
 Although the resolution is not binding, it reflected what experts described as "astonishing unanimity" by many of America's allies and friends against the use of sanctions as an instrument of foreign policy.
The vote also illustrates the erosion of support for the United States policy toward Cuba, the experts said.
"As a general principle when a country finds itself totally isolated and has virtually no allies, it should be an occasion for reflection on its policy line," said Jeffrey Laurenti, executive director of Policy Studies at the United Nations Association of the United States, a grass-roots organization in Washington.
Mr. Laurenti echoed the views of other experts when he said support for sanctions diminished dramatically after Congress passed the Helms-Burton Act in 1996, extending sanctions to countries and foreign companies that do business with Cuba, Iran and other nations with which the United States has disputes.
"The United States has a perfect right to prohibit trade by its own nationals or companies with a country it deems a threat to its own security," Mr. Laurenti said in a telephone interview today. "But the extraterritorial nature of such laws has turned a great deal of friends like Canada and the European Union against us."
Last year 143 nations supported the resolution, and the United States, Israel and Uzbekistan opposed it. This year a diplomat from a country friendly to the United States said, "The Cubans did not even have to lead the fight."
The number of those opposing the American position has steadily increased in annual votes for seven years.
The resolution cited the Helms-Burton Act, which many here saw as an attempt to impose American laws on other countries.
But the United States representative, Ambassador A. Peter Burleigh, said that "the Cuban Government's systematic denial of universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms to the people of Cuba" was reason enough to maintain the embargo.
"The United States," Mr. Burleigh added, "believes that economic sanctions are an important foreign policy tool to be used in certain compelling cases."
The Helms-Burton law has stretched the limits of the 35-year-old embargo by allowing United States citizens who were Cuban citizens before Fidel Castro took power in 1959 to sue foreign companies or individuals. The defendants have to be conducting business from property that Cuba confiscated.
The law also denies visas to the United States to shareholders in the companies and their executives, and it caused a severe disagreement with Canada and the 15 nations of the European Union.
"Congress has been sanction happy for some time, and the U.S. has kept these sanctions on Cuba for domestic reasons," an expert with the Council on Foreign Relations, Judith Kipper, said. "Obviously in some cases sanctions don't serve American interests. At this stage they are not helpful in places like Cuba and Iran. We can accomplish a great deal more of what we want in Cuba by opening tourism and trade."
The General Assembly resolution was introduced by Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina of Cuba.

HEADLINE: Residents' Views on City Life Improve, and Giuliani Gets Credit

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH with MARJORIE CONNELLY 

 BODY:
For the first time since Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani won election in 1993, more than half of New York City residents say that life in the city has improved, a New York Times/CBS News Poll has found.
Nearly two-thirds of city residents who were polled earlier this month said they approved of the way that Mr. Giuliani, a Republican who easily won a second term last fall, was handling his job. And 59 percent said that life in New York City had improved in the last four years, up sharply from 39 percent in a poll last fall that asked the same question. 
 But while most respondents said that Mr. Giuliani had succeeded in reducing crime, few could cite other areas he had handled well.
Perhaps most striking, at a time when Mr. Giuliani is striving to raise his national profile, is that only 19 percent of those polled said he should run for President in 2000. Even fewer -- 12 percent -- said he should run for Vice President. The overwhelming majority of New Yorkers, 61 percent, said Mr. Giuliani should not run for the White House.
Gov. George E. Pataki, a fellow Republican who has also expressed interest in higher office, fared even worse on those questions -- 10 percent supporting a run for President, 10 percent behind a run for Vice President but 69 percent saying that he should not run for either office.
Asked to choose between the two men as a Presidential or Vice Presidential candidate, 40 percent of New York City residents said they would select Mr. Giuliani, compared with 39 percent for Mr. Pataki. (The Governor was an easy favorite among statewide respondents, with 47 percent backing him, compared with 33 percent for the Mayor.)
As in past polls, more white respondents had positive opinions of Mr. Giuliani and his job performance than did black respondents. Only 36 percent of black respondents said they approved of how the Mayor was handling his job, compared with 70 percent of whites.
When asked to choose between "tough" and "too abrasive" as a description for the Mayor, most of the black respondents, 61 percent, said Mr. Giuliani was too abrasive. Most whites held the other view, with 54 percent describing him as a tough leader.
The telephone poll of 478 residents of New York City was conducted between Oct. 1 and Oct. 6 as part of a larger, statewide survey. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
Of the black respondents who said they were registered voters, 19 percent held a positive view of Mr. Giuliani, while 68 percent had an unfavorable opinion. By comparison, two-thirds of white voters -- 66 percent -- said they had a favorable opinion of the Mayor, while 18 percent held an unfavorable view.
The poll found that the percentage of city residents who approved of Mr. Giuliani was the same as last fall, when a Times poll that was conducted about three weeks before he was re-elected found that 63 percent liked the way he was handling his job.
In a year when Mr. Giuliani has cracked down on jaywalkers, taxi drivers and sex shop owners, almost half of those polled said that he had concentrated on quality-of-life issues "to avoid dealing with more serious problems." Fifty-eight percent of black respondents said Mr. Giuliani had focused too much on quality-of-life issues, compared with 38 percent of white respondents.
The new poll suggests that New Yorkers especially approve of Mr. Giuliani's handling of crime. Forty-six percent of the respondents offered that reducing crime was the best thing he had done since becoming Mayor, compared with 34 percent last fall. Increasing the size of the police force was the next most frequent response, mentioned by 6 percent.
Asked to credit Mr. Giuliani with something other than reducing crime, almost half were unable to come up with a response. Of those who did, 6 percent said he had cleaned up the streets, 3 percent said he had improved the quality of life, and 3 percent said he had improved the economy.
Asked to name "the worst thing" about Mr. Giuliani, 40 percent said they did not know. Twelve percent said he was "too outspoken," and 5 percent said he had "increased racial tension." One percent answered, "everything."
The poll showed that nearly two-thirds of New Yorkers felt that the police "favor one race over the other." The survey was taken about a month after officers clashed with some of the participants in a black youth rally in Harlem (an incident that 2 percent named as the worst thing that Mr. Giuliani had done since becoming Mayor). But the results were similar to those in the poll taken last October.
In street interviews yesterday, several city residents offered opinions that mirrored the poll's findings. They said that Mr. Giuliani was doing a good job and that crime reduction was his most notable accomplishment. But they also said that he was too abrasive and that he should not seek higher office.
"I think he should be satisfied with what he has accomplished as Mayor," said Thomas Scotto, 70, a retired civil engineer from Staten Island. "If he ran for President, he'd never make it west of Chicago. He'd be a dead duck."
Laura Torres, a respiratory therapist from Brooklyn, praised Mr. Giuliani's handling of crime but said he should be less belligerent.
"The Mayor's done a good job with police and crime, but he needs to be less of a bully," Ms. Torres, 46, said. "It's either his way or no way. He should learn how to negotiate better."

Mexican Business Giant Begins Transition to Sons

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Oct. 14

 BODY:
Carlos Slim Helu, the billionaire Mexican businessman, has handed two of his sons the leadership of Grupo Carso S.A. de C.V., the company where he began the climb that made him the richest man in Latin America.
According to an announcement late Monday, Carlos Slim Domit, 31, the oldest son, will be Grupo Carso's chairman, and his brother Patrick, 29, will occupy a new position equivalent to chief operating officer. The company produces everything from chocolates to fiber optic cable and owns the Mexican chain of 40 Sears stores. 
 Analysts said the elder Mr. Slim, 58, who had cardiac surgery a year ago, was putting the new generation in place in case he should suffer further ailments and also to prepare for the economic storm hanging over many of the emerging markets.
Mr. Slim Domit, however, denied that, saying, "His health had nothing to do with it," and adding: "He is perfectly fine. He did it now because he feels the company is well structured, it runs efficiently and no major unfinished business is hanging over it. He wants to dedicate more of his time to telecommunications."
The senior Mr. Slim will remain as chairman of Carso Global Telecom S.A. and of the nation's phone giant, Telefonos de Mexico, or Telmex, as well of as his financial company Grupo Financiero Inbursa S.A. Mr. Slim named one of his oldest associates, Jaime Chico Pardo, 48, to become the second in command at Carso Global Telecom.
He built his reputation and his fortune -- the family's net worth is estimated by Forbes magazine at $7.2 billion -- through smart purchases of ailing companies, which he turned around with shrewd management. Now he seems to want to explore new areas like the Internet and digital communications.
Unlike most successful Mexican companies these days, which are oriented toward exports, about 80 percent of Grupo Carso's production is for domestic markets. Mr. Slim Domit said the company was not planning major changes.
Analysts said they also expected little change at Telmex, the bellwether Mexican stock, whose American depository receipts are traded in New York, as are several other companies in which the family has held stakes. "Telmex is probably one of the best-positioned companies in Mexico to weather the new crisis," said Simon Flannery of J. P. Morgan Securities. "It has low levels of debt and generates significant amounts of cash."
Under the stern eye of Mr. Slim, his sons have received more than a decade of training to run his companies. The older son has been running the Mexican Sears chain, which his father bought two years ago. Floor-to-ceiling remodeling of several decrepit stores and radical changes to make the company more efficient have begun to attract customers. The younger son has run Nacobre S.A., a mining company.
The generational shift follows a recent pattern in Mexican business. Last year, Emilio Azcarraga Jean, now 30, took control of the vast Grupo Televisa media empire after the death of his father, Emilio Azcarraga Milmo, and Ricardo Salinas Pliego, son of a family of department store owners, who is now 41, is running TV Azteca, the rival television network.

HEADLINE: Budget Deal in Congress to Give Clinton the Full $18 Billion Sought for the I.M.F.

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14

 BODY:
The budget deal being worked out tonight on Capitol Hill provides the full $18 billion requested by the Clinton Administration for the International Monetary Fund, apparently ending a months-long struggle by the Administration to persuade Congress that the money is vital to the fund's efforts to stem a global financial crisis.
Administration officials and Republican Congressional leaders said the deal would require the fund to open many of its deliberations to public scrutiny and to impose new conditions on its loans to foreign governments. 
 The compromise, they said, is expected largely to end the fund's practice of lending money to troubled nations at below-market interest rates. It would also require that most loans be repaid to the I.M.F. within two and a half years; the average payback period now is closer to 10 years.
Republican lawmakers and senior officials at the Treasury Department, which managed the negotiations for the Administration, said they would not discuss other details of the legislative package until the budget deal is formally approved by both houses of Congress. The vote in the House and Senate could come as early as Thursday.
But officials on both sides of the negotiations said that the agreement on I.M.F. financing would not put onerous restrictions on the 182-nation organization as it tries to deal with the financial crisis that has devastated the economies of Russia, South Korea and Southeast Asia and that now threatens the economic stability of the rest of the world.
"We would never have agreed to this if it significantly hindered the ability of the fund to operate," said an Administration official involved in the negotiations.
The $18 billion had been requested by the I.M.F. to replenish reserve accounts depleted by the fund's attempts over the least year to bail out the economies of Russia, South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia.
The fund's leadership had waited anxiously for Congress to approve the money, since other large donor nations had said they would withhold billions of dollars in additional contributions until the United States acted. At the fund's annual meeting here this month, several speakers pointedly questioned Washington's commitment to solving the international crisis so long as Congress refused to approve the I.M.F. payment.
Last month the Senate approved the full $18 billion requested by the Administration. But the money had been blocked by Republican leaders in the House, notably Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Speaker, who said they would not approve additional money for the I.M.F. unless it agreed to the lending restrictions and an end to the secrecy that had long shrouded the fund's loan deliberations.
Republican Congressional leaders -- and more than a few Democrats -- have accused the fund of bungling the economic crisis, possibly even worsening the plight of several developing nations that now teeter on the edge of economic collapse.
The Republicans had sought an end to liberal lending policies by the I.M.F., which, they said, had encouraged some nations to pursue reckless economic policies in the knowledge that low-interest, long-term bailout loans were readily available.
The debate over I.M.F. financing led to an angry rhetorical clash between President Clinton and senior Republicans, with the President last week comparing the I.M.F. to a team of firefighters who were being deprived of water to battle a growing blaze. The House Republican majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, responded this week by comparing the I.M.F.'s managers to "arsonists" who were being denied the gasoline that would permit them to do more damage.
I.M.F. officials said that they had not been formally notified of the exact language in the legislation, but they said they expected that the Treasury Department would not allow the compromise bill to limit the fund's powers to disburse money to nations in crisis, given the severity of the global worries.
Administration official have said in recent days that the fund's management and several of the most prominent donor countries might even welcome some of the reforms imposed under the compromise bill.
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said earlier this week that he did not expect complaints from the leaders of the Group of Seven, or G-7, which together are responsible for nearly half of the financing of the I.M.F. "These are priorities we've worked on with the G-7, and I think we're likely to end with an agreement that everyone can feel good about," he said on CNBC, the cable network.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Operating Income Plunges at BankAmerica

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
The BankAmerica Corporation surprised analysts and investors yesterday by reporting that operating earnings fell 50 percent in the third quarter to $893 million, or 50 cents a share -- well below the 90 cents a share expected by analysts.
The declines reflected charges related to Nationsbank's recently completed merger with BankAmerica, and a larger-than-expected $372 million charge related to an investment in D. E. Shaw & Company, a New York-based hedge fund. 
 In addition to taking the charge, BankAmerica said it would reduce its risk from the fund by purchasing Shaw's entire fixed-income portfolio, which contains about $20 billion of securities -- primarily United States Treasury bonds -- and "related hedge positions." It also includes about $4 billion to $5 billion of Japanese bonds, as well as mortgage-backed and municipal securities.
"We had no idea that this bombshell was coming," said Michael Mayo, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. "The old BankAmerica prereleased earnings indications twice for the third quarter and still didn't include the bad news that came today about hedge funds and mortgage-servicing fees."
Although other financial services companies have also reported losses related to hedge fund exposure, analysts said BankAmerica's problems were unlikely to herald similar bad news from other banks as they report third-quarter earnings.
Investors reacted to the news by pushing the stock of BankAmerica, now the nation's largest domestic bank, down as much as 13 percent. It picked up slightly to close yesterday at $48.0625, down $5.875 a share, an 11 percent decline.
Several Wall Street analysts lowered investment recommendations on the bank yesterday, while others criticized managment for giving little advance indication of the scope of the D. E. Shaw charge, which some considered an unsually large exposure to an outside hedge fund.
The bank also reported a $519 million after-tax charge to cover costs associated with the merger of the San Francisco-based BankAmerica Corporation and the Charlotte, N.C.-based Nationsbank, which was completed on Sept. 30. The new BankAmerica has its headquarters in Charlotte.
After the $372 million Shaw-related charge, BankAmerica said it had $1 billion of exposure to the company, which it said it did not consider to be a hedge fund. Over time the bank will sell the $20 billion of fixed-income securities it is acquiring, and expects that its greatest loss on the portfolio will be about $175 million, a spokesman, Robert Stickler, said.
"This was a fund that traded in spreads," Mr. Stickler said. When Treasury bond yields fell sharply, "it was very damaging to firms that traded on those spreads. These problems developed very late and very rapidly at the end of the quarter. We don't feel we misled analysts."
The company has an additional $400 million in hedge fund exposure, which is substantially collateralized, it said.
But Thomas H. Hanley, a managing director and banking direcor at Warburg Dillon Read, maintained, "These problems were unexpected, poorly communicated and could indicate much deeper issues within the company."
Mr. Hanley, who lowered his investment recommendation on the bank's stock from strong buy to reduce, added, "In our assessment, BankAmerica was very close to this company, so it should have understood its businesses much better."
The old BankAmerica established a strategic alliance with D. E. Shaw in January 1997, to use Shaw strategies for proprietary trading and to provide equity derivatives for sale to customers, Mr. Stickler said.
In reportings its earnings, BankAmerica also said that fee income, in such areas as trading and investment banking, was hurt by the deterioration of overseas economies and the volatility of domestic financial markets. The bank added $500 million to reserves already established for losses related to global and domestic market volatility. But the company's core consumer and commercial banking activities, which are centered in the United States, continued to perform well, it said.
BankAmerica said income in the third quarter was $374 million, or 21 cents a diluted share, down 78.4 percent from $1.73 billion, or 96 cents a diluted share, a year earlier.
Last month, BankAmerica, which recently disclosed large trading losses in Russia, said that it had pretax trading losses around $330 million so far in the third quarter and that it expected its net-interest income in the quarter to be reduced by $65 million, primarily because of "one borrower."
Sally Pope Davis, a senior analyst at Goldman, Sachs, praised BankAmerica for reporting its hedge fund losses. "I think the company tried to take the most conservative view that it could," she said. "Adding $500 million to uncollateralized reserves was a conservative thing to do. Almost all of the surprises this quarter came from" the old BankAmerica, she added. "But this is Nationsbank taking a pretty pro-active role to fix as many things as it can, and clear the deck for future quarters.
Despite the third-quarter problems, BankAmerica's chief financial officer, James Hance, told analysts yesterday that the company had a goal of providing returns of 18 percent to 21 percent on shareholders' equity each year.
Among other banks reporting earnings yesterday, the First Union Corporation said third-quarter operating income rose 35 percent to $1.01 billion, or $1.02 a diluted share, from $748 million, or 78 cents, last year. The earnings were higher than analysts' forecast of 96 cents a share.
After merger and restructuring charges, the bank said it earned $995 million, or $1.01 a share.
"I think it demonstrates the superior risk management skills and diversification of the company," said Sandra J. Flannigan of Merrill Lynch. "They don't have any real hedge fund exposure, and there's minimal exposure to emerging markets."
First Union's stock rose 18.75 cents, to $50.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: COMPANY REPORTS;
Profits at New York Times Co. Rose 18.9% in Third Quarter

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
The New York Times Company reported yesterday that its net income rose 18.9 percent in the third quarter, as cost-control measures helped compensate for a slight weakness in advertising revenue.
For the three-month period that ended Sept. 27, the company earned slightly less than $55 million, or 29 cents a diluted share, compared with $46.3 million, or 24 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier. Revenue totaled $682.7 million, down from $683.6 million. 
 Weakness in advertising revenue has hit newspaper markets around the country, particularly those in high-technology centers like Boston, the home market of The Boston Globe, which is part of The New York Times newspaper group. The world economic turmoil was felt early in high-technology centers, so fewer companies turned to newspapers to advertise their available jobs.
Still, advertising revenue at The New York Times, the company's flagship newspaper, rose 4.62 percent, to $235 million.
The New York newspaper paid 7.9 percent more for newsprint in the quarter, the result of a rise of about 4.5 percent in the average per-ton price as well as increased consumption. That greater consumption of newsprint is a consequence of expanded coverage like the new weekly Circuits section, which specializes in technology news, as well as increased advertising volume in the newspaper as a whole.
But several Wall Street analysts said that newsprint prices are expected to steady or drop. The analysts said that slack demand for newsprint in Asia is creating surplus supplies.
Aside from The Times and The Globe, the company publishes 21 regional newspapers and three magazines, and operates eight network-affiliated television stations and two New York City radio stations.
Shares in the New York Times Company fell 56.25 cents yesterday, to $22.25, and are now down 45 percent from the high of $40.6875 reached July 6.
Douglas Arthur, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said he believed the stock's weakness partly reflected Wall Street's fears about its own financial health. As major brokerage houses lay off hundreds of employees, he said, the expectation is building that advertising -- particularly high-margin classified advertising -- will decline.
The company also said yesterday that John M. O'Brien, its acting chief financial officer since April, had been named the new chief financial officer.
That announcement came at the end of a six-month search for candidates to replace Diane P. Baker, who left the job earlier this year to care for her new son.
Mr. O'Brien, who is 56, began work at The New York Times newspaper in 1960 as a messenger. He has previously served as the chief financial officer of The New York Times newspaper. In a series of other executive posts during the last decade, he has supervised the newspaper's finances, production and electronic publishing efforts.

Globaloney Crisis

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Every economic seer, sage and pundit has an incentive to predict what Jimmy Durante used to call a "catastrostroke."
If disaster comes, you can boast of your prescience to those still around. If, however, the sky does not fall, you need not confess to false alarmism; you say smoothly that tragedy was averted because the world took your warning to heart. 
 That's what we see in panicked assessments of "global economic crisis," or "meltdown in Asia spreading to Brazil," or "financial collapse and hyperinflation in Russia," or last week's Newsweek cover, "The Crash of '99?"
Harvard's Prof. John Kenneth Galbraith declares Japan to have been in a depression for years. Times may be tough in Tokyo, but I always thought that when economists used the word "depression" they meant 25 percent unemployment, bread lines, Okies fleeing the Dust Bowl, etc., none of which has been happening in the world's second-largest economy. Instead, slug it "sluggish."
Global crisis-itis is the palpitation du jour. Because default, dear Brutus, is in our stars, Velikovskian catastrophists will next predict solar-systemic breakdown.
(Time out for the to-be-sure graph.) To be sure, a 30 percent drop in small stocks in the U.S. and a hangdog Hang Seng abroad augur ill for consumer spending. The spectacle of bankers stuffing money blindly into loopy-leveraged hedgehogs calls for fuller disclosure and higher margin requirements. And feared loss of American export sales induces Alan Greenspan to recite John Donne's "No man is an Island. . . ."
But global crisis-itis is no excuse for puffing up the International Monetary Fund into some New World Financial Order -- the newest dream of regulatory globocrats. Nor is today's bailout fever any reason to stop the free flow of capital. If investors cannot take their money out of a country, they won't put it in.
Welcome to Contrarian Corner. Last October, here is where the New- Age, new-paradigm new-economists, gaily waltzing with Goldilocks and Rosie Scenario, were admonished that markets went other ways besides up. This October, the contrarian message is: That pail of cold water in the face can be good for you.
Take the Russian economy. Pojaluista! The I.M.F. is Primakoving the pump with billions that will slip out the back door. But Russians keep dollars in mattresses, not rubles in banks. Disintermediators in babushkas barter goods cash-free. Someday they'll elect a leader who understands capitalism under contract law. Prices of Russia's huge national resources will rise, and private investment will pour in.
Now take the American economy. We're the locomotive that pulls along the world, the great consuming blotter that sops up the products of needy nations. With our full employment and price stability, the misery index has become the ecstasy index. That's why Congress and the President get high poll ratings. The same forecasters who a couple of years ago envisioned deficits "as far as the eye can see" now smell surpluses as far as the nose can sniff.
They're wrong again. One of these years we'll go into recession, and farewell surplus. Although we've successfully amended Joseph's interpretation of Pharaoh's dream -- eight fat years are now followed by two lean years -- we have not repealed the business cycle.
How, then, do we counter the hand-wringing hoo-hah of the crisis-mongers? Because the world depends on America's engine for its locomotion (and because we all much prefer the fat years), we should act now to soften the inexorable slump.
But we're not. Though the Fed has shaved a smidgen off interest rates for stimulus, Clinton fiscal policy is pulling us in the opposite direction -- toward slowdown. Beware the fervor of the convert: Clinton's got such budget religion he doesn't know when to stop praying.
To cushion a downturn and save jobs, we should stimulate now with solid tax reduction. But Republicans, fearful of Clinton sloganeering that the surplus must be "saved," await Election Day to bring the votes to override a veto of tax cuts.
No global catastrostroke hysteria needed. If we want to help our neighbors and ourselves through a rough patch, we should stimulate the growth that lifts the world.

HEADLINE: Indian Wins Nobel Award In Economics

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
Amartya Sen won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science yesterday for work on human rights, poverty and inequality that has changed the way governments deal with famines and for what the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said had "restored an ethical dimension to the discussion of vital economics problems."
Professor Sen, 64, whose given name means "one who deserves immortality" in Bengali, is master of Trinity College in Cambridge, England, and professor emeritus at Harvard University. He was president of the American Economics Association in 1994, still teaches part time at Harvard and is finishing a book on democracy and capitalism that will be published by Knopf next year. 
 Just a decade ago, a member of the economics prize committee of the Swedish Academy confidently predicted that Professor "Sen will never get the prize." His unfashionable concerns with values and his equally unfashionable style (highly influential, but wide-ranging, diffuse, lacking a single killer theorem) seemed out of step with the value-free, specialized approach that the economics profession values so highly.
But times have changed, including inside the secretive Swedish Academy that administers the economics prize. The economics prize was created in 1969 and has grown increasingly controversial within the academy, which is dominated by hard scientists. In a seismic yet unannounced shift three years ago, the academy, reacting to internal criticism over the quality of past and prospective recipients, essentially broadened the economics prize into a social science prize encompassing contributions to political science, psychology and sociology. At the same time, in a sweeping rule change, the academy also purged the prize committee of the generation that had controlled the prize since its inception and demanded that noneconomists be included in the seven-member prize committee.
A scholar who has sometimes been criticized for spreading himself too thin, Professor Sen has always responded by decrying the narrowness of modern economics and by asserting that juggling many balls badly is better than displaying virtuosity with one ball. And his view is the one that seems to be shared by more and more scholars.
Professor Sen's contributions to welfare economics, the basic theory of how societies make choices that are both fair and efficient, have become part of every graduate student's training in economic theory. And his critiques of economic concepts that were once taken for granted are among the most quoted in economics, including his essay "Rational Fools" in which he takes on the classical presumption that people are motivated primarily by self-interest.
But Professor Sen is best known for his work on the causes of famine, on inequality and on the measurement of poverty, work that many believe has saved many lives.
His 1981 book "Poverty and Famine" (Oxford University Press) influenced the way international organizations and governments deal with food crises. He showed that famine was not just a consequence of nature, but also an avoidable economic and political catastrophe. Drought and flood often precede starvation, but declines in food production rarely account for it. Typically, even if many thousands die, there is enough food in the country to go around or enough money to import it.
Disaster strikes, Professor Sen found, when the poorest people can no longer afford to buy food because they lose their jobs or because food prices soar. In the Bengal famine, in which three million perished, India's food supplies were not unusually low. Colonial rulers, immune to democratic pressures, simply stood by.
Partly because of Professor Sen's finding, governments now focus less on direct distribution of food and more on replacing the lost income of the poor, through, for example, public works projects.
Professor Sen's theoretical work on inequality shows that all commonly accepted measures of inequality involve hidden, sometimes surprising value judgments. One of the most dramatic insights to grow out of his research was the devastating consequence of inequality between men and women. Demographers have long been aware that there were fewer women than men in some poor countries, instead of more as in most of the developed world. And economists, including Professor Sen, have documented that girls and women got less food and medical care than men and boys. But nobody had calculated how many more women would have been alive if the ratio of men and women more closely resembled that of other countries. Professor Sen came up with the startling figure of 100 million "missing" women, most of them in India and China, killed, as it were, by discrimination.
 The questions that Professor Sen has asked in the course of his career, listed by the academy in its press announcement and often posed in dense, mathematically demanding treatises, convey the flavor of his work. How can societies make majority decisions without infringing the rights of dissenting minorities? What measures of inequality are meaningful? How can we decide whether poverty is declining or increasing? What causes famines?
The questions go back a long way. As a child, during the Bengal famine of 1943, Professor Sen handed out cigarette tins of rice to starving refugees as they passed his grandfather's house. The grandfather, a scholar and author of a book on Hinduism, engaged the boy in hours of serious discussion on his beliefs about life. As a teen-ager, Professor Sen considered becoming a Buddhist but turned to economics, mathematics and philosophy instead.
Professor Sen was a student at Cambridge in the 1950's under the economist Joan Robinson. She urged him to forget all that "ethics rubbish," but he did the opposite.
"Amartya has thought more deeply than anyone about the nature of the judgments we make about economic welfare," said the Nobel Laureate Kenneth Arrow, a lifelong friend. "What do we mean when we say that some group is better off."
A frequent contributor to The New York Review of Books, Professor Sen has long communicated with an audience beyond his fellow economists and often about his native India -- he keeps his citizenship there despite many years in the United States and Britain.
"Amartya has a cosmopolitan international and broadly conceived vision of India" that defies both Asian and Western stereotypes, said Robert Silvers, co-editor of the Review.
Professor Sen was in New York to attend a memorial service for a friend yesterday and was frightened when he was awakened at his hotel by a 5:30 A.M. phone call (from Stockholm, not home, as it turned out). After being told the good news about the prize, he confessed, he was "very touched." He said that he was especially pleased that the Academy had highlighted the issues of welfare, inequality and poverty in its press release. "I'm very keen to emphasize the importance of these issues," he said.
For all his moral and intellectual concerns, Professor Sen is remarkably down to earth. His wife, Emma Rothschild, an Oxford economic historian who has just completed a book on 19th-century economic thought, talks about his "great big laugh," his fondness for good wine and conversation, and his devotion to his friends and family, including his four children. Professor Sen also happens to be one of the most popular people in the profession, regarded fondly by those from John Kenneth Galbraith to Gary Becker. "He's accessible, he supports the underdog, he sticks up for what he believes," said an old friend, Geoffrey Heal, at Columbia Business School.
A Harvard philosopher, Robert Nozick, who has taught seminars with Professor Sen on everything from social choice theory to the philosophy of evolutionary biology to the so-called mind-body problem, said, "His work transcends the limits of economics and expands its domain."
Phillip Griffiths, the mathematician who is director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where Professor Sen was a member and then a trustee in the late 1980's and early 1990's, said, "To someone outside of the profession like me, Sen appears deeper than other professional economists."
The Economics Nobel Laureate Robert Solow once called Professor Sen the "conscience of our profession."
Last year the winners of the Nobel prize for economics were Robert C. Merton and Myron S. Scholes, financial theorists whose work helped power the explosive growth in financial markets since the 1970's. Last month's near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, the giant hedge fund in which they are partners, rocked financial markets around the world.
Mr. Merton and Mr. Scholes were honored for their work on how to measure the worth of an option.
Professor Sen will receive his prize, which includes a check for 7.6 million kronor (about $964,000) in Stockholm on Dec. 10.

HEADLINE: Volcker Sees Recovery in U.S. Coming SoonerThan Elsewhere

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker said yesterday that he expected United States financial markets to recover more quickly than emerging markets, which will take longer to resolve their problems.
"In the United States, we'll do better," Mr. Volcker said when asked if he expected United States financial markets to overcome their current difficulties stemming from the global financial crisis. 
 He declined to give a time frame for the end of the financing crunch affecting the nation's capital markets, except for Treasury securities.
"For emerging markets, it's a different issue," he added. "The problems are much more serious."
Mr. Volcker made the comments at the annual meeting of the Conference Board, a global consulting and economic research firm.
The keynote address was delivered by the World Bank president, James D. Wolfensohn, Mr. Volcker's former investment firm partner, who warned about the social crisis facing emerging market economies now engulfed in a financial crisis.
"Beyond all these numbers, you need to look at the social consequences," Mr. Wolfensohn said, referring to the financial crisis's ultimate toll on living standards and the environment.
The World Bank president stressed the importance for Japan to restore the health of its banking system and economy, a crucial factor toward Asia's recovery.
The World Bank president also stressed that Russia's problems were as much economic as political, as shown by repeated shifts in economic strategy.
Mr. Wolfensohn also noted the instability in some emerging markets led to a global crisis of confidence that abruptly reversed the tide of investments to developing economies.
"There is a global squeeze going on at the moment," said Mr. Wolfensohn, who said that about $150 billion worth of foreign investments left emerging market economies this year, compared with inflows of $300 billion to those same economies before the crisis started last year.
Mr. Wolfensohn said the reversal of that trend could not be solely made up for by capital injections from international organizations and would result in a global economic slowdown.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Economists raise questions about educational priorities.

BYLINE: By Michael M. Weinstein 

 BODY:
President Clinton has fought hard this week, in the final stage of budget negotiations, to protect his proposal to spend $1 billion as the first step in hiring 100,000 additional teachers to reduce class size in early grades. Mr. Clinton linked his proposal to the grand ambition of preparing the economy for the 21st century.
But critics of the plan point to research that casts doubt on the Administration's predictions of its likely impact. According to this line of argument, this is not the first time that the Administration has inflated the value of training and education initiatives. If the critics are right, the Administration's lobbying could channel money into the wrong places, starving quiet programs that might work better. 
 Prof. Alan Krueger of Princeton University, who served as chief economist at the Labor Department under Mr. Clinton, provides some of the research results that the Administration uses to bolster its case for smaller class size. He cites Tennessee, the only state to run a carefully controlled experiment, begun in 1986, to reduce class size in early grades. Mr. Krueger estimates that the program lifted scores on standardized tests by about 5 percentile points -- students who would score better than 50 percent of their peers if placed in classes of 22 would score better than 55 percent if placed in classes of 15.
But Mr. Krueger says the Tennessee results hardly settle the issue. He notes the higher test scores occurred by the end of the first year. Are smaller classes useless thereafter? Would class size of 18 -- the President's plan -- work as well?
Prof. Lisa Lynch of Tufts University, who also served as chief economist of the Labor Department, wonders whether the Tennessee program worked because it was small, and did not force Tennessee to dilute the quality of its teaching staff. Would a national program pose at least a temporary problem of finding qualified teachers? And would parents, Ms. Lynch asks, "prefer their children in classrooms of 25 or so students with a crackerjack teacher or in classrooms of 15 with a mediocre instructor?"
Here's an odd couple. Mr. Krueger argues that "the view that American schools perform poorly and that more public money will not help is contradicted by the data." Prof. Eric Hanushek of the University of Rochester publishes one study after another arguing that additional spending on schools wastes taxpayer money. Yet they jointly propose that Congress should resolve the many unanswered questions by running careful demonstration projects to figure out whether a national program to cut class size can work.
Some economists raise similar questions about other educational priorities of the Administration. It has already pushed tax credits for college tuition into law even though many economists predict they will do little good. Prof. James Heckman of the University of Chicago estimates that more than 90 percent of the cost of these credits will go to students who would have attended college anyway, missing the goal of lifting workers' skills.
In fact, colleges may try to capture some of the tax savings by cutting financial aid offers to families eligible for the new credit. Besides, Mr. Heckman argues, tuition is less of a barrier to college enrollment than Mr. Clinton seems prepared to admit. About half the nation's college students are enrolled in relatively inexpensive community colleges. Students in four-year public universities are already heavily subsidized, paying only about 20 percent of the cost of their education.
Some economic studies make a solid case for underwriting college enrollment by low-income students. The payoff for society can be huge. But, many economists say, the best way to achieve that goal is to expand Pell grants, which provide a low-cost way to increase enrollment because they, unlike a tax credit, go only to low-income families.
As for subsidies for the training of workers, many economists also agree with Mr. Heckman when he warns: "There is no such thing as cheap training; raising earnings of low-wage workers is extremely expensive." Indeed, he estimates that it would take almost $2 trillion to train high school dropouts and graduates to close the earnings gap that opened between them and college graduates over the last 20 years. His point is that politicians should tone down their promises.
But his larger point is that there are Government programs that do work. "Early intervention -- programs that focus on preschool children and students in early elementary school grades -- have been remarkably successful," he said. Programs in North Carolina, New York, Texas, Wisconsin, Michigan and several other states that provide full-time year-round classes, summer school, weekly home visits, mentoring and individual counseling have increased graduation rates by 20 percent or more and reduced criminal activity by a similar amount.
Early intervention can work, Mr. Heckman says, because it focuses on long-term factors that truly matter -- the influence of a child's family and environment on education expectations and ambitions -- rather than short-term factors, like tuition charges, which matter less than politicians suppose.
Education is an issue important to voters. But Mr. Clinton's critics say his proposals are, at best, useful ideas worthy of some space in the budget, but are hardly the pillar of an education agenda. At worst they may amount to a splashy waste that robs quiet, more useful initiatives of desperately needed money.

HEADLINE: Vallone Assails Debt Under Pataki and Offers Reduction Plan

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
Seeking to revitalize his gubernatorial campaign, Peter F. Vallone criticized Gov. George E. Pataki yesterday over "borrow and spend policies" and his failure to contain New York State's debt, and he proposed several measures, including a two-year moratorium on some new debts, to help remedy the problem.
"George Pataki proved that he is good at borrowing money," Mr. Vallone said in a speech before the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit budget monitor financed by business interests. "He proved that he is good at spending money. He is even good at raising money for his campaign. 
 "But while he is busy laughing all the way to the bank, the experts and credit rating agencies are shaking their heads in disbelief over what can only be described as economics of the absurd."
The state's debt was $27 billion when Mr. Pataki took office four years ago and is projected to reach $41 billion in the next five years.
Mr. Vallone said that if elected, he would impose a two-year moratorium on new debt to pay for voter-approved bond measures, and he would require the state's authorities -- quasi-governmental entities, like the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which are controlled by the Governor -- to finance 30 percent of their spending with cash on hand.
"New York State is facing a fiscal crisis much larger than the one New York City paid for in the 1970's," said Mr. Vallone, the Democratic Speaker of the New York City Council. "It took a Democrat in the White House to get our nation's fiscal house in order; it will take a Democrat in the State House to restore New York's."
Mr. Pataki's campaign spokesman, Michael Marr, dismissed Mr. Vallone's proposals yesterday. "Peter Vallone's performance today was, like the rest of his campaign, beyond embarrassing," he said, accusing the Speaker of being fiscally irresponsible, himself."
Asked to respond to the specifics of Mr. Vallone's proposals, Mr. Marr said, "It's rather difficult to give a substantive response to a proposal which is devoid of substance."
Mr. Vallone's speech was longer on criticism of Mr. Pataki than it was on specifics about his proposals, and economists said that while he had taken on an important subject, his ideas were not guaranteed to reduce the debt. It is also not clear how many of his proposals he would be able to put into effect without the approval of the Legislature.
In trying to stir up some excitement by proposing new fiscal policy before the budget group, Mr. Vallone was following a previously trodden path. Four years ago, then-candidate George Pataki used an address before the same group to lay out a somewhat more exciting campaign proposal: one of the largest personal-income tax cuts in state history.
Mr. Vallone criticized those tax cuts yesterday as disproportionately favoring wealthy New Yorkers, and said that the state should have used the record surpluses of the last two years to retire its debt.
Mr. Vallone has raised the issue of debt reform many times in the past, but his aides conceded that the latest occasion was an attempt to capitalize on the political advertisements of B. Thomas Golisano, the Independence Party candidate for governor, who is putting millions of his own money into the race. Most of Mr. Golisano's ads have accused Mr. Pataki, a Republican, of fiscal irresponsibility and have stressed the importance of debt reduction.
Much as Mr. Pataki did in his 1994 campaign, Mr. Vallone laid out how he would tame an unruly budget process. He said that if the Governor and Legislature could not agree on an estimate of how much revenue the state has to budget -- a contentious negotiation that typically delays the budgeting -- he would shift the responsibility for setting the revenue forecast to the State Comptroller, who is considered to be more neutral.
He also said that if there were no state budget by April 1, he would require the Legislature to stay in session around the clock until a balanced budget was approved.
The Governor can call the Legislature back into session, but it is not clear whether he has the legal authority to force the legislators to work around the clock.
Mr. Vallone's proposed two-year moratorium would cover all new general obligation debt.
"He's getting at an important issue," said Frank J. Mauro, the executive director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a research group in Albany financed by foundations and labor unions. "If we had done this over the past two years, we would have been better prepared for a recession."
The amount of general obligation debt the state is carrying, however, is fairly small: out of the current budget of $4.42 billion, general-obligation expenses account for only $492 million, or 11.1 percent.
Many financial analysts say the real problem, constituting some 80 percent of the debt, is so-called back-door borrowing by the state through its public authorities. Those agencies owed $71 billion when the Governor took office, but $85 billion today.
To address that, Mr. Vallone said he would require each authority's capital plan to include a "pay as you go" minimum of 30 percent cash.
Financial analysts praised the sentiment of his proposal, but said it was unclear how it would work.

White House and Congress Near Accord on I.M.F.
A tentative budget deal being worked out by Administration officials and Republican Congressional leaders would provide the full $18 billion requested by the White House for the International Monetary Fund. A16 

Skepticism in Kosovo
Many ethnic Albanians in Kosovo are not optimistic that the agreement between President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia and the American envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke, will achieve even the West's limited objectives. Two commanders of the ethnic Albanian rebel movement were often disparaging of the agreement as they reviewed it. A6
 
President Milosevic shut down two newspapers that were accused of "fomenting defeatism, panic, and fear," and he renewed a decree against the freedom of the press. The actions against what remains of the independent news media in Yugoslavia were a continuation of the censorship and shutdowns that started nearly two weeks ago. Those actions came when NATO threatened air strikes because of the crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. A6
 
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a collective of 54 nations, including the United States, has been handed what is by far its largest and thorniest task: monitoring the pledges by President Milosevic to end his violent crackdown in Kosovo. A6
 
A Declaration in Germany
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroder's Social Democrats and their junior partner, the Greens, declared Germany "a country of immigrants" and reached an agreement to promote the integration of immigrants by modernizing the nation's 85-year-old citizenship law. A5
 
Exiled Nigerian Writer Returns
Wole Soyinka, Nigeria's exiled Nobel laureate in literature, returned home nearly four years after fleeing the military dictatorship he vigorously opposed. As Nigeria's most prominent exile, Mr. Soyinka's return is an important expression of confidence in the promise by the country's military ruler, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, to restore democracy in the West African country. A13

U.N. Vote to End Cuba Embargo
A record 157 countries, voting in the United Nations General Assembly, favored an end to the United States economic embargo of Cuba. Although the resolution is not binding, experts said it reflected a striking unanimity by many of America's allies and friends against the use of sanctions as an instrument of foreign policy and illustrated the erosion of support for United States policy toward Cuba.

HEADLINE: CONGRESS'S RATING CONTINUES TO SLIP IN INQUIRY'S WAKE

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL with JANET ELDER 

 BODY:
With the midterm elections less than three weeks away, support for the Republican-controlled Congress has eroded significantly in the aftermath of the House vote to open a formal impeachment inquiry into President Clinton, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
The 105th Congress is now widely perceived as having invested too much political capital in impeachment and having accomplished little on a broad array of issues of importance to voters, from protecting Social Security to improving managed health care. 
 Approval of Congress has dropped to 43 percent from a high of 56 percent in September as the House has been consumed by the charges leveled against the President by the independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr. Forty-eight percent of the public now disapproves of the job that Congress is doing.
Nearly half of all voters said this Congress had accomplished less than a typical Congress. Most Americans could not name one accomplishment of this Congress this year. Of the minority who could cite something Congress had done, most mentioned the impeachment issue. The poll was conducted before a budget agreement appeared within reach last night.
Mr. Clinton's support, by contrast, remains as strong as it has ever been in his Presidency, with 63 percent of the public approving of how he is doing his job. On foreign policy, 60 percent approve of his Presidency, and 70 percent approve of his stewardship of the economy.
While no national survey can measure what will happen in individual Congressional districts, the latest poll suggests that Democrats may not be facing the rout in the mid-term elections that they were fearing just a month ago. Yet the polling also shows that, as many strategists have predicted, the election will swing on which group of voters proves the most motivated to come to the polls.
Looking at registered voters, the survey found that if turnout is similar to the last midterm election in 1994, the two parties are in a dead heat, a far better position for Democrats than they could have imagined just a few weeks ago.
But if, as many political strategists expect this year, November proves to be a low-turnout election, drawing to the polls only the most devoted voters, then Republicans do slightly better, favored 48 percent over 44 percent for the Democrats. Registered voters are split on whether their own member of Congress deserves re-election.
What is clear is that the political landscape is unsettled. In contrast to past months of sustained optimism, Americans are now divided on whether the nation is moving in the right direction.
In another sign of trouble for Republicans, Mr. Clinton was widely perceived as trying harder than the Congressional majority to find an acceptable compromise in the budget standoff that has dominated the closing days of this Congress. Fifty-three percent of the public said the Republicans in Congress were not trying to find a solution in the negotiations, while 58 percent credited Mr. Clinton with trying to find a way out of the impasse.
Those are almost the same perceptions that the public had during the fierce budget struggle of 1995, which led to the Government shutdown, although at that point Congress was held in far lower esteem. In December 1995, during the height of the fiscal showdown between the President and Congress, 64 percent of the public disapproved of how Congress was doing its job.
Still, conservative anger at Mr. Clinton's behavior helps explain why the Republicans chose to press ahead with authorizing an impeachment inquiry before the election to energize their core supporters. While 75 percent of the American public thinks that Mr. Starr's investigation was not worth the time and money, 55 percent of Americans who describe themselves as conservative Republicans say the investigation was worthwhile.
Republicans have to take care that they do not set off a backlash that energizes the Democratic base vote as well as the conservative one. The survey shows that should there be a high turnout election, 42 percent of those voting say they would favor a Republican candidate and 47 percent a Democrat.
It may well be that the Clinton scandal has far less of an effect on the election than anyone anticipates. Sixty-five percent of registered voters say the scandal will have no effect on which candidate they support in House elections.
Still, there is a longer-term risk for Republicans that they could damage their credibility as they move through the impeachment process over the next months.
Although most Americans now believe that Mr. Clinton probably committed perjury before a grand jury investigating his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, there is little public support for impeachment.
Nearly 7 in 10 Americans see the impeachment inquiry as political rather than an investigation into serious crimes. And a majority of Americans say Republicans pushed through the investigation of Mr. Clinton to damage him and the Democrats, not because they think the charges are serious enough to warrant further investigation.
There are many indications that Americans would like the scandal to go away. More than a majority of Americans think it is preventing the President and Congress from doing work that needs to be done.
Republicans, Democrats and independents alike expressed profound discontent with the focus on the Lewinsky matter, and several people in follow-up interviews pointed to the budget standoff as a sign of partisanship and disarray in Washington. The nationwide telephone poll of 926 adults was conducted on Monday and Tuesday and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Pat Hobbs, a retired secretary in Sonoma, Calif., who is an independent, said: "I think they're all too mixed up with the scandal in Washington and they're not doing anything else. They should be working on things that really concern the country like the economy, education, crime, Social Security, Medicare reform, you name it." She said she had not yet decided whom she would support in her local House race.
Fred Taylor, a 58-year-old minister from Plant City, Fla., who is a Republican, was frustrated as well.
"We're facing another Government shutdown," Mr. Taylor said, "and we're playing politics again. We spent a lot of time getting Clinton cornered and it really should have been a side issue for some committee instead of taking it up with the whole Congress. They need to look more into domestic issues like the minimum wage and how our kids are going to make a living, as well as with Bosnia and the global economic situation."
Mr. Taylor said he would vote for the Republican House candidate, but portrayed his vote as a vote for change. "They probably all need to be run out," he said.
Gretchen Nielsen, a Democrat in Tucson, Ariz., vowed that she was going out this Election Day and voting "for every Democrat I can find."
"I feel like Congress has been trying to shoot down everything that Clinton has been trying to do," said Ms. Nielsen, a 66-year-old writer. "I think Congress has a personal vendetta against Clinton in more ways than just the Starr report. They've killed things like campaign financing and the minimum wage, things that are really important."
And Mike Stivila, 53, an unemployed food service salesman from Colts Neck, N.J., longed for the sense of direction the Republicans had when they swept into control of Congress on the Contract With America. Mr. Stivila described that agenda "as the first time a Congressional body actually laid out what they were going to do and the time it would take to accomplish it."
Mr. Stivila, an independent, said he was not a supporter of Mr. Clinton. "What he did was reprehensible," he said, "but impeachment would throw the whole country into additional chaos. There are a lot of things that Congress should be addressing. We don't have a budget agreement. If they'd spend less time politicking, they'd be able to concentrate more on what the country needs."
Indeed, 47 percent of voters said this Congress had accomplished less than a Congress typically does across a two-year period. Only 28 percent said the 105th Congress had accomplished more than past ones.
Asked about specific issues, majorities of Americans said Congress had not made progress on making sure Social Security and Medicare were preserved for future generations, on significantly changing the way political campaigns raise and spend money, or on protecting the rights of patients.
But in one bright spot for Congress, a majority said it had made progress on significantly improving the nation's economy.
When Americans were asked to name something notable that Congress had done in the past year, 16 percent mentioned the impeachment inquiry. Another 16 percent said nothing, 56 percent did not know and 12 percent mentioned other issues.
Public approval of Congress continued to slide from the high of 56 percent in September. In the last New York Times/CBS News Poll in late September, Congress had an approval rating of 48 percent. Now, after the House vote to open an impeachment inquiry, it is down to 43 percent. But that is still good for Congress.
In November 1994, just before the last midterm election, when Republicans took control of Congress for the first time in 40 years, only 20 percent of Americans approved of the way Congress was doing its job. A year later there was a sharp backlash against the Republican Congress because of its budget confrontation with the President. With Americans holding Congress responsible for a shutdown of the Government, approval of Congress fell to 26 percent.
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted on Monday and Tuesday with 926 adults throughout the United States. Of these, 782 said they were registered to vote.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger. For example, for likely voters in low turnout election, it is plus or minus five percentage points. Likely voters were defined by a combination of past voting behavior, expressed intention to vote this year and attention paid to the campaign.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in question wording or the order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.

LSI LOGIC SETS LAYOFFS AND $326 MILLION CHARGE

BYLINE: Reuters 

 BODY:
Hurt by the global slowdown in semiconductor sales, the LSI Logic Corporation, a computer chip maker, said yesterday that it would lay off around 1,200 employees, or 17 percent of its work force, and close several plants. As a result of the revamping, the company, based in Milpitas, Calif., said it would take a third-quarter charge of $326 million, which left it with a quarterly loss of $282.8 million, compared with net income of $44.3 million a year earlier. LSI will close its wafer-making plant in Tsukuba, Japan; a test plant in Colorado Springs, and an assembly plant in Fort Collins, Colo. LSI stock fell 25 cents, to $11.875.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Agrees on Scaled-Back Tax Package

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14

 BODY:
Their hopes for a big tax cut this year having been blocked by President Clinton and Congressional Democrats, Republican leaders tentatively agreed tonight on a sharply scaled-back package that kept alive several politically popular tax breaks.
After several days in which squabbling among Republicans endangered efforts to pass any tax bill this year, House and Senate negotiators compromised as Congress raced to finish work on the budget and go home to campaign. 
 The package would extend an existing credit for corporate research and development, extend tax breaks for employers who hired welfare recipients and other unemployed people and provide relief for farmers hit hard by falling commodity prices.
The package would also speed an existing plan to allow self-employed people to deduct all of their health insurance premiums.
The package would cost about $5 billion over five years and $9.2 billion over 10 years. But the changes would be paid for by closing loopholes and extending or increasing other taxes.
Congressional aides said the deal must still be approved by Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Mr. Roth was still objecting tonight to several details of the package, especially a provision sought by a single Republican Senator, Phil Gramm of Texas, who has threatened to hold up the bill if he did not get what he wanted.
Mr. Gramm was seeking to include a provision, already approved by the House, that would allow Texas to forgive payroll taxes incurred by students enrolled at public universities, a right already enjoyed by most other states.
The bill was little more than a mop-up exercise for Republicans, who had seen this year, the first since 1969 in which the Federal government has run a budget surplus, as their best opportunity in decades to enact a sweeping tax cut.
But at every turn, they found themselves boxed in by Mr. Clinton, who in his State of the Union Message last January laid out a politically powerful dictum: leave the surplus untouched until Congress and the Administration settle on a plan to shore up the Social Security system, which will run short of money in coming decades as the baby boom generation retires.
Fearful of being portrayed by Democrats as putting tax cuts ahead of retirement security, Republicans were forced to backtrack on their tax-cut plans all year long. The most avid tax cutters in both the House and Senate argued that projected surpluses were so huge -- $1.55 trillion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office -- that there was plenty of money to deal with Social Security and have a tax cut.
They advocated tax reductions worth hundreds of billions of dollars, to be financed almost entirely out of the surplus. But moderate Republicans, especially in the Senate, balked. Even after the House lowered its sights and passed an $80 billion, five-year tax cut last month, the Senate refused to take up the measure, effectively killing it.
The package agreed on tonight does little more than keep expiring tax provisions alive for a few more months. Under a bill passed by the House several days ago, most of the provisions would have been extended until the end of next year; the latest compromise would shorten the extensions for several months.
The deal would also make it easier for middle-income people subject to the alternative minimum tax to claim the full benefit of the child credit and a credit for college tuition.
Separately, budget negotiators working on an emergency farm-relief package agreed to include a provision sought by Senator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa, that would let farmers put tax-deductible deposits of up to 20 percent of their income into special savings accounts. The provision is intended to allow farmers to save money in good years as a buffer for bad years.

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The International Paper Company will close fiberboard plants in South Carolina and North Carolina and dismiss 336 workers after the company failed to find buyers for the sites. The layoffs come on top of 1,500 job cuts that were announced on Tuesday. International Paper said yesterday that it would shutter a plant in Spring Hope, N.C., cutting 191 jobs, and a plant in Sellers, S.C., eliminating 145. Both make medium-density fiberboard, used in countertops and cabinets. The company put the fiberboard plants up for sale in August 1997. In addition, the company plans to cut 50 jobs from its chemical unit, Arizona Chemical. Shares of International Paper, based in Purchase, N.Y., fell $1.25 a share, to $44.8125.

HEADLINE: Final Details On the Budget Taking Shape

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14

 BODY:
Congressional Republicans and White House officials appeared near a budget agreement tonight, providing substantial new aid to schools and farmers in a total budget package of $1.7 trillion.
While last-minute details were being hammered out, negotiators appeared to agree on $6 billion in farm aid, more than $1 billion for new teachers and to provide new money for the International Monetary Fund. 
 With the Congressional elections only 20 days away, Republicans can argue that they now have in hand solid accomplishments to take to the voters. Democrats have been lambasting the Republicans for focusing only on the possible impeachment of President Clinton, repeatedly deriding them as a do-nothing Congress.
For Mr. Clinton, the political gains could be greater. By publicly highlighting education issues in the last week, he changed the subject from the Lewinsky scandal to an issue of primary importance to the voters. The apparent tilt of a final accord demonstrated his resurgent power to influence events on Capitol Hill.
At least a handful of areas remained in dispute late tonight. Erskine B. Bowles, President Clinton's chief of staff, said the two sides had failed to resolve a number of environmental issues, how to conduct the 2000 census and two measures regarding contraceptives.
As the bargainers paused for a late dinner break, with plans to reconvene at midnight, Speaker Newt Gingrich told reporters: "All the big things are done." He said there were a few "very, very narrow issues."
In highlighting education, Mr. Clinton sought a down payment of $1.1 billion to recruit and hire 100,000 teachers across the country to reduce the average class size to 18 students.
The tentative budget provides that money. It reflects Republican demands that the money be controlled by local school districts, but it allows them to spend it only on teachers, including special education teachers, and not on books or computers or other materials or activities.
The Republicans blocked a second Clinton initiative that would have provided billions of dollars in bonds for the reconstruction of dilapidated school buildings. Republicans also blocked the President's proposal for the national testing of students.
There were hints that while the leaders may have reached a tentative agreement on numerous items, the rank-and-file Republicans and Democrats might not be so quick to go along.
Conservative Republicans said they had word that they had lost on the contraceptive issues, which emerged today as one of the stumbling blocks to a final accord.
Conservatives were also concerned that the conditions imposed on the International Monetary Fund in exchange for the new money sought by the President were inadequate. The conditions are aimed at getting the I.M.F. to reduce the risk of its loans.
The conservatives, in addition, were worried that the President was seeking too much in so-called emergency spending that was not provided for by offsetting cuts in other domestic programs.
Several aides to Republicans said they believed that their side had been so short-changed in the tentative agreement that the members might defect and not vote to pass the final bill. This would force Republican leaders to search for votes among Democrats.
As negotiators paused in their bargaining, both sides said they would be shopping the tentative agreement among their members to see if there were enough votes to pass a final omnibus bill by Friday night.
"Everyone is going to take a breather and talk to their respective groups," Representative John Boehner of Ohio, a Republican leader, said tonight. "It's been a good day but not as good as we'd hoped."
Congress and the White House did agree today to extend their deadline and provide temporary financing of the Government through Friday night. This was the fourth deadline that they have missed since the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year.
With each passing deadline, the amount of money in the final omnibus package has expanded as members of Congress and the Administration try to slip in money for their favorite causes.
"The price tag tends to go up with the passage of time," said Representative Bob Livingston, the Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Asked if he meant the political price tag, he replied, "No, the actual price tag -- the cost of the bill."
But there did appear to be a political cost as well. Members on both sides of the aisle said the Republican leaders were calculating that it was to their political advantage to cede to the President on numerous items in exchange for a resolution to the dragged-out budget negotiations.
"People out there are beginning to get disgusted with all of us," said Representative John Porter, an Illinois Republican.
Representative David McIntosh, an Indiana Republican and leader of a band of House conservatives, said that many conservatives would not support the bill, based on early reports of the tentative agreement.
He said his earlier conciliatory comments about accepting a final package were based on an expected even split with the White House that did not seem to be materializing.
"Our leader, Tom DeLay, told us in conference this morning that we couldn't use the word 'cave,' " Mr. McIntosh said. "So, our leadership has 'bowed' to the President in most of they key issues. It is not a Republican bill, and our leadership shouldn't try to sell it as such. This is something you'd expect Lyndon Johnson and the Great Society Democrats to pass."
Republican leaders boasted about the tentative package tonight and began recasting themselves as "the surplus Congress," as opposed to the "do-nothing Congress" that Democrats had branded on them.
Mr. Gingrich said Republicans had won a crucial political battle on the census by postponing a decision for six months but that he was disappointed that the final package did not contain any serious tax cuts. The few issues still outstanding, he said, involved the regulation of pornography on the Internet, some extensions of minor tax credits and a battle on behalf of businesses to delay new rules on workplace ergonomics.
Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the Republican majority leader, hailed the agreement on the International Monetary Fund, even as conservatives, whom he had led in opposing new money for the fund, said it was inadequate. "Every time they sit down and make a decision, they will make it knowing that they can't keep it secret," Mr. Armey said of one of the conditions designed to end the fund's closed-book proceedings. "The windows are open, the sun's shining in."

Unemployment Rate Gets Closer to Nation's

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
New Jersey's unemployment rate inched closer to the nation's in September, when the state rate held at 4.8 percent compared with a slight rise nationwide, to 4.6 percent from 4.5 percent, the Federal Department of Labor reported yesterday.
The figures reflect the reliance among American manufacturers outside of New Jersey on exports to Asia, where faltering economies have dampened demand, said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. 
 The state's Department of Labor reported a one-month gain of 7,400 jobs for September.

HEADLINE: Schools Are Talk of California, But Not of the Candidates There

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 14

 BODY:
Throughout this election year, every public opinion poll in California has ranked education as the No. 1 concern among voters in a state whose once-golden public schools have slipped badly.
Two-thirds of likely voters in this famously tax-averse terrain now say they favor a record $9.2 billion bond measure on next month's ballot to repair and replace the state's crumbling schools. 
 That public focus mirrors national trends, and yet both major party candidates for governor seem to spend most of their time talking about everything but education.
Lieut. Gov. Gray Davis, the Democrat, and Attorney General Dan Lungren, the Republican, debate each other's decade-old legislative voting records, character and stands on abortion, gun control and Bill Clinton but hardly touch what politicians had long predicted would be the race's central issue.
"They've both run the standard pictures of them hanging around students in a classroom, but they've really shied away from specifics," said Mark Baldassare, director of a recent survey by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California.
Nearly a third of the residents questioned in the survey cited education as the issue they most wanted candidates to address, while perennial favorites like crime, the economy and taxes all rated in the single digits.
"There's a lot of words about need for improvement but not a lot of details," Mr. Baldassare said. "I think this is one of the key reasons why this race has just been in the doldrums for months."
In fact, pure politics helps explain the relative silence. For months, as Mr. Davis has held a consistent lead over Mr. Lungren to succeed Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican who is barred from seeking a third term, both candidates have run cautious campaigns aimed at the middle. Neither has been eager to wade into the potentially controversial waters of education overhaul -- or talk much about its cost.
Even today, at a news conference in Pasadena with Senator Dianne Feinstein, called to discuss education, Mr. Davis spent the first few minutes angrily accusing Mr. Lungren of failing to enforce the state's ban on assault weapons. Then he spoke blandly of his "high expectation approach" for raising standards, ending "social promotion" and auditing the state lottery to make sure its proceeds are spent on education as is mandated.
For his part, in his television commercials, Mr. Lungren endorses "school choice for parents," without explicitly saying that he favors vouchers -- government credits that parents could apply to private or parochial school tuition, an idea that voters decisively rejected in a 1993 ballot measure but that appears to be gaining support.
"Gray Davis is really trying not to say anything that's going to offend the teacher's union and the education establishment, which deliver hundreds of thousands of votes and big campaign contributions," said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley and co-director of Policy Analysis for Education, a nonpartisan group that studies school reform.
"On the other hand," Professor Fuller said, "Dan Lungren is trying to appeal to his party's conservative base, and he does that by backing vouchers. But that's a double-edged sword. He may pick up some suburban votes and some urban votes from middle-class Latino parents, but I don't think it's going to help him with the ever-present soccer moms, for whom vouchers are a worrisome word."
The need for change is clear enough. Under former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, California led the post-Sputnik boom in public education and built a system that was the envy of the nation. But since the passage of Proposition 13, the 1978 ballot measure that capped local property tax rates, the state's 8,000 public schools have had to compete for suddenly scarce resources in an era that saw both a grueling regional recession and a huge influx of new immigrants, many of them speaking little or no English.
In recent national standardized tests, California's fourth-graders surpassed only those in Mississippi and Louisiana in reading proficiency. Studies by a national teachers union and the State Department of Education have found that California ranks 37th in the nation in spending per pupil.
The state educates 1 of every 8 Americans but ranks last in the percentage of young adults who earn high school diplomas and 37th in college S.A.T. scores.
"Whatever their views of government, both Republicans and Democrats think that schools are the one thing government should do something about," said Bill Carrick, a Democratic political consultant who conducted scores of focus groups among voters around the state. "And voters think the schools stink, in every way imaginable, from crumbling infrastructure to lack of textbooks. The depth of the severity of educational deficiency is perceived as so great."
Moreover, in a state whose population is expected to grow by 18 million people -- an entire New York State -- by the year 2025, poll takers say voters tend to see "education" as a kind of proxy for their more generalized concerns about the future.
"I think voters are telling us they're concerned about the future and they feel that while things are going pretty well right now, they feel that their children may not have the skills they need to compete efficiently," Mr. Baldassare said. "They're telling us that technology is running along at a fast pace and they can't keep up with it."
"And most people recognize that in the regions where they live, there's been a phenomenal amount of immigration and there are large numbers of people who need to learn English and basic skills," he added. "And if the state is going to continue to achieve the economic prosperity which it has been used to having, then the schools have an enormous responsibility to teach and train these new Californians."
Yet while voters uniformly see problems, there is little consensus about what to do. For example, polls have shown that a ballot measure conceived by Mr. Wilson as a way to make permanent the class-size reductions previously ordered by the Legislature is failing to draw majority support among likely voters.
Instead, voters seem to be rebelling at 16 years of Republican rule in the Governor's mansion. A recent statewide Field Poll found that voters viewed Mr. Davis as significantly stronger on education issues than Mr. Lungren, and Mr. Davis hammers home that point in a new commercial noting that Mr. Lungren, as a Congressman, opposed creating the Department of Education.
That has frustrated many Republican strategists here, who complain that Mr. Lungren has not focused enough on an issue that could help him, and has not put his advertising money behind his one television commercial that features the issue.
They note, for example, that Mr. Lungren favors lifting the statewide cap on the number of charter schools, a popular system in which schools are publicly financed but governed by independent local boards of parents and teachers, while Mr. Davis favors only a gradual expansion.
"Education could be the key to a Lungren victory," said Dan Schnur, a former senior Wilson aide who now advises Mr. Lungren. "More than on any other issue he's got an opportunity to convince voters that he's an agent of change and that Davis is a defender of the status quo. On other issues, Davis is able to blur the differences."
But Mr. Schnur also knows firsthand the political pitfalls of education issues. In 1993, he managed the campaign for a ballot measure in support of vouchers that received only 30 percent of the vote. Current polls show public support for the idea approaching 60 percent, but experts say that surface number masks deeper public ambivalence.
Still, poll takers say the depth of public support for the costly bond measure shows the intensity of concern about the state's badly outmoded, overcrowded schools. Yet the state's recent experience with laws like the class-size reduction measure -- which quickly ran up against a shortage of qualified teachers -- makes people wary of any promise of a quick fix.
"In a sense, you want to slow down the reform process and see which of these ideas really work," Professor Fuller said. "Each one of these ideas has a silver-bullet quality to it, and then we start rolling out new programs at $1 billion each and we discover they create new problems. There's very little systemic thinking about how they all fit together."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 9, 1999, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Oct. 15 about education as an issue in the election for California governor referred incorrectly to a link between Dan Schnur, a Republican political consultant, and a 1993 campaign for a ballot measure to create a voucher system for public schools. He took no role in the 1993 campaign; it was managed by another consultant, Ken Khachigian.
This correction was scheduled for publication in October but was misplaced.

HEADLINE: Opulence at the Armory, With a Slight Hedge

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Over the last decade, exhibitors at the International Fine Art and Antique Dealers Show have seen it all. They remember the flush days of the late 1980's when collectors elbowed one another to be the first through the heavy carved oak doors of the Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan, dropping several million dollars on a chic little table or a pair of unusual chairs. But they also remember the bleak years of the early 90's when the crowds came but almost nobody spent.
Just how this year's show, which opens today and runs through Thursday, will be affected by the worldwide financial crisis is yet to be seen. As usual, the offerings are broad and the booths glamorous. A walk around the show provides a look at everything from a $3 million Cezanne still life to a $100 delft tile and a $40 18th-century silver mustard spoon. Dealers hope the art market will continue to rise as it did in 1987 after Black Monday. 
 "I haven't seen a client yet who says he's feeling too broke to buy," said Edward Munves, owner of James Robinson, a Park Avenue gallery specializing in antique jewelry and silver. "People consider buying silver or jewelry simply moving money from one kind of asset to another. It didn't stop me from bringing good pieces because people today would rather not buy than have lesser quality."
Some dealers take a less sanguine view of the market. Khalil Rizk of the Chinese Porcelain Company in Manhattan is prepared to see a few less sales this season. "Volume will be down, but things that are compelling and essential to a collector won't be passed up," he said. "There's such a shortage of great objects that connoisseurs won't be able to resist them."
The walls of Mr. Rizk's booth are covered with black felt to show off 70 watercolors of Chinese birds, which were made around 1810 for an English nobleman. They are priced at $3,800 each, and Mr. Rizk said he hoped collectors would buy them in interesting groups rather than one or two at a time. These are his purely decorative offerings. The stars of his booth are an 18th-century Chinese painting of a reclining horse, which has a $125,000 price tag, and a seventh-century Vietnamese gold Buddha, which stands 22 inches high and which Mr. Rizk says is one of the largest gold pieces of that period known. It costs $550,000.
It's not unusual to find booths like the Chinese Porcelain Company's that feature both affordable items and very expensive ones. Mark Brady, a painting and drawing dealer from Manhattan, said he brought reasonably priced decorative objects as well as serious, museum-quality works. Over the last several years, Mr. Brady said, he has had a significant rise in sales to American museums. But given the uncertainty of the market, he said he believed careful pricing was crucial.
"People just don't feel like spending excessive amounts of money like they did a year ago," Mr. Brady said. "They want to find works of art that are attractively priced."
One such work is a haunting painting titled "The Emperor Napoleon's Horse, Tauris," which was in the collection of the National History Museum in Paris. Priced at $38,000, it is signed and dated B. Noriac/1908 and depicts the skeleton of a horse being fed by his trainer, who also happens to be a skeleton.
This year's fair seems to offer a wider range of paintings than it has in recent years. Waring Hopkins, a Paris dealer, has a whimsical and colorful Calder from 1974, "The Card Players," which costs $50,000 and comes from a private collection in Paris. Also arresting is a Nabis-period Bonnard, "The Stork," an oil-on-cloth painting with a brilliant red background, which costs $960,000.
Mr. Hopkins just flew in from France after participating in the Biennale des Antiquaires, Paris's big antiques event, which ended last month. "The biennale wasn't as lively as the Fine Art Fair here in May," he said. "But we made many sales, so I can't complain."
One of the four new dealers this year, De Jonckheere, also showed at the biennale and is no stranger to New York fairs. The Paris gallery, which specializes in 16th- and 17th-century Flemish and Dutch paintings, has a booth filled with paintings by masters like Teniers, Bruegel and Cranach. One outstanding Bruegel, "The Return of the Country Fair" (1620), depicts a lively village scene. It is priced at $2 million and came from a private collection in Belgium.
The three other new dealers tried to decorate their booths with flair, and all succeeded. Frederick Schultz, an antiquities dealer from Manhattan, paneled his booth in a blond wood with modular displays that feature all kinds of objects, from a fifth-century B.C. bronze horn with a wonderful patina that costs $475,000 to an Iberian column idol dating from 200 B.C. for $165,000. "I'd like to think that I present antiquities in an intriguing way to people who never thought about them before," he said.
One booth away from Mr. Schultz is Galerie Blondeel Deroyan, another new dealer. The cool gray space features simple, sleek clear plastic display cases that show off a wide variety of objects, including antiquities, tapestries, furniture and artworks. Unforgettable are the booth's three important tapestries. The most striking is a large French embroidered one dating from 1600 that shows scenes of the Old Testament around the border and the New Testament in the middle, with the four Evangelists. It is from a private collection in northern France and costs $360,000. On a simple pedestal in the center of the booth is an impeccably carved figure of an Egyptian dignitary from the period of the Ramses kings, 1315 to 1090 B.C., for $525,000.
Galerie Blondeel Deroyan is based in Paris. So is another new dealer, Maroun H. Salloum. But Mr. Salloum specializes in 19th- and early-20th-century furniture and artworks. "My taste isn't very French," Mr. Salloum said. The walls of his small booth are paneled to resemble an Arts and Crafts room. In the booth, a pair of early cabinets by Adolf Loos, the Austrian architect and designer, face each other; they are priced at $110,000 for both. Other pairs here include 1860 plaster figures and evocative silver scones by Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann, a leading Parisian decorator and designer of the 1920's.
If one trend is evident at the fair this season, it is a proliferation of 1920's and 30's furniture and decorative objects. Vallois, another French dealer, is back for its second year, with a large booth whose walls are covered in parchment-colored undulating paneling. Nearly all the objects -- dining tables, chairs, vanities -- are by Ruhlmann. And an old-timer at the show, Ciancimino from London, used to epitomize English country-house taste until recent years when its booth and Pimlico Road shop have consistently carried Art Deco objects. This year a pair of ebony screens by Jean-Michel Frank flank the booth's back wall. "We feel most of our American decorators are going toward that look," Jean-Claude Ciancimino said.
They're also going for Russian furniture. Some of the best can be found at the booth of another London dealer, Antoine Cheneviere, who is showing a pair of Russian commodes by Heinrich Gambs, a major cabinetmaker of his time. Dated 1810, the pieces are of mahogany and ebony with gilt bronze leopardlike faces for drawer pulls and gilt claw feet. The dealer says he has not priced them yet.
When asked for his predictions about the fair, given the state of the economy, Mr. Cheneviere said: "Some people may decide to buy because it's another sort of investment. But at this point, it's anyone's guess."

Seeking growth, Weiss, Whitten, Stagliano changes its name and adds nine partners.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
A CREATIVELY focused New York agency is reorganizing as the principals seek to spark new growth.
The agency, Weiss, Whitten, Stagliano, which creates campaigns for clients like Allied Domecq, The Economist, Ferrari and Guinness, is being renamed Weiss Stagliano Partners as nine creative, account, production and administrative executives are given stock in the downtown shop. The new partners are gaining the undisclosed minority interest in the agency from Marty Weiss and Adam Stagliano, who will hold the majority of the equity and voting shares. 
 Weiss Stagliano was formed seven years ago as Weiss, Whitten, Carroll, Stagliano with the merger of two small shops that opened in 1989. Of the four principals who joined forces in 1991, the two who remain are Mr. Weiss, creative director, and Mr. Stagliano, president and account planning director.
As for the other two, Tom Carroll, who left in 1993, is a partner at Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer Euro RSCG, a unit of Havas Advertising in New York. And Nat Whitten, who left in November, started his own agency, Nat Whitten Inc. in New York.
Weiss Stagliano is part of a new generation of agencies that were founded in the late 1980's and early 1990's by entrepreneurial talents who broke away from such hot shops as Chiat/Day; Fallon McElligott; Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, and Wieden & Kennedy. Though many of the newcomers are thriving, there is a widespread perception, as Warren Berger wrote in an article in the July-August issue of the trade publication Creativity, that they "have not evolved all that far" and "have yet to hit the kind of early home run that promises future greatness."
Progress for Weiss Stagliano, which estimates its billings at $85 million to $90 million, has been impeded by two recent setbacks. The Barnes & Noble Inc. retail and on-line accounts, with billings estimated at more than $40 million, left after less than a year for the New York office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group.
And the estimated $35 million Guerlain fragrance account, once shared by Weiss Stagliano with WSP/Australie, part of the Euro RSCG unit of Havas in Paris, was consolidated at the French agency by the French perfumer, which is owned by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton. Weiss Stagliano does, however, continue to maintain ties with WSP/Australie.
"Do I think we had an aspiration 10 years ago to be bigger?" Mr. Stagliano, 43, said in an interview. "Absolutely."
"I don't think we're quite as brash as we were," he added. "But we still believe in our vision."
Mr. Weiss, 44, who joined Mr. Stagliano for the interview, agreed.
"We didn't lose a lot of sleep over what seemed like 'hits' to the outside world," Mr. Weiss said, because "we've never felt more solid."
"We have more focus and we have more management," he added. "It's all coming together."
One reason Mr. Stagliano gave for describing himself as a "psychopathic optimist" is that, he said, the agency "has never been as busy new-business-wise." He listed a new $5 million account from American Skandia, a unit of the Skandia Insurance Company Ltd., and additional assignments from such clients as Allied Domecq Spirits and the Guinness Import Company.
Weiss Stagliano is also taking part in account reviews, Mr. Stagliano said, that include the Chupa Chups lollipops sold by Chupa Chups USA and the Concord watch brand sold by Movado Group.
"We've weathered partners leaving," he added, "and the leaving of some fairly highly visible clients. We are not the new kids on the block; we have a certain maturity."
The naming of the new partners is meant to encourage their efforts in the Weiss Stagliano advertising operation as well as at units that specialize in film and music, Internet marketing and brand design.
"We wanted to come up with an incentive scheme," Mr. Stagliano said, "and at agencies that can mean only one thing: giving out equity."
The new partners are: Paul Budd, 35, studio director; Jeff Compton, 33, creative supervisor; Neil Cotton, 32, group account director; Louise Fischer, 31, group account director; Todd Gallentine, 34, creative supervisor; Jeff Greenberg, 41, production services director; Gay Holmes, 32, group account planning director; William Livolsi Jr., 39, chief financial officer, and Mark Mendelis, 30, creative supervisor.

HEADLINE: Delta Results Set a Record For Quarter

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Confounding investors worried about a weakening economy, Delta Air Lines reported record quarterly earnings yesterday, easily surpassing Wall Street's estimates.
Delta, the country's third-largest airline after United and American, saw its net income rise 29 percent, to $327 million, or $4.16 a diluted share, compared with $254 million, or $3.26 a share, during the period a year ago. Analysts polled by First Call had estimated that the carrier would earn $3.90 a share. 
 Revenue rose 7 percent, to $3.8 billion, compared with $3.55 billion in the quarter in 1997.
As the first major airline to report earnings, Delta may lead the way for the rest of the industry. But a large percentage of the gains for the company's first fiscal quarter appeared to come at the expense of Northwest Airlines, which was grounded for three weeks during the quarter after its pilots walked out in late August.
Delta executives estimated that because of the Northwest strike, Delta's revenue increased $25 million to $30 million, which equals about 23 cents a share.
Delta's shares soared $7 yesterday, closing at $93.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. Other major airlines also rose sharply for the second consecutive day in anticipation of a strong quarter.
But the increases did little to erase previous steep declines in airline stocks, which have fallen 44 percent from their peaks in July, according to Samuel C. Buttrick, an analyst at Paine Webber.
Because spending on travel is so closely tied to the health of the overall economy, airlines are often seen as leading indicators of economic downturns. Mr. Buttrick told his clients recently that only once before have airline stocks fallen 44 percent without a recession following, and that was during the 1987 stock market crash.
Brian Harris, the airline analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in New York, estimates that every 1 percent decline in consumer spending trims 9 percent from airline earnings.
Delta, like the other major carriers, said that it saw no signs of an imminent recession. It told analysts yesterday that advanced bookings through December for both domestic and international travel were at higher levels than they were at this time last year.
"What they are saying is they are just about locked in for next quarter," said Susan M. Donofrio, an analyst at BT Alex. Brown in New York. "The question mark remains for 1999 because they can't see that far out."
If a recession does come next year, however, Leo F. Mullin, Delta's chairman and chief executive, said the carrier was better positioned to weather it than at any time in its history. "We are cautious about general economic conditions," he said.
Delta has $1.1 billion in cash, even after spending $400 million during the quarter to buy its own shares. It is also putting in a new computer system that it said would produce $200 million in extra revenue in the coming year by enabling the airline to gauge passenger demand more efficiently.

HEADLINE: Salomon Cuts 100 Bond Jobs

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Salomon Smith Barney Inc. said yesterday that it had cut 100 jobs in United States bond trading, research and sales in New York to reduce costs as a result of trading losses in global markets.
The cuts are in all areas of the debt department and began on Wednesday, a spokeswoman, Arda Nazerian, said. The firm is expected to dismiss additional employees in its equities unit the week of Oct. 26 and after that, in investment banking. 
 The third-biggest United States securities firm by capital is dismissing employees after losing about $700 million related to global arbitrage and Russia's default in August, which sent bond markets around the world tumbling. Salomon Smith Barney is expected to report a net loss of about $325 million in its third quarter, its parent, Citigroup Inc., said last week.
The cuts follow Merrill Lynch & Company's decision to eliminate 3,400 jobs earlier this week. Wall Street is undergoing its biggest round of layoffs since late 1994 and early 1995, when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates several times.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Edge Upward; Analysts Call Increase a Fluke

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
Higher costs for new cars and trucks pushed up the prices paid to producers in September at the fastest rate in a year, a statistical fluke that analysts said did not portend a lasting acceleration of inflation.
Prices paid to factories, farmers and other producers for finished goods rose three-tenths of a percent last month, the Labor Department said. That came after a four-tenths of a percent decrease in August and was the largest increase since a rise of four-tenths of a percent in September 1997. Analysts were expecting no change for the month. 
 "It's not as bad as it seems," said Ian Shepherdson, an independent economist based in New York. "It would be very unwise to read any medium-term inflation implications from these numbers."
Rather than seeing an actual increase in auto prices, analysts said the Labor Department had trouble adjusting the Producer Price Index to account for early introduction of some new models, discounted costs on old models and the lingering effects of the strike against the General Motors Corporation.
In addition, other Government indicators released today suggest economic growth is slowing, which should mean fewer inflation pressures.
Sales at American businesses, for example, fell two-tenths of a percent, to $772.5 billion, in August after falling one-tenth of a percent in July, the Commerce Department said. That pushed up business inventories three-tenths of a percent, to $1.074 trillion, in August -- the fastest rate of stock-building since March.
And the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported that its general economic index remained negative, posting a reading of minus 6.1 this month. That suggests manufacturing contracted for a second straight month in the Philadelphia region. The report also showed no sign of inflation pressures in the region. Its prices-paid index fell to minus 14.5 in October from minus 2.5 in September -- the lowest in the 30-year history of the survey.
Separately, the Labor Department said the number of workers filing for state unemployment benefits rose by 2,000, to a seasonally adjusted 303,000, for the week ended Oct. 10 after claims rose by 11,000 the previous week, when 40 states or territories reported an increase in new jobless claims.
In its inflation report, the Labor Department said the core rate of the Producer Price Index, which excludes food and energy costs, rose four-tenths of a percent in September after falling one-tenth of a percent a month earlier.
A seasonally adjusted 2.2 percent rise in the cost of passenger cars and a 2 percent increase in the price of light trucks accounted for three-fourths of the September increase in the core rate, the report said.
The September increase in vehicle prices more than offset a 1.7 percent drop in car prices and a one-tenth of a percent drop in light-truck prices in August.
That meant prices did not fall as much as the Labor Department's seasonal adjustment factors expected. The department expected a 2.9 percent decline in auto prices; prices actually fell four-tenths of a percent. For light trucks, the department expected a 2.6 percent price decline; actual prices fell 1 percent.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Coca-Cola's Earnings Down By 12.2% in Third Quarter

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
The Coca-Cola Company reported third-quarter earnings yesterday that were in line with what the company previewed earlier this month, when senior executives warned that Coke's business had suffered from economic crises around the world.
The company earned $888 million, or 36 cents a diluted share, down 12.2 percent from $1.011 billion, or 40 cents a share, last year. Revenue totaled $4.75 billion, down 4 percent from $4.95 billion. 
 Worldwide volume for the quarter rose just 3 percent, compared with 11 percent for the period a year ago. In Europe, volume increased just 1 percent, while volume grew 4 percent in the United States. The company's Middle and Far East group recorded volume increases of just 3 percent in the quarter, compared with 10 percent in the 1997 third quarter. The biggest gainer was Africa, which is also Coke's smallest global division, where volume rose 5 percent, compared with 13 percent in the 1997 third quarter.
"It was exactly as advertised at the meeting three weeks ago," said Andrew Conway, a beverage analyst with Morgan Stanley. Mr. Conway lowered his fourth-quarter estimate by a penny, nevertheless, to reflect costs the company may incur from consolidating bottling operations in Russia. "During this time of global uncertainty, our system will continuously demonstrate the mind-set of the industry leader, with determination to stay focused on creating value for our customers, and our share owners," Coke's chairman and chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester, said in a statement.
Among the trouble spots was Germany, where issues as basic as the weather dragged down the performance of the rest of Europe. "You have a weak economy in Germany, and they said the weather wasn't good, and they are going through a transitional period in terms of merging bottlers," said Emanuel Goldman, a global consumer-products analyst for Merrill Lynch. "They are going to be paying especially close attention to Germany. The volume probably won't be up in the fourth quarter."
Additional problems persist in Japan, where volume was flat and up only 2 percent for the year. And in Brazil, where volume rose 1 percent in the third quarter, some analysts expect a dismal fourth quarter.
"What goes on in Brazil over the next few months is important in terms of Coke's total Latin American volume," Mr. Goldman said. "Whatever happens in Brazil, you have spillover effects." Already, Colombia and Venezuela have seen a 6 percent drop in volume, the company reported yesterday.

Fed Action on Interest Rates Sends Treasury Prices Higher

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices surged yesterday, and two-year notes posted the biggest rally in more than three years, after the Federal Reserve unexpectedly cut interest rates to avert a credit crunch and calm financial markets.
The central bank lowered its target for the Federal funds rate -- the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans -- by one-quarter of a percentage point, to 5 percent, after cutting it by the same amount in late September. It also cut the discount rate -- at which the Fed lends to financial institutions -- by one-quarter point, to 4.75 percent. 
 "It certainly caught us by total surprise," said John Burgess, who oversees about $90 billion at the Bankers Trust Company.
The Fed's move may signal deeper problems in the financial system and presage more rate cuts, Mr. Burgess said. It was the first time since April 1994 that the central bank changed interest rates between policy meetings.
Two-year notes, those most sensitive to Fed policy, soared after the Fed's move, driving yields down to 3.83 percent, the biggest rally since June 13, 1995. The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond rose 29/32 , to 108 8/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.97 percent, from 5.03 percent on Wednesday.
"It's just a shock," Tom O'Connell, a Treasury note trader at First Chicago Capital Markets, said. "The timing shows how much they are concerned about the market."
The Fed last trimmed rates at a policy meeting on Sept. 29, lowering the Fed funds target a quarter-point, to 5.25 percent.
Investors flocked to Treasury securities in recent months, seeking the safest investments after Russia devalued its currency and defaulted on some debt, shaking financial markets around the world. Thirty-year bond yields fell as low as 4.72 percent on Oct. 5, the lowest for long-term United States debt in 31 years.
The Fed's move "tells me there is significant concern about the financial system and the liquidity being provided by financial institutions," said Richard Schwartz, who oversees $21 billion in bonds at New York Life Asset Management in Parsippany, N.J.
"My belief is that they see significant problems among financial" companies that others may not be aware of, Mr. Schwartz said.
Already, big banks and brokerage firms, including the Nomura Securities Company, Merrill Lynch & Company and the BankAmerica Corporation, have announced trading losses and lower profits in the third quarter. In the case of Merrill, the weaker performance also resulted in job cuts.
Profit shortfalls at other companies, including the Eastman Kodak Company, also point to slower growth and the chance of more rate cuts, investors said.

Ruling Broadens Protection for Renter in a Co-op

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
In a decision that could affect the status of unsold co-op and condominium apartments throughout New York State, a housing court judge in Brooklyn has ruled that a tenant who rented an apartment from a sponsor after a conversion was entitled to the same protection against eviction as tenants who were living there at the time of the conversion.
While the ruling's effect is limited for now to the Brooklyn case, some lawyers are worried that it might set a precedent upsetting a standard assumption of the co-op and condominium market: that the sponsor can refuse to renew the lease of a tenant who sublets after a conversion. 
 The ruling, if upheld, would sharply curtail sponsors' ability to end the tenancy of such renters, preventing co-ops and condominiums from completing conversions while forcing sponsors to keep apartments vacant until they are sold.
"This has the potential of preventing the completion of literally thousands of conversions," said Jim Samson, a lawyer representing about 90 co-op boards in the city. "It would create major economic turmoil in the co-op community."
Stuart Saft, chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives, concurred. "This case affects every unsold apartment in the city," he said. "It immediately affects all the apartments which the sponsor rented after the conversion, and it will affect every apartment that presently has a rent-regulated tenant as those tenants vacate their apartments.
"When they leave," Mr. Saft said, "the sponsor has to decide whether to sell or deal with giving a new tenant the right to stay forever."
According to Martin Oestreicher, deputy commissioner of the city's Department of Finance, there are at least 420,000 co-op and condominium units in the city, of which about 100,000 are now held by sponsors.
The ruling, in Paikoff v. Harris, was handed down by Judge Marc Finkelstein of Civil Court on Aug. 31. It involved a six-unit co-op, sponsored by Barry Paikoff, at 534 Sixth Avenue in Park Slope.
The tenant, Emil Harris, rented a sponsor-held apartment five years after the 1992 conversion. When the lease expired, Mr. Paikoff started eviction proceedings. But Mr. Harris refused to leave, claiming that he should be considered a "nonpurchasing tenant" under the Martin Act, the state law governing the rights of co-op and condominium tenants. Rent control and rent stabilization are governed by other regulations.
Essentially, tenants protected by the Martin Act cannot be evicted except for good cause, like failing to pay rent, and cannot be subjected to "unconscionable rent increases." The act allows rent-regulated tenants already in the building to retain that status, but does not spell out rent formulas.
Before Judge Finkelstein's decision, it was assumed that only tenants already occupying an apartment during a conversion were protected. People renting after conversion -- either from a tenant-shareholder or a "holder of unsold shares," like the sponsor -- were considered unprotected.
But the judge ruled that the Martin Act applies to any tenant renting from someone other than a "purchaser under the plan." He also ruled that while tenant-shareholders are indeed purchasers under the plan, a holder of unsold shares, like the sponsor, is not -- contrary to a long-held industry assumption that had never been tested in court.
"If the Legislature intended that a holder of unsold shares should be considered a purchaser under the plan," Judge Finkelstein wrote, "the legislation should have contained a provision to that effect."
He also quoted a submission from the State Attorney General's office, which contended that a sponsor is not a purchaser under the plan, and, therefore, "a tenant who rents a vacant unit after the plan's effective date from a sponsor or holder of unsold shares is a nonpurchasing tenant," protected by the Martin Act. On that basis, Judge Finkelstein denied the eviction.
No decision on whether to appeal had been made, said Rand Levin, the sponsor's lawyer. "My view," he said, "is that there is a wealth of legislative history suggesting that the intent of the statute was only to protect tenants in possession at the time of a conversion."
Mr. Harris's lawyer, Ronald Languedoc of Brooklyn Legal Services, called the ruling well reasoned and "clearly reflecting the language of the statute." Mr. Harris, asked if he was aware that his case could set a precedent, said: "I'm very proud of that. Maybe it will give people in my situation a means of stability."
But real estate lawyers said they were concerned.
"Assuming that it's affirmed on appeal, and that's questionable," Mr. Saft said, "it means the sponsor may not be able to sell the apartment in the future because the tenant can't be evicted. From the co-op's point of view, it's good news and bad news. The good news is that it's more likely now that sponsors will sell apartments that become vacant. The bad news is that every tenant who rented after the conversion may have the right to remain permanently."
Mr. Samson, the co-op board lawyer, said he feared that the ruling would give sponsors an excuse to hold on to their apartments and continue collecting free-market rents.
"While it will scare most sponsors so they won't rent," Mr. Samson said, "there is also a group of sponsors who converted buildings with no intention of selling all the units. They simply sold the minimum and are holding the rest for the sole purpose of avoiding rent regulation and renting them out at free-market rents."
Likening those sponsors to Br'er Rabbit manipulatively pleading, "Please don't throw me in the briar patch," Mr. Samson said those sponsors, in truth, "don't want to sell."
"If they are told they can't evict," he said, "then they are protected from having to sell, and they are able to keep charging extraordinarily high and unregulated rents."

Trade Group Faults U.S. on Shrimp Rules

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization has ruled that the United States is not evenhandedly applying a law that bans certain shrimp imports, while saying that the law itself does not violate trade rules.
Washington had appealed an earlier ruling by a panel of the trade organization that said that a 1991 American law banning shrimp imports from countries that failed to prove that their shrimping fleets were taking steps to protect endangered sea turtles was illegal. The ban covers shrimps caught in nets without escape pods. 
 The trade group said that the United States applied the law "in a manner which constitutes arbitrary and unjustifiable discrimination between members of the W.T.O." and did not work with other governments to adopt similar protective laws for sea turtles before imposing an import ban.
American trade officials have promised to stand firm. In a statement yesterday, the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, said, "We disagree with the appellate body's assessment that we have not implemented the law in an evenhanded manner." Nonetheless, she said, "the appellate body has rightly recognized that our shrimp-turtle law is an important and legitimate conservation measure."
The ruling, released earlier this week, leaves the law intact, but the trade organization said Washington must take steps to apply the law more evenly. It did not list specific consequences of failing to comply.
In March, India, Pakistan, Malaysia and Thailand filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization, charging that monitoring of shrimping techniques was illegal because it was not a legitimate trade issue.
Environmentalists had expected the trade group to uphold its earlier ruling against the American law. Peter Fugazzotto, a spokesman for the Sea Turtle Restoration Project in Forest Knolls, Calif., north of San Francisco, said the W.T.O.'s "anti-environmental bias" was known.
Tim Eichenberg of the Center for Marine Conservation said, "We're very disappointed but not surprised with the W.T.O.'s decision."
"We hope that the Administration takes a strong stand," he continued, "and does not weaken any laws."
Analysts have said that the ban prevents the sale in the United States of perhaps $200 million to $300 million in foreign shrimp each year, and that lifting it would probably lower domestic prices of shrimp. That would hurt shrimpers and help packers, distributors and retailers.
The United States imported 113,300 tons of shrimp in the first five months this year, up 20 percent over the 1997 period. The 1997 exports from Thailand alone came to 137,000 tons, worth $1.23 billion, the Thai Frozen Foods Association said.

Finding a Balance in the Dollar's Slide

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Many Americans love a strong dollar. After all, a rising currency means lower prices for imports and more bang for the buck when traveling abroad.
But much of American business is a lot happier when the dollar is not so strong. That's because a weaker currency lifts American exports and helps stifle foreign competitors here. So why, with the dollar's recent plunge against the Japanese yen and its longer slide against the German mark, aren't executives breaking out the Champagne? 
 Perhaps because the dollar is not as weak as headlines suggest, even after it fell yesterday when the Federal Reserve, in a surprise move, cut each of its two key interest rate targets by a quarter of a percentage point.
"By easing now, the Fed will be promoting stronger financial markets down the road," said Michael Rosenberg, head of international fixed-income research at Merrill Lynch & Company. "So the hit the dollar is taking now should be an abbreviated one."
Take the case of the Nucor Corporation, an efficient steelmaker based in Charlotte, N.C., that has seen its exports plunge from 700,000 tons just a few years ago to 100,000 tons this year.
Nucor's exports have been depressed because the strong dollar makes its steel products more expensive in overseas markets and because the collapse of Asian economies has cut into sales to that region.
So it was not surprising that F. Kenneth Iverson, Nucor's chairman, was heartened last week when the dollar fell 8 percent against the yen in one day. Bidders he hadn't heard from in months were on the phone. "We've seen more opportunity for quotes," he said.
Trouble is, no new business has yet materialized.
There's a good reason. The dollar has fallen 20.7 percent against the yen and 12.7 percent against the mark from its 1998 highs, but it remains relatively strong against other currencies that play a big role in American trade, including the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar. Those currencies both set record lows this year against the United States dollar.
Indeed, until last month the trade-weighted dollar, which is intended to reflect each major currency's impact on United States trade, was the strongest it had been since 1985. The trade-weighted dollar had jumped 21 percent since May 1995, when the American currency was at record lows against the yen and the mark. But since September, according to the index by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, the trade-weighted dollar has fallen only 4.8 percent.
The dollar's overall fall "has not been enough to make a big difference," said John Lipsky, chief economist for Chase Manhattan Bank.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar fell to 116.75 yen, from 118.98 Wednesday, and to 1.6187 marks, from 1.6426. The Dallas Fed index for the daily trade-weighted dollar dropped to 172.5, from 173.5.
Still, while exporters may not be getting much support, it appears that the weaker dollar could provide significant aid to American companies that have had earnings abroad crimped by a strong dollar during the last year. Eastman Kodak, Gillette and I.B.M., for example, seem poised for a lift from the weaker dollar in the quarters ahead.
"After being a severe negative for earnings this year, it could be a positive," said Thomas Doerflinger, an investment strategist at Paine Webber. This year -- in which he believes earnings gains for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index will be negligible -- Mr. Doerflinger said that the strong dollar had on average cut earnings growth by about two percentage points.
The hit-and-miss impact of the dollar's recent fall is partly because currency changes show up through the conversion of foreign earnings almost immediately but take much longer to have broader economic impacts. And the global slowdown, which has cut consumer demand worldwide, means that a lift from the dollar may go mostly unnoticed, analysts said.
And every business is different. Some multinational corporations hedge against dollar fluctuations, some don't. Some have operations around the world, others are concentrated in a handful of countries.
A stronger dollar should eventually help the American auto makers, by putting pressure on Japanese and European auto companies to either raise prices in the United States or accept lower profit margins.
American importers, however, will be paying more. What is unclear is whether a weaker dollar will lead to higher inflation or whether an expected economic slowdown in the United States will force all companies to hold down price increases.
Moreover, a lot depends on where the dollar goes from here. Some economists think it will reverse course against the yen, rallying as high as 150 yen, because the Japanese economic outlook is still glum.
The decline seems more lasting against the mark, but that could change after the euro, the new European currency, is introduced in January. Other variables include performances by stocks as well as any further Fed rate cuts.
For other American exporters, like Eastman Chemical, a polyester plastic maker based in Kingsport, Tenn., the story is the same as at Nucor. "Generally, a weaker dollar will make us more competitive," said Larry Munsey, Eastman Chemical's treasurer. "We can lower prices and gain more volume."
That's the theory, anyway. But "it's too early to tell," he said, adding, "It could take several months."
In addition, whatever aid the dollar gives exporters could be overwhelmed by the drag on sales from the recession in Asia and the slowdowns appearing in Latin America, Europe and the United States.
Another problem awaits American steelmakers. Walter Carter, the steel analyst at Standard & Poor's/DRI, said 80 percent to 90 percent of American steel exports go to Latin America and Canada, where the dollar is far stronger than it is compared with the yen and the mark.
On the plus side, American companies with business abroad should show benefits soon. Gillette, which posted a decline in third-quarter earnings yesterday, said it expected the dollar's recent fall to lift earnings in the fourth quarter.
Kodak said this week that it expects a weaker dollar will actually lift its earnings 1 cent a share in the fourth quarter -- if the dollar stays where it was Sept. 30. It is already 14.4 percent below where it stood against the yen then -- and 3 percent below its rate against the mark -- meaning even better earnings news.
I.B.M., which reports earnings Tuesday, is another company that can catch a break, especially with the dollar now 16 percent less than the rate of 139 yen that the company considered a problem when it posted its second-quarter earnings in July.
"We put currency on the negative column, and it has the potential of remaining there for the rest of the year," Douglas Maine, I.B.M.'s chief financial officer, said then.
For company earnings, the dollar's strength is important when compared with its exchange rate in the corresponding quarter the year earlier. Beginning in 1999, those quarterly comparisons are looking very good -- even if the dollar doesn't weaken any more.
One reason for sharp swings in earnings is that many corporations do not hedge against currency fluctuations, partly because of the cost and, in some cases, because of bad experiences. Kodak was a leader in hedging in the 1980's but does not do significant hedging now.
On the other hand, Merck & Company has been doing long-term hedging for years "to insulate the company from periods when the dollar get stronger," said Judy C. Lewent, the drug maker's chief financial officer.
She called the dollar's plunge against the yen a positive for the company. At the same time, though, the increased volatility raises the costs of hedging now against a stronger dollar in the future.
For American auto manufacturers, the dollar's fall -- if it holds -- should be positive. David Bradley, an analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities, said that a third of the cars sold in the United States by Japanese auto makers are imported; of those made at plants here, he said, about a third of the parts are imported.
Auto makers, he said, are already telling analysts that they will cut their incentive programs back in the fourth quarter, in part because the weaker dollar will make it harder for the Japanese to match American prices. In Europe, he said, a weaker dollar will help make American sales there more valuable when they are translated back into dollars.
As for inflation, the dollar's fall is not expected to add much to import prices. Mr. Lipsky of Chase Manhattan said that the dollar's impact would be overshadowed by a worldwide slowdown in demand that should keep prices in check. Chase is forecasting that consumer inflation in the United States will fall to 1 percent next year.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place -- Mixed Signals From the Fed;
If the Water's Fine, Why Are Those Sharks Still Circling?

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Board's late-afternoon decision yesterday to cut two key interest rates by one-quarter of a point caught traders and investors in all the United States financial markets completely flat-footed. And even though the Dow Jones industrial average soared 330.58 points on the news, the fact that the move came between regularly scheduled meetings at the Fed only served to make already-battered bond investors more nervous than ever. If the Fed was aiming to increase the confidence of financial market participants, the cut did only half the job.
On one hand, the reduction in rates is positive because it clearly telegraphs the Fed's willingness to do what it can to stop a recession from rolling across America. Just after the Fed moved, William Dudley, economist at Goldman, Sachs, said: "Is the risk of recession higher or lower than an hour ago? Probably lower because the Fed is acting. They showed that they're not going to take any chances with the economy." 
 But an unintended consequence of the sudden cut in rates was increased investor anxiety that the worldwide financial crisis may be either closer to home or even worse than anyone but the highest-ranking Fed officials realize. Everyone wondered just what specter the Fed might see on the horizon that mere mortals still find invisible.
Certainly there has been nothing in the recent economic figures that indicated the need for an immediate and drastic move by the Fed. Yes, the United States economy is weakening. September retail sales, for instance, were disappointing, showing an increase of just one-tenth of a percent for the month, excluding auto sales. And the Commerce Department reported that sales at domestic businesses fell two-tenths of a percent in August, after declining one-tenth of a percent in July. Not great news, but not signs of an imminent recession either.
And so, while stock market investors raced to buy equities on the news, bond investors were left scratching their heads. Why did the Fed move at all and why did it move when it did?
The Fed explained itself this way: "Growing caution by lenders and unsettled conditions in financial markets more generally are likely to be restraining aggregate demand in the future." Translation: a credit shortage seems to be developing that could stop economic growth dead in its tracks.
Still, reducing rates between meetings of the Fed's Open Market Committee is unusual; it hasn't happened since April 1994. And, if the reason for the cuts was a possible credit contraction, then why were two of the Federal Reserve Bank presidents in the last two days on record saying the country was not experiencing such a shortage?
On Wednesday, the New York Federal Reserve Bank president, William J. McDonough, said that while he was concerned that the nation's largest banks were cutting back credit, he saw no signs that small and regional banks were doing so. And, yesterday, less than an hour before the Fed announced its cuts, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond president, Alfred Broaddus, told a Washington & Lee University alumni gathering: "I don't think we're anywhere near a credit crunch at this stage."
Obviously others in the Federal Reserve system felt differently. As Charles W. Peabody, bank analyst at Mitchell Securities in New York, explains: "To get a discount rate cut, the Federal Reserve Bank presidents petition the Fed. They're obviously starting to worry about a domestic recession as they look out to 1999."
There is no disputing that many of the financial markets are frozen, and that the severe lack of liquidity could create additional dislocations like those seen recently at hedge funds run by Long-Term Capital Management, D. E. Shaw and Ellington Management. As Mr. Dudley points out, the Fed funds rate had been slightly above the Fed's target of 5.25 percent recently. "This shows that money is not moving freely in the money markets, that sand is in the wheels," he said. So, rather than wait four weeks to cut rates at its Nov. 17 policy-making meeting, the Fed acted to reassure investors and encourage them to get back into the pool. "We had a shark scare, and Fed is saying O.K. you can come back in," he said. "But nobody believes them."
The sudden cut in rates certainly puts to rest any conflict that may have existed among Fed members over monetary policy. As recently as this summer there was something of a schism within the Fed, with two non-Washington members holding out against rate cuts. No longer.
But the timing of yesterday's rate cut was intriguing on several other counts. First was the fact that the Fed decided to announce its move at 3:06 P.M., relatively late in the afternoon, while the stock market was open but the Treasury bond futures markets were closed. This is interesting because the futures markets -- the world's most liquid -- are where Treasury bond traders execute a large percentage of their trades. With this market closed, bond traders could not react to the Fed move as well as they could have if the rate cut had been announced at 2:15 P.M., as is typical.
Indeed, some traders speculated that the timing of the Fed's move appeared calculated to get a rise out of the stock market. Why? Because it was done late in the day before today's expiration of October equity options. And, if the Fed had moved while the bond futures market was still open, it ran the risk of a negative reaction from bond traders. This could have dampened stock traders' enthusiasm a bit.
In any case, after weeks of turmoil in the financial markets, it is clear that the Fed believes that a rate cut is needed to grease the wheels of the capital markets and get them whirring again. To do this, it must restore investor confidence, especially in all areas of the non-Treasury bond market.
After the Fed moved, some of these markets did react favorably. The difference between yields on Treasuries and other bonds with similar maturities narrowed, according to Steven Eisman, an analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer. For example, the spread between 10-year Treasury notes and the lowest-rated 10-year junk bonds narrowed by 5 basis points, or five one-hundredths of one percentage point, compared with levels at the end of last week. Over the same period, the spread between those Treasury notes and the better grade of junk bonds narrowed by 14 basis points, and the spread between Treasuries and top-quality corporate bonds narrowed by 13 basis points.
But it remains to be seen whether the one-quarter-point rate cut will be enough to stop the hemorrhaging at hedge funds and big brokerage firms and banks that own giant positions in troubled mortgage-backed securities, high-yield bonds and other non-Treasury debt and that have sold short corresponding Treasury securities. When the bond markets open today and traders absorb the full implications of yesterday's rate cut, it could be seen as exacerbating the problems at these already-hobbled firms.
And lower interest rates will make American stock and bond markets much less attractive to foreign investors, big buyers of United States financial assets in recent years. A declining American currency makes foreign investors less willing to hold United States stocks and bonds. The dollar closed yesterday just above its lows for the year against both the yen and the mark.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Stocks Surge InFinal Hour On Rate Cut

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
With stocks already rallying yesterday, a surprise interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve touched off a huge final-hour surge that drove prices up more than 4 percent on all three major market gauges.
The Dow Jones industrials jumped nearly 380 points at its peak before settling back in the final minutes to close up 4.15 percent at 8,299.36. It was a gain of 330.58 points, the third-biggest point advance on record. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index surged 4.17 percent, or 41.96 points, to 1,047.49. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index rose 4.55 percent, or 70.04 points, to 1,611.01.
"The A team is on the case," said Richard B. Hoey, chief economist and head of stock research at the Dreyfus Corporation, referring to the Fed action and the Administration's apparent success in winning Congressional approval of its request to replenish the International Monetary Fund, the lender of last resort for numerous distressed world economies.
One of the likely beneficiaries is Brazil, where stocks surged 6.65 percent yesterday on improved prospects for a rescue package. Mexican stocks jumped 6.55 percent.
Banks were among the standout gainers in yesterday's surge, but it embraced nearly every industry, with 446 of the 500 stocks in the S.& P. index and 29 of the 30 Dow industrials -- all but Philip Morris -- posting gains.
Analysts saw the Fed action as driven mainly by a desire to put more cash in the nation's financial system, which has suffered recently from growing caution by lenders in the face of exposure to losses from emerging markets and hedge funds and the possibility that the economy could slide into recession.
Shares of American Express, J. P. Morgan, Citigroup, Chase Manhattan, Bankers Trust and Merrill Lynch were all sharply higher.
The Fed move was seen as insurance against a business downturn as well and the threat this would pose to corporate profits.
"When I see the Fed stepping up like this it makes me less inclined to forecast a recession," said James E. Glassman, senior United States economist at Chase Securities, who said that until this afternoon he had been "toying" with such a prediction.
Nevertheless, there seemed to be little euphoria among portfolio managers and little rush, except by traders, to pile into stocks.
"After a couple of days I think people will pause and reflect a little bit," predicted Hank Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed in Overland Park, Kan. "They're not just willy-nilly going to jump on the train."
Steven Goldman, market strategist at Weeden & Company, said market operators were still scarred from the "psychological damage" from this year's pummeling of many stocks and were unlikely to suddenly become exuberant.
But he did say that the Fed's reduction of the discount rate, as opposed to the Federal funds rate, is especially significant for the market.
Over the last half-century, the first such cut has been followed three months later by an 8 percent rise in the S.& P. index, with the gains expanding to 13.5 percent after six months and 19.5 percent after a year. On only 2 of 14 occasions did stocks fail to climb, Mr. Goldman said.
The jump in the Dow left the industrial average down 11.1 percent from its July 17 peak, but well above the 20 percent drop it flirted with just a week ago.
Shares of General Electric rose 4 3/8, to 82, contributing the most to the jump in the S.& P., followed by Microsoft, which was up 5 1/4, to 105 7/16 . Citigroup rose 4 3/16 , to 39 13/16 ; American International Group was up 8 3/16 , to 82 7/17 , and Coca-Cola, whose profits matched lowered expectations, jumped 3 1/8, to 67 1/2.
Airlines were very strong for a second day, with Delta Air Lines up 7, to 93 1/2, and UAL, the parent of United, and AMR, American's parent, up 4 3/4 and 4 3/8, respectively. General Motors, up 3 7/8, to 56 1/16 , paced a buoyant auto group in which Chrysler gained 3, to 46 1/2, and Ford Motor climbed 2 15/16 , to 48 3/4.
Drug stocks, which were among the best in resisting decline, took off yesterday, with Warner-Lambert up 5 1/4, to 76; Bristol-Myers Squibb up 4 3/16 , to 102 7/8; Schering-Plough up 4 1/8, to 99 3/8; Merck up 3 7/8, to 133 1/4, and Pfizer, whose sales of Viagra have cooled, up 1 3/4, to 97 3/4.
Until the Fed action, stocks had been been spurred by a growing belief that almost any likely negative development had already been factored into prices, including lower profits.
"The market is beginning to believe that third-quarter earnings are shaping up better than the Street has expected," said Peter Cardillo, equity strategist at Westfalia Investments.
On the New York Stock Exchange there were 2,467 issues that rose yesterday, while 682 declined and 386 finished unchanged. But new lows for the year still dwarfed new highs, by 111 to 32.
Volume was 937.6 million shares, trailing only the number that changed hands Sept. 1, when the record of 1.2 billion shares was set, and on two days last week.

HEADLINE: The Fed Acts

 BODY:
By suddenly cutting interest rates yesterday, the Federal Reserve sent a strong message that it is worried about the world economy and determined to prevent a world recession. It was the latest encouraging signal that officials around the world are no longer complacent about the financial storm.
Since the International Monetary Fund's annual meeting ended last week without any clear agreement to act, financial markets have continued to signal distress by increasing the interest rates that must be paid by riskier borrowers, whether they are American companies issuing junk bonds or Latin American nations trying to fund their operations in a hostile financial environment. 
 The Fed rightly decided that the cautious rate reduction it made Sept. 29 was not enough. With yesterday's cut, the rate that banks pay on loans to each other is down to 5 percent from 5.5 percent before the first move. That rate is still higher than market interest rates, and more moves may be needed. But policy makers are showing they can act.
Yesterday's move follows agreement in Japan on a bank rescue plan with enough money to make real progress in dealing with that nation's financial paralysis, although doubts remain about how it will be applied. The cut also came on the same day that Congress approved $18 billion for the I.M.F. A prime goal of world policy makers should be to keep Latin America from following in Asia's footsteps, a goal that seems more achievable with the I.M.F. now able to help Brazil.
Statements by Wim Duisenberg, the head of the new European Central Bank, that he saw no need for coordinated easing of monetary policy were disappointing, but Mr. Duisenberg also emphasized the need for a flexible policy. There is reason to hope that European policy makers will not remain on the sidelines if the situation worsens.
Financial markets soared in reaction to the unexpected rate cut, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising more than 240 points in just 45 minutes. That was an indication that investors did not see the action as a warning that the Fed knew of any imminent disaster, such as a pending financial failure, but rather as a sign of determination to help the global economy.

HEADLINE: Quarterly Profit Down at Gillette

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
The Gillette Company, the world's largest maker of razors and blades, said today that its third-quarter profit fell -- the first quarterly decline in eight years -- because of weak sales in Asia, slowing economies in Latin America and the rising dollar.
Gillette said third-quarter profit before a charge fell 19 percent, to $353 million, or 30 cents a share, from $437 million, or 38 cents, a year earlier. Gillette, which also makes Duracell batteries, Papermate pens and other products, was expected to earn 30 cents, the average estimate of analysts surveyed by the First Call Corporation, a research firm in Boston. Sales fell 6.3 percent, to $2.53 billion from $2.70 billion. 
 Gillette, which gets a third of its revenue outside the United States and Western Europe, warned last month of the profit decline because of the drop in international sales, especially in Russia and Brazil. The recent introduction of the three-blade Mach 3 razor also raised marketing costs.
Gillette, which is based in Boston, announced the earnings after the close of New York trading. Its shares rose $2.25, to $42.625, as stocks generally soared.
A charge of $347 million, or 30 cents, for a revamping that includes cutting 4,700 jobs and closing dozens of plants and offices, resulted in net income slightly above break-even.
In a conference call with reporters, Gillette executives said they still expected an increase in fourth-quarter earnings per share in "low double digits."

HEADLINE: Clinton Urges Netanyahu And Arafat to Take Risks

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
President Clinton, promising his own intense involvement to secure agreement, today urged the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to "break the logjam" and take the risks required to provide new hope to their peoples.
Opening a four-day summit meeting between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, Mr. Clinton warned that "too much time has already been lost" in the search for an interim accord that will provide the Palestinians an additional 13 percent of the West Bank in return for Palestinian steps to fight terrorism. 
 "Concessions that seem hard now will seem far less important in the light of an accord that moves Israelis and Palestinians closer to lasting peace," Mr. Clinton said in the White House Rose Garden, flanked by the two Middle East leaders.
This afternoon Mr. Clinton traveled to the Wye Conference Center near Queenstown, Md., on the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay, where Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat have agreed to be isolated in comfort, with their aides and American officials, in the hopes of finishing the interim deal, now long overdue.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright will continually be at the center. Mr. Clinton said he would go there as needed.
Although American and Israeli officials said much hard work remained, failure on a long-delayed interim accord would be embarrassing to President Clinton just before the Nov. 3 elections. More importantly it would leave the peace effort on the verge of collapse seven months before May 4, when the Israelis and Palestinians are supposed to have completed their final agreement.
Mr. Arafat has threatened to declare Palestinian statehood unilaterally if May 4 passes without a final settlement.
Mr. Netanyahu and Israel's opposition Labor Party have warned him against such a step.
But senior American officials acknowledged that Mr. Arafat had to have "something concrete" to point to by then, with talks on a final settlement proceeding well.
A main task at the talks in Maryland, the American officials said, in addition to finishing the interim agreement for the 13 percent Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank in return for specific Palestinian antiterrorism steps, is to find a way to avoid a more fundamental crisis in seven months.
If the interim deal can be achieved here, after more than 19 months of stalemate, talks on a permanent settlement will immediately restart.
Natan Sharansky, one of Mr. Netanyahu's closest advisers in the Cabinet, said in an interview today that "no date is sacred" and that it could take two years for a final settlement to be negotiated.
The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, called that unacceptable. Mr. Sharansky tried to play down the stakes for the meeting here, saying Israel could not accept any agreement just to have one.
"We are coming to a summit where expectations are so high," he said. "Yet the most outstanding issues are not resolved. While what we in Israel have to give is clear, what we are to get is not."
The main issues for the Israelis are Palestinian steps to improve security, fight the radical Islamic Hamas movement and stop public and private "incitement" of violence against the Israelis.
An important part of the private violence issue, Mr. Sharansky said, is requiring a public change in the Palestinian charter to remove clauses calling for the destruction of Israel.
"I want it to be hard for Arafat," Mr. Sharansky said. "I want him to have to argue for such a change. To me the heart of the question is not the percentage of land we give, but to change the charter."
Mr. Netanyahu was cautious, saying, "We come with the best intentions and we hope that there will be an accord."
Mr. Arafat was optimistic. But he again mourned Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by an Israeli extremist. He reminded Mr. Netanyahu, in a reiteration of their long argument about whether peace flows from security or vice-versa, that "peace is the most important platform for security, and he has to remember this and not to forget that some of his extremist gangsters have killed my partner Rabin."
The old arguments are a prime reason why American officials want to isolate the leaders from outsiders, in particular from the press, and force them to concentrate in secrecy on the hard bargaining needed for a deal. The Wye Center, set amid dense woods along the unspoiled Wye River some 70 miles from Washington, was the next best choice, and a far more elegant one, after the Israelis rejected the Presidential retreat at Camp David in the Maryland hills. Israeli officials did not want the comparison to the 1978 marathon sessions there that led to a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt.
This afternoon at the Wye Center, Mr. Clinton said that the Americans were "ready to do whatever we can." He urged all sides to focus on the talks only.
"Therefore we have agreed to confine our dealings with the media to periodic briefings to be conducted by spokespersons," he said.
But the spokesmen like James P. Rubin of the State Department have pledged to say as little as possible.
Mr. Sharansky joked that he was hesitating to enter the conference Center "because I'm afraid they won't let me out again."
But his presence, combined with the arrival on Friday of the new Foreign Minister, Ariel Sharon, and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, is a sign of Mr. Netanyahu's seriousness. The three figures make up the "kitchen cabinet" and must themselves agree if Mr. Netanyahu has any chance of getting a deal through his Cabinet.
Mr. Sharon and Mr. Mordechai remained in Israel an additional day for a commemoration of a famous tank battle in the 1973 war. Mr. Sharon will fly directly to Rochester, Minn., where King Hussein of Jordan is undergoing cancer treatment at the Mayo Clinic, for a visit before joining Mr. Netanyahu at the Wye Center.
But with the Israeli delegation unable to work after sundown on Friday because of the Sabbath, American officials acknowledge that the time is short for the breakthrough that Mr. Clinton and Ms. Albright want so badly.
Among the issues to be settled include a third shift of Israeli troops due under previous accords, a move quite likely to be settled by a panel on borders at the final-status talks after they have begun.
There are also arguments about how Palestinians will travel unhindered between the West Bank and Gaza, with the Israelis suggesting buses and even trains. The Palestinians insist on being able to travel in individual cars. An airport and an industrial park in Gaza are essentially settled, but security questions remain on a planned seaport.
The real danger of the summit meeting, said Stephen Cohen, vice chairman of the Center for Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation, is that "everyone will settle for a very little thing that they call an agreement and that resolves nothing in the region." He urged Mr. Clinton "to aim high," saying, "A fairy-tale agreement about too little will not solve the problems."

HEADLINE: Clinton Officials Say I.M.F. Deal Expands Strategies to Halt Crisis

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
With the final agreement struck today in Congress to inject $18 billion into the depleted coffers of the International Monetary Fund, Clinton Administration officials said they now have more political leeway to attempt new strategies in fighting the continuing global financial turmoil.
For months the Administration has been warning that without an agreement with the Republican majority in the House to provide the added money to the monetary fund, the institution that has acted as the global financial firefighter would run out of water. In the end, perseverance won out. 
 With markets around the world coming unglued, the Republicans dropped a key demand that the fund complete revisions before it receive any of the new American cash.
The accord now paves the way for other nations to increase their contributions, and today the Administration projected that the fund's war chest would swell by $90 billion before the end of the year.
That, in turn, makes it possible for the fund to move ahead with a package of at least $30 billion in aid for Brazil, the world's ninth-largest economy and a critical American trading partner.
It will also give financial teeth to President Clinton's proposal, gradually being embraced by American allies, to set up multibillion dollar lines of credit within the I.M.F. to help nations combat economic contagion and defend their currencies before disaster strikes.
"This will substantially improve the I.M.F.'s capacity and our capacity to respond to and to prevent any escalation of the crisis," an Administration official said today, after days of negotiation that resulted in a list of changes for the fund.
White House officials said that the United States and its largest allies, who together account for 43 percent of the votes on the fund's board, had agreed on the need for many of the revisions that survived in the final legislation.
But it is far from clear that money alone will calm the turmoil. Billions in aid did little to stabilize Indonesia, and it did nothing to solve the political paralysis that grips Russia. In fact, Russia's default set off the latest round of capital flight that has led investors to pull their cash out of emerging markets around the globe, creating waves of financial instability.
That instability has since coursed through the American financial system, and contributed to the Federal Reserve's decision today to cut interest rates for the second time in less than three weeks.
The Fed's move was motivated largely by signs of growing distress in the domestic economy. At the same time, though, it offers Mr. Clinton a chance to argue that the United States is moving on two fronts: Lowering interest rates to spur growth around the globe, and playing a far more direct, aggressive role in preventing financial meltdowns before they occur.
But the entire strategy depended on winning an agreement with Congressional Republicans who portrayed the I.M.F. as incompetent and misguided, an "economic arsonist" in the words of the House majority leader, Dick Armey.
In private meetings in the last two weeks with Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, though, Mr. Armey took a far more conciliatory pose, according to Administration officials and Congressional aides who attended the meetings.
"The world has changed in the past few months," said one Administration official, referring to Russia's default on its debt and the subsequent panic among investors that has spread across the globe. "People sort of get it now that it is a bit scary out there."
The Administration's hope is that the mere act of refilling the fund's fuel tanks will infuse the markets with a bit more confidence that the world's lender of last resort can stay in business.
But the Administration is clearly considering taking steps that go beyond deploying the fund's resources.
There are more and more signals, for example, that once Congress is out of town Mr. Rubin may dip into an American fund under his control, called the Emergency Stabilization Fund, to provide some kind of backup financing for Brazil, in case money from the I.M.F., the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank proves insufficient.
"We have excluded no options," a senior Treasury official said last week.
In return for the $18 billion, the Administration agreed to a series of conditions, including pressing for higher interest rates for major monetary fund loans, far greater disclosure of information about the economic conditions of member countries and the establishment of two advisory committees to monitor the fund and other elements of the global regulatory structure.
But the Administration was able to steer Republicans away from their first impulse: To make reform of the I.M.F. a condition of American financing. Instead, the Treasury Secretary has to certify that the Group of Seven industrial nations support the revisions, which would virtually assure their passage by the fund's board.
In Paris today, Michel Camdessus, managing director of the I.M.F., said he believed there would be little problem enacting the changes Congress sought, and said several -- especially the publication of more financial data about countries receiving the fund's aid -- had been in place for a year.
"The world needs to know that the I.M.F. has the resources it requires," Mr. Camdessus said. "I hope the rest of the world will all ratify in turn the increase in resources."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "FOR THE RECORD -- Funds for the I.M.F.: The Conditions"
 
After months of debate on Capitol Hill, House Republicans pared down their demands on the I.M.F. Here are the highlights:
 
Greater Public Disclosure
The Treasury will certify to Congress that the seven largest industrial nations, which control 43 percent of the votes on the I.M.F.'s board, will vote for the publication of agreements that the I.M.F. reaches with countries. It will also press for disclosure of the board's discussions, track records of I.M.F. programs and annual economic reviews of member countries.
 
Interest Rates
The U.S. will certify that it and its allies support an increase in interest rates to about 7 percent on I.M.F. loans. This would push countries to repay the I.M.F. quickly and refinance their loans privately.
 
Social Impact
The U.S. will use its "voice and vote" to study the effects of I.M.F. loans on the poor, on the working class and on labor standards.
 
Review of I.M.F.
A congressional advisory committee will review global financial structures.The Treasury will also create an advisory committee on the I.M.F.
 
Reporting Requirements
The Treasury will make a detailed evaluation of I.M.F. operations in a report to Congress.
 
Competition With American Industry
In South Korea, the Treasury will certify that I.M.F. funds are not subsidizing those industries that compete with American manufacturers.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
FEDERAL RESERVE CUTS RATES AGAIN; WALL ST. SURGES

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve unexpectedly cut interest rates today, warning that a growing wave of fear among investors and lenders was threatening to derail the nation's long economic expansion.
The cut, by one-quarter of a percentage point, was the first time in four and a half years that the central bank had changed interest rate policy outside one of its regularly scheduled meetings. Stunned, Wall Street responded with a powerful rally, sending stock prices up more than 330 points, with investors brushing aside concerns about a possible credit squeeze and market instability. 
 Although economists had become increasingly convinced that the Federal Reserve would cut rates at its two remaining meetings this year, the unusual timing of today's move suggested that the central bank sees the economic outlook deteriorating as the financial crisis that began last year in Asia hits the United States even harder. Page C1.
The channel through which the domestic economy is being most affected, moreover, has been a headlong flight by investors from any hint of risk, a psychological shift that can be difficult for policy makers to control and counter.
Acting on his own authority after consulting by telephone with members of the Fed's policy-making committee, Alan Greenspan, the chairman, reduced the Federal funds target for the overnight lending rate between banks by a quarter-point, to 5 percent. The cut was intended to encourage more lending and to bolster the economy by making it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow. The Fed had cut the target rate by a quarter-point at its last regular meeting 16 days ago.
The central bank's board also approved a quarter-point reduction in the discount rate on loans from the Federal Reserve to banks. The cut, to 4.75 percent, was the first change in the largely symbolic discount rate since January 1996.
"Growing caution by lenders and unsettled conditions in financial markets more generally are likely to be restraining aggregate demand in the future," the Federal Reserve said in a statement, referring to the likelihood of a slowdown. "Against this backdrop, further easing of the stance of monetary policy was judged to be warranted to sustain economic growth in the context of contained inflation."
Several banks quickly reduced their prime rates on loans to their best customers, setting off a cycle that could lead to slightly lower rates on credit cards, auto loans and other loans to consumers. While the Federal Reserve's action does not directly affect mortgage rates, which have been creeping up from very low levels, it could help push them back down by putting pressure on the long-term rates set in the bond market. The Fed disclosed its action in a news release at 3:15 P.M., just after President Clinton and Republican leaders in Congress announced that they had reached a budget agreement.
The interest rate cut sent stock prices soaring around the world. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 330.58, its third-biggest point gain ever, to close at 8,299.36, its highest level since Aug. 26.
Bond prices also surged. The dollar, which has been sliding sharply against the Japanese yen, fell again.
Economists said the rate reduction was justified by recent signs that the economy, which had been humming along through much of this year at a healthy if somewhat slower pace, was beginning to lose steam and could even lapse into recession next year.
But the abruptness of the reduction led to widespread questions about whether the Fed was acting to head off an as-yet-unpublicized problem at a financial institution or investment fund that might further damage the already-fragile market psychology. The markets have been especially skittish since the near-collapse last month of Long-Term Capital Management L.P., the prominent hedge fund.
"Whenever the Fed does something out of the ordinary, it makes you wonder, and the first thing that comes to mind is whether there is some other financial market land mine out there," said Paul L. Kasriel, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "Obviously they felt a need to move that couldn't wait a month. It's a bit of a mystery."
There were no immediate signs of any bank or investment firm running into deep trouble. But Mr. Greenspan and other policy makers in Washington have been fretting in public for the last week about how the crisis of confidence has affected even the safest haven, the market for United States Treasury securities.
For the last several months, investors worldwide have been dumping stocks and bonds almost indiscriminately and putting their money into Treasury bonds. But in recent weeks economists have noticed that within the Treasury market investors are increasingly buying only the newest issues, which tend to trade most readily, and avoiding older issues, for which there is a less liquid market.
As Mr. Greenspan pointed out in a speech last week, investors are therefore demanding not just safety in their investments but the ability to sell them instantaneously. The development was a troublesome sign, Mr. Greenspan suggested, because companies are already having trouble raising money in the stock and bond markets and banks are showing signs of pulling back on new lending.
If their access to money dried up, businesses would have to cut back on their investments in new technology and equipment, which have driven much of the economy's growth in recent years.
"There was a serious threat emerging," James Glassman, an economist at Chase Securities, said. "What is now a Wall Street problem threatened to become a Main Street problem. What the Fed is doing now makes me less pessimistic about the risks next year."
For much of this year the Fed debated whether it needed to raise interest rates to head off the possibility that the combination of steady growth and very low unemployment would set off a wage and price spiral. Last spring, Mr. Greenspan held off pressure from the Fed's inflation hawks for a rate increase. And when the financial crisis that began last year in Asia rolled through Russia this summer, creating a sense of near-panic among investors, he began laying the groundwork for a rate cut and followed through with a quarter-point reduction on Sept. 26.
In moving today, more than a month before the next scheduled Fed meeting on Nov. 17, Mr. Greenspan again asserted his power at the Fed, sweeping aside any remaining objections from colleagues who think rate cuts could backfire if the economy proves more resilient than it appears. Eight of the 12 Federal Reserve banks requested the cut in the discount rate.
It is unclear whether Mr. Greenspan had specifically requested the authority from the policy-making committee to cut rates another quarter-point before the next meeting.
Mr. Greenspan had room to move, though, precisely because there have been so few signs of inflation in the economy. Although the Government reported today that the prices paid by producers for finished goods rose three-tenths of a percent in September, the biggest rise in a year, economists said that the increase came largely from jumps in automobile and vegetable prices and that there were no signs of price increases in earlier stages of the production process.
The Federal Reserve's action came against a backdrop of efforts by policy makers around the world to bring the financial crisis under control. Japan took a big step this week toward addressing the problems that have paralyzed its banking system, agreeing on a plan to spend up to $500 billion to shore up ailing institutions.
And today, Congress came to a final agreement with the Clinton Administration on new money for the International Monetary Fund, which is assembling a package of financial aid for Brazil. Pressure is growing on Germany's powerful central bank to consider a rate cut; Britain and Spain have both cut rates in the last week.
"It's like a global United Way pledge drive," Mr. Kasriel said.
Some analysts said the rate cuts by the Fed would not have as powerful a stimulative effect on the domestic economy as they would under normal circumstances. That is because the long-term rates set in the markets are already relatively low and the most interest-sensitive sectors of the economy, especially housing, are already booming.
But they said the rate cuts were clearly driving down the dollar's value, especially against the Japanese currency. The fall in the dollar, they said, would help make American goods somewhat more competitive on international markets, giving a slight boost to the economy. And to the extent that the weakening dollar increases the relative value of the yen, it will help inject more confidence into the moribund Japanese economy and avert further devaluations by other Asian countries.

In a Surprise Move, Fed Reduces Interest Rates
After consulting with members of the Federal Reserve policy-making committee, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, unexpectedly cut interest rates by one-quarter of a percentage point. The move came against a backdrop of growing fear among investors and lenders that the nation's economic expansion is slowing. 
 The action was the first time in four and a half years that the central bank changed interest rate policy outside of one its normally scheduled meetings. It stunned Wall Street, which responded with a powerful rally that sent the Dow Jones industrial average up more than 330 points. Page A1.
 
Treasury bond prices surged after the interest rate cut. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 4.97 percent, from 5.03 percent. C4.

Zapata, which said it would become the No. 1 site on the Internet by buying up dozens of small Web sites, is backing off that plan and evaluating its on-line strategy because of the decline in Internet stocks. C2.
 
$1.7 Trillion Budget Deal Approved
President Clinton and Congress reached agreement on the final portion of the nation's $1.7 trillion budget, the first in three decades brought forth with a surplus and one that offers the biggest peacetime increase in military spending since 1985. A1.
 
With the final deal struck in Congress to inject $18 billion into the depleted coffers of the International Monetary Fund, the Clinton Administration said it now had more political leeway to attempt new strategies in fighting the continuing global financial turmoil. A8.
 
Producer Prices Moved Higher
Higher costs for new cars and trucks pushed up the prices paid to producers in September at the fastest rate in a year, a statistical fluke that analysts said did not portend a lasting acceleration of inflation. C8.
 
 
U.S. Loses World Trade Group Case
The World Trade Organization has ruled that the United States is not evenhandedly applying a law that bans certain shrimp imports, while saying that the law itself does not violate international trade rules. C8.
 
Delta Earnings Surpass Estimates
Delta Air Lines reported quarterly earnings that easily surpassed Wall Street's estimates. Delta, the country's third-largest airline, said net income rose 29 percent, to $327 million, or $4.16 a diluted share, compared with $254 million, or $3.26 a share, in the period a year earlier. Analysts estimated that the carrier would earn $3.90 a share. Delta's shares leaped $7, to $93.50. C3.
 
Coca-Cola earned $888 million, or 36 cents a diluted share, in line with estimates. C2.
 
Proposal to Simplify Disclosure
The Securities and Exchange Commission proposed rules to let public companies sell their stocks and bonds more quickly and cheaply as part of a move to simplify corporate finance disclosure.

HEADLINE: So Many Fans, So Few Tickets;
A Long Line, but Most Series Seats Go to the Connected

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
Whether you were one of the true die-hards who could recite the batting averages of even the Yankees' minor league players or someone still unaware that there is a position known as designated hitter, there was passionate unity yesterday in trying to achieve a nearly impossible goal: getting tickets to the World Series.
At 1 P.M. at Yankee Stadium, after a quiz-show-type drama involving plastic wristbands and numbered baseballs plucked out of gym bags, the few thousand tickets ceded to the public went on sale for this weekend's Games 1 and 2. But far more of the tickets were in the grip of corporations, season-ticket holders and scalpers, and throughout the city, New Yorkers mounted frenzied campaigns through every conceivable connection to acquire the most coveted prize in town. 
 Rarely has the gulf between supply and demand been so enormous. The supply is about 57,000. The demand is about 8 million.
There is nothing at all egalitarian about the ticket distribution. The way these things always go, relatively few of the rabid, shout-out-your-lungs fans who have eaten the hot dogs and swilled the beer and rooted for the Yankees week in and week out during the regular season will be inside the stadium for the Series, which begins tomorrow night.
In fact, the seating capacity of Yankee Stadium is just under 57,000. The number of tickets sold to the public yesterday was supposed to have been about 5,000 per game, one-third as many as were sold two years ago when the Yankees last competed in the World Series, and at double the prices. The algorithm that accounts for where the missing seats went was beyond the capacity of baseball fans, who have no problem computing slugging percentages.
Many of this year's seats will go to the roughly 15,000 part- and full-season Yankee ticket holders. Major League Baseball parcels out the rest among the other big-league teams; baseball's national corporate sponsors and licensees; the networks with broadcasting contracts; the Baseball Writer's Association, and the National and American League offices.
Why were the Yankees selling 10,000 fewer seats per game to the public? The explanation by team officials was that there were about the same number of season-ticket holders as two years ago, but that more are full-season ticket holders who are entitled to buy twice as many seats as they hold. And they said that sponsor commitments had multiplied.
The most visible manifestation of the ticket mania was outside Yankee Stadium. People camped on the asphalt outside the stadium for more than a day, enduring rain and cold and raucous sleeping conditions, in the hope of getting seats. Thousands left with little more than sore backs and the prospect of another World Series in front of the television.
Starting at 7 A.M. yesterday, wristbands with four-digit numbers on them were handed out to the people in line, until 5,000 bracelets had been distributed. They were numbered from 5000 to 9999. The supply was exhausted by 10 A.M., with several thousand people left empty-wristed.
At 12:30, four Yankee gym bags filled with baseballs numbered from 0 to 9 were arrayed in front of Joe Torre, the Yankee manager. With circus music playing in the background, he pulled one ball from each bag, and those formed the number for who got first shot at tickets. It was 7427. Whoever had No. 7428 would go second, then 7429 and so forth. Everyone with a bracelet was expected to be entitled to buy two tickets to either of the first two games against the San Diego Padres. As it turned out, however, the tickets ran out well before everyone got to the window.
Damon Sebastian -- a 46-year-old chef from the Upper West Side whose wristband was 6734, putting him 4,306th in order to buy tickets -- said the ticket windows ran out of seats just before 7 P.M., when he was still a few hundred feet from the window. This suggests that more than 700 people with wristbands never got tickets and that the stadium might have sold considerably fewer than it had estimated it would.
"This is a big sham," Mr. Sebastian said, incensed. "Nobody's math could be that bad. There are kids here crying and everything." He said that he had been at the stadium since 7:35 Wednesday morning. "That's 30 hours taken out of my life," he said.
No. 7427 was on the wrist of Jim McDaniel, 26, a telemarketer from Haddon Heights, N.J., who had arrived at the stadium around 2:30 A.M. yesterday with three friends. He bought seats in the tier boxes almost directly behind home plate. He said he was going to take his father. "He doesn't know I'm up here," he said. "I can't believe I'm actually going to get tickets."
The first person in line was the much-interviewed Michael Ansolone, 21, from Stony Point, N.Y. His bracelet carried a heartsick number: 6956. That meant he would be the 4,528th person to buy tickets. But before he got to the window, the tickets were gone. He had called his job and contrived a story about a stomach virus. "I don't think I'd go through this again," he said.
Among the unlucky were Daisy Larson, a secretary from Brooklyn, and her husband, Michael Soto, who has metal rods in his back and can't sit for long. "I was trying," she said. "I got up at 4:30 and we left the house at 5:30." When they got to the stadium, the line was 11 blocks long. "I'm not ashamed to say I cried today," she said.
Considerable vitriol was exchanged about how few tickets were allotted for the ordinary fan. "I've been a Yankee fan since I was 13," said Jim Boggs, who works for Coca-Cola and drove two and a half hours from Somers Point, N.J. "Nine thousand tickets for the general public for two games. That's completely outrageous."
Anthony Ricucci, 24, who lives in the Bronx, said: "I'm a financial consultant trainee at a big brokerage firm. There's people in my company who got tickets because they know somebody, and they don't even want to go, and they're selling them for $600 or $1,000 apiece. I don't have that kind of money."
In these days of no inflation, ticket prices for the Series are up more than 100 percent. They are $150 for a box seat, $100 for reserved seats and $40 for the bleachers, compared with $70, $45 and $25 for the 1996 Series. In looking at other professional sporting events, Major League Baseball said it had concluded that World Series prices were undervalued.
Ticket brokers and scalpers were already advertising choice seats at prices edging into the thousands of dollars. Two brokers contacted from classified ads in The New York Post said they had tickets priced as high as $2,500. The brokers, who refused to give their names, said they got the tickets from various sources, including contacts at the stadium and people hired to stand in line. The police said that during the playoffs, scalpers brought in people from homeless shelters in New Jersey to wait in line. In 1996, counterfeit tickets also made it onto the market.
Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco's office said yesterday that its undercover investigators bought divisional playoff tickets from brokers at inflated prices and that it was going to announce legal action against at least two brokers as early as today. Investigators are now pursuing World Series tickets.
David Corvette, a spokesman for Mr. Vacco, said season-ticket holders and "diggers," the people paid to stand in line, could not account for the volume and quality of the tickets that brokers are pushing. He said investigators were looking into the possibility of "ice" -- money being paid to stadium insiders who are selling tickets being held for V.I.P.'s and players' wives.
Despite a heavy police presence at Yankee Stadium yesterday, dozens of scalpers, most of them teen-agers organized in roving bands, were doing business, both selling and trying to buy seats. To elude capture, they exchanged tickets away from the street, according to fans who said they encountered scalpers in the bowling alley facing the stadium, in coffee shops and even in a portable toilet outside a parking lot on 157th Street. There was considerable bargaining. One scalper offered a box seat for $1,000, then quickly came down to $400 apiece for two seats.
Tickets for Games 6 and 7, if they are necessary, are to be sold only through Ticketmaster beginning tomorrow at 1 P.M. The three middle games are in San Diego.
It is a matter of religious faith among prominent, well-connected New Yorkers that they can get anything with one phone call, two at the outside. And so throughout the city, people were working every network they knew to find their own tickets, many without luck.
For certain people, the pitches and runs are less important than their friends knowing that they were at the game. A 21-year-old designer of computer networks, who would give his name only as John, was shopping yesterday at Cigar Landing, a store in the Morgan Stanley building in Times Square. He said he had managed to land two box tickets on the third-base side for tomorrow's game. He said he paid $750 apiece to a broker. Why? "I like to do it because there are so many people who can't," he said.
A logical person to pester in these desperate hours is Howard Rubenstein, the New York public relations man who is a spokesman for George M. Steinbrenner 3d, the Yankees' principal owner. "I must have had 150 calls between yesterday and today," he said. "From clients, media, people I haven't spoken to in 10 years."
Someone from the theater industry called Mr. Rubenstein and promised seats to an impossibly sold-out show in return for Series tickets. Someone who was involved in treating Mr. Rubenstein's bad back not long ago phoned from a hospital.
There was one answer: Sorry. Mr. Rubenstein does have a suite at Yankee Stadium that holds 26. As he did for the last World Series, he plans to invite media people. But no clients.
Another popular fellow was Rick Cerrone, the Yankees' spokesman. He has a message on his answering machine warning callers that if they are inquiring about tickets, he doesn't have any. It has had negligible effect. He is making a great many apparent new friends and renewing countless long-lapsed acquaintances. As Mr. Cerrone put it, "It's such a coincidence that people pick October to call you and see how you're doing."

HEADLINE: Holdover From Solid South Tries to Defy G.O.P.'s Tide

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: GREENVILLE, S.C., Oct. 14

 BODY:
He is, quite simply, the last of his kind.
Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, his hair so white that it emits a translucent glow, is the only Southern Democrat of his era remaining in a chamber once distinguished by the breed. For 32 years, he has survived by knowing which backs to slap, which arms to twist and which chits to call in the service of winning highway funds and military appropriations for a desperately needy state. 
 For most of that period, South Carolinians were grateful for any morsels dropped from Washington's table. But South Carolina, like the rest of its region, has been transformed over the years, from a dependent economy into an assertive one, and from a Democratic stronghold into a Republican fortress.
As the 76-year-old Mr. Hollings runs for re-election to a sixth full term, the question is whether the state he has served for 50 years -- as legislator, Lieutenant Governor, Governor and Senator -- will finally leave him behind. Other than the Comptroller General, Mr. Hollings is the only statewide-elected Democrat left in South Carolina.
And thus this year's Senate campaign between Mr. Hollings and his Republican opponent, Representative Bob Inglis, serves as something of a referendum on whether any role remains in the state, and in the South, for a party that went all but unchallenged in the early days of Mr. Hollings's career.
There are now 7 Democrats in the Senate from the 11 states of the old Confederacy, down from 16 in 1980.
"So much rides on this race as far as the South is concerned," said Charles W. Dunn, a Clemson University political scientist. "If the Democrats can't save this seat, what seat can they save and how can they recruit candidates? If Hollings loses, it's almost like Sherman has finished his march."
Polls show the race to be tight, with Mr. Hollings holding a slight lead of 49 percent to 42 percent in a Mason-Dixon survey taken two weeks ago. While political analysts generally commend Mr. Hollings's campaign strategy and work ethic, they note that the Senator failed to put his underfinanced opponent away in September, when he had the advertising airwaves to himself.
They also said that the outcome could be influenced by a number of outside forces. In the race for governor, a surprisingly competitive effort by Jim Hodges, the Democratic challenger to Gov. David M. Beasley, seems to be exciting the Democratic base, a benefit to Mr. Hollings. But Mr. Inglis, a member of the Judiciary Committee who has demanded President Clinton's resignation, may be aided by strong sentiment in South Carolina about the White House sex scandal.
The choice for South Carolinians could not be starker. While Mr. Hollings is best known for his commitment to deficit reduction, he remains an advocate of Federal activism in areas like education, housing and the arts. Mr. Inglis, on the other hand, typifies the South's new Republicanism and its anti-Government leanings.
At 39, Mr. Inglis, a three-term Congressman, is barely half Mr. Hollings's age. He is a father of five who sleeps on an air mattress in his Congressional office. While Mr. Hollings hails from Charleston, the static old seaport of elegant homes and Democratic faith, Mr. Inglis represents the burgeoning Greenville-Spartanburg metropolitan area, which is infused with new foreign investment and fervent Christian conservatism.
Mr. Hollings speaks in a mumbled, sometimes unintelligible drawl, and his acerbic wit has produced a compendium of impolitic comments. The bookish, bespectacled Mr. Inglis, by contrast, reveals virtually no accent and lectures with the measured deliberateness of an economics professor.
While Mr. Hollings campaigns on his ability to get things done, Mr. Inglis rejects the very premise of pork barrel politics and has shaped his campaign around the preachy theme of "principle over politics."
Mr. Inglis has hindered his own campaign by refusing to accept contributions from political action committees, limiting his projected budget to about $2 million, a third less than Mr. Hollings has already spent. And in a state with more seniority in the Senate than any in history -- 74 years between Mr. Hollings and his 95-year-old colleague, Strom Thurmond -- Mr. Inglis argues that tenure counts for little in today's Republican Congress. He has vowed to serve only two terms, just as he promised to serve only three in the House.
"If principle doesn't win in politics, then I'm not very interested in winning," he said in an interview. "Before, we were the redheaded stepchild of the nation and we needed anything we could get to lift us out of this desperate poverty we were in. Now what South Carolinians are realizing is they that prefer free enterprise opportunity to a Government guarantee."
Where was the value of seniority, Mr. Inglis asked, when the Federal Government recently closed military bases in Charleston and Myrtle Beach and eliminated thousands of jobs at the Savannah River Site nuclear plant?
"It's not an attack on the Senator's effectiveness," he said, noting that the Pentagon's base closure commission has usurped the seniority spoils system. "It's not that he was asleep at the switch. It's that the world has changed, for the better."
Mr. Hollings, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Commerce Committee and one of the most senior members on Appropriations, scoffs at this notion. The value of seniority, he said, can be seen in his ability to place other Federal agencies at the Charleston base after the Navy withdrew.
Furthermore, Mr. Hollings said in a debate in Greer on Tuesday night that Mr. Inglis will be "a lame duck by the time he gets up there with this silly term limits thing."
"He won't even get a good committee," the Senator said. "He won't be a voice. He'll be hardly a whisper from South Carolina."
After listing a number of interstate highway projects that he helped secure for South Carolina, Mr. Hollings added: "He continues to call it pork. This is Government. This is the way it works."
Indeed, Mr. Inglis has crusaded against pork, a sustaining staple of South Carolina politics, with both his words and his votes. In the House, he opposed Federal financing for an interstate highway connector in his home district and for a badly needed bridge in Charleston. He did so, he said, because the money was being earmarked for politically influenced projects that bypassed the state's priority list. Instead, a toll road is being built to connect the Interstates in Greenville, prompting Mr. Hollings to refer to his opponent as "Toll Road Bob."
Mr. Inglis's stands may seem noble to those who do not spend rush hours stalled on Interstate 385, said Marc T. Belk, a store manager in Greenville who confronted Mr. Inglis at a campaign stop here this week. "This fellow here is going to Washington and voting against our interests," Mr. Belk said. "He's like the guy in fourth grade who reminded the teacher when she didn't collect the homework."
If South Carolinians perceive Mr. Inglis as moralistic, he does not seem to mind. His strategy centers on making the campaign a referendum on Mr. Hollings, and if his style draws a contrast with that of the tart-tongued incumbent, all the better.
Mr. Inglis regularly asserts that South Carolinians should expect more civility from their representatives. He travels the state in a red motor home emblazoned with the slogan: "Finally, someone's listening!" His aides at headquarters answer the telephone by saying, "It's a great day at Inglis for Senate." At the debate in Greer, as at most appearances, Mr. Inglis said that South Carolinians should "expect a senator to be civil to you, expect him to listen, expect him not to denigrate you, not to humiliate you."
Such comments are a reference to Mr. Hollings's reputation for aloofness and arrogance. To reinforce that point, the State Republican Party recently broadcast an advertisement that included footage of Mr. Hollings giving a speech on election night in 1992. Thinking that he had run his last race, and perhaps bruised by his narrow victory margin of three percentage points, Mr. Hollings blurted: "I don't have to get elected to a blooming thing. And I don't have to do things that are politically correct. The hell with everybody." Then he added: "I'm free at last."
Six years later, Mr. Hollings cannot seem to mask his indignation at being challenged by Mr. Inglis, whom he dismisses as a hypocrite. And in recent days, the Senator has played willingly into Mr. Inglis's strategy. In an interview on Wednesday with The Herald of Rock Hill, S.C., Mr. Hollings mocked Mr. Inglis as "so oozing and goozing and such a nice little choirboy and so pleasant, and everybody's rude, and he wants to be courteous. He is a goddamn skunk. I can tell you that right now."
Mr. Inglis responded: "I guess he's right about me being a choirboy. That's not my style to use that kind of language."
Mr. Hollings is capable of joking about his style, telling a big crowd at a Democratic fish fry in Fair Lawn on Monday night that he and his wife, Peatsy, get along so well because they are "both in love with the same fella." But he also said in an interview that his arrogance pales compared to Mr. Inglis's.
"Here's a fellow that rode in on the Christian right in the big wave we had in '92, done nothing for anybody and all of a sudden he's going to change and give us a new setup," Mr. Hollings said. "Now if you talk about arrogance, egads. I can be a little arrogant, but he's big arrogant. He wins first prize on arrogance."
Defiantly unreconstructed to the end, Mr. Hollings said he was running one more time to stem the Republican tide. On Nov. 3, voters will decide whether his era will end on his own terms.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET DEAL: AGRICULTURE;
Proposed Farm Aid Signals A Shift in Economic Winds

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, By The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 15

 BODY:
The agreement to spend $6 billion on the nation's farmers marks a departure, at least in spirit, from a landmark 1996 measure intended to move agriculture into a free market economy.
The aid, which comes in addition to the more than $5 billion that has already been appropriated for farmers this year, is intended to salve an agricultural economy that has been hurt by weather disasters, crop diseases and falling commodity prices. 
 The bid to rescue farmers is a contrast to the 1996 law, under which subsidies will be phased out by 2002.
"Congress is demonstrating an unwillingness to let the free market control the agricultural economy -- at least in an election year," said Neil Harl, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University. "There is a big upside to the market approach. And there's a big downside. And that downside causes pain."
The bill earmarks about $3 billion for farmers hurt by disaster, especially in the Southwest and the upper Great Plains. Farmers in Oklahoma and Texas endured severe drought, while those in the Dakotas saw crops devastated by disease.
The bill also includes about $2.5 billion to help farmers hurt by falling crop prices, a result of stronger foreign competition, especially in South America, as well as weaker import demands, particularly in Asia. Prices have also been driven down by the good weather that brought abundant harvests in the central Midwestern states, which produce most of the nation's corn and soybeans.
"This is definitely going to help," said Brent Kleinsasser, a grain farmer in Huron, S.D. "But is it going to make or break many farmers? I don't think so."
The measure also gives $200 million in subsidies to dairy farmers, although milk prices have strongly rebounded lately, and $200 million for stockmen, especially in the Southwest, where forage for grazing cattle burned in the intense heat.
The bill was a compromise between a Republican measure that would have spent about $4.2 billion and a Democratic version that would have spent about $7 billion. President Clinton vetoed the Republican measure last week.
Farm groups generally praised the bill. Mary Kay Thatcher, a spokeswoman for the American Farm Bureau, which usually supports the Republican view on agriculture, said the measure kept the Federal Government out of farming decisions, a tenet of the 1996 measure.
Democrats in the Upper Great Plains, sometimes known as the "prairie populists" -- a group that includes Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota -- had hoped to restore some Government control over planting decisions that were eliminated by the 1996 law. In the view of some critics of the 1996 measure, including the more liberal National Farmers Union, the free market approach has led to overproduction of some crops, causing prices to fall.
"We've seen what happens when the market takes over -- prices drop through the floor," said Marilyn Wentz, a spokeswoman for the National Farmers Union. Ms. Wentz said the new money would help many farmers avoid foreclosure. Nearly a quarter of farmers in some parts of the Southwest had been facing financial failure, she said.
The bill also underscores the powerful influence of agriculture on the nation's political debate. Only about 600,000 commercial farmers remain, but millions of Americans can trace their ancestry to the farm and see the way of life as a symbol of American virtue.
Support for the subsidies started last summer, when politicians in the Dakotas urged President Clinton to help farmers with a payment of $500 million. Farmers and politicians in other states then called for relief, as crop prices fell.
Critics of subsidies have long complained that farmers have no special right to a safety net. Unsuccessful farms should fail, just like unsuccessful drug stores and auto repair shops, critics say.
But Mr. Kleinsasser, the South Dakota farmer, said farmers were not the only ones who gained from aid to agriculture.
"The more farms there are, the longer food will stay cheap," he said. "When you get a handful of big corporations that control food production, the prices would go way up."

HEADLINE: Men Held in Beating Lived on the Fringes

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: DENVER, Oct. 15

 BODY:
Within two hours one night last week, Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, Colo., admitted two young men from different sides of a social and sexual chasm in the small city of Laramie, Wyo.
 In one room lay Matthew Shepard, a gay 21-year-old freshman at the University of Wyoming and a graduate of the American School in Switzerland, who had been robbed and severely beaten in an episode that the authorities say was at least partly linked to his sexual orientation.
Four rooms away lay one of Mr. Shepard's accused assailants, Aaron J. McKinney, a 22-year-old roofer who dropped out of high school. Mr. McKinney, the father of a new baby, had suffered a hairline fracture of the skull in an attack on two Hispanic men after Mr. Shepard's beating, the police say. 
 Mr. McKinney and a friend, Russell A. Henderson, have been charged with first-degree murder in the fatal beating of Mr. Shepard on the night of Oct. 6. Mr. Shepard was left tied to a ranch fence in near-freezing weather, in a case that has captured national attention for its brutality. It has also reinvigorated the debate about hate crimes, provoking comment from President Clinton and Wyoming's Governor.
The case also reveals much about Laramie, a college town where higher education provides the economic mainstay and the conservative ranching culture reigns, and where all of those involved in the Shepard case lived on the fringes.
Mr. McKinney, known around Laramie for his short temper and willingness to brawl, was awaiting sentencing for burglarizing $2,500 from a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant before Mr. Shepard's beating.
After the attack on Mr. Shepard, the Laramie police said, Mr. McKinney returned to town and picked a fight with two Hispanic youths who were walking down the street.
One of the youths, Emiliano Morales 3d, 19, recalled that a man, whom he later identified as Mr. McKinney, jumped him near a park just after midnight on Oct. 7. He said his friend Jeremy Herrara, 18, had tried to warn him of the impending attack.
"Jeremy yelled, 'He's got a gun!' " Mr. Morales said, and then the assailant "hit me in the head."
"Jeremy ran up and hit him with a stick," he continued. "and we took off."
Mr. Morales received 21 staples to repair his cut scalp. No charges have been filed in that fight.
Like Mr. McKinney, Mr. Henderson dropped out of Laramie High School, taking jobs, and most recently, repairing roofs. By the time of his arrest last week, he had committed several driving offenses and had two convictions for drunken driving.
He lived with his girlfriend, Chasity V. Pasely, in a rented trailer.
"I perceived him as a follower," said Sherry Aanenson, who owned the couple's small trailer and charged them $340 a month rent. "I have a hard time imagining him coming up with anything like this on his own. It seems extremely out of character, but sometimes people make really bad choices."
If Russell Henderson was a quiet follower, Aaron McKinney was a young man with a short fuse.
About five years ago, his mother died and he came into a small inheritance, enough to allow him to buy a 1967 Mustang. After his arrest last December in the burglary of the fast-food store, he moved to Florida with his girlfriend, Kristen L. Price.
In July, their son, Cameron, was born and they returned to Laramie, renting a first-floor apartment in a rundown wooden house. Ms. Price, also a dropout from Laramie High, took care of their baby full time.
On Monday, Travis Brin, a high school acquaintance of Mr. McKinney, told The Rocky Mountain News how the volatile young man once "flipped out" in a Laramie bar on encountering the doctor who had treated his mother. "He was yelling at this guy, blaming him for his mother's death," Mr. Brin recalled. "They almost called the cops to get him out of there. After that, I didn't want to be around him much."
At one point in recent months, Mr. McKinney took a conflict-resolution class in Laramie. Friends of Mr. Henderson have said that he did not seem to have any animosity to homosexuals. But Brendan Murphy, an acquaintance of Mr. McKinney, said Mr. McKinney had expressed prejudiced toward both homosexuals and racial minorities.
Mr. Murphy told the News: "He'd say really ignorant things."
On the night of Oct. 6, Mr. Henderson and his high school buddy were cruising Laramie in a pickup truck borrowed from Mr. McKinney's father, Bill. Stopping by the Fireside, a campus hangout, they pooled their money to pay $5.50 for a pitcher of beer, paying in coins. It was in the bar that they met Mr. Shepard.
After beating Mr. Shepard and stealing his wallet, the two men returned to their homes and made anti-gay remarks to their girlfriends, Laramie police say. The two women, police say, invented an alibi for their boyfriends and dumped Mr. Henderson's clothing in a trash bin and his bloody shoes in a storage shed at the apartment of Ms. Pasely's mother.
"He was crying, and he kept throwing up," Ms. Price said in an interview with the ABC News program "20-20." "He just came in and hugged me, and said, 'I've done something horrible. I deserve to die.' "
Ms. Price and Ms. Pasely have been arraigned on charges of being accessories after the fact. If convicted they face penalties of up to three years in jail and up to $3,000 in fines.
Their boyfriends have been charged with kidnapping, aggravated robbery and first-degree murder. Bond has been suspended until prosecutors decide whether to ask for the death penalty.
Ms. Price has told reporters that her boyfriend said the primary motive was robbery, but that he was also embarrassed when Mr. Shepard made a pass at him at the Fireside.
"He said that a guy walked up to him, and said that he was gay and wanted to get with Aaron and Russ," Ms. Price recalled to "20-20." The two men beat him, she said, "to teach him a lesson not to come on to straight people."
Two months before he was killed, Mr. Shepard was involved in another altercation, with a man who claims that he struck him because he had flirted with him. The kind of violence in this case fits national patterns in anti-gay crimes, several experts in the field say.
"Once someone is labeled as homosexual, any glance or conversation by that person is perceived as sexual flirtation," Karen Frankin, a forensic psychologist, wrote in a recent paper. "Flirtation, in turn, is viewed as a legitimate reason to assault."
"Self defense" from homosexual overtures, ideological opposition to homosexuals, thrill seeking and peer approval were the main justifications for assaulting homosexuals given in an anonymous survey conducted by Dr. Franklin conducted recently.
Young men account for 80 percent to 90 percent of people arrested for "gay bashing" crimes, said Valerie Jenness, a sociology professor who teaches a course on hate crimes at the University of California in Irvine. "This youth variable tells us they are working out identity issues, making the transition away from home into adulthood."
Many communities foster the problem, these researchers said, by signaling to young people that gays are fair targets for attack. In Laramie, for example, a billboard message was altered in December 1993 to proclaim, under a brace of pistols, "Shoot a gay or two." At a time when Mr. McKinney and Mr. Henderson were teen-agers at Laramie High, the message greeted hundreds of drivers daily for over a month, until a visiting gay activist erased it.
"The impact of a billboard like that is far more significant than people might imagine," said Brian Levin, director of the Center on Hate and Extremism at Stockton College, in Pomona, N.J. "Young people are a sponge for rhetoric that goes through society, from a billboard to the dinner table. These young men could actually believe they are doing the bidding of their overall community."

Sorority Suspended for Float
 FORT COLLINS, Colo., Oct. 15 (AP) -- A sorority at Colorado State University that co-sponsored a parade float that mocked homosexuals after the fatal beating of a gay college student has surrendered its charter. The scarecrow with the words "I'm Gay" appeared on a float sponsored by the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity and the Alpha Chi Omega sorority. Pi Kappa Alpha officials said the float had been vandalized and the anti-gay epithet added to the figure.
Disciplinary hearings will begin early next week for as many as 11 fraternity and sorority members.

HEADLINE: Trump Starts A New Tower Near the U.N.

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Donald J. Trump, who has already left his sizable imprint on New York City's skyline, is starting work on what he says will be the tallest residential building in the world, a $360 million slender glass monolith across the street from the United Nations complex.
The bronze-colored tower, to rise 861 feet, or 72 stories, above First Avenue, is proceeding while investment banks are sharply curtailing lending for major real estate projects in the city. Still, Mr. Trump says he has both the financing -- from two German banks -- and the city permits needed to proceed with the project. 
 "I've always thought that New York should have the tallest building in the world," Mr. Trump said yesterday. "It doesn't. But now, it has the tallest and most luxurious residential building in the world."
Demolition began yesterday on the vacant office building, the United Engineering Center, that now occupies the site, at First Avenue between 47th and 48th Streets.
But as word of the size of the project has filtered out, residents have begun expressing concern about the prospect of a tower that they contend will dwarf all the buildings in the neighborhood, whose biggest presence is the United Nations complex. (The United Nations Secretariat is 39 stories tall.) Some residents also say the city may have improperly allowed Mr. Trump to transfer development rights from adjacent properties in order to build such a large tower.
"It doesn't fit into that neighborhood at all," said Edward Rubin, chairman of the land use committee of Community Board 6. "There's nothing around there that's that big. If anything deserves to be that prominent, it's the U.N., not Donald Trump."
Mr. Trump does not expect any problems. And having built Trump Tower, Trump Palace and Trump International Hotel and Tower, he has already decided on a name for his latest project: Trump World Tower.
He is also billing the structure as a 900-foot tower that rises the equivalent of 90 stories, even though it will actually be 39 feet shorter and have 72 floors. In a similar vein, in 1985 the developer Harry Macklowedescribed Metropolitan Tower, his angular, black glass building on West 57th Street, as a 78-story condominium, even though the building has only 68 floors.
New York developers have long had a penchant for marketing their projects as the biggest, tallest or grandest. The designation is a boost to the ego, but more important, the value of apartments or office space rises rapidly with the height of a building.
Mr. Trump himself has long wanted to build the tallest building in the world. He owns 40 Wall Street, a downtown tower that briefly held that position when it was built in 1930. In 1985, the developer planned to build the tallest building in the world at Television City, a proposed riverfront complex on the Upper West Side. But the project ran into widespread opposition, and the Federal Government warned that the proposed 1,949-foot office tower would have disrupted the approach to Runway 13 at La Guardia Airport. In that same year, he proposed another world's tallest building -- resembling a rocket -- at Columbus Circle, but lost the competition for developing that site.
To obtain the site of his latest project, Mr. Trump outbid a raft of other developers 18 months ago, paying $50 million for the L-shaped property, which was owned by the United Engineering Trustees. In an uncharacteristically quiet manner, Mr. Trump began buying unused development rights from neighbors to the west on 47th Street, including the Japan Society and the Church of the Holy Family. The city also allowed him to build a larger building after he promised to include a public plaza in the project.
Before Mr. Trump was ready to go forward, however, the real estate market in August started feeling the effects of the turmoil in the financial markets in Russia and Latin America. Most of the banks and investment funds that had fueled the real estate boom over the last three years suffered enormous losses and suddenly stopped lending for real estate projects in the United States. Developers and real estate investors are now nervously scrambling to hold together projects.
As luck would have it, Mr. Trump signed a financing agreement four months ago with two large German lenders, Deutsche Bank and Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank, in exchange for a $3 million deposit. Earlier this week, the banks came through with the money for the bronze tower, although it is not clear how much money Mr. Trump will put up for the project.
"There are a few banks still doing business," said Robert Dowling, a managing director of Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank in New York. "We're one of them. We believe in Donald Trump and that site."
Mr. Trump, Daewoo Corporation, which is his Korean partner, and the German banks are betting that there will be few new towers built over the two years it takes to construct the latest Trump project, and they believe that this lull will lead to a pent-up demand for such luxury units.
The developer does have a knack for selling apartments at top dollar. The condominiums at his last project, Trump International Hotel and Tower at Columbus Circle, sold for an average of $835 a square foot last year, 75 percent more than the average condominium on the Upper West Side, according to the Corcoran Group, a residential real estate company. Many of his buyers are foreign.
Even if Japanese and Hong Kong buyers are now absent from the New York market, Germans and Italians are still in the market, according to real estate brokers.
Mr. Trump said that prices at Trump World Tower would start at $750 a square foot, but that he expected them to increase.
Barbara Corcoran, chairwoman of the Corcoran Group, said: "Everybody knows the name Trump. It's a label associated with the word luxury."
But some questions remain about whether there is an inexhaustible supply of buyers, particularly when Japan, Hong Kong, Korea and Brazil have fallen into a severe recession. Condominium prices in Manhattan have leveled off in recent weeks, after soaring 32 percent over the past 18 months to an average of $455 a square foot.
"Nobody really knows," Ms. Corcoran said. "It feels as though there's an inexhaustible supply. New York continues to attract a lot of wealth from around the world. New York has almost become a luxury status symbol."
Designed by the architect Costas Kondylis, the planned Trump World Tower will be 47 feet taller than Cityspire, the 814-foot tower at 150 West 56th Street that is currently the tallest residential building in the city. Mr. Kondylis said he designed Trump World Tower as a glass monolith to insure that the 376 apartments in the 750,000-square-foot building would be large and luxurious.
The marble-lined lobby will have 40-foot-high ceilings, while the apartments will range from 800 square feet with 10-foot ceilings to 4,500 square feet with 16-foot ceilings at the top of the building. The apartments will also feature floor-to-ceiling windows.

FIRSTPLUS SELLING BUSINESSES AND CUTTING HALF ITS STAFF

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Firstplus Financial Group, a struggling home-equity lender that failed to find a buyer after putting itself up for sale in August, said yesterday that it was selling its businesses in parts and would dismiss 3,000 people, or 50 percent of its staff. Firstplus, a Dallas-based company that specializes in loans of up to 125 percent of a home's value, said it was selling its loan servicing business to Superior Bank F.S.B. and that it had accepted an offer for its British-based business. It said the two transactions were worth $130 million. Firstplus said Aug. 31 that it wanted to be acquired, but at least two potential buyers reportedly abandoned purchase plans after preliminary talks.

ARCO LAYING OFF 900 AND CUTTING COSTS BY $500 MILLION

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Atlantic Richfield Company, the seventh-largest oil company in the United States, said yesterday that it would cut 900 jobs, or 4.5 percent of its work force, and reduce costs by $500 million. Costs will be reduced over two years, with most of the savings, $350 million, expected in 1999, the Los Angeles-based company said. Facing the lowest oil prices in 12 years as well as slumping earnings, ARCO is seen by many analysts as a target for takeover by another oil company. ARCO's chief executive, Michael R. Bowlin, warned employees last month that spending would have to be reduced "to insure that ARCO remains a strong and successful independent company." ARCO said the 900 layoffs would come mainly from technical and administrative positions at its Los Angeles headquarters and in Plano, Tex.

No More Policy Changes, Japan Bank Chief Says

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Masaru Hayami, the governor of Japan's central bank, said yesterday that no further changes in monetary policy would be made until it judged the effects of recent measures to pull the nation out of recession. The agency, the Bank of Japan, cut rates last month, is gauging the effect of the Government's plan to help banks dispose of bad loans and will keep an eye on fluctuating foreign exchange rates and the United States economy before it takes further steps, Mr. Hayami said at his monthly news conference. The central bank chief also urged top banks in Japan to accept capital injections of taxpayer funds quickly, as provided for in a 60-trillion-yen package that is expected to win final passage in Parliament today.

HEADLINE: ANTIQUES

BYLINE: By Wendy Moonan 

 BODY:

Antiques Get Ever Younger
The definition of antiques is changing daily, and, as usual, Los Angeles sets the trends.
On Oct. 25, two Los Angeles auction houses will team up for the first time to conduct a sale, "20th-Century Decorative Arts, Fine Art and Modern Design." Los Angeles Modern Auctions, which since 1992 has been conducting three sales of 1950's furniture each year, is branching out. The house, known as Lama, will sell the fixtures from Rebecca's Restaurant in Venice, Calif., in a joint venture with Santa Monica Auctions, which sells mostly contemporary art. 
 Just so you know how new an antique can be: Rebecca's closed three weeks ago, said Peter Loughrey, the head of Lama.
Rebecca's, a fashionable Mexican restaurant with a subaquatic theme, opened in 1983. Frank Gehry, the Los Angeles architect who designed the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, created the entire space from top to bottom.
It had an 18-foot-long cut-glass octopus chandelier in bright red, a pair of giant black crocodile sculptures with individually bent metal scales suspended from the ceiling, and two nine-foot-tall cut-glass-and-silicon fish lamps that were leaping out of the sea -- more specifically, from the rear of the custom banquettes. It was an underwater fantasy.
The idea was "to create indirect, atmospheric light," Mr. Gehry said at the time. "Walking in, you see a bunch of strange objects and forms but the important thing I was striving for was that each element be discrete and complete, so there's no blurring. They just stand on their own in this space."
In the auction catalogue, Thomas Hines, a professor of history and architecture at U.C.L.A., writes that like Charles Rennie Mackintosh's famous Cranston Tea Rooms in Glasgow in 1900 or Adolf Loos's American Bar in Vienna in 1907, Mr. Gehry's Rebecca's has "regrettably joined the venerable company of Restaurants Departed."
Mr. Hines suggests that Gehry's fixtures are "unique artifacts" that should "somehow continue to stand on their own as survivors of Rebecca's unfortunate demise."
Mr. Loughrey said several New York City dealers had expressed interest in the Gehry pieces, despite the high presale estimates ($100,000 to $150,000 for the octopus, $80,000 to $150,000 each for the crocodiles, and $40,000 to $50,000 for the pair of fish lamps).
Mr. Loughrey does not find the estimates so high. In the 1980's, he pointed out, the Fred Hoffmann Gallery in Santa Monica, Calif., sold limited editions of Gehry's smaller fish lamps, in glass and translucent Formica chips, for about $40,000 apiece.
Mr. Hines writes in the catalogue that the fish motif has always been important to Mr. Gehry, because it reminds him of shopping for the makings of gefilte fish with his grandmother as a child in Toronto.
Estimates for other items in the sale, not from the restaurant but many of them designs by other world-famous architects, are more modest. There is the brilliant red polyurethane foam prototype of "Joe," a club chair in the form of a baseball mitt that the Italian team of DePas, D'Urbino & Lomazzi designed for the Poltronova company in Italy in 1969. This chair, eventually manufactured with stitched leather upholstery to look more authentic, has been a status symbol for homeowners with private sports bars for years. The auction house's estimate is $8,000 to $10,000.
There are also some design treasures that could probably be unearthed only in Los Angeles. There is, for example, an original Unit Chair by R. M. Schindler, the Austrian architect who moved to Los Angeles in the 1930's and is now the height of fashion among modern-design aficionados (estimate: $12,000 to $14,000).
Schindler designed the Unit for the Elizabeth Van Patten house he built in 1934 in the Silverlake section of Los Angeles, and he continued to make other versions of it for two later houses. It is an upholstered chair whose square seat has slots to allow attachments, like a table or seat back. It looks as contemporary as the latest beds by the French designer Philippe Starck, which have bedside tables attached.
The auction also includes several pieces of furniture that have come to be considered "les musts" of Modernism: the Dunbar sofa designed by Edward Wormley ($1,500 to $1,800), a wood armchair with webbed upholstery by Jens Risom ($800 to $1,000), a pair of club chairs with trapezoidal arms attributed to Paul T. Frankl ($1,200 to $1,500) and a George Nelson built-in storage unit from the home of D. J. Dupree, a former president of the Herman Miller furniture company ($2,500 to $3,000).
Mr. Loughrey said collectors now look for modern pieces with notable provenance: "1950's pieces that were special-ordered for a particular person, like the Dupree storage wall."
"The validity of modern furniture is now firmly entrenched," he added. "Modern design is not just a fad. The market for modern has never slumped. We are still seeing record prices again and again. We achieved a world record for a design by Charles and Ray Eames last May 17 -- a 15-panel folding screen in wood sold for $41,800."
Maybe mid-century design will be recession proof, but that does not explain its intense appeal. Mr. Loughrey, who is 30, tried to explain his feelings. "I grew up in Maryland with delicate 18th-century furniture and silver," he recalled. "There were rooms I wasn't ever allowed to go into as a child. Modern furniture is to be used."
He tried to put it in more historical terms: "There was a huge boom after World War II and people had enormous optimism about the future and the postwar world order. We have to remember this furniture was brand new and anti-traditional. It had refreshing new forms. This furniture is what 20th-century design is all about."
The sale preview, from Monday through Oct. 24, will be at the I. M. Chait Gallery, 9330 Civic Center Drive, Beverly Hills. Information on the auction: (323) 845-9456.

This is the 10th anniversary of the International Fine Art and Antique Dealers Show, which opens today at the Seventh Regiment Armory, at Park Avenue and 67th Street, and runs through Thursday. Christie's "Arts of France" sale is next Friday, with 176 lots. Sotheby's has its English and Continental silver sale on Wednesday.
But let's not forget what's close at hand: Manhattan has some of the finest antiques dealers in the world. No fair or auction house has anything more spectacular, for example, than the exceptional pair of solid silver Italian consoles with gilt bronze decorations now gracing the walls of Dalva Brothers, at 44 East 57th Street. Equally spectacular is the Roentgen chest of drawers with gilded bronze tassel pulls that Tony Victoria, the owner of Frederick Victoria & Sons at 154 East 55th Street, is selling.
Sometimes it's important to pay attention to the hometown teams, too.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 26, 1998, Monday

 CORRECTION:
The Antiques column in Weekend on Oct. 16 about an auction of fixtures designed by Frank Gehry for Rebecca's Restaurant in Venice, Calif., which has closed, referred incorrectly to Thomas Hines's comments in the auction catalogue about Adolf Loos's American Bar in Vienna. Mr. Hines, professor of history and architecture at the University of California at Los Angeles, cited the American Bar's interior as an example of modernist design that had escaped demolition. He did not include the bar in his reference to "the venerable company of Restaurants Departed."

HEADLINE: Output Slows and Consumer Prices Are Steady

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Industrial production unexpectedly declined during September and consumer prices were unchanged, signs the Federal Reserve has room to reduce interest rates still further to combat faltering consumer confidence.
"With the U.S. economy near price stability and a slowdown looming, the risk of any acceleration in inflation is virtually zero," said Brian S. Wesbury, the chief economist at Griffin, Kubik, Stephens & Thompson Inc. in Chicago. 
 The Fed said today that output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities fell three-tenths of 1 percent last month after having risen a revised 1.6 percent during August. The decline was the third in the last four months and capped the weakest quarterly performance since early 1991, when the economy was in recession.
The September drop in production resulted from widespread weakness in the manufacturing of big-ticket goods ranging from autos to steel, the central bank said. Analysts had been expecting an increase of one-tenth of 1 percent.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said consumer prices were unchanged in September for the first time in six months. They had increased two-tenths of 1 percent in August. While health care costs rose last month, falling energy and transportation costs contributed to September's tame inflation reading.
A third economic indicator, the University of Michigan's index of consumer confidence, fell to 98.9 this month, from 100.9 in September.
The Government also said today that the annual cost-of-living increase for Social Security beneficiaries in 1999, based on the inflation reading for the last 12 months, would be only 1.3 percent, the smallest rise since 1987. Government checks for retirees will increase, on average, by about $10, to $780 a month.
As the economy slowed, average weekly earnings for workers fell in September by the biggest amount in 17 months, according to Labor Department statistics. Adjusted for inflation, earnings fell a seasonally adjusted six-tenths of 1 percent after having increased four-tenths of 1 percent in August.
The reports were released one day after the Fed unexpectedly cut interest rates, warning that nervousness among investors and lenders could undermine the nation's economic expansion.
An indication that the economy was slowing came from the third quarter's industrial production data. Output was unchanged during the three months -- the weakest quarterly performance since the last recession, when production dropped 8.3 percent in the first quarter of 1991.
Today's industrial production report also showed that the plant-use rate, which measures the amount of industrial capacity in use, fell to 81.1 percent in September, from a revised 81.6 percent in August.
Manufacturers are encountering "weak export demand and, maybe, weakening domestic demand," Peter Kretzmer, an economist at Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities in New York, said.
The Labor Department report showed that the core rate of the Consumer Price Index, which strips out often-volatile food and energy costs, rose two-tenths of 1 percent in September, the same as in August.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Fed-Generated Optimism Sends Asian Stocks Soaring

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Stock market euphoria swept from the United States and Europe to Asia today, as share prices across the region surged in response to Thursday's cut in interest rates in the United States.
Hong Kong's gains were among the biggest, with the benchmark Hang Seng index jumping almost 9 percent, to 9,777.01, the highest level since early May. Shares in Singapore, Bangkok, Jakarta and Manila all rose more than 5 percent; in Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 issues gained 2.19 percent. 
 While analysts were impressed by the strong performance, which extends a rally that began last week, most were loath to declare it a turning point in the Asian financial crisis. Indeed, some said they were worried that the stock markets had become too rosy a barometer.
"There has been so much bad news built up in the region that any glimmer of good news causes the market to overshoot," said Brian C. Lippey, managing director of Tokai Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong.
Mr. Lippey said a fundamental recovery in Asia still hinged on whether Japan could clean up its debt-burdened banking system. Although the Japanese Parliament completed passage of legislation today intended to do that, Mr. Lippey and other experts said it fell short of the radical overhaul needed.
"The Gordian knot for Asia is Japan, and the center of that knot is the Japanese banking system," Mr. Lippey said. "Until they get that sorted out, the rest of Asia is going to be in for more disappointments."
Still, from Seoul to Singapore, it was hard to find disappointment today. Here, the Hang Seng index posted one of its largest gains of the year, on hopes that local banks would follow the lead of the Federal Reserve in cutting rates. Late today, they reduced the deposit rate by one-quarter of a point, to 5 percent.
"The Fed's action suggests that they've diagnosed the problem, and the response is going to be serious and prompt," said Miron Mushkat, director of strategy at Indocam Asia Asset Management here.
Beyond the lower rates, Hong Kong has been buoyed by the stronger Japanese yen, which has eased pressure on the Hong Kong dollar. A weaker yen had hurt Hong Kong because its dollar's exchange rate is linked to the United States dollar. That meant that the Hong Kong dollar was overvalued relative to other Asian currencies, and it made this former British colony a relatively costly place to do business.
Among the biggest winners in this market rally is the Hong Kong government, which spent enormous amounts to prop up the stock market in August. The intervention, which officials said was intended to thwart foreign-currency traders, exposed Hong Kong to widespread criticism abroad and at home.
For now, though, Hong Kong's government is sitting on hefty gains. While the government has not disclosed the market value of its holdings, analysts estimate that officials started buying $10 billion to $15 billion of stock when the Hang Seng index was at 6,600. The market has since gone up nearly 50 percent.
"My opinion is that they got lucky, but it's better to be lucky than smart," said Mac Overton, a portfolio manager at MBF Unit Trust here, who had harshly criticized the intervention.
Shares of the giant banking company HSBC Holdings, which was the government's largest investment, shot up $12.50 (Hong Kong), or $1.61 (United States), today, to $173. Analysts said the demand for shares of HSBC, parent company of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, was fueled by rumors that an American hedge fund was trying to buy the government's 8.9 percent stake.
The catch is that officials here said they intend to retain the shares for the long term. That means their huge potential profits are on paper only. Whether the government will be able sell its shares at a profit depends on whether this rally is merely a respite from the crisis -- or the start of a genuine recovery.
Analysts said lower interest rates could revive business activity in Asia. But they said it was worth remembering why the Federal Reserve reduced rates: to forestall a slowdown in the United States economy. Such a slowdown bodes ill for Asian countries, which depend on American consumers to buy their goods.
"Ultimately, your view of this depends on whether you think consumer demand in Europe and the U.S. is going to hold up," said Richard Margolis, a regional strategist with Merrill Lynch here.

HEADLINE: Gadgets to Go Gentle Into Age;
A Market Grows and Modernizes as Demand Increases

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
They spent 40 years building a life that produced six children, a thriving business and the security for what was to be a carefree retirement. But David and Ann Lambert's plans crumbled when he suffered a stroke five years ago that left him partly paralyzed and unable to speak more than a few words.
In time, the Lamberts, both 63, learned to adjust, thanks to good medical care, family support -- and a few of the wide array of new or updated health devices and gadgets for use in the home. A $3,400 motorized stairway lift, for instance, "was the best money I ever spent," Mrs. Lambert said. The lift has restored a taste of independence to Mr. Lambert, who as an entrepreneur founded the Lambert Glass Company in Louisville, Ky. 
 Indeed, as more people like the Lamberts -- especially graying baby boomers and their elderly parents -- face medical catastrophes, a growing and increasingly competitive business in home health care devices is taking shape to serve them.
This industry's growth is not surprising considering the rapidly rising population of older Americans. The number of people over 85 has grown six times as fast as the overall population since 1960. The Census Bureau projects that by 2000, the percentage of elderly people in this age group will more than double, to 12 percent from 5.6 percent in 1960.
There is thus a powerful need for items that ease discomfort, increase mobility and generally provide a sense of control for those struggling with the aches and ailments of aging. And with the Government encouraging home health care to save money on institutional care, numerous companies are stepping into the fray. They include such big public companies as Invacare and Sunrise Medical Inc. as well as smaller, private manufacturers and dealers such as Rice Home Medical, New Abilities Systems Inc. and Gould's Discount Medical, a division of the Mobilectrics Company.
"The demographics make it a growth area, and the shifting focus of health care makes it a growth area," said James Walsh, a spokesman for the VGM Group, a consortium of independent suppliers of health care products. "Health care is moving out of the institution and into the home."
As a result, companies that have the latest health aids and the best marketing see a chance for substantial increases in profits in a virtually recession-proof $3 billion industry.
Carol Laumer, executive director of Rice Home Medical in Willmar, Minn., about 100 miles west of St. Paul, has seen her business more than double in the last decade. Now, she said, "all of those folks in institutions in the past can stay in their own homes or in assisted living."
A device sold by Rice Home Medical, for example, enables some cancer patients to administer chemotherapy to themselves at home or even while on vacation. Curtis W. Johnson, a retired construction worker, knew nothing about this device until he discovered 10 months ago that he needed one.
Mr. Johnson, who is 71 and suffers from liver cancer, says his ambulatory infusion pump has allowed him to receive treatment while he fishes for "anything that wants to bite."
"It doesn't stop me from doing anything," said Mr. Johnson, who lives in Granite Falls, Minn. Now, he simply goes to the hospital to get the pump needed to operate the device and deliver his treatment instead of spending hours there receiving it. "You're in there 10 or 15 minutes and turn around and go home just like nothing ever happened."
Other devices are less critical but hugely helpful in the home.
People with limited dexterity can buy plastic finger loops that fasten to keys to help turn keys in doors. An E-Z Reacher, a long rod with a small suction cup attached to the end, enables people to pick up objects like soup cans and juice bottles without having to bend or stretch. Other items help people turn lights on and off, pull up their socks, thread a needle or turn pages of a book.
There is even a gadget that allows people to smoke without gripping the cigarette, though it might be stretching matters to call that a health aid. This and many other products are made or distributed by a small Canadian company called Parsons A.D.L. (for "accessories for daily living") Inc., which does a big part of its business over the Internet (www.parsonsadl.com).
Many other items are more high technology, reflecting the race to modernize older products and to come out with new ones that appeal to disabled people, who are living more active lives than ever. Invacare, a leader in home medical equipment based in Elyria, Ohio, recently introduced a product that converts air to pure oxygen, eliminating the need for emphysema patients to have canisters refilled by a dealer.
New Abilities, of Palo Alto, Calif., even makes a dental retainer that is actually a tongue-touch key pad that allows quadriplegics to operate household appliances, use a computer and maneuver a wheelchair.
Many older people manage to avoid serious ailments, of course, and the bulk of baby boomers are still young and healthy. But in coming years the sheer size of this group -- nearly 78 million people -- is expected to create increased demand for eyeglasses, skin care creams, medical equipment, vitamins and other goods.
Moreover, baby boomers' parents are well into old age, the time when medical needs are greatest. And largely because of managed care restrictions, people need home medical care longer as the average hospital stay has declined -- to 6.2 days in 1996 from 7.1 in 1986, according to the American Hospital Association.
Unfortunately, said Ken Gould, who runs Gould Discount Medical in Louisville, where the Lamberts bought their stairway lift, not enough people know about such products. So, he has started to advertise on television and has expanded his showroom to display more items.
"Every day there are new products coming out that are more and more helpful," Mr. Gould said. "There are a lot of people out there laboring and not knowing what is available."
To be sure, consumers will not necessarily rush to buy some of these items, but they clearly have more choices these days. And manufacturers and retailers of all sizes are stepping up efforts to increase consumer awareness.
"Our advertising support has gone from six figures to well into the seven-figure numbers in the last three years," said Louis Slangen, senior vice president for sales and marketing at Invacare. The company has also expanded into mass retail channels in the last three years, so shoppers can now buy its Aurora brand products, such as walkers and canes, at Wal-Mart and even supermarkets like Winn Dixie.
The additional availability "creates a great awareness level and, of course, it enlarges the market," Mr. Slangen said. "I think what is most important for the industry is that people feel confident and comfortable in using the products." In the past, he added, many items "did not look very attractive, the ergonomics was not very good, and many products you would need reconstruction in the house in order for them to go through the doors."
Suppliers and analysts who follow the industry say that kind of inefficiency will no longer do. The market is growing by about 7 percent a year and will continue to do so for several decades, said Jeff Knightly, an analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer. So, even in this era of enormous growth, he said, only the low-cost providers and the most innovative and efficient companies will survive, in part because of new Medicare restrictions on patient reimbursement and the cutthroat bidding that goes on in managed care.
Despite those threats to weaker competitors, the VGM Group, the suppliers' consortium, has seen the industry growth firsthand and says its members have prospered as demand has picked up. The group had 11 members when it was created in 1986 as a way for smaller dealers to pool their resources to give them increased buying power and a louder lobbying voice. It has since grown to about 1,300 companies.
Judy Stubbs is grateful that so many more companies are focusing on this market. Her 84-year-old mother, Muriel Abramson, who suffers from a cardiac condition, lives with Mrs. Stubbs and her husband in San Antonio and depends on the latest in lightweight wheelchairs and other devices.
"She would be in a nursing home if some of these things were not available," Mrs. Stubbs said. For such people, she said, functioning in a home without the aids "would be extremely difficult if not impossible, because there is no way you can be with them every single second."
Mrs. Stubbs, who is 46 and considers herself a typical baby boomer, added that an increasing number of her friends and relatives are caring for elderly relatives and have begun to think about their own futures.
"I think about when we age," Mrs. Stubbs said, "and what's going to happen and where we are going to go and how we are going to function."

 BODY:
Maynard Parker, who as editor of Newsweek helped transform the weekly newsmagazine from a digest of foreign and political events into a publication that put greater emphasis on science, religion, social issues and technology, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 58 and lived in Manhattan.
Mr. Parker, who had been suffering from leukemia for the last year, died of complications from pneumonia, said Richard M. Smith, the chairman and editor in chief of Newsweek. Mr. Parker re-entered the hospital in September after closing Newsweek's cover story on the Starr report. 
 He was Newsweek's editor for the last 16 years, a time when newsweeklies realized that to survive they had to change, that magazine covers featuring foreign dignitaries no longer sold on the newsstand, that people got their news from other places, especially television, and that magazines had to offer something else: deeper analysis, broader subject matter, articles with a voice and point of view.
In a television roundtable discussion about newsmagazines last year, Mr. Parker said, "The economy's good; people aren't worried about threats from abroad."
"They're looking at some other things," he said. "Health. They're looking at religion of all sorts, formal and informal. They're looking at medicine. They're looking at science. They're interested in what's going on around them. They're interested in technologies."
Although news media experts have long predicted the demise of newsmagazines, Mr. Parker helped to increase Newsweek's total paid circulation and make the magazine more competitive with Time magazine. Time remains the best-selling weekly newsmagazine, but Newsweek closed the gap, creating real competition between the two publications. Newsweek's circulation increased to 3.2 million in 1998 from 3 million when Mr. Parker took over as editor in 1982. The current circulation of Time is 4.1 million; U.S. News & World Report's is 2.2 million.
During Mr. Parker's tenure, Newsweek received several honors, including Overseas Press Club awards in 1996 and 1997 for best reporting from abroad and a National Magazine Award for general excellence in 1993.
Maynard Michael Parker was born in Los Angeles on July 28, 1940. After graduating from Stanford University in 1962, he went on to Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism a year later and started out as a reporter at Life magazine in 1963. After Army service as an officer in Thailand from 1964 to 1966, he returned to Life as a correspondent in the Hong Kong bureau.
He moved to Newsweek in 1967, where he continued to cover Hong Kong and went on to become Saigon bureau chief. As bureau chief there and later in Hong Kong, he led Newsweek's coverage of the Vietnam War, including the Tet offensive and the invasion of Cambodia.
In June 1969, Mr. Parker filed this dispatch from the Mekong Delta: "The most striking difference between the Americans and the ARVN Republic of Vietnam regulars lies in method. The Americans use what they call 'jitterbug tactics.' At the start of every day, each brigade commander is given a list of 5 to 20 targets chosen by intelligence. The commander gives his orders verbally, the troops pile into helicopters, and the brigade assaults each target on the list until the enemy is located. This approach overcomes the division's most serious problem -- finding the enemy in the first place."
He also reported on the second India-Pakistan war, China's Cultural Revolution and America's rapprochement with Beijing.
He returned to the United States in 1973 to become managing editor of Newsweek International, a new global newsmagazine, and went on to be Newsweek's national editor, assistant managing editor and then executive editor.
Mr. Parker was named editor in November 1982 and served as chief deputy to Mr. Smith, who became the editor in chief in 1984, before assuming responsibility for daily editorial operations in March 1991, winning the post over Stephen G. Smith, who is now editor of U.S. News & World Report. He also continued to write articles for The Atlantic, Foreign Policy and Foreign Affairs.
The tall, slender editor is remembered by his colleagues for his military language -- he loved using phrases like "scramble the jets" when he moved reporters around the globe to cover a fast-breaking story. "He was a larger-than-life field general," Mr. Smith said, "wielding all the weapons of the magazine to tell a story."
Mr. Parker is also remembered as a driven and dedicated editor who stayed on at Newsweek even after being passed over twice for the top job. His enthusiasm was particularly apparent on deadline, colleagues said, when he was known for making last-minute decisions and savoring every one of them.
"What would daunt most people was thrilling to him," said Evan Thomas, an assistant managing editor of Newsweek. "The later, the harder, the better. He was never happier than when we were either at war or on the brink of war."
As an editor, Mr. Parker's strength lay in asking the right questions. He grew frustrated when his staff did not work as hard as he did, and he criticized them for "leaning on their shovels." As a hands-on editor, he was understated; the sum total of his notes on a story often amounted to a simple line: "Say better pls."
Mr. Parker also loved to scoop the competition. In September 1995, for example, after losing out to Time on the right to excerpt the memoirs of Gen. Colin L. Powell, Newsweek obtained an advance copy of the book and raced ahead with a cover story.
His career was marred by two decisions. In 1983, he pushed Newsweek to publicize the so-called Hitler diaries. After bargaining unsuccessfully for United States publication rights to the diaries from the West German photo-weekly Stern, Newsweek ran an 11-page cover story despite questions about the documents' authenticity. Newsweek's coverage of the diaries included the observation, "Hitler's diaries -- genuine or not, it almost doesn't matter in the end."
When the German authorities later declared the diaries a hoax, Newsweek ran a second cover story suggesting that the magazine had played a major role in uncovering the fraud. Mr. Parker described the experience as the low point in his career.
In 1996, Mr. Parker was forced to answer for having guarded the secrecy of Joe Klein, then a Newsweek columnist, who had vehemently denied being Anonymous, the author of the best-selling novel "Primary Colors," even as Newsweek published Mr. Klein's denial and speculated about other writers.
At the time, Mr. Parker said he did not consider it a conflict that his magazine published an item at odds with his own personal knowledge, although in retrospect, he said that perhaps he should have killed or delayed the item. "I don't think it's a conflict," Mr. Parker said in an interview. "This is not a matter of national security. This is more a matter of who shot J. R."
But Mr. Parker's job remained secure. In the wake of the Klein controversy, Mr. Parker's superiors at The Washington Post Company, which owns Newsweek, vouched for his work. Donald E. Graham, the company's chairman, said in 1996, "If magazine editors were all free agents, without a second's hesitation I would pick Rick and Maynard" to lead Newsweek, referring to the magazine's chairman, Richard M. Smith, and Mr. Parker.
Mr. Parker's first marriage ended in divorce.
He is survived by his wife, Susan Fraker, an assistant managing editor at Fortune magazine; a daughter from his first marriage, Francesca L. Parker of Beaver Dam, Wis.; two sons from his second marriage, Nicholas Maynard Parker and Hugh Fraker Parker, both of Manhattan, and his father, C. N. Parker of Bradbury, Calif.

HEADLINE: With Prod From U.S., Mideast Talks Are Moving, Slowly

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WYE MILLS, Md., Oct. 16

 BODY:
Israeli and Palestinian leaders, under the prodding hand of American officials, are making some progress toward an interim accord, officials said today, but they described the going as slow and the mistrust as still deep.
"All of these issues have been politicized for so long," one official said, "there has to be a lot of clearing of the air." 
 The delegations are spending too much time arguing over who should be in which meetings and why, without always concentrating on the substance at hand, the official said, in remarks confirmed by other officials with knowledge of the talks here.
Israeli officials said they would not come to any agreement "just to have one," while a Palestinian official complained about the slow pace of the discussions.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, together with large delegations of experts and advisers, are gathered in seclusion at the Wye Conference Center near here.
Under the prodding of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and the special envoy Dennis B. Ross -- with President Clinton expected to come to help on Saturday -- the two sides are trying to finish a long overdue agreement under which Israel will withdraw from another 13 percent of the West Bank in return for specific Palestinians steps against terrorism.
The greatest progress was made on the question of security. George Tenet, the Director of Central Intelligence, joined the talks today to help the two sides work out the American role in judging the Palestinian security service's effort at combating the radicals in their midst, like the Hamas movement.
An official said the C.I.A. felt it was critical to begin to dispel the deep Israeli mistrust of the Palestinian security forces, "to figure out a way to validate any Palestinian claims of best efforts at fighting terrorism."
While both sides have accepted this American role as the best way to assess Mr. Arafat's commitment to battling those who oppose a peace, it is proving complicated "to operationalize" the concept in a lasting way, the official said.
While the two sides spent the most time discussing security, the talks advanced on the economic front as well. They concentrated on the issue of safe passage for Palestinians from the West Bank to Gaza; the opening of an already built airport in Gaza; and how to better the lives of Palestinians whose access to jobs in Israel has been limited.
One official with knowledge of the talks was gloomier, suggesting that it would be difficult to come to a final agreement by the end of Sunday, or Monday morning. He described Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat as too fond of haggling over details and principles and not raising their sights high enough.
"This isn't a peace negotiation," the official said. "This is a real-estate transaction."
The Israelis want Mr. Arafat to go to war against Hamas and to stop both public and private "incitement" against Israel and Israelis, while changing the Palestinian charter in a public way to delete clauses calling for Israel's destruction. Israeli officials acknowledge that these are difficult steps for Mr. Arafat, but they say he cannot use "the excuse of weakness forever," one official said.
On Thursday, Mr. Arafat told Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Clinton that he hoped "this will be the Camp David for the Palestinians and the Israelis," whom he called "cousins," an official said -- the event that finally breaks the back of the main problems between them.
Mr. Netanyahu was less lofty but clear, saying he had come "to reach an agreement that is clear, specific and binding," and promised his best efforts.
The atmosphere of this second day of talks here was good, said the State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin. "It does appear that there is a better and more constructive and more pragmatic atmosphere to work on these problems than there had been in the past," he said at the day's only public briefing for the press.
In what appeared to be a good omen, given the two leaders' general dislike of one another, Mr. Netanyahu telephoned Mr. Arafat this morning and invited him over for a conversation. The two men talked, with an American interpreter, for nearly 90 minutes before a joint lunch given by Ms. Albright.
In the evening, an American invitation to be hosts at a joint Sabbath dinner was politely declined by Mr. Netanyahu, who did not want a religious meal to be inevitably politicized, an Israeli official said. The Wye Center has a synagogue for worship.
So the Israelis ate alone and the Americans ate with the Palestinians.
Two key Israeli officials, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordecai, will not arrive until later. Mr. Sharon, after visiting today with King Hussein of Jordan, who is ill, at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, is to arrive here on Saturday night, while Mr. Mordechai, who remained in Israel to deal with an unexplained security issue, will not arrive until Sunday morning.

HEADLINE: Brazil Plans $20 Billion In Tax Hikes, Budget Cuts

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Oct. 16

 BODY:
As a three-man economic team headed for Washington, and President Fernando Henrique Cardoso flew off to Portugal, Brazilian Government officials put the finishing touches today on an ambitious package to raise $20 billion in revenues through spending cuts and tax increases next year.
But public announcement of those measures, eagerly awaited by investors and markets throughout Latin America, appear set for delay once again. Details of Brazil's plans to reduce its high deficits, initially expected to be announced just after Mr. Cardoso's Oct. 5 re-election, and then on Oct. 20, now will likely not be disclosed before the second round of gubernatorial elections on Oct. 25, legislators said. 
 Since the economic collapse of Russia in August, investors and economists have sharpened their focus on Brazil. While President Clinton lobbied Congress for $18 billion to restock the International Monetary Fund this week, with an eye toward assisting Brazil, the team that returned here from the I.M.F.'s annual meeting in Washington earlier this month scoured Government accounts for politically feasible sources of savings and reform.
Though the country has sped up various receipts the Government is getting for privatizing state entities like the phone system to replenish foreign reserves, it is losing more than $400 million a day from central bank coffers. Foreign reserves, which had stood at $70 billion, are down to $46 billion, with capital flight surpassing $30 billion despite the government's doubling of interest rates to more than 40 percent.
Three senior Government officials, Pedro Parente and Amaury Bier, of the Finance Ministry and Altamir Lopes of the central bank, are scheduled to meet this weekend with I.M.F. officials in Washington to discuss the Government's blueprint for cutbacks and reforms.
Eager to avoid replaying the contentious and unpopular I.M.F. accords of the 1980's, Brazilian officials are trying to disassociate the hardship to come from the I.M.F. The steps to cut the budget deficit are being portrayed as measures to rehabilitate the economic systems. In that way, the administration here hopes to avoid the humiliation of appearing to bend economic policy to I.M.F. orders once again.
The I.M.F. goal corresponds to a 2.5 percent to 3 percent surplus in Brazil's primary budget account, which covers Government expenses but excludes interest payments on debt. "It will be drastic, but we have to deliver that," said Demosthenes Madureiro do Pinho, the director of international relations at the Brazilian central bank. Higher interest rates on the national debt are bringing the cost of the debt to 3.5 percent of Brazil's economy, Mr. Pinho said, adding that spending reforms are key to restoring confidence and, ultimately, lowering interest rates.
In August, before the economic collapse of Russia triggered a swift and sizable flight of capital from Brazil, the Government had presented a budget for next year with a primary account surplus of 0.92 percent, or $6 billion.
A senior official at the Ministry of Planning, Martus Tavares, says there is little room for the federal Government to reduce its budget by much more. So the Government will depend on tax increases and savings by states and municipalities to raise the remaining $14 billion.
The federal Government will likely create new taxes, increase existing ones and consolidate others to raise more revenues, though economists warn that an expected deepening of the recession in Brazil bodes ill for tax revenues. Michel Temer, president of the lower house of Parliament, said in an interview here that Congress would begin debate on social security reform on Nov. 4, and would begin what promises to be a stormy debate on political reform soon after.
The measures being discussed include a 0.1 percent increase on a special Government tax on every check written, to 0.3 percent. Congress passed the tax in 1996 as a one-year effort to improve the deteriorating public health system, but the revenue has been used to offset excess spending in other areas. Last year, the tax brought in $7 billion. With a 0.1 percent increase, it will likely bring in another $3 billion, and it would be made permanent.
The three-year plan of adjustments also relies on states and municipalities to produce about 30 percent of the projected savings through legally-mandated spending limits, though states have had a spotty record in controlling outlays.
While President Cardoso clearly interpreted his victory this month as a mandate for swift, if painful, reforms, it is by no means clear that state governors are hearing the same message from voters. In gubernatorial races in key Brazilian states, Brazilians are favoring candidates that are not particularly known for austerity.

HEADLINE: THE GRAPES OF WRATH '98

BYLINE: By Gary Krist; Gary Krist is a Washington writer whose most recent book is "Bad Chemistry," a novel.

 BODY:
Fade in: A deserted, dust-blown street on Manhattan's Upper East Side. Twilight. Tom Joad, a former mutual fund manager just released from Federal prison, stands in front of the Joad family's six-bedroom town house. The building is in ruins; the double-paned French doors are smashed, and the tattered Ralph Lauren window treatments flutter ghostlike in the howling wind. 
 TOM (climbing the broken stoop and entering the dark house): Ma? Pa? Anybody here?
VOICE (from within): Who's that?
TOM (lights a candle): Muley? Muley Graves? That you?
MULEY: Why if it ain't young Tom! I thought you was in jail. Insider tradin', wasn't it? You bust out?
TOM (frowning): Out on parole. (He looks around the deserted house.) What happened here? Where's my folks?
MULEY: You ain't heard? They're gone. They been run off the land, jes' like all t'other brokers and analysts in these-here parts. The landlord come to clear 'em off the place two weeks ago, jes' after that hedge fund went belly-up and your pa had his margins called.
TOM: His margins called? Why?
MULEY: Oh, Tom, things been bad since you gone away -- real bad. Them Japanese banks been flirtin' with failure, the market in Brazil been gyratin' like some broke windmill, and don't even ask me about Russia. A man can't make no kinda livin' on Wall Street no more. And when it got so your pa couldn't even swing the prix fixe at Patroon, he knowed it was time to take the family and go.
TOM: So they jes' up and left?
MULEY: They had to, Tom. Your pa, he sold the Baccarat and the Christian Liaigre furniture. Then he and your ma loaded ever'thin' else they owned into the Limited Edition Range Rover and headed out.
TOM: But what about you, Muley? You was ridin' high last time I heard, what with them call options on Amazon.com and Infoseek and all.
MULEY: Yeah, well, things're different now. Come the Asian currency crisis, my portfolio done took a nose dive like ever'body else's. Only reason I ain't gone is I got nowhere else to go. So I just haunt this land -- at least the part west of Lexington Avenue and south of 96th Street -- like some kinda graveyard spirit.
TOM (shaking his head despondently): It ain't right, Muley. You and me and our folks and grandfolks before us been tradin' derivatives on this land for 50 years. It jes' ain't right for it all to end like this -- especially just when the Hammacher Schlemmer Christmas catalogues are arriving.
MULEY: It sure ain't. It seems like jes' yestiddy we was readin' Cigar Aficionado and orderin' up magnums of Petrus. Not no more.
TOM: So where'd they go -- my ma and pa? Where'd they head to?
MULEY: To Washington. Lotsa work out there, they say -- consultin', lobbyin'. 'Course they ain't payin' but mid-six figgers with no stock plan and nary a year-end performance bonus. But your pa, he says a man can scrape by on 500 thou per annum if he really has to.
TOM (with disgust): You cain't expect anybody to raise a family on wages like that. We ain't animals. (Turning suddenly hopeful.) But I tell you somethin', Muley. Sure, times is bad, real bad, but we're gonna get through this. (Music begins to swell.) Mark my words. They cain't wipe us out, they cain't lick us. We're the salt of the earth, keeping this economy goin' with the sweat of our brows -- figuratively speaking, of course. (Camera begins to pan away.) We'll go on forever, Muley, because we are the people!

 Music crescendos. Camera rises to show a new day dawning over Wall Street. Fadeout.

HEADLINE: Citing Low Inflation, Government Makes Only Small Increase in Social Security

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Social Security benefits will rise 1.3 percent next year, the Government announced today. That is the smallest cost-of-living increase since 1987.
More than 44 million Americans receive such benefits. While most are elderly, about 30 percent are under the age of 65. 
 The increase is small because inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, has been exceptionally low.
The Commissioner of Social Security, Kenneth S. Apfel, said the average monthly Social Security check for retired workers would rise next year by $10, to $780.
For an elderly couple, both receiving benefits, the average check will rise by $17, to $1,310.
Benefits in a number of other programs are also tied to the Consumer Price Index. The maximum monthly payment for 6.6 million low-income individuals receiving Supplemental Security Income will rise to $500, from $494.
In a separate announcement, the Department of Health and Human Services said that the monthly Medicare premium would rise next year to $45.50. For the last two years, it has been fixed at $43.80.
Medicare premiums are deducted from monthly Social Security checks. The premiums are recalculated each year to reflect changes in health care costs and Medicare law.
The spending habits of retirees obviously differ from those of younger people. But Henry J. Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said there was no conclusive evidence that living costs were rising much faster for the elderly than for other Americans.
Some research using experimental price indexes for the elderly suggests that the inflation rate for older consumers may be slightly higher than the overall rate, but the difference appears to be very small.
In any event, many Social Security recipients are under 65. Of the 44.3 million people who receive Social Security, 27.3 million are retirees, 3.4 million are dependents of retired workers and 7.4 million are survivors of workers who have died. In addition, 4.6 disabled workers and 1.6 million of their dependents get Social Security.
The American Association of Retired Persons pointed out that medical costs were rising faster than most consumer prices, and that elderly people, on the average, spent 19 percent of their income on health care and health insurance. Thus, the association said, Congress should be wary of proposals to reduce the cost-of-living adjustment as part of any program to revamp and preserve Social Security.
Martin A. Corry, director of Federal affairs at the association, said: "For the vast majority of Social Security beneficiaries, the cost-of-living adjustment is the only source of retirement income that is indexed for inflation. Changes in the cost-of-living adjustment and the Consumer Price Index should be last on the list of possible options for savings in Social Security. Such changes have a disproportionate effect on low- and moderate-income people, and on the oldest of the old."
The indexing of Federal benefit programs has been criticized on the ground that it tends to increase Federal spending. But the Congressional Research Service said the 1972 law that authorized automatic increases in Social Security, linked to the Consumer Price Index, was sought mainly by conservatives, "as a means of curbing even larger ad hoc benefit increases" approved by Congress in prior years.
Many economists have said that the Consumer Price Index overstates the cost of living. The Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics is making changes in the index in an effort to fix that problem.

PAKISTAN: TALKS WITH INDIA ON KASHMIR -- For the first time since India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests in May, their Foreign Ministers met in Islamabad to discuss ways of easing military tensions in the region and resolving their conflict over the disputed territory of Kashmir. Little of substance was expected to emerge from the three days of talks, but a Pakistani spokesman described a productive day of negotiations while the Foreign Ministers, K. Ragunath of India and Shamshad Ahmed of Pakistan, looked on without commenting. Celia Dugger (NYT) 

CHINA: STILL A GROWING ECONOMY -- Bucking the downturn in the rest of Asia, China's economy is picking up, with new data suggesting that Beijing may come close to achieving its target of 8.0 percent in gross domestic product growth this year. The State Statistical Bureau announced that growth in the third quarter of this year had climbed 7.6 percent from a year earlier. Many economists believe that a huge increase in government investment and lending, combined with a good harvest and accelerating industrial production, will enable China to meet the 8 percent target, or come close to it.

INDONESIA: AMERICAN BANNED FOR CRITICISM -- An American professor, Jeffrey Winters, has been banned from entering Indonesia for allegedly embarrassing its chief economics minister and implying that he was not clean enough to lead a national anti-corruption drive. Professor Winters, an associate professor at Northwestern University, denied that he had accused the Coordinating Minister of Economy and Finance, Ginandjar Kartasasmita, of being corrupt, saying only that the minister was a "questionable" choice to lead the team charged with eradicating corruption in Indonesia.

ANGOLA: FIGHTING UNDERMINES U.N. EFFORT -- Renewed fighting in Angola is laying waste to four years of peace efforts by the United Nations, whose Security Council has just extended its mission's mandate in the country by another six weeks. The heaviest fighting has struck northern areas, where forces of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or Unita, were reported surrounding the town of Uije. The latest clashes, which involved heavy artillery, come in the wake of four years of intense peacekeeping efforts aimed at creating a government of national unity, demobilizing Unita forces, removing mines from roads and returning refugees to their homes.

SWAZILAND: ALL HAIL KING? -- Voters in Swaziland went to the polls in an unorthodox parliamentary election that bans political parties and gives the king the last word. Opposition groups and trade unions called for a boycott of the poll. The turnout was sparse in Mbabane, the capital of this small southern African kingdom. The police presence on the streets was minimal but roadblocks were set up on highways leading to the capital and polling stations were watched by the police. A number of opposition leaders have had their homes raided in recent days. (Reuters)

MEXICO: RAUL SALINAS MURDER TRIAL NEAR END -- Prosecutors presented closing arguments in the case against the brother of former President Carlos Salinas, Raul Salinas de Gortari, who is accused in connection with the 1994 assassination of a prominent politician. In a 1200-page legal brief, the prosecution charged that Raul Salinas ordered a hired gunman to kill Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, a former state governor, because of political rivalries between them. If convicted, Mr. Salinas faces a maximum sentence of 50 years in prison. His defense lawyer, Eduardo Luengo Creel, said prosecutors have not offered any material evidence linking Mr. Salinas to the crime. He has been held in a solitary cell in a maximum security penitentiary since February 1995. (Julia Preston)
 
CANADA: MOHAWK ACCORD -- The Quebec Government and leaders of a Mohawk reservation have signed a wide-ranging agreement aimed at calming tense relations dating back to a 1990 standoff that led to violence. The accord, signed by Kahnawake Grand Chief Joe Norton and Native Affairs Minister Guy Chevrette, calls for Quebec to compensate Mohawks for the use of roads, railway lines and bridges running through their reserve, which is south of Montreal. It also spells out a framework to negotiate issues such as public security, economic development and the administration of justice. (AP)

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: THE INCUMBENT;
Pataki Calls Political Financing 'Dreadful,' but Has No Solution

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
New York State's campaign finance system is "dreadful" and ought to be overhauled, Gov. George E. Pataki said in an interview this week, but he suggested that any real reform would be difficult to achieve and refused to detail what changes he might want to make.
In an hourlong interview on Thursday with editors, reporters and executives of The New York Times, Mr. Pataki did say he would like to change the system in a second term, but not precisely how. "I have some thoughts, but I don't want to talk about them," he said. Moments later, he appeared to retreat from that statement, insisting, "I do not have a plan." 
 Throughout the interview, Mr. Pataki, who is running for re-election, dwelled on the accomplishments of his first term, like cutting taxes, promoting business growth and changing the welfare system. "There were a lot of skeptics around the state who didn't believe that we'd be able to achieve what we set out to do," he said. "But I think if you look back over what we've achieved in the last four years it is truly historic."
But the Governor had little to say about what he would do if voters granted him a second term on Nov. 3, except that it would be more of the same. In addition to his coyness on campaign finance, he was elusive on other topics, including the next state budget, legislative redistricting after the next census, and whether he would run for President or Vice President in 2000.
He also refused to be pinned down as to whether he would debate his Democratic opponent, Peter F. Vallone, or to explain why, a month after Mr. Vallone began demanding debates, none have taken place or been scheduled. He said it was up to the candidates' campaigns to arrange debates, as if he had no say in the process.
When asked to list his agenda for a second term, Mr. Pataki declined. "In '94 I didn't say there were one or two top goals, and I wouldn't say it now," he said. In fact in 1994, when he was running for his first term, Mr. Pataki did campaign on two main issues: reducing taxes and reinstituting the death penalty. He often cites his success in achieving both goals.
Among the few specific objectives Mr. Pataki did cite in the interview were apprenticeships for welfare recipients and removing pollution from the Hudson River.
"The reason why I want to have another four years is that we've just started, and there's so much more to do," he said.
On the way candidates raise money to run for office, the Governor said: "Our campaign finance system is dreadful. I think it's dreadful. And I don't like it, I have never liked it. What we need is a comprehensive approach to solve it."
Such sentiments are notable if only because the Governor has done exceedingly well under the current system, and he has shown no inclination in the past to change it. He raised $14.5 million for his 1994 run, setting a record for New York campaigns that he has shattered this year, raising nearly $20 million.
The Governor said there should be restrictions on "independent expenditure" campaigns that interest groups, from unions to the tobacco industry, run for or against candidates. "They don't even have to file and disclose who they are and what they're spending money on," he said.
There should also be limits, he said, on how much of their own money wealthy people can spend in pursuit of public office, referring obliquely to B. Thomas Golisano, the Independence Party candidate running against Mr. Pataki, who plans to spend $20 million of his money.
But Mr. Pataki acknowledged that so far, no one has found a way to reach either goal without unconstitutionally restricting free speech.
The Governor said any attempt at campaign finance reform should also look at "soft money," the unlimited contributions that parties can accept as long as they do not go directly into specific campaigns, and at transfers from parties to candidates, or between candidates. But he would not say that he opposed either practice.
Looking ahead, Mr. Pataki would not pledge to serve out a second four-year term, or rule out a campaign for national office. "It's flattering when people talk, you know, and say that you could run for national office," he said. "It has never been an obsession of mine; New York State has been."
"But," he added, "you never say never."
He offered some criticism of his party's leaders in Congress, who he said "had a difficult time transitioning from a minority to a majority," and said that in 2000, governors like him ought to become more involved in setting the Republican national agenda.
"I think there's a very real difference between the Republicans who have had to govern and administer governments and those who have had the luxury of legislating," he said.
In reviewing his record, the Governor concentrated on tax cuts and on the ways he has lightened burdens on business, like lowering the cost of worker's compensation and unemployment insurance, and deregulating hospital pricing.
"Every single year we have been number one in America in reducing taxes," he said. The result of his policies, he said, is, "We're seeing economic growth that we haven't seen in years prior to that." The Governor boasted, as he frequently does, that private-sector employment is up by 360,000 jobs since he took office, though New York's pace of growth still lags behind the national rate and been concentrated in the New York City area.
Mr. Pataki defended his handling of state finances, and dismissed warnings from some of the state's independent fiscal monitors that it has become too dependent on Wall Street, and too vulnerable to a sharp downturn. He noted that the state had ended each of the last three fiscal years with a large surplus, and is headed for another surplus this year.
"We have never counted on Wall Street continuing," he said.
Mr. Pataki spoke frequently of the sharp declines in crime and in the welfare rolls, taking much of the credit for both. He asserted that most of the 570,000 people who have left welfare have found work, and grew insistent when asked how he knew that to be the case.
"Well, of course it's true," he said. "If they're not on social services, what do you think?"
A study earlier this year by the State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance found that of people who had left welfare over a nine-month period in 1996 and 1997, only 29 percent had found even minimal employment. But Mr. Pataki said the State Department of Labor was working on a more detailed effort to track what became of former welfare recipients.

HEADLINE: Mrs. Hume's 'You Got It!' Confirms Prize

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY 

DATELINE: BELFAST, Northern Ireland, Oct. 16

 BODY:
On the morning he won the Nobel Peace Prize, John Hume got out of bed, as usual at 8:30, made himself some Alpen and bananas for breakfast and prepared to spend another day in his life's work: trying to permanently end sectarian violence in this predominantly Protestant British province.
But before the news of the prize came, Mr. Hume, the most prominent mainstream Roman Catholic leader in the province, could not help wondering about the award, he said in an interview here this afternoon."They told me I would get a phone call from the prize committee if I won. I never got the phone call," he said. Instead, a journalist phoned from Oslo and said there were reports that he had won. His wife, Pat, turned on the radio at about 10 A.M. in the living room of their house in Londonderry, west of Belfast. 
 "You got it, John!" shouted his wife, who has also been his chief assistant for the 30 years of his relentless campaign for a peaceful settlement involving the Protestant majority, the Catholic minority and the British Army and police.
"I don't know what I thought when I heard," he said. "I was very pleased, of course. But I see it as a very powerful statement that has given international endorsement for the peace process."
Then, he straightened his gold and black patterned necktie and went to work, talking peace to groups in Londonderry and Belfast, acknowledging without a smile that he was pleased with the award.
In public, he used the same old calm, logical words he has used thousands of times, telling an audience of Catholic and Protestant schoolgirls in Belfast that, "We'll spill our sweat together, not our blood. Your generation must lay the foundation for a new society. Did you choose to be born Catholic or Protestant? So why fight with someone from the other community."
And he quoted the words of warning his unemployed father gave him as a boy in persuading him to to shun the violence of the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republican Army: 'You can't eat a flag.'
He posed with the girls, opening his too-tight suit jacket revealing that he has grown heavier in recent months. His sometimes unkempt black hair was neatly combed. Some of the girls tittered and squeaked and asked for his autograph.
Being treated like a celebrity was an unfamiliar role. The paternal advice led Mr. Hume, a French teacher in the 1960's, to become a champion of a peaceful settlement. In Washington he urged the Government not to listen to highly vocal I.R.A. supporters in the United States.
But during a day of fielding hundreds of questions, he refused, when asked, to say the prize was a validation of his life's work. However, most ordinary people here, many government officials and experts agree that without Mr. Hume's effort there would be no peace agreement.
The pact, approved in the spring, drastically reshapes political power in the province, giving Catholics more power and giving the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic more influence in northern affairs.
But, the Nobel prize day also underscored the fact that Mr. Hume, 61, and suffering from a nerve disorder, is getting ready to distance himself from the wearying peace effort -- thousands of debates, seemingly endless contentious issues, deals within deals, careful political statements designed to keep the two sides talking, not shooting and bombing.
His gradual withdrawal from the effort began in June when he allowed Seamus Mallow, a colleague in the mainstream Catholic Social Democratic Labor Party, to become the Catholic leader in the Assembly with the title Deputy First Minister.
This afternoon, at the Dominican College here, a girl said he seemed to be drifting away from Northern Ireland after all his years as a peace advocate. No, he said, he would continue to work for the province in London where he is a member of Parliament and in Strasbourg where he has a seat in the European Parliament, as well as in Washington.
But he acknowledged that he had stepped back in the new Assembly, where much work remains, because "I couldn't take on the extra work."
When a reporter for French television asked what he would do with his share of the $960,000 prize money, he said, "Ce n'est pas pour moi, mais pour le peuple. Un prix symbolique." ("It is not for me, but for the people. A symbolic prize.")
As to the money, he smiled broadly and said he would be able to use it "tres bien." ("Very well.")

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN;
In an Interview, the Governor Stresses Crime, Welfare and Tax Cuts

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from an interview with Gov. George E. Pataki on Thursday with editors, reporters and executives of The New York Times:
What's on my mind, obviously, is the hope that the people of the state give me the opportunity to lead New York for the next four years. I think back to when I sat around here in 1994 and laid out an agenda and talked about what we were going to do. And I know there were a lot of skeptics here, that you were not alone. There were a lot of skeptics around the state who didn't believe that we'd be able to achieve what we set out to do. 
 But I think if you look back over what we've achieved in the last four years it is truly historic. We did what we said we were going to do. And we've done a lot more than that.
And I remember, as I'm sure you do, in 1994 we had three cornerstones of what we talked about.
One was crime. The most important thing government does is provide for the safety of its people. No state has done more. We have dramatically transformed the laws of this state in ways that people thought couldn't be done. And our streets are the safest they have been in over a generation. And we are leading the nation in reducing violent crime.
The second area I talked about was welfare reform and how 1 of 11 residents was trapped in welfare and how we were going to replace it with workfare. And I'm sure a lot of you thought that was good rhetoric but nonsensical policy. Well, the fact is it was more than good rhetoric. It's been tremendous policy, and it has resulted in a dramatic change in our system that not only has saved the taxpayers money, but, more importantly, has changed people's lives and replaced a system that encouraged dependency with one that requires responsibility. And today we have 571,000 fewer people on welfare than in January of 1995, an absolutely historic number. And we didn't throw anybody off by saying that this category or another category is not going to be eligible. We didn't raise the eligibility standards. We just said that there are going to be certain requirements for those of you who look to participate in that system.
And we talked about tax cuts. And I said we'd cut the personal income tax by 25 percent because we had to restore an economic climate where people felt they could invest and create jobs. And we not only did, we've cut the income tax by more than 25 percent for the vast majority of New Yorkers. But every single year we have been number one in America in reducing taxes -- business taxes, energy taxes, transportation taxes, real estate taxes. We are now in the process of repealing the estate tax so that you won't have to go back to Alabama for six months and a day. You'll be able to stay in New York year-round.
And the results have been what we would have thought. We're seeing economic growth that we haven't seen in years prior to that -- more than 360,000 new private sector jobs.
The reason why I want to have another four years is that we've just started, and there's so much more to do.
In 1994 I didn't even talk about the environment. I didn't talk about the arts. I didn't talk about reforming the health care system and other areas where we felt it was important to do things simply because we had to have a focused agenda for a limited period of time in the campaign. But since that time, not only have we done more in the areas that we focused on during the course of the campaign than we said we would do -- far more in every single area -- but we've also taken areas like the environment where we are transforming what New York State does and again reclaiming national leadership. And we have dramatically changed the entire method of health-care delivery in New York State in a way that hasn't gotten public attention and at the same time done things like create a historic program: expansion of the Child Health Plus program where we are the best -- we have the best system in America to guarantee affordable, basically free, comprehensive health care to every single child of New York other than those who can afford to make the payments.
So it's been, I think, a successful four years. There's a lot more that we want to do and we hope to have the opportunity to continue to do.
 
State's Fiscal Health
When I took office in January of '95, we had a brutal budget fight. In 1995, no one disputed the fact that we had a $5 billion deficit in the fiscal year. Democrats, Republicans, they all said yes, we have a $5 billion deficit. By our fiscal policies we've not only led the nation every year in cutting taxes, but every year we have created a surplus, and then increased the surplus. Four hundred million surplus the first year. A billion two surplus the second year. A $2 billion surplus the third year. And this year we are on track -- and we just got the recent numbers for the first six months of the year -- notwithstanding what has been going on on Wall Street in the last three years, for a more than billion dollar surplus again. In fact, our numbers are better than that.
A more than billion dollar surplus, and, in fact, after the first six months our numbers are at least $150 million better than projected when the budget was adopted.
We have never counted on Wall Street continuing. We have never counted on the global rate of economic growth continuing to explode the way it was. And that's why we built in, consciously, surpluses over these years. Because what I've always said is I'd rather be pleasantly surprised by a continuation of a boom or an expansion that we know will not continue forever.
 
New York State Debt
 There are three parts of state debt. The state-supported debt: That is where the state issues bonds and directly is responsible. Then there's state-related debt: That is what used to be called the moral obligation debts. When the U.D.C. Urban Development Corporation floats $500 million in bonds, the U.D.C. doesn't have a revenue stream to pay it off. It is a moral obligation of the state to pay off those debts. And then there is authority debt, public authority debt. Public authority debt is not counted by the rating agencies because it's backed by revenue. So the Power Authority, the Long Island Power Authority, the M.T.A. State-supported debt has gone from about $28 billion to about $34 billion.
State-related debt has gone from a little over $7 billion to about $1 billion because we have paid off almost $6 billion in the pre-existing moral obligation debt. So that total state-related debt, which is what the rating agencies base their analysis on, is up significantly less than $1 billion in over four years. And I know that's not the perception. But those are in fact the numbers.
The authority debt, our authorities, a number of them have been upgraded, as well as the state. And that the Standard & Poor's for the first time in I think, it's 12 years, upgraded the state's ratings in September of '97 specifically stating that we have done a much better job in managing debt. And every, I believe, it's every single authority today has more net operating revenue after debt service than they did when I took office.
 
Election-Year Budget Increases
The first priority is to make sure that the state budget is soundly balanced in a way that provides for stability and a cushion. . . .
You look at the budget, we are accessing a lot more Federal funds. So it's one of the reasons why we are expanding, why the budget numbers have gone up. The state fund numbers have not gone up as much. The state fund numbers did go up because we had the revenues, we had the surplus. Even with the tax cuts, we believe we're soundly balanced going forward prospectively, and we're investing it in sound programs like education.
There's a projected $1.8 billion deficit in the upcoming fiscal year. But we'll have more than a billion dollar surplus. Let me just say, there's a huge difference between starting your fiscal year with a $5 billion deficit as we did in 1995 and starting your year with a $2 billion surplus as we did in 1998. And that is, I believe, a significant part of the direct result of our intelligent policies and managing both the finances and the economic condition of the state.
 
Goals in a Second Term
In '94 I didn't say there were one or two top goals, and I wouldn't say it now. The basic concept that has driven me from the beginning is we want people to have confidence in the future of their community and of their state. We want them to take a look -- whether it's where do I send my kid to school, where do I buy a home, where do I invest and create jobs, where do I retire, where do I locate next to a program, a playground. We want them to believe. And have a sound rational basis to believe that this is the right place.
And that comes down to criminal justice. People have to feel safe in their community, and people have a right to feel safe in their community regardless of where they live and shouldn't have to live behind an iron gate with a private guard to feel safe. We're proud of what we've done with criminal justice. And everybody's saying, and it's true, the streets are the safest they've been since 1970. In 1970, I lived in Washington Heights, and I remember thinking, my God it's awfully dangerous here, because I used to take the A train from 168th Street down. And I'm kind of a big guy.
I don't think we can sit back and say that our efforts to make the streets safer are over. We'd have to do more.
We've dramatically restructured the welfare system, and we're 571,000 fewer. But we can't just sit back and say to those people who still have talent and ability and a desire to participate and develop their own skills that we've done enough. . . .
On the economic side, we are always in competition. Yesterday, those four companies announcing the 1,200 manufacturing jobs, every one of them was solicited by at least one other state actively trying to get them to leave New York or to locate in their state instead of locating in New York. We beat them. But you have to continually look to see -- whether it's reducing the regulatory burden or lowering energy rates, or continuing to push down workers compensation rates -- how you can do better. And on the environment, which has always been one of the areas that I've been extremely committed to for future generations, we've done more than this state has done in decades. But there's still so much more to do.
You know, I signed a legislation creating the Hudson River Park. It's not there. We have to make sure that it's done and that it's done right. We have to make sure that the Hudson River is clean.
 
National Ambition
It's flattering when people talk and say you could run for national office. It has never been an obsession of mine; New York State has been. I really am proud to be a New Yorker and love this state. And if the people give me the opportunity to run the state for the next four years I will do my best. But you never say never. You know, what I want to do is be in a position where I can do the most to make this a better state. And there's no question in my mind that as of now that's as Governor.
 
Campaign Finance Reform
Our campaign finance system is dreadful. I think it's dreadful. And I don't like it. I have never liked it. What we need is a comprehensive approach to solve it. . . .
But it's not simple. One of the phenomenon that I think is most dangerous and distressing to me that we're seeing is that so much of a political campaign is run outside of the candidates' campaign. I don't have any qualms taking responsibility and accountability for my ads or my campaign's positions on an issue, but what we're seeing is a proliferation of independent expenditures by interest groups, by political parties, by individuals that are unaccountable. And they not only are unaccountable for the candidate, but they don't even have to file and disclose who they are and what they're spending money on. And whether it's the teachers' union going after Senator D'Amato or the Republican State Party going after somebody else, I think we have to have some method where they are held accountable and subject to some reasonable restraints. And that also goes for individuals like an individual who is spending $20 million complimenting me on my leadership of the state over the course of the last four years.
But the problem is the United States constitutional restriction on freedom of speech. How do you come up with a comprehensive approach that doesn't just say Candidate X, instead of getting $5,000 from this group, he can now only get $2,000 from this group. Meanwhile that group can spend $5 million in an unaccountable way. The question is how, given the Supreme Court restraints, can you have a comprehensive approach that deals with everything from independent expenditures to soft money. I have some thoughts, but I don't want to talk about them...
I do not have a plan...
It's something where I certainly understand the need to change it. I think any change has to deal with all the different elements and not simply reduce the contribution limit and then force more into the ether of independent expenditures or advocacy campaigns. But I certainly, not only am willing to listen to ideas, but hopefully I'm going to be proposing -- suggesting -- some ideas that I will come up with if I'm around as we go forward.
 
The Budget Process
I think we actually finally made progress towards that this year. That with the open budget process. It's something I have been calling for for, that the Governor, whether it's me or any other governor, lays out your budget and people know what you're trying to get for better or for worse. In 1995 for a lot of the groups it was for worse. But they knew what I was trying to do, knew what my position was, and I had no qualms talking about it from one end of the state to the other. Behind closed doors people can take positions that are very different from what they might advocate in the open. And what I've said from the beginning is the Assembly should pass their own version of the budget in the open, in the light of day, then in the open, in the light of day have joint conference committees. Do it. They did it in 1998. I think it was a great process.
 
Gubernatorial Debates
I'm really proud of my effort. And I'd like the opportunity to go across the state talking about it. And I'm also confident of my ideas as to what we can do in the future going forward. But we want to make sure that's what it really is. That it's a debate about the issues affecting the future of the state and the campaigns have met and I would hope would continue to meet and could come to a resolution so that we can do it.
 
Role in National G.O.P.
I think there's a very real difference between the Republicans who have had to govern and administer governments and those who had the luxury of legislating. There's a very real difference. And I think if you look at where the Republican Party has been successful, it has been with those objectives. Governors across the country from the largest states to the smallest states successfully changing their states and governing well. I think it's 32 states now have Republican governors, and there's a reason for it. Because I think we have shown that we can change things and improve people's lives and make for more responsive and intelligent government.
I think part of the reason is when you govern, it's fine to be philosophical, but ultimately you have to be practical and you have to solve problems. You can't just have abstract positions. You have to, in fact, make sure those positions are practical and will work on the streets of the communities you lead.
And I think there has been a difference between the Washington party, which I think has had a difficult time transitioning from a minority to a majority, and those of us who have been governing and governing successfully. So I would intend in 2000 -- and don't read anything into this -- but to be far more active. Because I think part of the problem and one of the reasons the Republicans did poorly in 1996 is it was largely a Washington-oriented convention.
 
Anti-Bias Law for Gay People
 It's something that I think is very, very important. I think that New York state is a special state, and one of the reasons is because we have always expressed a caring and compassion for each other and a level of tolerance. And I think that passing the bias-crime legislation, including a provision protecting those who would be discriminated against based on sexua orientation, is very important. And I have said that time and again to the Senate and will continue to urge them, even if they disagree, to allow a vote.
 But I can no more force the senate to vote on that than I can force the assembly to vote on the dairy compact. Some legislators, legislatures are very jealous of the balance of the constitutional seperation of powers

HEADLINE: Caterpillar Profit Is Down 12.7%

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc., the largest manufacturer of construction and earth-moving equipment, said today that third-quarter profits fell 12.7 percent because of weaker sales in Asia and global competition that forced the company to lower prices.
The results, well below Wall Street forecasts, helped deepen the gloom surrounding Caterpillar and other companies that continue to suffer from a global economic crisis that is slowing worldwide demand for farm and construction equipment. 
 Shares of Caterpillar, which is based in Peoria, Ill., fell $1, or 2.1 percent, to $47.
"It certainly looks like the competitive landscape has gotten worse," said David A. Bleustein, an analyst at Paine Webber. "There is much more pricing pressure than there was three months ago."
Caterpillar said, however, that revenue growth was strong, with sales of $5.17 billion in the third quarter, up 12.5 percent from a year earlier, largely because of rising sales spurred by lower prices, huge discounts and strong demand in the United States and Europe.
Profits for the quarter were $336 million or 92 cents a share, down from $385 million or $1.01 a share a year earlier. Wall Street analysts had forecast $1 a share.
Slowing demand for farm and construction equipment in Asia and Latin America and Caterpillar's acquisition of Perkins Engines in February cut into profits. Caterpillar was also hurt by its foreign currency exposure, because of the strong dollar, and by a heavier sales mix of equipment that had lower profit margins.
Another reason for the slowdown, according to Marsha Hausser, a spokeswoman, was Caterpillar's large investments in future growth. She said the company had fought hard in recent months to retain its market share in equipment sales.

Shares Rise for Second Day on Euphoria Over a Rate Cut

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Confidence stemming from the Federal Reserve Board's second interest rate cut in three weeks spread further through financial markets yesterday, as stock prices registered strong gains in heavy trading and bond yields fell.
By the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average, which soared more than 330 points Thursday in an enthusiastic response to the rate reductions orchestrated by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, advanced another 117.40, or 1.41 percent, to 8,416.76. For the week, the blue-chip index was up 6.55 percent. 
 Broader market averages also posted healthy gains.
Capping its best week in 14 years, the Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 8.93 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,056.42. For the week, the index gained 7.31 percent, its best showing since the week of Sept. 3, 1984, according to Birinyi & Associates.
And the Nasdaq composite index concluded its best week in 24 years, rising 9.94 points, or six-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,620.95. For the week, the technology-heavy Nasdaq soared 8.6 percent.
"The benefit of what Mr. Greenspan did for stocks on Thursday is not so much an indication that the Fed will provide liquidity to the system, but to instill a sense of confidence in the system again," said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
"To some degree, things have shut down in financial markets, due to a loss of confidence, " Mr. Olesky said, referring to what has happened since Russia defaulted on its sovereign debt in August. "You don't have to look very far now to realize that people are much more constructive on the market."
The gains left all three major indexes in positive territory for the year. Since the first day of trading in January, the Dow is up 6.4 percent, the S.& P. 500 is up 8.9 percent and the Nasdaq composite is up 3.2 percent.
Shares of small companies, which have been battered so far this year, also finished with strong gains.
Two stocks rose for every one that fell in price. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company shares gained 8.06 points, or 2.4 percent, to 342.87. At more than 1 billion shares, volume on the New York Stock Exchange was the fourth busiest in the history of the Big Board.
In large measure, the interest rate cuts by the Fed over the last two weeks have generated hope among investors that the central bank will do all it can to avert a downturn in the American economy by cutting interest rates further.
The sense that the Fed is prepared to cut the overnight Federal funds rate, currently at 5 percent, still further is readily apparent in the credit markets.
Although yields on 30-year Treasury bonds rose marginally, to 4.98 percent, from 4.97 percent Thursday, the rate on three-month Treasury bills, the rate most sensitive to changes in the overnight Federal funds rate, fell by 30 basis points, to a bond-equivalent yield of 3.61 percent. It was the biggest one-day drop in the three-month bill rate since the summer of 1992.
"We are going to get more rate cuts, maybe at the next Fed meeting in November," said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis. "The Fed is our friend."
Short-term rates were also responding yesterday to continued rumors that a big bank or other financial institution is near failure.
As they often have in recent days, the rumors focused on the health of Bankers Trust, which is expected to release its third-quarter earnings report next week.
Yesterday, Bankers Trust came under heavy selling pressure in the stock market, losing 5 1/2, to 51 3/8, on a day when most financial stocks posted good gains.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Timing a Rate Cut: The Fed Acts Quickly

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
He is revered in the financial markets these days as omnipotent and omniscient, but Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has not always gotten it right.
In 1990, the American banking system was seizing up. Many institutions had been hit hard by losses on real estate loans, and regulators were demanding that they keep more capital on hand. Banks became reluctant to lend, and the credit shortage helped push the economy into recession. 
 Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues at the Fed largely missed the problem, cutting interest rates aggressively to stimulate more lending only after the economy began to contract. And as he confronts another credit shortage that could put the nation's long business expansion at risk, Mr. Greenspan is determined not to make the same mistake again, as evidenced by his unusual decision on Thursday to cut rates by a quarter percentage point between the central bank's regularly scheduled policy meetings. Economists now expect a series of further rate reductions this year and possibly into next year.
"Virtually the only blemish on Mr. Greenspan's record as chairman was in not acting forcefully enough to offset the 1989-1990 credit crunch, which was the fundamental cause of the 1990 recession," said G. David Orr, an economist at First Union Capital Markets. "He will not want to be caught in that situation again."
In acting assertively, Mr. Greenspan was trying to break a psychology within the markets that more bad news was almost inevitable and that the risks to investors and lenders were only growing. In doing so, however, he may have had to sidestep reluctance among some members the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee who remain concerned that lower rates could fuel inflation by stimulating an economy that by some measures, including a very low unemployment rate, is already running hard.
The committee voted just over two weeks ago to cut its Federal funds target rate on overnight lending between banks by a quarter-point, to 5.25 percent, turning aside pressure from the financial markets and many economists for a half-point cut.
That Mr. Greenspan then cut rates on Thursday by another quarter- point suggested to many analysts that the Fed chairman had wanted a half-point cut in the first place, but had not been willing at that time to force a showdown over the issue with committee members who still see a potential threat from inflation.
Mr. Greenspan announced his decision after convening a conference call among the committee's members early Thursday afternoon. A spokeswoman for the Fed said no vote was taken and that Mr. Greenspan acted on his own authority, which is routinely granted to him by the committee but rarely used.
Mr. Greenspan appears to have had widespread support within the Fed, since 8 of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks requested that the central bank also reduce the discount rate on their short-term loans to commercial banks. Among the banks requesting the discount rate cut was the St. Louis Fed, whose president, William Poole, was among those most concerned earlier this year about the inflation risks.
But analysts said Mr. Greenspan prefers to develop a consensus before acting. Determined opposition from even one or two members of the committee, such as Jerry L. Jordan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, who has been concerned that growth in the money supply is signaling a possible upturn in inflation, would be enough to give Mr. Greenspan pause, they said.
"Greenspan has been wanting to cut interest rates earlier and faster, but the inflation hawks on the Federal Open Market Committee held him back," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at the Norwest Corporation, a Minneapolis banking company. "At the September meeting Greenspan was able to convince the hawks that the global situation indeed is dangerous. But at that point the hawks were not willing to let Greenspan go more than a quarter of a point."
Since then, Mr. Sohn said, there have been new indications that the economy is slowing and that inflation remains dormant. Today, for example, the Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index was unchanged last month, leaving the inflation rate for the last 12 months at just 1.5 percent. Earlier in the week the Government had reported weakening retail sales and subdued price increases at the producer level.
"My belief is that Chairman Greenspan basically called the members and gave them the appearance of consulting," Mr. Sohn said. "But it was clearly more of a formality, especially in light of the more negative economic numbers."
In trying to avert a credit shortage, Mr. Greenspan is dealing with market psychology more than a mismatch between demand and supply in the economy. His decision to cut rates at an unexpected time may have been calculated to give a maximum boost to the markets, where fear about recession at home and a further meltdown in the world financial system has led investors and lenders to shy away from the merest whiff of risk.
In the short run, at least, the rate cut succeeded on that score. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped a further 117.40 points today after a 330.58-point gain Thursday, and is nearly 12 percent higher than the low of 7,539.07 reached Aug. 31. The Standard & Poor's index and Nasdaq index also ended the week with strong gains.
"Dr. Greenspan, ace psychologist, knew his clients needed some positive reinforcement," Mr. Orr said.
But it is still too early to know whether interest rate cuts will convince investors that high-grade corporate bonds are not so risky after all, or reassure banks that the business outlook is sufficiently bright that it is reasonable to provide new loans. While the Fed has some tools, like the discount rate, that can directly help to encourage more lending by banks, it can only indirectly stimulate greater availability of capital in the financial markets, where most big companies turn for funds.
In a report today, Robert V. DiClemente and David Hensley, economists at Salomon Smith Barney, said "new issuance of investment-grade corporate bonds remains sporadic and hesitant," with the volume, at $3.5 billion for the first half of October, far behind July's $19 billion.
Mr. Greenspan has several important factors working in his favor. The almost total lack of inflation gives him considerable room to push rates down further in coming months. When adjusted for inflation, in fact, the Fed funds target rate is still relatively high -- about 3 percent. Because the Federal Government is running a budget surplus there will be no inflationary pressures from fiscal policy.
Compared with 1990, Mr. Greenspan has also gotten off to a much faster start in dealing with the evolving problem, said Maury N. Harris, an economist at Paine Webber. By the time the Fed started easing rates in the summer of 1990, 43 percent of banks had already tightened lending standards on loans to small companies, compared with 23 percent last month, Mr. Harris said.
"In 1990, the bank credit crunch had become more serious than the current credit situation before the Fed started to let the investing public and American business leaders know that it was plugged into the problem and willing to ease," he said.

Cut in U.S. Interest Rates Helps Markets Rally Abroad
Stock markets in Asia and Europe surged in response to Thursday's interest rate reduction by the Federal Reserve. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index jumped 9 percent, to 9,777.01, its highest level since early May. 
 Shares in Singapore, Bangkok, Jakarta and Manila all rose more than 5 percent. The Nikkei index of 225 issues in Tokyo gained 2.19 percent. The German DAX index climbed 1.76 percent, and the main market gauge in London increased 1.38 percent. Page C2.
 
Wall Street's Advance Is Extended
Stocks registered strong gains as confidence stemming from the Federal Reserve's second interest rate cut in three weeks spread. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 117.40 points, or 1.41 percent, to 8,416.76. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 8.93 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,056.42. And the Nasdaq composite index rose 9.94 points to 1,620.95. For the week the Nasdaq index rose 8.6 percent, its best performance in 24 years. C3.
 
Mild Gain in Social Security Benefits
The Government said Social Security benefits will rise 1.3 percent next year, the smallest cost-of-living increase since 1987, because of exceptionally low inflation. More than 44 million Americans, most of them elderly, receive Social Security benefits. A10.

Budget Agreement Still Needs Work
Some Republicans sounded notes of discord over the $1.7 trillion Federal budget deal, but they also said they would probably vote for the package because it increased defense spending and provided aid to farmers. However, no one can vote on the package just yet because there are still disputes to iron out. A1.
 
Tucked into the $1.7 trillion Federal budget agreement is a measure that would restrict children's access to pornography on the Internet. The measure says Internet merchants and others will be in violation only if they give children access to material that is "harmful to minors." A10.
 
Production Declined Last Month
Output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities fell three-tenths of 1 percent in September and consumer prices were unchanged last month for the first time in six months, further signs that the economy is slowing. A third economic indicator, the University of Michigan's index of consumer confidence, fell to 98.9 this month from 100.9 in September. C2.
 
Shake-Up Continues at Merrill Lynch
A shake-up in the executive suite continued at Merrill Lynch. The leading brokerage firm, led by David H. Komansky, left, named G. Kelly Martin, 39, as chief of the debt business, replacing Seth Waugh, who will become Mr. Martin's deputy. Mr. Waugh had been co-head of the global debt unit since 1997. The change is the second in two days. On Thursday, Merrill named Richard A. Dunn to replace Daniel T. Napoli as head of its risk management team. Both Mr. Waugh and Mr. Napoli were demoted, but the firm said it was not assigning blame to them and that both would stay on the job. C14.
 
Hoechst Calls Off Sale of Herberts
The German chemical maker Hoechst has ended talks to sell its Herberts paint unit to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. The buyout firm was offering a price below what Hoechst was willing to accept. C3.
 
Nissan Motor Expects a Net Loss
Nissan Motor, Japan's second-largest auto maker, said that it expected to post a net loss of 33 billion yen ($284 million) for the first half of the current business year because of huge losses on its securities holdings. C2.
 
Profits Decline at Caterpillar
Caterpillar, the manufacturer of construction and earth-moving equipment, reported that third-quarter profits fell 12.7 percent, to $336 million, or 92 cents a diluted share. Sales jumped 12.5 percent, to $5.17 billion. C2.

To the Editor:
Re "Albany to Make Trucks Pass Emission Tests" (news article, Oct. 15): New York State's concern about vehicular emissions deserves applause. However, mandated emission testing needs to be balanced by incentives to induce private fleets to purchase alternative-fuel vehicles.
The Alternative Fuel Vehicle Act of 1997 offers tax credits toward the purchase of clean trucks and buses. The State Legislature needs to augment its 1997 effort by reducing the taxes on alternative fuels like natural gas. New York City, in turn, should offer "green curbs" -- preferred curb-side parking for clean-fuel delivery trucks. 
 New York can follow the examples of California, Connecticut and Rhode Island, balancing mandates with incentives. Private truckers will respond to comprehensive incentives that yield economically viable clean-fuel fleets.

KELLOGG EXPECTS '98 PER-SHARE EARNINGS TO FALL 20%

BYLINE: Reuters 

 BODY:
The Kellogg Company, the nation's largest cereal maker, said yesterday that it expected its 1998 earnings per share to fall about 20 percent from 1997 because of global economic turmoil and weakness in its two largest cereal markets: the United States and Britain. The forecast was ever gloomier than a projection by Kellogg in July, when it said it expected a decline in 1998 per-share earnings of up to 15 percent. Kellogg, which makes 12 of the world's top 15 cereal brands, reported a profit of $1.70 a share for 1997. Kellogg has been grappling with fierce competition from its branded cereal competitors and lower-priced bagged cereals. On the New York Stock Exchange, Kellogg's shares dropped $3.5625 yesterday, to $34.0625.

HEADLINE: New Stock Exchange Site Under Discussion

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
City and state officials told the New York Stock Exchange yesterday that they were on the verge of securing a site for a new headquarters and trading complex for the market directly across the street from its historic home on Wall Street, according to people involved in the discussions.
But in what has become a high-stakes poker game, the Stock Exchange did not immediately embrace the proposal, saying it was exploring all of its options. 
 In an effort to insure that the financial district in lower Manhattan remains the financial capital of the world, officials have been scrambling to come up with a real estate deal for the exchange, which has threatened to move to Battery Park City or New Jersey unless the city comes up with an alternative by Nov. 4.
In a meeting at the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine and Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, told the chairman of the exchange, Richard A. Grasso, that they were confident a deal could be struck for the site, according to people who were there. Four office buildings owned or controlled by J. P. Morgan & Company now sit on the block, along with an apartment building. The site is bound by Wall Street and Exchange Place, between Broad and William Streets.
Under the terms of the proposal, the state would condemn the property and acquire the land, which would be ready for demolition and construction in 2001.
Officials at the Stock Exchange expressed reservations about the proposal, yet another indication that they may favor moving to vacant land at Battery Park City. The exchange has no desire to antagonize city and state officials, however, because it wants hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds for a new headquarters.
"As currently presented, the economics have yet to justify building a new New York Stock Exchange trading facility on the old J. P. Morgan site," Richard Adamonis, a spokesman for the exchange, said yesterday. "We continue to keep all options open."
The so-called J. P. Morgan site first surfaced as a possible home for the stock exchange in 1991, when Morgan and city and state officials proposed building a $1 billion super exchange for the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and the city's commodities exchanges.
Negotiations dragged on for a year. But in the midst of a severe recession that left a quarter of the office space vacant in lower Manhattan, the New York Stock Exchange decided not to go forward.
Six years later, historic preservationists blocked a plan by the New York Stock Exchange to build a new trading floor on the Morgan site and a glass atrium over Broad Street that would have connected the old and the new buildings.
Desperate to get out of its cramped space on Wall Street, the Exchange told city officials in April that it wanted to move to Battery Park City, where it could build a modern complex on vacant, state-owned land.
And when the stock exchange felt that City Hall was not paying sufficient attention to its problems, Mr. Grasso announced that New Jersey was offering all kinds of enticements to move to Jersey City.
Ultimately, the exchange agreed to give New York officials six months to come up with an alternative that would keep the market in the financial district. Landlords and businesses were alarmed that the loss of the exchange would undercut the downtown renaissance and spark the exodus of many financial companies.
For four months, city officials negotiated with property owners on a block bound by Broad and William Streets, between Beaver Street and Exchange Place. The most difficult problem was at 25 Broad Street, where a developer, Crescent Heights Investments, had spent $100 million converting the vacant office building into 345 apartments -- a move the city encouraged.
Bruce Menin, the president of Crescent Heights, said yesterday that he had been in negotiations with city officials but had not heard from them recently.
In recent weeks, city officials suddenly resurrected the old J. P. Morgan proposal, hoping to strike a less complicated deal with J. P. Morgan, which has more than 2,500 employees in four buildings on the block, and the Elghanayan family, which owns the apartment house at 45 Wall Street.
Real estate executives say that Morgan believes it is imperative that the stock exchange remain in the financial district.

HEADLINE: Brandeis at 50 Is Still Searching, Still Jewish and Still Not Harvard

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

 BODY:
Half a century ago, when a group of uneducated immigrant Jews scraped together enough money to buy a bankrupt medical and veterinary school in Waltham, Mass., west of Boston, they named it Brandeis University and set out to found the Harvard of the Jews.
The plan was dismissed by many as pie in the sky. But it was a propitious moment. The Nazis had been defeated, Israel had been created, the civil rights era was in its infancy, higher education was on the brink of explosive growth and American Jews were still restricted in their access to many institutions. 
 So when the new university named after Louis D. Brandeis, the first Jewish Justice of the Supreme Court, quickly became home to renowned intellectuals like Leonard Bernstein, Max Lerner and Herbert Marcuse, the plan seemed on track.
In the intervening decades, however, something happened that Brandeis's founders did not foresee. The Jews' fervent drive for acceptance, prosperity and a role in shaping American culture succeeded so well -- partly through the efforts of Brandeis -- that Brandeis never became the Harvard of the Jews.
Harvard became the Harvard of the Jews as did Yale, Columbia, the University of Pennsylvania and the rest of elite American colleges, where Jews, who make up 2 1/2 percent of the American population, typically make up 20 percent of students and faculty members.
"Jews are no longer trying to get into the American academic establishment," said Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, a historian of American Jewry. "They are the academic establishment. The problem Brandeis had come to solve has been solved."
But solutions are sometimes new problems in disguise.
As Brandeis alumni and friends gathered this weekend to celebrate the 50th anniversary of their Jewish-sponsored, non-sectarian university -- the old broken buildings and dirt paths now a groomed 235-acre campus -- they are struggling with how to position their institution in its middle age.
Other universities created to serve specific groups at certain historical moments, like black and women's colleges and even some small religious schools, are also struggling to reinvent themselves.
In the case of Brandeis, as Israel has become secure, as the generation that suffered the Holocaust dies, as Jews continue to rise freely through the ranks of politics, industry and the media, Brandeis and American Jewry together face a challenge unprecedented in Jewish history: How to forge an identity divorced from persecution?
"What do you do when all the choices are yours?" asked Gary Tobin, a Brandeis professor of Jewish studies. "When you can't blame external forces? When there is no hostile environment to mold your ideology?
"The American Jewish community has achieved a remarkable degree of integration into society," Professor Tobin said. "It was purposeful, deliberate and achieved through enormous effort. We tried very hard to get where we are. Where does that leave Brandeis?
"It doesn't want to be thought of as reclusive, separate, disintegrated from American life. It has to find a balance. In the same way that a Jew has to decide what it means to be an assimilated Jew, Brandeis has to decide what it means to be an assimilated university."
Part of the chosen solution is through a conscious internationalism and emphasis on ethics that officials like Jehuda Reinharz, president of Brandeis, believe can be illuminated by the Jewish tradition.
So yesterday, right after the Brandeis festivities began with a picnic lunch, the first event was a symposium on "Human Rights: The Unfinished Agenda." Among the speakers was Shen Tong, a Brandeis graduate and an organizer of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protest in Beijing. The university has also just opened a $13 million international center on the study of ethics and social justice.
Last spring, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany was the commencement speaker, and the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet, was a campus guest.
Such internationalism has been accompanied by an increased Jewish emphasis. The neglected Jewish studies department has been rebuilt, kosher food areas have been expanded and there are a couple hundred modern Orthodox Jews among the university's roughly 3,000 students. There are even a few strictly Orthodox students, in somber dark dress, who had, until recently, never considered Brandeis because it was seen as insufficiently Jewish.
The diversity of Jewish life on campus might be expected to produce tensions, as it has in Israel. But one of Brandeis's goals is to find a way for different kinds of Jews to live together.
Organized Sabbath dinners on campus are an example. On Friday nights, several hundred young Jews celebrate together: Reform men with earrings sitting near black-coated Orthodox men and Conservative women in colorful yarmulkes.
 
A Role as an Advocate Of Jewish Pluralism
Such dinners, with their singing and high-minded discussions afterwards, suggest a role for the university in the debate over identity: as an advocate of Jewish pluralism.
"I think most of us agree that for Brandeis to flourish in the 1990's, it must give expression to its Jewish character," said Michael J. Sandel, a professor of government at Harvard who is a Brandeis graduate and board member. "There are many ways to do that but one is to serve as a forum for debate over competing visions for Jewish life. Brandeis should be a convener of different voices."
For non-Jews, the Jewish emphasis can be both intriguing and alienating. Sucheta Puranik, a junior from Wallingford, Conn., said it was fascinating to watch Jews, who are so used to being in the minority, feel in charge. But she said she joined the campus intercultural center to find others who feel a bit left out during Jewish holidays.
Brandeis has trouble attracting African-Americans despite strenuous efforts to do so, including two programs that bring inner-city youths to campus. Blacks make up less than three percent of the student population.
In its early years, Brandeis's goal was not Jewish pluralism but the purest assimilation. Again, Harvard and other elite universities founded by religious communities were the models. Until 1937, for example, all presidents of Brown University were Baptists, many of them ministers. Today Brown, like the others, is a center of secularism.
So, the theory went, it would be for Brandeis, which is Jewish-sponsored but non-sectarian, unlike Yeshiva University, which requires students to take a heavy load of courses in Jewish studies. The Brandeis student body began overwhelmingly Jewish but quickly became more diverse, with 40 percent non-Jewish students. The faculty has long had a mix of backgrounds.
Brandeis had become emblematic of major college trends. Not only had it served as a bohemian intellectual center in the 1950's but in the 1960's it became synonymous with the 1960's. For a time, Brandeis became the National Student Strike Information Center. In 1970 two students were on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's 10 Most Wanted list for taking part in an armed robbery that stemmed from their political beliefs. LSD-laced punch was served by half-naked students in the middle of campus.
In the 1970's, when many Jews turned their attention and money toward Israel, Brandeis found itself without the resources or leadership of more established universities. This was partly because, unlike Vanderbilt, Duke, Rice or Vassar, Brandeis was not named for its chief donor but for its main inspiration. Brandeis depended upon, as it still does, what it calls its foster alumni -- American Jews -- for support. But as American Jews became integrated, they patronized other institutions; support for Brandeis waned and the quality of its students declined. Some of the university's supporters began to worry that Brandeis's frank Jewishness was a liability.
In the late 1980's, when Evelyn Handler was president of Brandeis, a committee of students and trustees examined ways to reduce the university's Jewish character. Gustav Ranis, a professor of international economics at Yale and a member of Brandeis's first graduating class, led the committee, which actually bore the name "Dejudification." The idea was to attract more non-Jews, particularly Asians, and the committee decided a relaxation of Jewish dietary restrictions would help.
 
Defining Roots, Improving Vision
"We recommended that there be one place on campus where pork and shellfish could be consumed," Professor Ranis said. "Evelyn Handler ran with it and announced it. There was a huge negative response in the American Jewish community. Jews who didn't themselves keep kosher wanted Brandeis to keep kosher."
Its finances a mess, its reputation sullied, its mission muddied, Brandeis was the subject of major newspaper articles describing its identity crisis. The board urged Ms. Handler to resign.
Salvation appeared in the guise of a physician. Samuel O. Thier, then president of the Institute of Medicine under the National Academy of Sciences, served as Brandeis president for three crucial, stabilizing years. Having served on the faculties of Yale, Penn and Harvard, Dr. Thier said he saw the quality of Brandeis and its faculty.
"Here was this place with spectacular scientists, really first class, yet they were feeling miserable," Dr. Thier recalled. "The institution was young but it was part of a tradition thousands of years old. To me, it looked like a recovery just waiting to happen."
As Jonathan D. Sarna, a professor of American Jewish history at Brandeis, put it: "Brandeis was like a guy named Mendelssohn trying to pretend that he's not Jewish. Once that came to an end, things improved quickly."
Pork and shrimp were removed from the cafeteria. Dr. Reinharz, then a Zionist historian at Brandeis, was named provost. American Jews were told that Brandeis still thought of itself as Jewish and that its future depended on their support.
No one grasped the importance of that support as clearly as Dr. Reinharz, who took over the presidency in 1994. Dr. Reinharz, 54, born in Israel, is fiercely devoted to Brandeis, where he earned his Ph.D.
Traveling around the country, often with his wife, Shulamit, a Brandeis professor of sociology and women's studies, Dr. Reinharz has given a new face to the institution. He has also grasped the value of celebrity, attracting people like Ann Richards and Anita Hill as visiting lecturers and persuading Robert B. Reich, the former Secretary of Labor, to take a professorship.
"What I have done is really clearly define and articulate what we are all about," Dr. Reinharz said. "Tempering our Jewish identity did not work. I have defined our mission very clearly and without embarrassment as having four pillars: Jewish sponsorship, total non-sectarianism, a commitment to social justice and excellence."
It is on the pillar of excellence, that Brandeis sees its work most clearly in the future. Applications are brisk, and Brandeis has drawn some first-class students by offering them hefty scholarships regardless of their parents' incomes. But the university still suffers from being a second choice for many of the brightest on campus. It has been frustrated at not being able to crack the top 25 list in the university rankings put out by such publications as U.S. News and World Report. But a recent book by Hugh David Graham and Nancy Diamond, "The Rise of American Research Universities," (Johns Hopkins, 1997) ranked colleges based on faculty publications and citations. After controlling for institutional size, it ranked Brandeis ninth over all and first among a group of "rising" research universities.
 
Facing Problems With Clear Mission
Eleven faculty members belong to the National Academy of Sciences, and 27 belong to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, high numbers for a small institution.
Yet by not veering far from a Jewish identity, Brandeis faces a potential problem in attracting the very best from all walks of life.
Arthur Levine, president of Teachers College at Columbia University, said Brandeis, from which he graduated, must "find a way to translate the values of religion without making it religious."
"Once Brandeis loses its Jewishness, it becomes just another university and pushes away its donor base," Mr. Levine said. "Moreover, Brandeis faces the same challenges as all research universities. For the first time since the days Brandeis was founded, universities are not a growth industry."
This is the calculation that Dr. Reinharz has made: Money and mission rely on Brandeis's Jewish roots.
"I doubt that at any point we will just decide this is an excellent university and call it a day on the Jewish issue," Dr. Reinharz said. "I see a very strong Jewish link throughout Brandeis's future. There will never be a day when we at Brandeis will say, 'Now we know what we are about.' The process is the point and the process will always go on."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 2, 1998, Monday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Oct. 17 about Brandeis University referred incorrectly to a trustee committee in the late 1980's that examined strategic planning, including ways to attract more non-Jewish students. The committee had no student members and no formal name; "dejudification" was a pejorative term used by critics.

And Bear in Mind
(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)
 
THE AMERICAN CENTURY, by Harold Evans with Gail Buckland and Kevin Baker. (Knopf, $50.) An accessible political history, elegantly and copiously illustrated; it argues that American democratic ideals, however many times they have led to grief for ourselves and others, on balance have made for human rights, here and abroad.
 
DANCING NAKED IN THE MIND FIELD, by Kary Mullis. (Pantheon, $24.) The darkly joyous autobiography of a brilliant chemist (Nobel Prize, 1993) whose views on global warming, H.I.V., the ozone layer and many other issues are either unusual or bizarre (maybe time will tell).
 
EUCALYPTUS, by Murray Bail. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $23.) A magic novel from Australia, in which a homesteader's daughter must marry, fairy tale fashion, the first suitor who can correctly identify every eucalyptus species; a wandering storyteller breaks the rule.
 
EVENING, by Susan Minot. (Knopf, $23.) An elegant, assured novel that tells the story of a woman's life in two narratives: one as she remembers her life, one as she passes from it.
 
THE EVOLUTION OF JANE, by Cathleen Schine. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) A character named Jane and the principles of evolution are both shrewdly rendered in a novel that unconventionally uses large principles to illuminate a particular life.

THE GIANT, O'BRIEN, by Hilary Mantel. (Marian Wood/Holt, $22.) An early mad scientist meets a late, unviable, enormous Irish spinner of tales in a novel that grants the future to the scientist but the heart to the bard.
 
I MARRIED A COMMUNIST, by Philip Roth. (Houghton Mifflin, $26.) A tender, harsh, witty novel whose title refers to a bitter, hostile book written by the female half of a ruined marriage (sound familiar?), and whose principal action, recalled in the present, takes place in the dire focus of the age of McCarthyism.
 
LOVE UNDETECTABLE: Notes on Friendship, Sex, and Survival, by Andrew Sullivan. (Knopf, $23.) A meditation, basically religious, on the effects of AIDS in the culture and in individuals, by the former editor of The New Republic.
 
THE VENTRILOQUIST'S TALE, by Pauline Melville. (Bloomsbury USA/St. Martin's, $23.95.) A gleeful fiction that plays the spirit-filled world of South American Indians against the rationalist world of exploitative, "civilizing" Europeans in a novel that is in part an act of revenge on Evelyn Waugh for his 1934 novel, "A Handful of Dust."

THE FIX
 By Michael Massing.
 335 pp. New York:
 Simon & Schuster. $25. 
 Michael Massing has been writing about drug issues in the United States for a decade. He believes the central problem to be the hard-core users of heroin and cocaine, who are "disproportionately poor, unemployed and members of minority groups." Although hard-core users are only a fifth of total users, they consume three-fourths of the cocaine and heroin used in this country and are responsible for most of the pathological behavior that elicits public and governmental responses. If we could provide appropriate treatment to anyone in this population who wanted it, Massing maintains, the whole drug problem would diminish, as would the illness and crime associated with it. The result of Massing's investigation is "The Fix," a balanced and significant analysis of the American drug problem that carries specific, practical recommendations for reform.
He separates himself from the "legalization/harm-reduction camp" that asserts that drug-related diseases and social pathology are the fault of drug-control laws themselves. Having spent long periods observing drug treatment centers, roaming the streets of Harlem and hanging out with drug users, he has experienced a "real-life rebuttal to the rosy accounts of addiction offered by the revisionists." Regardless of the drug laws, addiction and drug use create terrible conditions: child abuse reports in New York rose from 36,000 in 1985 to 59,000 in 1989 when the crack epidemic hit the city. Massing's approach contrasts with recent books like Mike Gray's "Drug Crazy," which calls for a radical revision of our drug laws. Gray describes a golden age of drug use prior to the Harrison Narcotic Act of 1914, when "the country had looked upon addicts as unfortunate citizens with a medical problem." To right current wrongs, he recommends that we put the provision of drugs "back in the hands of doctors and pharmacists."
Massing also distances his position from apostles of draconian penalties and those who put their faith in interdiction. His middle way has one clear emphasis, and that is comprehensive treatment. He knows this would work because we had such a program once; it succeeded wonderfully, but we let it slip away. We were therefore unable to mount a powerful defense against cocaine and crack in the mid-1980's, and now we have 10 times as many hard-core users as we faced during the Nixon Administration.
Nixon's strategy aimed directly at reducing crime in anticipation of the 1972 election. Treatment was part of a broad program that included foreign policy to shut down the Turkish-French connection; the Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement to attack street crime; the Internal Revenue Service to go after illicit profits. That crime reduction held first place among Nixon's priorities -- not the care of addicts -- is illustrated by the Administration's surprising willingness to adopt methadone, a synthetic opiate, as its preferred treatment for heroin users. At the time, a high-ranking official in the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs told me that the bureau would hand out heroin if it thought that would cut crime. This attitude was surprising because the substitution of one addiction by another contradicted the previously adamant stand by Nixon's adherents against any drug use.
How did Nixon come to approve the financing of methadone treatment for tens of thousands of addicts? Massing draws on interviews with key actors and internal Government documents to provide an answer. The most persuasive element was the methadone program developed in Washington by Robert DuPont, later the Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Heroin use was skyrocketing; crime was rampant. In his 1968 campaign Nixon had declared that "D. C. should not stand for disorder and crime." Washington became the laboratory for national drug policies. In 1970 DuPont, with support from the White House, established the Narcotics Treatment Administration, which was soon flooded with applicants. Although nondrug treatment was also offered, methadone appeared to cut the crime rate quickly, and that impressed the President and his aides. By the 1972 election crime had fallen by 50 percent in the District of Columbia, an achievement that was widely broadcast.
Of course, the methadone program was only one of the actions taken to reduce crime in Washington. Even Egil Krogh, the Nixon aide most responsible for creating the political will for this ambitious national treatment program, did not know if the program was responsible for the drop in crime, but he knew that from a political perspective, "it was a slam-dunk great success."
Massing has no doubts about the success of the treatment program. His conviction comes from his encounter with Nixon's drug expert, Jerome Jaffe, a psychopharmacologist and psychiatrist plucked in 1970 from the University of Chicago, where he had established a treatment program that employed a range of options, including drug-free therapy. He was asked first to head a committee of experts from outside the Government to come up with a response to drug addiction. His report was practical rather than theoretical and named methadone as the best treatment for heroin addiction (the major addiction at that time) and the best way to reduce crime. Following the adoption of what was basically his proposal, Jaffe entered Government service.
His first big administrative assignment was to deal with addicted Army personnel coming back from Vietnam. This he did with ingenuity and dispatch, and then began work as the "drug czar," the first head of the Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Policy. Jaffe was neither a good administrator nor an adept politician -- he was a scientist. Many of his psychiatric and scientific colleagues distrusted him for working with Nixon. Some critics lambasted him in the most vitriolic terms for advocating methadone; they described the program as an enslavement of minorities. In Massing he has found a vindicator.
Massing advocates Jaffe's "code," a set of principles that summed up his approach to drug use: "Chronic drug users are at the heart of the nation's drug problem; a diverse array of services is required; Government must assure their availability and efficacy; law enforcement is an adjunct to rehabilitation and, always, reducing demand for drugs through education and treatment must take precedence over law enforcement efforts to reduce the supply of drugs. Massing says the Nixon Administration, following the Jaffe prescription, managed to bring a "serious heroin epidemic" under control "in a few short years."
Massing recommends setting up an organization like the Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention that would engage only in reducing demand for illicit drugs, to be headed by a "C. Everett Koop-type figure" and backed in the White House by a facsimile of Egil Krogh -- that is, a high-ranking White House official whose special province would be drug abuse. A comprehensive national treatment program for drug and alcohol abuse should be established. In Massing's view, the most unfortunate mistake in the recent history of drug programs was the Government's shift of emphasis from heroin to marijuana, in response to increased complaints by parents, during the latter half of the Carter Administration. Treatment for the hard core shriveled. During the Reagan Administration the amount spent for treatment in real dollars fell to less than a quarter of what had been provided in the Nixon Administration.
Massing's powerful arguments for more treatment programs, especially metha-
done, must be put into a larger historical context. The 1970's witnessed the climax of a long-simmering reaction against law enforcement as the chief tool against drug abuse. That era of toleration, however, peaked about 1980, and since then we have been on a slope leading toward intolerance of drug use. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's attack on methadone maintenance is a recent example of opposition to any drug use by former users. As valuable as methadone may be for some (and I believe it can be helpful), it is an uphill battle to justify it to those who have zero tolerance for drugs. Can a national policy that was feasible in 1970 be resurrected three decades later in a less friendly climate?
Finally, remarkable claims for treatment in the early 1970's must be tempered by the knowledge that most people in trouble with drugs were taking heroin, for which methadone is a stabilizing replacement. Today, cocaine users are the vast majority of the hard-core population, a problem for which methadone is useless. Massing's recommendations are too valuable to be oversold.

HEADLINE: The Agent;
The Most Hated Man in Baseball

BYLINE: By David Samuels; David Samuels, a contributing editor at Harper's, last wrote for the magazine about the private investigator Terry Lenzner.

 BODY:
The only rule of the rude and sprawling sports-entertainment culture that spans the morning drive-time radio hours to the late-night highlights on ESPN is that every fan has a right to his opinion. The second baseman can't hit left-handed pitching? Bench him! Ride the bum out of town! All that is required in exchange is that you back up your opinions with facts, the way the six stone-cold baseball fanatics seated at the conference table are doing this morning in a gray-carpeted office just off the freeway in Newport Beach, Calif.
As familiar as the scene may appear -- a bunch of guys tossing around batting averages and on-base percentages -- this is not your ordinary workplace conversation. For these men are marshaling statistics with a very single-minded intention: to prove that Bernie Williams, a shy and graceful athlete who patrols center field for the New York Yankees, is one of the top five players in the game. 
 "Every year Bernie's average has gone up, his on-base percentage has gone up, his slugging has gone up," summarizes Scott Boras, the man at the center of the table. A former minor-league player, Boras, 44, is today one of the country's most successful sports agents, a lawyer whose aggressive tactics have led critics to call him "the Darth Vader of baseball." Alongside him sit a Harvard economics graduate, two lawyers and a former computer engineer from NASA. After a minute of silent concentration, Boras arrives at a plausible frame for his story. "It's a 'Rise of Bernie Williams' thing," he says. "He's entering his prime. He's opened the door to stardom."
To his detractors, among them major-league owners, general managers and scouts, Boras is the most hated man in baseball, an agent notorious for his market-breaking salary demands and his Svengali-like hold over his clients, including 50 major-league and 35 minor- league players. Beginning in 1984, when he won a record $7.5 million five-year contract for his former minor-league teammate Bill Caudill, Boras has shown an unrivaled
ability to set new prices for talent. Most recently, he won a $65 million contract for the Atlanta ace, Greg Maddux, and an $8.5 million deal for J.D. Drew, a 21-year-old outfielder who had yet to hit a single minor-league pitch.
Seated at the table, Boras looks like the successful Orange County lawyer that he is, with a thick gold watch gleaming from his wrist and a touch of the old-time Western gunfighter around his unblinking eyes. When he is focused on something, the way he is focused on Bernie Williams's career stats right now, his eyes narrow with an unsettling ferocity that recalls photographs of the psychic Uri Geller attempting to bend spoons with his mind. What the numbers show is that, so far this year, Bernie Williams is first in the American League in hitting and on-base percentage. Yet they also show that when it comes to home runs and runs batted in, Williams's numbers, while impressive, hardly rank with those of crowd-pleasing sluggers like Sammy Sosa or Mark McGwire.
"But how many guys have scored a hundred runs and driven in a hundred three years in a row?" Boras asks, hunting for a more effective way to dramatize Williams's place among the top hitters in the game. According to the stat books piled up on the table, around a dozen players make the cut. But when this elite category is narrowed to hitters who also play center field, the list narrows down to a handful, including Bernie Williams, Mickey Mantle and Joe DiMaggio. "That's some tall cotton there!" Boras says. His eyes gleam.
For New York Yankees fans, of course, that gleam is bad news indeed. What it means is that Boras has hit on an argument that is likely to result in Bernie Williams becoming one of the highest-paid players in baseball history later this fall. And if the Yankees owner George Steinbrenner doesn't buy the argument that Bernie Williams is the equal of Mantle and DiMaggio? No matter. The Arizona Diamondbacks, the Los Angeles Dodgers or some other wealthy suitor surely will.
Grieving fans, strident denunciations of mercenary players, accusations by named and unnamed sources that Scott Boras is destroying baseball, all of that will have to wait until the last pitch of the season is thrown. Meanwhile, Boras heads off to his 9:15 spinning class with his wife, Jeanette. With early-morning meetings, 85 players to service and night games to attend, the morning exercise class is often the only time that the agent and his wife spend together during the week.
The Irvine Sports Club, where Boras works out, features floors of state-of-the-art fitness equipment and an Olympic-size swimming pool centered on a lofty sun-filled atrium. It is a gleaming temple to the culture of physical fitness and body worship that has transformed professional sports into a mass entertainment whose selling power dwarfs even that of Hollywood. And just as the Hollywood studios of the 1940's and 50's disintegrated in the face of the emerging star system, professional sports teams now face a similar fate, looking forward to a future in which they will live only in the shadows of their highly paid stars.
And what better place to occupy in the star-driven universe of sports entertainment than where Scott Boras finds himself right now? Like Michael Ovitz in Hollywood during the 80's, he controls access to talent. He is the medium through which stars are made. Sitting by his locker at the gym, he talks about his love for the game and the fact that stars are made through their performances on the field. Yet he admits that the money is the brightest light that shines on achievement in a market society. "Who ever heard of J.D. Drew before we got him the contract?" he asks, pulling on a sleeveless tank top and a pair of tight-fitting Lycra shorts. "No one. That kind of attention follows the money." Boras's own share of the profits is not insignificant, either. While his 5 percent commission on player salaries is hardly exorbitant (other agents receive commissions of up to 20 percent), it also amounts to more than $5 million a year. Impact Sports Marketing, the Atlanta-based company that handles endorsements for Boras clients and of which Boras is part owner, earns 20 percent commissions on the deals his players sign.
Yet it is also true that the big payoff is almost always the hard-won ratification of a 5- to 10-year commitment by the agent to a player whose chances of striking it rich pale next to the risks inherent in an athletic career. Take Bernie Williams, for instance. Thirteen years ago, when he first met Scott Boras at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in Puerto Rico, the Yankees star was a scholarly looking 16-year-old with a sprinter's build and a fondness for playing classical guitar. Coming up through the Yankees minor-league system, where he spent his first five years, the knock on the center fielder was that he didn't hustle. He lacked heart. And with his fondness for the guitar and his glasses, you could see Bernie Williams more easily as a young graduate student in chemistry than as the heir to Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle.
"He wasn't a raw athlete," Boras remembers. "He was an intellect. And his intellect had to be fed before he could adopt the traits the scouts desired. And that was part of our process, where I would sit down with Bernie and say: 'When you make a bad play, you drop your head. Don't just look with a blank stare. Show disappointment. Show your frustration."' Behind such advice is the knowledge that making it out of the minors takes more than talent alone, and even players like Bernie Williams have to act the part. Having Scott Boras on your side doesn't hurt, either.
Through his team of minor-league scouts, Boras tracked Williams's progress through the Yankees organization, had regular face-to-face meetings with the young prospect and even flew to Puerto Rico to visit the player and his parents. All in preparation for the far-off day -- now set to arrive sometime this November -- when the fawnlike center fielder from Puerto Rico would be transformed into a market viper, striking fear into salary-conscious owners, perhaps breaking the hearts of his fans in New York, but almost certainly breaking the bank.
"Look, my opinion has always been that I would rather work for the star than work for the movie house," Boras explains on his way through the parking lot. "The star is always going to be pursued."
Yet if Boras has exploited the star system on behalf of his clients, he is hardly its creator. "The owners have figured out what their fans want," he says. "These fans want exclusivity. They want restaurants. They want private skyboxes with the comforts of your living room. They want seats with computers attached to them. And they are willing to pay a premium, four or five times the going rate." The expression on his face, somewhere between a truth-telling smile and an indulgent sneer, does not make it clear whether he approves or not. What is clear, however, is that waves of money are rolling in to major-league ballparks -- and Scott Boras sees it as his responsibility to get as much of that money for his clients as he can.
Walking down the steps of a near-empty Dodger Stadium in the late afternoon as the players work alone or in pairs before tonight's game, Boras is having a great time. He loves sitting in the stands a few rows in back of the dugout and hearing the smack of balls hitting leather over the bright green grass of the field. Yet to his critics, Boras's professions of love for the game are only a cover for the agent's greed. "He sees all the devious ways you can rip people off," says one baseball executive. Another one, Ron Schueler, general manager of the Chicago White Sox, has suggested that Boras's aggressive style is the result of his time in the minors. "Maybe this is something personal," Schueler told The Chicago Tribune, "but it's not good for baseball. Something must have happened." To Boras, such insinuations of bitterness and greed have a very obvious purpose. "These are merely personal affronts designed to do what?" he asks. "To keep me from the talented player."
Yet if Scott Boras is not in it for the money alone (his office is modest; he stays in cheap hotels on the road; he has never visited Europe; and he looks forward with real enthusiasm to late-night dinners at Taco Bell), it is also clear that he is a driven man who sees major-league baseball teams as the enemy -- at least at salary time. And that at least some part of what drives him results from the experiences of the smooth-faced young man with curly blond hair in a St. Louis Cardinals uniform gazing out from the photograph on Boras's office wall. The last day Boras played professional baseball, in 1978, he had just started law school after three knee operations. "The grass was green, I'm shaking and my knees were killing me," he remembers. "I went home and cried for two days. And then I went back to class on Monday. And they paid me anyway, which meant a lot."
Boras also remembers the first time he ever saw his teammates cut. "It was the shock of my life," he says, "because I had never seen the game of baseball make anyone unhappy. But when I walked into that locker room and saw 40 players get released and the emotion and how they did it -- you walk in and there's a slip of paper and your uniform is gone." After 20 years, his eyes still go wide at the memory. He looks like a boy on the farm who has just been told the truth about what happens to horses when they get old.
"And then you go out into the parking lot and guys are shaking hands and crying," Boras continues, after a moment of reflection. "I remember this one kid sitting there, just crying his eyes out, bent over, and he had been a No. 1 draft pick. He'd been doing this for four years. You saw dreams end. You saw players who didn't know what to do or where to go."
Which is one reason why Scott Boras fights so hard for his players and why he approaches major-league contract negotiations in the same hard-nosed spirit with which he played the game. He will make good on the promise to treat players like family. He will never let his clients down. As he sits in the stands with his briefcase by his side, one arm slung over the back of an adjoining chair, various Dodgers notice his presence and wander over to talk. One client, Charles Johnson, a catcher who set a record last year with the Florida Marlins by playing a full season without a single error in the field, is the first to come over, taking the agent aside to discuss both his personal life and his swing at the plate. The Marlins' World Series victory last year was a triumph for the agent as well. As Boras remembers: Charles came and got me, and he took me into the locker room. And there was Robbie Nen, Alex Fernandez and Kevin Brown. And I've known every one of these guys since they were starting out. I've known Alex since he was 16. I've known Charles since he was 16. And to sit there with four guys in a locker room, and Alex dumping Champagne all over my suit -- that's a very special time."
Boras knows that he is often the only stable element in his clients' careers. He is a lawyer, advocate, big brother, a source of endorsement deals, family counselor, psychologist and coach. After the Marlins won the Series, the owner, H. Wayne Huizenga, insisted that he could not afford his large payroll and scattered Johnson, Nen and Brown to other clubs, along with the rest of his high-priced talent. This year's incarnation of the Marlins lost more than 100 games. Whether the break-up of the team was caused by greedy players and their agent, as some fans believe, or by a mercenary owner depends on who is telling the story. That Scott Boras's clients will make top dollar no matter whom they play for is not in dispute.
But today Boras is worried about another client, a sweet-faced rookie from the Dominican Republic named Adrian Beltre. Projected to be a star player, Beltre has suffered through a shaky first season in which he has played part time while hitting around .200.
Perched on top of the Dodger dugout, Beltre at first says very little. Boras tries to draw the player out, asking awkwardly after the rookie's family back home and his favorite Dominican dishes. Boras decides to test the player by expressing his feelings about the Dominican Winter League. For Dominican-born players, Winter League ball is a chance to go home and perform before family and friends. For managers and executives of American teams, it also presents the risks of injury, bad influences and departures from the teams' conditioning programs. "I don't think you should play winter ball -- no winter ball, O.K.?" the agent says. "You should work on your conditioning here in the States."
Adrian Beltre considers the challenge with care before he responds. "I'll get back to you on that," he says. Then he smiles, a radiant, confident smile, to show that there are no hard feelings but that he will do as he pleases whether his know-it-all agent approves or not.
An hour later, Boras could not be happier. "When you try to take control over something and the player just nods, that means there is a self-esteem issue there. So when Beltre said, 'I'll get back to you on that"' -- he flashes a winning poker-player's grin -- "it told me that this player really, truly wants to be in control of what he does. And that's why this guy is going to be big."
So let the fans curse and the talk-radio hosts foam at the mouth, and let the baseball executives solemnly declare that Scott Boras is destroying the game. Driving out into the California desert beyond the urban sprawl of Los Angeles toward the setting sun, the agent is clearly in his element, fielding calls on his cell phone and looking forward to watching the High Desert Mavericks, the Arizona Diamondbacks single-A affiliate.
The High Desert Mavericks play in a gently sloping concrete bowl with good sight lines and fold-down seats for approximately 4,000 people. Tonight the stadium is probably half full. The crowd has a pleasant blue-collar feel, a mix of senior citizens, young couples and families with children who move out to the desert for the clean air, safer streets and affordable starter homes. There are no luxury boxes here. The fans come to cheer on players whose names are unknown outside of this community and their hometowns. Few on this field will ever make it to the majors.
One likely exception is the Mavericks' starting pitcher, Brad Penny, a raw 19-year- old pitcher from Broken Arrow, Okla., who throws two pitches in excess of 90 miles per hour. Penny is a market viper in the rough. As the game progresses, Boras charts each pitch that Penny throws, admiring his control and his consistent ability to pitch ahead of opposing hitters. By the end of the fifth inning, however, he has spotted a flaw.
"He throws a little bit across his body, which is a concern because of the stress that places on his arm," Boras says. Still, it is clear that he is impressed.
There is something refreshing about sitting beneath the stars in the California desert and watching players who, because the chances of ever making the majors are so remote, must play for something approximating a love for the game. The Mavericks fans are having a good time, too. As the seventh-inning stretch begins, nearly every fan in the stadium rises to his feet to join in the traditional chorus of "Take Me Out to the Ball Game." Scott Boras doesn't sing. He sits in his seat and scribbles notes on his yellow pad, the same pad he used to plot Bernie Williams's free-agent strategy earlier that morning.
For Boras's moment of transcendence, when it comes, will not take place inside a baseball stadium. It will take place on the phone or perhaps in the home of a player he has known for years. Although the hour is late and the road is dark as we drive back through the desert, the agent can imagine what that moment will feel like.
"Last year, when we did Maddux's contract," the agent recalls, "it was the biggest contract in baseball. That was an achievement. But the clear, resounding, overwhelming emotion for me was seeing the comfort in him that was not there before. And to me, it was to be able to deliver to my client, my friend, that kind of feeling, where three days later he could call me on the phone, sitting up in bed with his wife, and go, 'Man, was that ever a lot of fun or what?"'
If Boras's face is invisible now in the darkness, the emotion in his voice is easy to hear. "And I'm going, 'What are you talking about?' And he goes, 'Man, that was just like playing a game."'

HEADLINE: A Town That Big Dreams Built

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER HALL; CHRISTOPHER HALL has traveled extensively in the Pacific Northwest.

 BODY:
IN 1887 in the booming settlement of Port Townsend, Washington Territory, a prosperous Maine-born contractor and occasional rum-runner named George Starrett married Ann Van Boklen, a hometown girl. At the time of the wedding, local Indian uprisings were a none-too-distant memory and Washington statehood was another two years away, but Port Townsend -- on the northeast corner of the Olympic Peninsula -- already seemed destined for prominence.
Designated by the Federal Government as the customs port for all of Puget Sound, largely because it stood at the entrance to Washington's inland sea, the town was crowded with tall ships, sailors and fortune seekers from around the world. A link to a transcontinental railroad appeared imminent, facilities for a city of 21,000 were under construction, and the actual population was climbing toward 7,500, up from 917 seven years earlier. Brick and stone commercial buildings lent an air of respectability to the town, although rampant gambling, drink ing and prostitution along the waterfront earned Port Townsend its reputation as the wickedest city north of San Fran cisco.
In 1889 George Starrett gave his wife a gift entirely in keeping with the times -- a new, large and lavishly appointed house on a windswept bluff 200 feet above the rough and tumble waterfront. The most remarkable feature of the wooden mansion was a four-story, octagonal tower on whose ceiling an artist had painted Mrs. Starrett as each of the Four Seasons. On the first day of each new season, when the sun shone through a pane of red glass in a dormer window, for a quarter of an hour Mrs. Starrett's corresponding seasonal likeness would be bathed in rose-tinted light.
More than 100 years later, the Starrett Mansion and its tower still stand watch over the shipping lanes of Puget Sound, with snowcapped Mount Rainier and the volcanic Cascades to the southeast, across the water, and the peaks of the sawtooth Olympics to the southwest. The restored house -- now an inn known as the Ann Starrett Mansion -- is one of the many preserved Victorian-era buildings that form an entire district listed on the National Register of Historic Places. For decades a regional destination -- Seattle is two hours away by car and ferry -- Port Townsend and its historic district increasingly attract visitors from other states and countries who are touring nearby Olympic National Park.
When I first saw Port Townsend around 1970, as a teen-ager on a family vacation, the town was just beginning to emerge from a long economic slump that followed the sudden end of its boom years. Preservation-minded owners had started to buy and restore the historic buildings, and a couple of inns had opened in old homes. But I recall being struck -- even at a green age -- by how ghostly and still the town appeared for a bright August afternoon. With all the half-vacant commercial blocks and faded turn-of-the-century houses, it seemed a figment of my young, overactive imagination.
Nearly three decades later, I returned last October for an overnight stay and found the renaissance in full swing. On the outskirts of town, I drove past a busy new supermarket. Near the refurbished port, I heard a muffled chorus of rat-a-tats, screeches and bangs -- a machine-made song of prosperity and industry. I saw new paint throughout the historic district, which covers both the downtown waterfront and the uptown residential area on the bluff. The district has been recognized now for 22 years, the same amount of time that George and Ann Starrett lived in their house, raising their only child while witnessing the demise of Port Townsend's ambitious dreams.
Within a few years of the Starretts' wedding, the railroad plan fizzled and the great land speculation that underlay most of the town's wealth came to an abrupt halt. By 1893, in the wake of a national depression, the population had dwindled to less than 2,000 and a large boneyard fleet floated in the harbor. Office buildings were left unfinished, and one of them later sheltered so many birds it was dubbed the world's largest birdhouse in Ripley's "Believe It or Not."
Except, perhaps, during May to September, the height of the tourist season, there is still a timeless, world-apart feel to much of Port Townsend. The community of 8,500 is geographically isolated, perched on a finger of land jutting into Admiralty Inlet -- the entrance to the Sound -- and surrounded on three sides by the waters of the inlet, a harbor and the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Port Townsend is connected to cities along the eastern shore of Puget Sound by a few ferries and a single rural highway that peters out on the far side of downtown. Behind the town is the rugged, rainy and sparsely populated Olympic Penin sula.
ON my most recent midweek visit, I spent an afternoon and the following morning exploring the historic district on foot. On both days, the sea air was bracing, and the autumn weather typically cool and dry. Because it lies in the rain shadow of the Olympic Mountains, Port Townsend receives only 16 inches of rain per year, while in the famous rain forests of the Olympic Pensinsula the average is 140.
During an afternoon walk along tree-lined Water Street, a six-block stretch of which constitutes most of downtown, I joined dozens of people shopping, eating and strolling in the weak sun. On both sides of the street are two- and three-story buildings with elaborate brick and masonry facades pierced by high, arched windows. The upper stories contain offices while the ground floors house shops and restaurants, only a few of which seem geared exclusively to the tourist trade. You can still get keys made on Water Street or buy a length of marine rope, and there are several independent bookstores -- including one, Melville & Company, whose hand-lettered, front-window manifesto promises a "stubborn refusal to stock stupid books just because they're cheap."
As many as 21 saloons dispensed liquor along Water Street during Port Townsend's boom years. While these days there aren't quite that many places to buy coffee, it still seemed that every third pedestrian I passed was sipping an espresso or latte from a paper cup. It's a sight you soon get used to in the java-obsessed Pacific Northwest.
From the end of Union Wharf, a new downtown pedestrian pier, I had a wide view over the water. Just in front of me, pursued by a flock of crying gulls, the Whidbey Island ferry churned toward shore, while in the distance a colossal container vessel sounded a long, low blast of its horn as it lumbered past a gray warship. To my right, a few miles down the waterfront, steam billowed from the slender smokestack of a 1927 pulp and paper mill, the town's largest employer.
The next morning, I wandered for several hours among the historic homes on the bluff -- a quiet world of turrets and gables, old gardens and sea birds wheeling overhead. Although most of the houses are privately owned, I got a good feel for the neighborhood by walking its narrow streets and occasionally stopping to read about a particular house in a book I'd found at the county historical museum.
The Starrett Mansion is perhaps the most ornate residence on the bluff. In addition to the ceiling frescoes, it boasts intricate interior carpentry using costly hardwoods shipped around the Horn. On the downstairs newel post, a cast-bronze goddess holds aloft an electric lamp, which in the late 1800's was a striking touch of modernity in the still-raw territory.
There are, however, other impressive homes. One is the F. W. Hastings House -- now the Old Consulate Inn -- an 1889 Queen Anne that has kept its original barn-red color. From 1908 to 1911, the German consul lived in the stately house while represent ing his government's commercial interests and occasionally providing refuge for German nationals in danger of being shanghaied.
One of the blufftop homes open for tours is the Rothschild House, the 1868 residence of an early Port Townsend merchant that is now maintained by the state and fitted with its original furnishings. The simple white house with yellow trim and brown shutters was closed when I stopped by, but through a window I glimpsed the 1891 wallpaper -- a repeating pattern of ornate tan and cream curlicues. At the nearby First Presbyterian Church (1889), I did have a look inside at the expansive, semicircular sanctuary, with its vaulted ceiling and 692-pipe organ, considered the oldest in the state.
Port Townsend's two most prominent government buildings, the Jefferson County Courthouse and the Customs House, are also on the bluff. The red brick courthouse (1892) is dominated by a 100-foot clock tower that once was an important mariners' landmark. The building and its parklike grounds occupy an entire block. On either side of the south entrance stand 90-year-old monkey puzzle trees, an arboreal oddity popular in temperate turn-of-the-century gardens.
Before leaving town, I spent some time studying the three-story, neo-Romanesque Federal Customs House, which commands a sweeping view of maritime traffic from its edge-of-the-bluff location. The sandstone building is solid and serious, and when erected in 1893, it must have been a potent emblem of national identity in a then-remote corner of the country. As Port Townsend slipped from prominence, however, the Customs House suffered a similar loss of stature. In 1913, nearly all its federal tenants, except for the post office, moved to Seattle.
I walked into the post office intending to have a quick look at the redwood paneling and ornamental ironwork mentioned in the guidebook, but on my way out I was stopped by the sight of townspeople standing at a counter to buy stamps or mail a parcel. Nothing noteworthy about that. But I also saw that each customer stood in two shallow depressions -- one per shoe -- worn into the white marble floor by generations before them.

Getting There
Port Townsend is on state Route 20, 13 miles from U.S. 101.
There is direct passenger and car ferry service to Port Townsend from Whidbey Island. The crossing takes about 30 minutes, and the high season fare (from early May to early October) is $8 for a car and driver ($6.25 at other times); pedestrians and automobile passengers pay $1.80 year round. From the Seattle area, several ferry routes cross Puget Sound and hook up with roads leading to Port Townsend. For ferry information, call (206) 464-6400 or, from within Washington State, two toll-free numbers: (800) 843-3779 for automated information, or (888) 808-7977 for an operator.
There is a guide to Port Townsend on the Internet at www.olympus.net/biz/ptguide.
 
Places to Stay
I spent the night at the beautifully restored, 11-room Ann Starrett Mansion, 744 Clay Street, (800) 321-0644 or (360) 385-3205, fax (360) 385-2976. On the Internet, it is www.olympus.net/starrett. My room, formerly Mrs. Starrett's private parlor, was furnished with nice antiques, including a polished walnut deep-well dresser with marble top and an Eastlake canopied bed in mahogany. The room also had a pocket-sized bath with stall shower and a private balcony overlooking Admiralty Inlet. Double rooms, all with private bath, are $89 to $225, including a substantial cooked breakfast in the elegant dining room. For those who simply want to tour the house, it is open every day from noon to 3 P.M. Admission is $2.
The F. W. Hastings House Old Consulate Inn, 313 Walker Street, (800) 300-6753 or (360) 385-6753, fax (360) 385-2097, www.oldconsulateinn.com, has eight guest rooms with private baths. Rates, from $96 to $195 for two, include a seven-course breakfast as well as cordials and homemade desserts in the evening.
 
Places to Eat
At the Silverwater Cafe, 237 Taylor Street, (360) 385-6448, I had a great lunch of mild onion soup and half a tangy salmon salad sandwich, with a glass of crisp Washington fume blanc and a slice of blackberry pie topped with vanilla-bean ice cream. The bill came to about $15, excluding tip. The plant-filled, two-level restaurant is in a renovated 1889 Elks Building on a side street downtown. Open year round for lunch and dinner.
At Lonny's Restaurant, in the port area at 2330 Washington Street, (360) 385-0700, the subdued lighting and pared-down decor give the 66-seat dining room a big-city feel. Seasonal Northwest ingredients are used in dishes including oyster stew, a rich, velvety chowder made with local Dabob Bay oysters simmered in cream with pancetta, fennel, leeks and parsley. A dinner of the stew, house salad and glass of wine was about $24.
The Coho Cafe, 1044 Lawrence Street, (360) 379-1030, is a cozy storefront spot for breakfast and lunch with a vegetarian emphasis. A filling lunch of curried acorn squash soup, sourdough bread, coffee and apple pie was $7.50. Dinner is served in summer and on special occasions at other times of year. Closed for the month of January.
 
Sightseeing
The Port Townsend Visitor Information Center, 2437 East Sims Way, (888) 365-6978 or (360) 385-2722, distributes a free flier about a self-guided driving tour as well as a free visitors' guide. The center also can help travelers find accommodations.
The Jefferson County Historical Museum, 210 Madison Street, (360) 385-1003, occupies the former police court, jail and fire hall of Port Townsend's 1892 City Hall. The exhibits introduce players in the town's history, from American Indians, pioneer women and sea captains to a once-flourishing Chinese community. Open Monday through Saturday 11 A.M. to 4 P.M., Sunday 1 to 4 P.M.; closed weekdays in January. Admission, $2.

HEADLINE: Q&A/Sarwar A. Kashmeri;
Helping Businesses Prepare for the Euro

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
AS many focus on the coming of the millennium and the expected havoc it could play with computers, Sarwar A. Kashmeri is reminding people that a date perhaps even more significant is coming up sooner: Jan. 1, 1999. That is when 11 European countries will replace their currencies with one joint currency, the euro. And the effect will be a shot heard around the world, said Mr. Kashmeri, a resident of Mount Kisco and president of Niche Systems, a Manhattan-based consulting company, which has been offering seminars to help businesses prepare for the euro. He also has a Web site (www.nsinc.com).
The euro will be used by France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, Finland and Ireland, 11 of the 15 members of the European Union. Mr. Kashmeri expects that other countries, particularly England, will eventually adopt the euro. Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with Mr. Kashmeri: 
 Q. Why should Americans who are not doing business with companies in Europe care about this?
A. I think there are two reasons. One is a business reason, and the other is a more basic tourist-travel reason. The biggest reason to me is that enormous business opportunities are opening up for American firms in Europe, and a lot of it is for medium-size and small firms. If they are prepared for it, they can take advantage for it. Two, what's taking place in Europe is the biggest single-currency trading zone in the world. So when the euro comes into being on Jan. 1, 1999 it will start assuming the same predominance as the dollar. What does that mean for interest rates? What does that mean for money supply? What does it mean for invoicing in dollars or euros?
Q. Will business opportunities be created because of the euro or coincidental to the euro?
A. Because of the euro -- and I'll give you some very simple reasons. Right now in Europe if you take all the companies that work in Europe and you take all the money that they spend in managing currency risk, it's roughly $57 billion every year. That $57 billion will now get freed up. Also Europe is very much like the United States used to be before we had a central bank and one currency. If you're a small business and you want to issue stock, let's say, in Belgium, you have very few places you can sell that stock because people outside Belgium really don't want to buy stock in Belgian currency because of the currency risk. But all of that is about to change dramatically. So people will buy stock all over, and there will be a growth in the bond market -- the capital market. They will become almost the size of the United States -- an enormous amount of new capital will be generated. That comes together with the fact that American companies are leaders in so many high-technology disciplines, which are going to be needed in Europe. So both of these are a potent mix, I believe, for opportunity for American companies.
Q. How should this affect travelers?
A. A number of different ways. Interestingly, if you took $1,000 and traveled now through those 11 countries that are adopting this single currency and you didn't do anything but exchange currencies at the airport and kept going, you'd wind up with only $850 because of the exchange rates and commissions. So you will not lose that $150. Prices will also be affected. Prices in Europe can vary as much as 30, 50, sometimes 100 percent for the same product. And it's not readily obvious because they're in all these different currencies.
Now for the first time people will be able to compare prices in the same currency. Sometimes there is no rhyme or reason for different prices except that people in one country just pay more for certain goods. A scarf by a certain manufacturer in France may have a cultural and prestige value that it may not have in, let's say, Portugal. So you can actually compare prices. If your itinerary takes you to two or three European cities, you may not want to buy the scarf in one country but you might want to in the other.
Consumer groups are forming in different Europeans cities, and they're saying, Come across the border, the price on this or that is so different. And remember, some of these are very small countries so it is not so hard to go across the border to shop.
Q. Recount the problem that the McDonald's Corporation faces.
A. McDonald's is trying to figure out exactly -- as are a number of companies, by the way -- how they're going to price their product. Big Mac prices can vary tremendously from one country to another. As you know, the Big Mac is the same size, determined by McDonald's regulations. So they're trying to figure out if they convert the price to euros, people might see a 60 percent difference, or more, from one country to another, in the price of a Big Mac. So they're trying to figure out how to counteract this. Should they change the price in one country versus another? Should they change the size?
Another implication for travelers is with credit cards. Right now, if you go from one country to another and you spend money, all you see on your credit card is an exchange rate. Buried in the exchange rate are two things: the money that is made on the changing of the currency and the credit card charge. Beginning next year, the currency rates will all be fixed, so cards will only be charging transaction fees. So you'll be able to compare the fees on cards, and if there is an exchange rate you could question it.
We should keep in mind that American Express is going to become the first company in the world to issue euro traveler's checks on Jan. 1, 1999. The euro is a wholesale currency. This means it will be used for stocks and bonds and by companies dealing with one another and governments raising debts. But notes and coins don't come into existence until Jan. 1, 2002. So a lot of people have been saying that it really doesn't matter for us folks who travel because we won't have euro notes and coins. That's now no longer true. There are banks that have announced they will issue euro credit cards. There are banks that have announced you can open accounts there. But most important for us, as Americans, American Express has said they will have euro travelers checks. So because prices are being increasingly listed in euros, our travelers will be able to say, I'll pay in euros.
Q. What affect, if any, will the euro have on an individual American's financial investments?
A. I'll give you a personal example: my wife and I had invested in this mutual fund, which dealt with European government bonds. It was a pretty good mutual fund. It made money by buying and selling different currencies and bonds, depending on their prices and interest rates. About a year ago, we got a letter that that fund was being shut down, because one of the things the euro does is make all the interest rates converge.
Q. Are there predictions about what the euro might do to the United States' balance of trade with those countries?
A. There are various scenarios there. At our last conference in September, Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, gave the keynote address. He said the euro will be good for Europe. The scenario that is being painted is as follows: because the gross domestic product of those countries that are adopting the euro will very quickly become almost the same as ours, the euro will be a very strong currency. The dollar and the euro will be the two dominant currencies in the world. So some banks, like J. P. Morgan, are actually predicting a shift in reserves -- out of dollars and into euros -- equal to our deficit. What does that mean for us if that is all that happens? Would we have to buy oil in euros? Right now we are in the fortunate position of running a trade deficit and borrowing money from everyone in the world because everyone wants dollars.
Q. Will the European Union and its joint currency hold together?
A. I think it's going to hold together. I don't think it's going to be smooth sailing. This is a huge process, but I think the European governments will see it through. A lot of our companies, especially middle-size companies, are fixated on the year 2000. But they should keep in mind that the year 2000 is an event; it will happen and go. The euro is a whole process that will bring significant opportunities, and it's a very strategic issue compared to a very technical issue that the year 2000 is. The year 2000 is a programming issue. It's an expensive one, but it's just a programming issue. Whereas the euro is an entire change in a continent.

HEADLINE: DANCE;
Dancing Away the Havana Blues

BYLINE: By SUKI JOHN; Suki John's ballet "Sh'ma" will have its American debut at the 92nd Street Y on Nov. 1.

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
A tropical rain cleanses the crumbling structures of old Havana as a motley group of dancers repairs to an underground sanctuary. Carrying donated costumes and worn audiotapes, they filter into an empty cabaret and begin to structure the afternoon lineup. A powerhouse modern dancer will present a new solo, a group of grade-school children will show a reconfigured mambo, a virtuosic teen-ager will accept a choreography prize and an ecstatic deejay wields a bootleg copy of last year's London techno hit. Two North American dancers will perform contemporary solos, making for truly exotic entertainment. Welcome to an Afternoon of Dance at the Cafe Cantante, where for a few hours the daily struggle is forgotten with the distinctly Cuban antidote to black-market blues: dance.
The Cafe Cantante is housed in Havana's Teatro Nacional, a post-revolutionary structure nestled in the Plaza de la Revolucion, guarded by a three-story-tall wire relief of Che Guevara in his beret. The theater complex is a shrine to Cuban culture, built to foster art by and for the people. A kind of miniature Lincoln Center, it contains once-beautiful studios and workshops, two large proscenium stages and the Cafe Cantante. 
 Theater and dance are still accessible to ordinary people, but the nightly cabaret cover charge at the Cafe Cantante is $10 American, prohibitively expensive for workers paid in Cuban pesos. Featuring some of the hottest bands in the country, the cafe harks back to the days of big daddies and fat cigars. Nocturnal tourists pay big money to be thronged by women whose intelligence and charm are matched only by their desperation. But once every two weeks, on Saturday afternoon, the cafe is reclaimed by the masses. The entry fee is 2 pesos (about 10 cents), and the crowd is decidedly local.
Afternoons of Dance, as these Saturdays are called, was started three years ago by Narciso Medina, one of Cuba's most highly regarded contemporary choreographers. Mr. Medina, 35, opened the first self-supporting dance school since the revolution, building a studio out of what used to be his family's modest apartment in Havana's Vedado district. His company is known for involving the neighbors: half the barrio works on the production crew in one capacity or another. His company performs frequently on the street, where they focus on the dances of Santeria ritual, based in the Yoruba tradition of West Africa.
Mr. Medina began the afternoons as a way to prepare emerging dancers for the stage and to further involve local residents in the making of art. The series combines polished performances, works in progress, improvisation, children's recitals and social dancing. "The cafe audience is better than in the theaters; they're more opinionated and enthusiastic," Mr. Medina says. "The conditions aren't perfect, but creativity abounds."
Rudimentary spotlights and tacky nightclub decor surround a small carpeted stage. The cheap tiles of the low ceiling are sometimes dislodged by dancers jumping high or being lifted. In front of the stage, a concrete floor provides space between tables for improvisers, brave souls who dance together without plan or structure. Drinks are sold in dollars, but black-market rum is the libation of preference.
The afternoons are dance jams in which everyone participates, effectively blurring the boundary between audience and performer. In Cuba, where dance is central to culture and religion, aficionados are unafraid to share the floor with professionals. The whole intergenerational crowd jumps up to boogie between the acts, the most extroverted leaping to the stage while the merely enthusiastic flood the floor. By late afternoon the underground cave feels more like a huge party than a performance, with heat and rum burning off any remnants of stage fright that might hold back the timid few.
One recent Saturday, the program began with a group of children from Mr. Medina's company school. Dressed in red and black, they depict Eleggua, one of the Orishas, or deities, of Santeria tradition. The dance is a study in simple technique, rhythm and floor patterns, designed to integrate performance skills into a lesson in Cuban folklore. The smallest dancer loses his way and, unfazed, creates his own variation of the dance.
Throughout the day children of both sexes perform with natural ease. In Cuba there is little stigma attached to boys dancing, and many of the country's most celebrated dancers are men. But the division of labor is apparent from an early age: boys dance with strength and weight while girls wiggle and shake provocatively.
Tomas Guidante, 28, a masterly soloist in Mr. Medina's troupe, performs a solemn, sculptural work in progress. Interrupting his ovation, he initiates a group improvisation set to imported New Age sounds. (Though their music is captivating, Cubans are fascinated by foreign recordings, perhaps because a decadeslong drought has been replaced by a glut.) Serendipity guides two women in black to the lip of the stage, where their eloquent gestures mingle in a celebration of the spontaneous. Suddenly the music changes to an explosive salsa. Three couples converge in a wheel, spinning through the latest version of "salsa rueda." They change partners, dos-a-dos and bump pelvises, grinning. Men duck their heads under women's elbows, unwinding limbs just in time to change partners again.
Los Morenos del Son, an ebullient band brandishing myriad percussion and brass instruments, launches into an infectious, updated folk song. The crowd responds energetically, old and young coordinating their moves. One hotshot after another embellishes a roosterlike strut, spinning, grabbing the air, twisting to the floor on one leg and rising up again. The wily lead singer creates a rap about the vicissitudes of life in Cuba. Several dancers hop on the stage and begin a Supremes-style chorus. They shimmy together and sing out: "O la Habana! O la Habana!"
When it's all over, the spent crowd spills out into the wet Plaza de la Revolucion. The Cafe Cantante turns back into a pricey nightclub. Dancers begin the long trek home, hitchhiking, walking or riding bicycles because buses overflow with passengers and taxis accept only dollars. They keep their eyes out for the rare snack they can afford, in pesos. O, la Habana, so rich and so poor.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
A Detour in the Theater That No One Predicted

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH; Frank Rich, an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times and its former chief theater critic, is the author of "Hot Seat: Theater Criticism for The New York Times, 1980-1993," being published this week by Random House.

 BODY:
IF you love the theater, or are part of it, or even writing about it, then everything's a drama.
When I joined The New York Times as a drama critic in 1980, I had no idea that there would be so many offstage events that would be part of my beat. I couldn't have imagined that the director Gower Champion's death would be announced from the stage by the producer David Merrick on the opening night of "42d Street." Or that Joseph Papp would lead a fierce protest two blocks from my office to try (unsuccessfully, of course) to halt the demolition of three theaters, including the Morosco (hallowed site of the premiere of "Death of a Salesman"), to make way for a towering Marriott hotel. Or that the theatrical community would be decimated by an epidemic, as yet unnamed and unremarked, like AIDS. 
 When 13 years later I moved on, somewhat sadder and (I hope) more than somewhat wiser, the landscape was unrecognizable -- and not just because of the vanished old theaters. The hottest play in town was a two-part, eight-hour "gay fantasia" known as "Angels in America," Disney was toying with sticking its first toe ("Beauty and the Beast") into Broadway, and Neil Simon, whose plays for better and worse had defined Broadway for three decades, was being exiled by economic realities to a small playhouse dozens of blocks from Times Square.
Now nearly another five years have passed, and the American theater seems poised for an even more dramatic and far more rapid shift -- perhaps the most momentous systemic change since the rise of Off Broadway and the regional theater movement in the 1950's, or even since the onslaught of television in the decade before that. And again, the biggest story is happening offstage.
After generations of being a backwater to the big-money, mass-audience show business mainstream of movies, television and the recording industry, the American theater is no longer secluded in its own idiosyncratic world where it can be entirely the master (however erratic and self-destructive) of its own fate. Like book publishing before it -- until the last decade, another quaint holdout against the forces of media consolidation -- the theater is now becoming "content" suitable for synergistic annexation and exploitation by our new entertainment conglomerates.
What prompts me to take stock of the theater's recent past and looming future is the time I recently spent compiling "Hot Seat," an anthology of the drama reviews I wrote for The Times. Confronting an avalanche of old clippings for the first time in years, I re-encountered some great nights and artists that remain indelible, as well as some fabulous fiascoes, like "Moose Murders" and "Carrie," that linger almost as brightly as triumphs like "Sunday in the Park With George" and "Glengarry Glen Ross." I also discovered that other plays, including some I had praised, had vanished entirely from memory.
MY editor suggested that I acknowledge this new perspective by adding retrospective afterthoughts to my reviews and, for fun, create an appendix with lists not just of bests and worsts but also of plays that I now feel I had overestimated (starting with Sam Shepard's "Lie of the Mind") and underestimated ("Nicholas Nickleby") the first time around. Rocco Landesman, the rare Broadway producer who is actually a reformed drama critic, has long griped that one of the worst things about critics is that they never admit to making mistakes. He's right. It was certainly liberating to admit to mine, now that I had some historical distance that allowed me to look at the record fresh and recognize them. (Though some of that historical perspective is simply the vicissitudes of age; in another 20 years, maybe I'll even look back fondly on "Aspects of Love.")
But the biggest, most humbling mistake I discovered -- and I feel only slightly defensive about it, since everyone else in or around the theater made it, too -- was my utter failure to anticipate the single most important change on Broadway in decades: the arrival of Disney as a redevelopment force, which led in turn to the happy revival of 42d Street and the entire Times Square neighborhood but, less happily, to the impending corporatization of the American theater, on Broadway and beyond. From this discovery it was only a sobering moment until I realized that, whatever my lists of bests and worsts, there was only one candidate for the honor of "most influential" production during my time as drama critic.
The winner, without question, is "Cats."
I am not talking about the quality of this musical or lack of same -- a mirthless debate even in 1982 -- or its marathon run, now and perhaps forever the longest in Broadway history. Rather, "Cats" is "most influential" in terms of its mega-influence on the national theatrical culture. "Cats" outlasted its critics, outlasted umpteen casts, outlasted English-speaking audiences, even outlasted the career of its principal creator, Andrew Lloyd Webber, who hasn't had a hit in more than a decade. But now, 16 years after its New York opening, the new world that the American theater is entering -- the world typified but not exclusively represented by Disney -- is the one that "Cats" has made.
"Cats" proved as no production had before that there was an infinite tourist audience for a theatrical attraction (as opposed to, say, a circus, Las Vegas revue or Radio City Music Hall pageant) in which spectacle trumped (or perhaps Trumped) content and no English was required for comprehension, whether by young children or foreign visitors. In conjunction with the rise of ticket prices into the stratosphere during its run, "Cats" soon made it difficult for adult, conventionally scaled musicals to compete in the commercial theater's marketplace. Why pay the same high ticket price for a show, consumers asked, that didn't have a levitating spaceship or a falling chandelier but only good songs, compelling characters or provocative drama?
A very few smaller-scale musicals, like "Rent" and "Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk," have bucked the odds, but they are anomalies. Straight plays, already an endangered species when "Cats" opened, have fared even worse. Drama on Broadway now pretty much means exclusively British imports and one-person shows. There is no major (or even semi-major) American playwright with a new work scheduled for Broadway this season -- and it's not because American playwrights aren't writing.
The lasting influence of "Cats" is felt not just in the ascendancy of spectacles. With its environmental set and audience-pawing performers, "Cats" (and its immediate Lloyd Webber sequel, the roller-skating "Starlight Express") also anticipated the kind of national theatrical franchise, from "Tony and Tina's Wedding" to "Late Nite Catechism," in which the "interactive" theatrical experience becomes virtually indistinguishable from theme parks and theme restaurants.
Most of all, "Cats" is the show that led indirectly but inexorably to Disney's arrival on Broadway a decade later by proving, first, that Broadway musicals could be marketed in a big-budget, Hollywood-style "branding" blitz (previously unknown in an industry that was suspicious of television commercials until the 1970's) and, second, that there was a huge profit to be made in exploiting animated characters on a Broadway stage. The characters of "The Lion King," at the gorgeously restored Ziegfeld palace the New Amsterdam, are literally descendants of the cats of "Cats," with the gifted director Julie Taymor providing the illusion of highbrow gloss to the kiddie show that the British director Trevor Nunn and (involuntarily) T. S. Eliot lent to their feline ancestors at another former Ziegfeld roost, the Winter Garden.
There is nothing wrong with a "Cats" or a "Lion King" as part of the Broadway mix -- if it actually were a mix -- but what "Lion King" helped bring to Broadway (as "Cats" did not) is a corporate sensibility in the work itself, not just its marketing. Whatever its merits, "Cats" was produced by individuals as an original piece for the theater, while "Lion King" is but the stage incarnation of an already existing product line (the movie, the tchotchkes, the video, the Disney World representations, etc.) manufactured by the most sophisticated entertainment giant on the planet.
The corporate mentality extends to the "Lion King" score, which is by an assembly line of disparate songwriters ("Cats" had only Mr. Lloyd Webber and his unacknowledged alter ego, Puccini). The performances at the New Amsterdam are often unspontaneous, as if they were audio-animatronic carbons of the animated movie's prototypes. There is synergistic cross-product-plugging not just in the Disney store off the lobby but onstage (a gag promoting "Beauty and the Beast").
Disney is not alone in bringing a corporate approach to the theater. It is merely the corporation with the biggest marquee name, deepest pockets and, in truth, the most skill.
A similar sensibility infuses "Ragtime," the product of Livent, the first publicly traded company to devote itself to theater. Though based on a nuanced, indisputably adult novel by E. L. Doctorow, this musical has the same look and feel as the previous Livent product, "Show Boat" -- even though the shows have different authors and were staged by very different directors (Frank Galati and Harold Prince, respectively). "Ragtime," like "Lion King," comes to a halt for a gratuitous corporate plug (a number about the Ford Motor Company, whose cash donation bought it the name of the new theater where the show is playing). And, like "Lion King" as well, "Ragtime" is suffused with a bland political correctness designed to appeal to all markets and offend no one. (In retrospect, the vulgar sexism of "Cats," with its whore-kitty-with-a-heart-of-gold heroine, seems almost daring.)
Since Disney still (rightly) regards theater as a small-potatoes part of its empire, and Livent is on the ropes in the midst of declining revenues and rising fraud investigations, they may actually end up as relatively minor players in the new corporate theater. The real power could turn out to be a newcomer few have heard of: SFX Entertainment.
The brainchild of Robert F. X. Sillerman, a radio mogul, the publicly traded SFX has swallowed up a bevy of pop-music concert presenters and venues, now controlling more than half the national market, including 31 of the country's 37 amphitheaters. Late last year, it bought Pace, the leading producer of theatrical touring shows in America, then went shopping for other theatrical properties across the map. Since theater on the road is now a far larger business than Broadway, SFX is de facto the most powerful theater producer in the country. We have come a long way from impresarios like David Merrick and Joseph Papp, who produced both high art and schlock but who ventured from theater only to dabble in movies or television. SFX's nontheatrical enterprises include not just pop concerts but the staging of monster-truck rallies, demolition derbies and the career management of Michael Jordan.
On the new road dominated by SFX, not only are straight plays extinct but even a Disney or Livent musical may prove to be a relatively rarefied theatrical offering. Much of the schedule at gargantuan touring houses around the country is filled out by what Variety has called "pseudo" theatrical attractions: multiple companies of "Riverdance," "Stomp," "Tap Dogs" and their many imitators and variations.
Meanwhile, Broadway more than ever tailors itself to this same huge and lucrative market. This explains not only why there are no major American plays on Broadway's schedule this season but why most of the announced shows are chestnuts with familiar, instantly saleable titles ("Footloose," "Peter Pan," "Annie Get Your Gun," "You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown").
The only antidote to this new commercial theater, which has more in common with the values of special-effects American movies and network television than did even old Broadway at its most commercial, remains the nonprofit theater of Off Broadway and resident theaters nationwide. As has been true since the 70's, the most exciting new plays originate in such companies -- but now they are ghettoized there. Nonprofit theater hits like "How I Learned to Drive," "Wit" and "The Dying Gaul" -- which once might have moved to Broadway (and from there, possibly, to the road), as "Glengarry Glen Ross," "Driving Miss Daisy" and "Angels in America" once did -- now remain in small houses for their entire runs. An occasional "Side Man" notwithstanding, they rarely transfer to Broadway and their only hope for national dissemination is if they are mounted in new productions by local companies around the country.
On its face this seems a workable system: a two-tiered theater just as there is a two-tiered film culture divided between Hollywood blockbusters and independent art-house films. But nonprofit theaters don't have the reach or the financial clout of even the movie industry's small fry; the most successful of these theaters still need serious philanthropic subsidies (public or private) just to meet costs.
Now, the new corporate theater giants are knocking at their door with bigger and bigger checks. This season alone three major nonprofit theaters -- Lincoln Center Theater in New York (Livent's "Parade"), the Alliance Theater in Atlanta (Disney's "Elaborate Lives: The Legend of Aida"), the Alley Theater in Houston (SFX/Pace's "Civil War") -- are collaborating with the new behemoths, exclusively on musicals. Are these Faustian bargains that will lead to other commercial collaborations that will change the character of such theaters and ultimately wipe tough new plays off their schedules, too? Or are they benign, one-shot deals? It is too early to tell.
An even larger open question is how corporate theater will affect nonprofit theaters indirectly -- by shaping the taste of their future audiences. If the new generations of theatergoers coming up now are mostly weaned on the esthetics of "Lion King" and "Riverdance," will they want the same limited theatrical diet when they become the new audience pool for the Roundabout Theater Company or the Goodman Theater in Chicago or Arena Stage in Washington?
A new Theater Development Fund survey released last month reported the good news that the under-18 theater audience is increasing for the first time in more than a generation. But there is chilling news buried in the fine print: almost all of these new theatergoers were attending "Beauty and the Beast" and the like, with the under-18 component of straight-play audiences numbering a minuscule 1.1 percent. (Even for 25-year-olds, the figure rises only to 6.4.)
BUT what keeps me optimistic about the theater, and always has, is that the influx of talent never stops. If companies that were vital when I was a drama critic, like the Circle Rep and Negro Ensemble Company, vanish, new ones like the Atlantic, New York Theater Workshop and Drama Dept. still come along to take their place. These are the theaters that find and nurture the individual voices that produce our best plays and musicals -- and they are the antithesis of the new corporate theater, which is run by committee. No corporation is ever going to create a "Death of a Salesman" or a "How I Learned to Drive" or a "Bring In da Noise" or a revival that makes you look at Shakespeare or Williams or Ibsen anew. But will the nonprofit theaters that do this work be heard against the forbidding din of giants like Disney and SFX and the other media conglomerates certain to follow?
At this point, as I recall, a drama critic ritualistically reminds readers that the theater is a fabulous invalid, destined to rise once more from its deathbed. But our theater, a bigger business than ever as measured in dollars, is hardly dying. The real question about a theater overrun by cartoon characters and scripted by marketers is what, over the long haul, will be its quality of life.
I never would have guessed as I watched a defiant Joe Papp, the great O'Neill actress Colleen Dewhurst beside him, fight big commercial interests to save hallowed old playhouses in the early 1980's that his struggle was quixotic. Even if he had saved those theaters, what would he have been saving them for? Not for the theater of language and intimacy and passion. Not for anything he or many of the rest of us back then would have recognized as plays.

HEADLINE: Troubled Times Arise at Southampton Hospital

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

DATELINE: SOUTHAMPTON

 BODY:
IN his four-and-a-half years as president and chief executive of Southampton Hospital, Dr. John J. Ferry Jr. had seemed to be everything that the top administrator of a private hospital in the Hamptons should be.
Energetic, charismatic and ubiquitous, he expanded hospital services, invested in new equipment and added touches of panache like valet parking and official greeters in a main lobby. He was a fixture at social and sporting events that raised money for the hospital. He modeled black satin boxer shorts at a benefit for breast cancer and rode the hospital float in the St. Patrick's Day parade dressed as Peter Pan, green tights and all. 
 And in his dealings with the hospital board Dr. Ferry, a pediatrician with an M.B.A. from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, was always formidable.
In appearances one board member recalled as mesmerizing, Dr. Ferry assertively set forth his agenda and, toward the end of his tenure, convincingly laid to rest whispering that all was not well in the hospital's financial house because of billing problems and a dramatic rise in accounts receivable, among other things. Any problems, he said, were temporary.
But that's where Dr. Ferry was wrong. In August, he and the hospital's chief financial officer, Joseph Zwolak, abruptly resigned and two board members, the newly appointed chairman, R. Peter Sullivan III, and vice chairman, Donald Louchheim, announced startling news: The hospital was in a grave financial crisis, its depths yet to be plumbed.
In ensuing weeks the picture darkened. The hospital's new auditor, KPMG Peat Marwick, replacing Deloitte & Touche, uncovered layer upon layer of chaotic book-keeping and mismanagement. A computer software conversion problem was shown to have crippled billing, money the hospital said it was owed turned out not to be owed at all, and the "outsourcing" of bill collection led to new costs and hospital loss of control.
By last week, the hospital's reported short-fall had nearly reached $50 million for the past three years and was still rising as auditing continued.
Over the same period, a $25 million endowment fund had been used up, leaving the hospital, with an annual operating budget of $65 million, without a cushion in its time of greatest need.
Dr. Ferry had no comment last week about the hospital's troubles, but in a letter to The Southampton Press following his resignation, he said problems had been far greater than he, other hospital executives, the former auditor or board members knew.
"I understand and respect the need for change in leadership not only in finance but in executive management," he wrote, pledging to support the hospital "in any way I can."
The hospital's new acting president and chief executive, Thomas B. Doolan, said last week there was no danger that the 127-bed hospital, which has a staff of about 1,000 doctors, nurses and others, would close. He said streamlining, tighter financial operational controls, renegotiated contracts with managed care companies and possible cutbacks in hospital services would bring a turn-around. But Mr. Doolan said that the quality of hospital care would be maintained and that every effort would be made to retain satellite programs.
Mr. Doolan is also the head of the Peconic Health Corporation, the parent company of Southampton Hospital, Central Suffolk Hospital in Riverhead and Eastern Long Island Hospital in Greenport, which was formed to help the three hospitals compete in the deregulated health industry.
Mr. Doolan and Mr. Louchheim have both said contributions to Southhampton Hospital will be essential for its recovery.
But as news of the hospital's financial problems spread, contributors have had reasons to pause before writing checks. Mr. Louchheim said donations to the hospital were already "drying up."
"You can't go out and ask people to give us money without first creating a climate of confidence in the new management," he said. "People have to feel the contributions they make are not just pouring money down a rat-hole.
"Many people are saying, 'You squandered all our money, if we give you more how do we know you won't waste it?"' he said. "It's very difficult. We know we can turn this ship around, but we need some time."
Some have said the full story of the hospital's finances has yet to be told. The East Hampton Star, a weekly newspaper, suggested in a recent editorial that "the hospital leadership solicit not another penny until they have provided a full and satisfactory accounting."
Critics have questioned whether the board was diligent in overseeing the hospital. Membership on the 35-member board, with 30 seats filled, was, critics said, a social plum for second-home owners who were often absent and inattentive to hospital business.
"I know it seems incredible and I have great difficulty explaining it," said Mr. Louchheim, the former publisher of The Southampton Press. "But this isn't about millions of dollars disappearing. What we're talking about is an overestimation of billing.
"There isn't somebody running away with $30 million," he said, referring to hospital losses in 1997.
In a written statement, Mr. Sullivan said the board had been "stunned by disclosure after disclosure of the faults in our financial accounting and reporting systems" and had been "seriously misled" by auditing and management reports.
James J. Needham of Bridgehampton, a former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange and a former commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said he has notified the office of New York Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco of the hospital's problems.
Mr. Needham, also a former Southampton Town Board member and an accountant, said he hoped the attorney general would investigate whether board members upheld their responsibilities.
A spokesman for Mr. Vacco, David F. Corvette, said he could neither confirm nor deny that an investigation was being conducted.
Mr. Needham said the board had yet to give an adequate account of how it failed to notice the problems sooner. "It's just hard for me to understand how something like this could get away from them," he said. "Fifty million dollars disappearing like that is a great concern to everybody."
Even those who expected that the hospital would recover under Mr. Doolan expressed astonishment. "I think in a very brief time the hospital will be turned around," Vincent J. Cannuscio, the Southampton Town Supervisor said. "It's just unfortunate that they didn't have control over their own dollars and cents. It's unbelievable, really. If you don't have that, something is dramatically wrong."

HEADLINE: Tenants as Developer's Partner in a Loft Venture

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
UNPLEASANT as it is, a handful of tenants are living through the reconstruction of their building at 285 Lafayette Street, a block south of East Houston Street at the eastern fringe of SoHo. Once it was the Hawley & Hoops candy factory. Now it is an unusual example of an owner-tenant business partnership.
For years the artist-residents who occupy about a third of the building have expected that under one owner or another it would be upgraded and that they would be left peacefully in place in live-work space that many have improved at their own expense. 
 What they could not have expected was a major $16 million reconstruction that includes additional rooftop space as part of a conversion to a residential condominium, with themselves as an integral part of the development process. The completed project will have 21 new condominiums -- finished space selling for $1.4 million and up -- plus the 10 condominiumized spaces that the tenants will own.
In what may be an unprecedented arrangement in Manhattan loft rehabilitations, the upstairs tenants in the 100,000-square-foot building took a 35 percent interest in the owning partnership. They will get deeds to their space after the conversion. They will not share in profits from the sale of condominiums by the developer, and they have no financial interest in the entity that owns the new space in the rooftop addition. But should they eventually decide to sell their own space, they will benefit from the increased value that is being created.
They are not getting a gift. The 10 tenants are putting up a total of $700,000 for their 35,000 square feet, and chipping in about $500,000 more as their share of the construction and other costs associated with legalizing the building for residential use. Like many residentially occupied loft buildings, 285 Lafayette Street never received a certificate of occupancy for residential use, although under the 1980 loft law tenants have been given regulatory protections.
For the tenant living in a 2,500-square-foot quadrant of a floor, the equity contribution is about $100,000 -- $50,000 for the cash contribution and $50,000 more toward the legalization costs. Tenant spaces actually range from 1,000 to 3,000 square feet.
All parties seem to agree that the project would not have gone forward had the developer been unable to reach an agreement with the tenants, who were represented by Paul A. Gulielmetti of Manhattan. At one point they had hoped to buy the building themselves.
"It took us a long time to get used to Eric as our partner rather than Eric as our landlord," said Diane Villani, a tenant leader and a partner in Quartet Editions, a publisher of fine-arts prints, who has lived in the building since 1979. "We have had to get used to not calling him when there's no heat."
Eric D. Hadar is the 33-year-old president of the family-owned Allied Partners, the developer. Five years ago Mr. Hadar left Sonnenblick Goldman, the real-estate investment banking and brokerage firm, to found Allied Partners with backing from his father, Richard Hadar, the former president of a direct-marketing company, American Direct Industries, which was sold to Bankers Trust in 1989.
Allied Partners has become an active Manhattan real-estate investor, acquiring 14 properties that it says has a market value of about $136 million, and providing other investors with short-term loans.
IT acquired, for example, the Studio 54 building at 254 West 54th Street, with its 30,000-square-foot theater and adjacent 16-story office building, in 1994 when the property was in receivership. The office building was gut-renovated and re-leased. Allied also bought the 200,000-square-foot office building at 250 Church Street, again acquiring a mortgage for less than its face value, and renegotiated a lease to keep city agencies in occupancy.
Allied was an investor with William Lie Zeckendorf, Arthur Zeckendorf, Kent Swig and David Burris in the acquisition of Brown Harris Stevens, the brokerage and management firm, and with that firm it participated in the acquisition of 770 Lexington Avenue, at 60th Street. And it took over the management of 545 Madison Avenue, at 55th Street, when it was 70 percent occupied, after acquiring the leasehold mortgage and a limited-partnership interest. The building is now fully leased, Mr. Hadar said.
The Lafayette Street building has a long history as a rehabilitation candidate. Once it was owned by Norman Ferber, a Manhattan real estate investor. Along with other owners of financially distressed loft properties in lower Manhattan in the 70's, he brought in sculptors, painters, photographers and other artists on commercial leases, and they altered their space to live in them. Such tenants were given legal occupancy rights under the loft law.
Another owner, Fred Deutsch, took over in the mid-80's, and obtained an acquisition and development loan. He moved into the building and elaborately renovated 6,000 square feet of space for his residence on the fourth and fifth floors. Architectural Digest pictured the apartment on the cover of its February 1993 issue.
Mr. Deutsch approached Allied Partners in late 1994 about the building's financial plight. Its loan was in default and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had taken over the assets of the bank that made it. Allied, along with two longtime New York City real-estate investors, Lawrence Friedland and Arnold Penner, acquired the mortgage. For two years Mr. Hadar and his lawyer, Norman Marcus, worked on a rezoning needed for the redevelopment. By the time construction was ready to start, Allied had bought out its financial partners and Mr. Deutsch, whose former apartment is part of the reconstruction.
Meanwhile, Mr. Hadar had negotiated the arrangement with the tenants, who supported the rezoning and the addition of 24,000 square feet on the roof, which was considered essential for the economic feasibility of the project. As owners the tenants will pay their proportionate share of the building's real estate taxes and operating costs, averaging $1,500 a month for 2,500 square feet.
ALLIED PARTNERS is selling 21 finished apartments, ranging in size from 1,780 square feet to 4,060 square feet, and in price from $375 a square foot to $1,244 a square foot. The first six floors -- the original building -- are divided into four apartments a floor. A new finished apartment with 3,235 square feet on the fifth floor, facing south and west, sells for $1.55 million. On the same floor an apartment of 3,365 square feet facing south and east sells for $1.825 million.
In the rooftop addition there are two set-back floors with seven apartments, one a duplex, and above that are two duplex penthouses. All these apartments have terraces. They sell for $1.4 million to $4.2 million. If the apartments are fully sold out at the currently listed prices, the total sell-out would be $41 million. Helene Luchnick, vice president of Douglas Elliman, the sales director, said that there are eight signed contracts so far.
The numerous special features include high ceilings -- three are 26 feet high or more -- terraces, fireplaces, and elaborate kitchens and baths. Many of the fixtures have been purchased from Urban Archeology, a store specializing in antique reproductions as well as originals. Urban Archeology has been a 30,000-square-foot tenant in the building since the 80's, and has a new lease from Allied that runs to 2006.
The architects are WYS Design Partnership Architects, and Costas Kondylis & Associates. Shael Shapiro, the architect in charge at WYS Design Partnership, noted that the development was made possible by the city's decision to rezone the property to a mixed commercial and residential zone (C-6-3) from its former manufacturing designation. Included in the rezoning was the already rehabilitated Puck building, with commercial and office space, a block to the north. The City Council rejected a broader proposal by the City Planning Commission to include in the rezoning an entire triangular stretch east of Lafayette Street between Prince and Bleecker Streets.
Does Mr. Hadar realistically expect people to spend over $1 million to live on Lafayette Street south of Houston Street? "Our average purchase price so far has been $2.5 million," he said. One penthouse apartment, a duplex with 2,890 square feet of interior space and a terrace, sold for $3.1 million.

HEADLINE: Albanian Student Looks Past Asylum

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
AFTER months of fighting for political asylum, Edmond Coku, 18, is breathing easily again. Fearful that if he returned to Albania, the country of his childhood, he would share the fate of his grandfather, Mr. Coku waged a hard-fought battle with the United States Government this summer -- and won.
But now the strapping young man, last year's valedictorian at Lincoln High School in Yonkers and now a scholarship student at Manhattanville College in Purchase, has another hurdle to clear. 
 Mr. Coku is also seeking political asylum for his 63-year-old father, Zef Coku, who still possesses the bullet-riddled coat of his own father, executed in 1945 by a Communist firing squad. As it is for many Albanians, the story of the Coku family is tragic.
"We have suffered for many years," the elder Mr. Coku said recently through a translator. "My father cried out before he died, 'Long life to Albania,' and he made the sign of the cross. But in the end, the Communists had their way."
Zef Coku came to New York from Albania on a visitor's visa in June to attend his son's graduation, and he wants to remain. Unlike other immigrants from his country in recent years who have fought unsuccessfully against stringent immigration laws to remain in the United States, the elder Mr. Coku will likely be granted political asylum, in part because his son has paved the way for him, lawyers said.
A 1997 immigration law denies asylum seekers full hearings with legal representation and the right to Federal appeals unless they quickly convince officials that they have a credible fear of persecution.
Before the law took effect, people who requested asylum were allowed to stay in the United States while their cases were heard by immigration judges. If the judges ruled against them, they could remain while they appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals and then to the Federal courts.
"For everyone, it is getting more difficult to leave," Edmond Coku observed. "Every day it gets more dangerous in our country, and my father fears for his life because the same people who executed his father are free to kill him, too."
An Albanian, whose lawyers reported that she was gang raped because her husband refused to fight for the Government, escaped to the United States last year. She was detained in Elizabeth, N.J., but was unable to convince immigration officials that she had a credible case. As a result, she was deported under the new law designed to weed out baseless asylum claims. After her return to Albania, the woman's story received wide attention and she became a test case. She was finally able to come back to the United States, in part through the efforts of the American Civil Liberties Union.
In the case of the Coku family, a pattern of harassment and persecution has been shown, dating back to the grandfather's role as a leader in the Albanian War of Independence in 1912, said Adam Dorsky, a lawyer with the firm Wilson & Associates of Manhattan, which represented the student on a pro bono basis.
When the Communists came to power and before they executed Ded Coku in 1945, they labeled him a "kulak," a rich man who exploited peasants. After his death, the family (including Edmond's father who was 10 at the time) was sent to internment camps to live. Edmond was born in such a camp in 1980.
"Our story started with my grandfather's execution," the student said. Zef Coku, as a member of the National Association of the Former Politically Persecuted and an elected member of the Presidency of the District Council of Lezhe in Albania, has continued his family's tradition of political activism. But Edmond Coku does not think he will become politically involved once he graduates from college, preferring other courses of study like computer science, law or finance, he said.
"Perhaps political science," he added, "but I do not think so."
Because the Communists recently returned to power, Edmond's mother and his 23-year-old brother went to Italy, where they now live in detention camps. About the same time, as the political situation throughout the Balkans continued to grow more dangerous, Edmond was sent to live with relatives -- first in Dallas and then in Yonkers.
Measuring only 250 miles in length and 50 miles across, Albania has produced such people as the Roman emperor Justinian, Pope Clement V and Mother Teresa. But for the most part, its people have labored under difficulties as their mountainous country, which lies along the east coast of the Adriatic, was endlessly subjugated and divided by its neighbors, beginning in 1488 with the Ottomans, and then in 1912 with dictators from Serbia. About two-thirds of the Albanians in the Balkans are secular Muslims, and the others are Greek Orthodox or Roman Catholic.
An estimated 500,000 Albanians have settled in the United States, about half of them in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, said Vehbi Bajrami, editor of Illyria, an Albanian-American newspaper in the Bronx, which is published twice a week.
But successful asylum requests are becoming less frequent. Last year, after new immigration rules took effect, officials estimated that more than 1,000 people requested asylum at United States airports and about 80 percent of them were found to have a credible fear of persecution. The rest were deported.
Experts say the number of people seeking asylum has fallen sharply since 1994, when the Clinton Administration first stopped automatically giving asylum seekers work-authorization cards.
In Bayside, Queens, an immigration lawyer, Linda L. Foster, confirmed that it was becoming more difficult for those seeking political asylum because United States officials are now differentiating between those fleeing actual political persecution and those attempting to leave a bad economy.
Also, she said that the Communists had become "very adept" at hiding their true role in any political persecutions because Albania was seeking membership in NATO and wanted to avoid being cast as a nation that violates human rights.
In addition to the Albanians from Kosovo, Macedonia and Montenegro who live in the New York City area, another 50,000 to 75,000 have been living in the Boston area since World War I, said Joseph J. DioGuardi, a former Republican Congressman and now president of the national Albanian American Civic League. Also, close to 75,000 live in Detroit, and the rest are scattered in pockets nationwide, he said.
"Albanians have always felt comfortable looking to the West," observed Mr. DioGuardi, who said they have immigrated mostly to Italy and North America. In the United States, he said, many Albanians have been successful as entrepreneurs, often starting out as waiters, busboys and building managers and "quickly buying property or buildings, restaurants or other businesses." Mr. DioGuardi's forbears on his father's side fled to southern Italy from Albania in 1488.
Many of the buildings in the northern Bronx near the Grand Concourse and Pelham Parkway are owned and managed by Albanian landlords "who get ahead, want good educations for their children and move on to places in suburbs like Westchester," he said. There are enclaves of Albanians in Chappaqua, Ossining, Yonkers and Scarsdale.
Edmond Coku's extended family in Yonkers fits the picture of success that Mr. DioGuardi drew. Mr. Coku's 33-year-old cousin, Alfonse Pali, with whom he lives, came to the United States six years ago with his wife, Vera. After marrying in a civil ceremony in Lezhe because the Communist Government would not recognize their Roman Catholic faith, they fled to Greece, where they had a religious ceremony, and then to New York.
The couple worked in factories until Mr. Pali found a job as a doorman and then as superintendent in the Yonkers building where they now live with their 4-year-old son, Daniel. Mr. Pali is also employed at the Bronx Zoo as a construction worker and has started his own construction business. His wife is attending Lehman College in the Bronx.
Meanwhile, Edmond Coku is continuing his studies at Manhattanville College. After hearing about both his scholastic success and his immigration problems, Richard A. Berman, president of the college, asked him to join Manhattanville's small global community and offered him a full scholarship.
As a point of contrast to his latest accomplishments, Edmond Coku recalled a less happy time in Lezhe eight years ago when his teacher announced that he had won a student of the year award. Two days later, she withdrew the prize upon realizing who the 10-year-old boy was. "She found out that I was the grandson of Ded Coku," he said. "I still am, but now I can again carry the family name proudly."

HEADLINE: Coattails And More In the Races For Congress

BYLINE: By PEGGY McCARTHY 

 BODY:
WHEN Mark Nielsen campaigns, he often introduces himself as the Republican running for John G. Rowland's old Congressional seat. No matter that Mr. Rowland, now the Governor, hasn't been in Congress since 1990, and that there have been two Congressmen in the seat since then.
Mr. Nielsen, who calls himself a "John Rowland Republican," is the challenger in a competitive race for Fifth District Congressman. He is blunt about seeking to benefit from any coattails the popular governor might offer and any association with Mr. Rowland that would entice voters to cast ballots for him, instead of for the Democratic incumbent James H. Maloney. 
 The six Connecticut contests for the United States House of Representatives are taking place this year amid many questions, particularly about coattails. If Mr. Rowland does as well as polls indicate in the gubernatorial race against his Democratic challenger, Barbara B. Kennelly, will that help Republican Congressional candidates like Mr. Nielsen, even though there is no longer a party lever in Connecticut? Will a strong showing by the incumbent United States Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Democrat, against Gary A. Franks, the Republican challenger, offset Mr. Rowland's numbers and boost Democratic Congressional candidates? Will the House's handling of the impeachment inquiry into President Clinton's relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky affect voting for Congressional candidates? Will Democrats stay home on Election Day, Nov. 3, because of an apparent lack of enthusiasm for their party's gubernatorial candidate?
Such questions reflect the fact that this year, "there are so many conflicting moods in the electorate," said Howard L. Reiter, professor of political science at the University of Connecticut.
The State Democratic Party Chairman, Edward L. Marcus, expressed concern about turnout, saying the gubernatorial contest "has not been the most exciting campaign, in general." Much of the outcome depends on the 800,000 unaffiliated voters. There are 700,000 registered Democrats and 420,000 registered Republicans.
In the Fifth District, national Democratic strategists call Mr. Maloney's re-election bid "a major priority." Republicans name Mr. Nielsen, who championed welfare reform legislation, their best shot in the Northeast to pick up a House seat. Both candidates are receiving money from their national parties. The conservative-leaning swing district includes Danbury, Meriden, Waterbury, lower Naugatuck Valley towns, and inland suburbs in Fairfield and New Haven counties. Both the candidates are lawyers from Danbury and Harvard University graduates. Mr. Nielsen is currently a State Senator and Mr. Maloney a former State Senator.
Mr. Maloney, whose advantage as an incumbent is limited because he has served a single two-year term, has made constituent work a priority as a deliberate contrast to his Republican predecessor, Mr. Franks. Known for walking an independent path, Mr. Maloney he took a political gamble when he joined only 30 other House Democrats who aligned with Republicans in voting for an open-ended impeachment inquiry. (He did this after voting for the Democrats' limited proposal, which was defeated.) His opponent is making an issue of 1994 violations of campaign finance laws by Mr. Maloney's brother, in a case that prosecutors found no evidence that the Democratic candidate was involved. Mr. Nielsen also criticized the Maloney campaign for raising money for a primary that didn't occur, leaving open the possibility of allowing the same donors to contribute twice, once for a primary and once for a general election. The Maloney camp called the matter an honest mistake.
Five incumbents are seeking re-election to the House in Connecticut. All but Mr. Maloney voted with their parties' positions on the impeachment inquiry. There are independent or minor party candidates in all six districts.
The First District in the Hartford area is getting more than usual attention because there is an open seat for the first time since 1982 when the Democratic incumbent, William R. Cotter, died. Mrs. Kennelly, now the gubernatorial candidate, won a special election and easily won re-election in the district, which has a two-to-one Democratic plurality over Republicans. There hasn't been a Republican elected in the district since 1956 when Edwin H. May Jr. was swept into office with Dwight D. Eisenhower's Presidential landslide.
Despite the history of the Democratic bastion, state and national Republican organizations are giving money, campaign help and enthusiastic support to their candidate, Kevin J. O'Connor, a 31-year-old lawyer from Wethersfield. In the First District, "he has the best chance of any Republican I've seen in my political lifetime," Christopher DePino, chairman of the State Republican Party. Mr. O'Connor is emphasizing education as a major issue and what he considers complacency by Democratic officeholders on the issue. And, in acknowledging the lopsided registration in the district, Mr. O'Connor promised that he would be an independent lawmaker in the style of Representative Christopher Shays of Stamford and the Fourth District.
John B. Larson, of East Hartford, is the Democratic candidate for the First District seat, having won a four-way primary last month. Mr. Larson is a former State Senate President pro tempore who spent 12 years in the Senate. His most important legacy is family leave legislation, one of the first in the country. He ran an unsuccessful primary in 1994 to be his party's gubernatorial candidate. His expensive primary this year has put a drain on his campaign finances, which could hamper his activity in the final weeks of the campaign.
The race in the Sixth District for the third time pits the Democratic challenger, Charlotte G. Koskoff, against the incumbent Republican, Nancy L. Johnson. In 1996, Ms. Koskoff lost by just 1,587 votes despite having so little money; she could not afford television commercials. Since then, Mrs. Johnson, who is seeking a ninth term, has been spending more time in her district and is running an aggressive campaign, heavy on television advertising.
Paul R. Petterson, assistant professor of political science at Central Connecticut State University, observed that "there is no critical weakness Nancy Johnson has at this point other than being identified with Republicans." The district covers the northwest section of the state.
Ms. Koskoff, a former college professor and a lawyer from Plainville, said she expected to get financial help in the final weeks of her campaign from the national Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, help that she said facilitates other mainstream donations. And this time she has money for television advertising. In the last election, she strongly criticized the incumbent for her handling of an ethics investigation into House Speaker Newt Gingrich's fund-raising activities, which resulted in a House reprimand and a fine. She still reminds voters of that and also criticizes Mrs. Johnson's sponsorship of an amendment that allowed Stanley Works of New Britain to make parts overseas and label the finished product as made in this country. She points out that Mrs. Johnson has received campaign donations from Stanley Works.
Mrs. Johnson, a former State Senator from New Britain, has countered that she has worked to increase jobs in the district. She lists among her accomplishments passage of measures to improve mammogram standards and guarantee health care for uninsured children of welfare recipients and points to endorsements, usually handed to Democrats, from the Sierra Club and the Connecticut Education Association.
Elsewhere, the incumbents are considered by most political analysts to be in strong positions. The Second District Democratic incumbent, Sam Gejdenson, of Bozrah, has prevailed in tight elections in the past in his eastern Connecticut district, which includes New London, Middletown and Norwich. This year, he is seen to be in a better position in his bid for a 10th term. He is promising to work to make the Social Security system solvent.
Gary M. Koval, the Republican who is challenging Mr. Gejdenson, is critical of the incumbent's opposition to tax-cut legislation proposed by Mrs. Johnson. Mr. Koval, a Mansfield resident, is a State Liquor Control commissioner and owns a computer supply business. When he lived in Columbia, he served on the Board of Selectman, the Zoning Board of Appeals and was Republican Town Chairman.
In the Third District, in the New Haven area, the incumbent Democrat, Rosa L. DeLauro, is seeking a fifth term in a race against a poorly-financed Republican opponent, Martin T. Reust. Ms. DeLauro, a House Minority Whip, has maintained a high profile criticizing the Republican majority in the House. Television viewers witnessed a dramatic confrontation when she was gaveled by Speaker Gingrich and heckled by Republicans while she was attempting to debate the impeachment inquiry matter. She has been vocal in her complaints that the Republicans have not moved legislation through Congress. She cites her proposal to require insurance coverage for two-day hospital stays after mastectomies and coverage for one day for lymph node operations, which was not given a public hearing despite having 219 co-sponsors.
Mr. Reust, a Madison resident, is a computer software designer and consultant. He is a member of the Madison Board of Assessment Appeals who supports requiring a two-thirds majority vote for a Federal tax increase, overhaul of the Social Security system, and giving parents more choice over where their children attend public school.
In lower Fairfield County's Fourth District, Mr. Shays, who is seeking his seventh term, was in the national limelight with his co-sponsorship of a campaign finance reform bill with Representative Martin Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat. It did not succeed, though, as the Senate killed campaign finance reform.
Mr. Shays's opponent is Jonathan Kantrowitz, a former Board of Education member in Fairfield, who ran four years ago and again has refused to accept money in the race. He has limited his message to a few issues, mainly fighting crime and drug use, improving education and helping to stabilize the world's economy by strengthening the International Monetary Fund. In a recent candidates' forum on Connecticut Public Television, when he was asked a question concerning health maintenance organizations and their treatment of elderly people, he responded that he is running "a very limited campaign focusing on a few issues, and that's not one of them."
Mr. Shays, who prides himself on bipartisan efforts, co-sponsored with Mr. Maloney legislation designed to restore contaminated, former industrial sites, called brownfields. It was signed into law by President Clinton.
While voters' sentiments across the country appear to be swinging daily, and with two weeks left until Election Day, nothing is certain, says Mr. Reiter of UConn. Backlash from the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal and the handling of impeachment proceedings have shifted from favoring Republicans to more recent polls concluding they would favor Democrats.
In Connecticut, voter reaction taken in late September by the Quinnipiac Poll showed 49 percent of respondents saying a candidate's position on impeachment wouldn't affect their vote in a Congressional election.
At the same time, 35 percent responded that they would be less likely to vote for a a candidate who favored impeachment and 14 percent said they would be more likely to support such a candidate.
"It could come back to haunt Republicans if they're perceived as strongly against the president," said Douglas Schwartz, director of the poll.

HEADLINE: Tribes to Revive Language

BYLINE: By SAM LIBBY 

 BODY:
IN 1908, the Mohegan elder Fidelia Fielding -- the last speaker of the Eastern Algonquin language spoken by the Pequots as well as the Mohegans -- died. Ninety years latter leaders of both the Mohegan and Mashantucket Pequot tribes say reviving their dead language is their most important long-term cultural goal.
"Today the Mashantucket Pequot regret the loss of their language and would like to see it become a part of the community again," reads the legend on an exhibit about the Algonquin languages in the recently opened $200 million Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center. But the economically resurgent tribes have no immediate plans, programs or money allotted to make their language live again. 
 "Language defines a people," says Kevin McBride, director of research at the museum and research center, and an anthropology professor at the University of Connecticut. "A language expresses a people's national and ethnic identity. A people's language tells of their political, cultural and social life. Language articulates a people's world view. Surviving Eastern Algonquin languages such as Micmac, Passamaquoddy, Abenaki and Ojibwe show the fundamentally different way that Indian peoples and Europeans viewed the physical and spiritual worlds," said Dr. McBride.
The Mohegan-Pequot Language was documented by missionaries and scholars. In 1690, a Pequot vocabulary list was compiled by Rev. James Noyes in Groton. In 1717, Experience Mayhew, a Congregational Minister translated the Lord's Prayer into Mohegan-Pequot. Ezra Stiles, president of Yale University collected Pequot linguistic data in Groton in 1762.
Fidelia Fielding was born in 1827 and raised by her maternal grandmother, who spoke only Mohegan-Pequot. Ms. Fielding recorded her diary in the Mohegan Pequot language during the latter half of the 19th century.
To demonstrate their interest in making the Mohegan Pequot language part of their community again, the Mashantucket Pequot show a menu in the museum that was used during the tribe's 1992 attempt to translate such words as hamburger and hot dog into Mohegan-Pequot.
There should be enough documentation of the Mohegan-Pequot language to give linguists the ability to create a Mohegan Pequot-English dictionary, says Dr. McBride.
Words to describe aspects of the modern world such as computer and casino could either incorporate the English word or a Mohegan-Pequot construct that would describe the modern technology. A similar process took place in the 17th and 18th centuries when the Mohegans incorporated English words or Mohegan language constructs for chickens and other livestock as well as for firearms and technology introduced by Europeans, says the Mohegan tribal historian, Melissa Fawcett.
In the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center an interactive language exhibit allows traditional stories and common words in the Micmac, Passamaquoddy, Abenaki and Ojibwe language to be heard and read with English translation. The exhibit shows how similar and how different the vocabularies could be in the Eastern Algonquin languages; at the same time, basic similarities can be seen in the grammar and language construction.
Words in the Eastern Algonquin languages tend to be lengthy, consisting of many meaningful parts that could designate whether the word is singular or plural, animate or inanimate. Words often change according to context. A short sentence can convey many subtle meanings.
A trader crossing Connecticut in the 16th century would have encountered at least four different Indian languages, says Dr. McBride. Mohegan Pequot language speakers could not necessarily communicate in that language with the Niantics, Narragansetts, Nipmuck and Quiripi. This indicates that Connecticut Indians must have been able to speak more than one language since members of the different tribes did intermarry and socialize, he said. Eastern Algonquin Indians also could communicate with each other using a common sign language.
Because of the common grammatical rules of the surviving Eastern Algonquin language, and the documentation of the Mohegan-Pequot language, linguists should be able to establish the language's grammatical rules, says Dr. McBride. The museum's interactive Eastern Algonquin language exhibit promises the Pequot language will soon be included.
"It is a sacred obligation," says the Golden Hill Paugussett Chief, Big Eagle. "Indian people must keep their languages alive. If the language is not spoken, it must be made to live again."

HEADLINE: A Grand River Widens Its Circle of Friends

BYLINE: By ROBERT DUBROW 

 BODY:
THE 410-mile Connecticut River was recently designated an American Heritage River under a Clinton Administration initiative. The designation should give a boost to as many as 29 projects in natural resource and environmental protection as well as in economic revitalization, historic and cultural preservation.
The river, the longest in New England, begins in a tiny pond at the northern tip of New Hampshire and flows southward to serve as the Vermont-New Hampshire border. It traverses western Massachusetts then enters Connecticut. Bisecting the state, it flows past Windsor Locks, Hartford, East Hartford, Middletown, East Haddam and Essex, among others. Then it joins Long Island Sound at Old Saybrook and Old Lyme, providing an estimated 70 percent of the Sound's fresh water. The American Heritage Rivers Initiative was created to help communities use Federal programs better. "It's really the people who live and work in a particular place who understand what they need," said Whitty Sanford, of the Connecticut River Watershed Council. "We're the ones that are making the decisions and directing this." 
 Each sponsor of the river's successful nomination will be involved in some aspect of the action plan submitted with the nomination. Ms. Sanford said that "some projects are quite new and others have been in the works for quite some time but need to have specific assistance from Federal agencies."
The No. 1 issue facing the river in the state is urban sprawl, said Tom Maloney, of the watershed council. One project in the plan aims to protect prime agricultural soil, groundwater, floodplain habitats and the rural character of the river valley north of Hartford, said Mr. Maloney. The worry is, he said, that "malls, the strip developments are taking over. It's basically a planning issue; we're going to work to craft some planning strategies for the communities, hopefully, to implement on their own." Riverfront revitalization projects in Hartford, East Hartford and Middletown should also help contain urban sprawl, Mr. Maloney said. "There are terrific opportunities to focus attention on the livability of our cities and their connection to the river," he said.
Restoring pedestrian access to the river in Hartford and East Hartford as well as creating parks and recreational centers has been the work of an organization called Riverfront Recapture for 17 years, said Joe Marfuggi, the group's president.
Though much of the work is finished, slated for completion by next summer are a landscaped plaza over Interstate 91 connecting downtown Hartford with the river as well as grassy terraces at the river's edge, a stage at the base of the terraces, a bulkhead for excursion boats and water taxis serving downtown Hartford, and a new pedestrian promenade on Founder's Bridge.
Riverfront Recapture has worked to bring in visitors to spend time and money, mainly through major sporting events, including a professional bass fishing tournament, the United States Rowing Association's national convention and a triathlon with 1,100 competitors that included swimming in the river. "These kinds of events have an economic impact and depend upon a clean and healthy river to succeed," Mr. Marfuggi said.
Middletown's restoration effort includes Harborpark, a small park, said James Sipperly, a planner for the city.
But, he explained, access to Harborpark is difficult because Route 9 lies between the downtown business district and the river.
A pedestrian plaza over Route 9, reconfiguration of Route 9, and renovation of a pedestrian tunnel underneath the highway are the access options being considered. There are also plans to expand Harborpark, to develop additional areas for walking, picnicking, fishing, biking and boating, as well as to improve water quality.
Combined storm and sanitary sewer overflow and polluted runoff, Mr. Maloney said , are the river's two major water quality problems. As well-drained soil is replaced with pavement, rooftops and storm drains, he said, "everything just washes down into the river."
Road sand and salt, sedimentation and erosion from construction sites, motor oil, metals and animal waste are ingredients of the runoff.
In older cities, where storm sewers are connected to sanitary sewers, raw sewage in combination with a significant rainfall is a serious problem.
Mr. Maloney explained that "you get a big pulse, millions of gallons of water coming in with all that sanitary sewage and overwhelming the sewage treatment facilities. Any one of those August thunder storms that everybody loves will cause a combined sewer overflow event."
The Metropolitan District Commission in Hartford is now planning the second phase of its program to cope with such overflows, said Neil Geldof, director of engineering and planning. The city invested $80 million the first phase; strategies have included separating storm sewers from sanitary sewers and expanding and upgrading the sewage treatment plant.
But Connecticut needs the help of Massachusetts, where the Springfield area, just north of the state line, requires almost $400 million, officials estimate, to fix its combined sewer overflow problem.
"It's not good for the river in Connecticut," said Mr. Maloney. "It's probably the major upstream impact." A Connecticut-Massachusetts coalition is working to get a Federal budget appropriation for the clean-up.
Additional projects include one to restore fish that spend their lives at sea and return to fresh water to spawn, another to inventory river bank erosion, and a process to determine whether the four-state Connecticut River valley should be designated a National Heritage area by the National Park Service (the last would be in order to better manage the historical and cultural resources of the valley).
One of the benefits of the American Heritage River designation is communities in the four-state watershed coming "to understand that when somebody does something up river, it has an impact down river," said Mr. Marfuggi.
"We also have to understand the importance of the diversity of the communities on the river.
"By creating this group that will be working together, we'll improve that kind of understanding."

HEADLINE: The Ties That Bind: Thinking Globally At the Local Level

BYLINE: By DIANE NOTTLE 

 BODY:
DOES Margate, England, have an elephant?
Do tigers roam the streets of Colmar, France? 
 Do rock stars play outdoor concerts under the stars at an amphitheater in Zhejiang Province, China?
Well, no, to all of the above. Even so, these communities have some common threads with Margate, Princeton and Holmdel, respectively.
Margate, England, is a seaside resort at the end of the Thames estuary 15 miles northeast of Canterbury; a few years ago the mayor of Margate, N.J., paid a visit, bearing gifts of T-shirts and a proclamation of friendship. Colmar, in the Alsatian lowland near the German border, has no university, but it does have a music school and an art museum, a dedication to historic preservation and some sense of being a barrel tapped at both ends. Zhejiang County may not have a PNC Bank Arts Center, but it is a coastal province near China's largest city, Shanghai; nicknamed "Land of Fish and Rice" and "Home of Silk and Tea," it may be China's answer to the Garden State.
It is hardly surprising that New Jersey, with a population that is nearly one-eighth immigrant and a wealth of companies and educational institutions, has extensive international connections that bring the state a rich array of economic and cultural benefits.
Foreign consulates are usually in major cities like New York and Philadelphia, but New Jersey has several. Portugal, for example, has a consulate in Newark near the heavily Portuguese Ironbound district; Ecuador has one in Jersey City; Italy has vice-consulates in Newark and Trenton. And this year, the French consul general in New York City appointed an honorary consul for New Jersey: Caroline Lareuse of Princeton, one of 38 honorary French consuls throughout the country named with the blessing of the State Department.
Mrs. Lareuse, who is married to a Frenchman, holds dual citizenship and has long been active in many Franco-American activities, exemplifies the kind of personal ties that have developed through programs that let public officials and private citizens reach out to people around the world.
One such program is Sister Cities International, a Washington-based independent nonprofit organization founded in 1951 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. "His idea was that if people would interact with other ordinary people, it would create an international understanding that would someday bring world peace," said Jane L. Tublin, director of international programs in New Brunswick's Department of Economic Development, who is on the board of Sister Cities International. The organization has linked 1,200 communities in the United States to 2,100 partners in 125 countries.
Currently, more than a dozen communities in the state are participating, and the New Jersey League of Municipalities plans to meet with Sister Cities International next month to establish more relationships abroad. Some communities have several siblings: New Brunswick and Elizabeth have three each; Montclair and Newark have four.
This weekend, officials from Jersey City and Princeton are leaving on trips to their sister cities in Europe. And communities here welcome visitors from abroad -- everyone from the 29 Austrian high school students who arrived in Montclair last week to the three young white tigers in residence at Cohanzick Zoo in Bridgeton, on loan from the Parken Zoo in Bridgeton's sister city, Eskilstuna, Sweden.
 New Brunswick's ties to Japan -- where it has two sister cities, Fukui, northeast of Kyoto, and Tsuruoka, about 200 miles north of Tokyo -- are especially strong and venerable. In 1867, Kusakabe Taro of Fukui came to America to study English and enrolled at the school that would become Rutgers University. The first Japanese member of Phi Beta Kappa, he finished his studies in just three years, but he died just before graduation and was buried in Willow Grove cemetery. Takagi Saburo of Tsuruoka, like Kusakabe a son of the samurai class, followed him to New Brunswick; he was later a member of the Japanese consulates in New York and San Francisco.
They were only the first of about 500 Japanese who passed through New Brunswick in the late 19th century, Ms. Tublin said. Those ties were rediscovered by Dr. Ardath W. Burks of Basking Ridge, professor emeritus of Asian studies at Rutgers, when he traveled to Japan in the 1950's on a Fulbright Fellowship.
Today, the partnerships are primarily cultural and educational. Each year, New Brunswick and Fukui exchange student artwork for exhibition; here, the art has been shown at schools, the public library and the Bristol-Myers Squibb company. In August, a delegation of 65 visited, including the 45-member Fukui Soave Children's Choir, who performed at the McKinley School en route to Brazil. Tsuruoka sends students to New Brunswick for two weeks each summer, and New Brunswick has now sent two teachers there for two-year assignments.
Because of the large Hungarian population, New Brunswick also began a sister-city relationship with Debrecan, Hungary, in 1987. Debrecen, 120 miles east of Budapest, was selected from a list of five cities profiled for common factors. "It has two teaching hospitals, a medical school, an important museum and a university that was very much related to Rutgers, although it's much smaller," Ms. Tublin said. "And the biggest industry is pharmaceuticals. For all these reasons, it looked like a perfect match." Programs so far have included Trade 2000, a conference to promote business partnerships at the World Trade Center in Manhattan last October; "Healthy Families Healthy Children," in which doctors examined issues like immunization and nutrition, and an exchange of folk dance troupes.
And now, a committee of about 25 is working with Irish Sister Cities Committee to form a third sister-city relationship, with Limerick.
 
JERSEY CITY
Bagpipes in Spain: A Cultural Triangle
The Irish are also becoming involved in a three-way relationship with Jersey City and Oviedo, Spain, thanks to Jose Arango, a senior adviser to Mayor Bret Schundler.
Oviedo, the capital of Asturias province on the Bay of Biscay in northwestern Spain, with a population of about 200,000, already had an American sister city, Orlando, Fla. But Mr. Arango is a native son, more or less. Born in Cuba of parents from Asturias, he moved to Oviedo with them when he was 7 and lived there until the family came to West New York in 1973 for six months when he was 17. Those six months have stretched to 25 years in New Jersey.
He called on a friend -- "we played soccer together in Spain" -- whose father is the chief of protocol in Oviedo. When Oviedo's Mayor, Gabino de Lorenzo, came over to visit Orlando in February, he traveled via New York and stopped by Jersey City.
Mr. Arango describes Oviedo, a city of 275,000, as "a beautiful town, surrounded by mountains." Its university is among the oldest in Europe, and the city also has a medical school and a Gothic cathedral.
Asturias has a strong Celtic tradition, being in the region where one of the seven Celtic tribes migrated before the time of Christ, Mr. Arango said. "In the northern region, they have bagpipes," he said. "All the food is based on potatoes and fish and cabbage. If they send their kids to learn English, they send them to Dublin. There's the Catholic tradition. And Spain is still fighting the English influence in Gibraltar."
Since Jersey City also has a large Irish population, Mr. Arango is now working to involve the County of Dublin, too. This weekend he is leaving on a trip to Madrid, Toledo and Oviedo. "Part of the delegation is Irish people in the administration because they understand right away," Mr. Arango said.
With a population that is about 35 percent Hispanic, Jersey City also has sister cities in Puerto Rico, Peru and the Dominican Republic -- all former colonies of Spain. "There's always that hate-love relationship with Spain," Mr. Arango said. "But the bottom line is, they feel proud. We all got some part of the culture from there."
And in September, during Hispanic Heritage Month, "we had a visitor from Barcelona," Mr. Arango said. "Now, everybody wants to come to Jersey City."
 
MONTCLAIR
A Provider of Hope In Hard Times
Montclair is the twin city (the British term) of Barnet, England; the Schwesterbezirk of Graz, Austria's second largest city; the goroda pobratimy (brother city) of Cherepovets, Russia, and the ciudad hermana of Laguna de Perlas, Nicaragua.
Barnet has a Montclair Park, where New Jersey irises have been planted, and Montclair has a Graz Park. Cherepovets has named a street for its sister city -- "the only street in town with freestanding two-family homes" in a nation of large apartment blocks, said Linda Wanat, Montclair's municipal clerk. In 1992, when Austria celebrated the 500th anniversary of the Columbus's voyage to America, the United States was represented by a display of American Indian art from the Montclair Art Museum.
The relationships with Barnet and Graz are approaching their 50th anniversaries, said Ms. Wanat, who coordinates the sister city programs endorsed by the town. Each is run by a volunteer committee and financed through donations, and each grew out of humanitarian aid.
Friends of Barnet was officially founded in 1949, but the towns' relationship actually dates to World War II, when the mayor's wife, Helen Barrett Speers, headed a committee to evacuate English children to Montclair. Fifty-two came over from Barnet, a borough of London, and a longstanding friendship was born. In 1994, for the 45th anniversary of Friends of Barnet, twin plaques showing parades of English and American schoolchildren were placed in the two towns' municipal buildings.
Overseas Neighbors, the group in touch with Graz, began sending medical supplies and Care packages to Austria "even before the Marshall Plan," said its president, Juliana Belcsak. "The initiative has always been people to people," she added. "We try to stay away from politics as much as possible. "
Mrs. Belcsak simply laughed when she was asked how many foreign visitors she had housed. "It's uncountable at this point," she said. "Sometimes we have entire delegations coming."
Humanitarian aid continues, in new forms: Montclair has sent food and medical supplies like insulin to Cherepovets since their relationship began in 1990, and medical supplies and books to Laguna de Perlas. So does the parade of children in need of help. At least four children from Cherepovets have come to New Jersey for life-saving medical treatment through the Rotary Club that Montclair helped establish there. "When they come, they're really deadly ill; there's no hope for them," Mrs. Belcsak said. "We're pleased to send them back in first-class shape."
What does Montclair, an affluent suburb of 38,000, have in common with Cherepovets, a heavily polluted industrial city of 350,000 that produces mainly steel and fertilizer? "A lot," Ms. Wanat said. When she visited Cherepovets, she was given "a very formal tour" before she asked if she could just sit down and talk with some local women. "I didn't want the tour for the visiting fireman," she said. "I wanted to really get to talk to the people. Once I made that clear, we stopped doing all the ceremonial things, and they let us talk directly with the people we wanted to meet.
"In the middle of this conversation, I realized we had everything in common. One woman's son was a star football player. He didn't want to go to college; he just wanted to be a pro. Another was bemoaning that her family had a small apartment and her mother-in-law had come to live with them. I saw them reflected in my life and my friends. They're the same as we are. They have the same desire for peace, for financial security. What I loved was, when they invited us in, they gave us the very best they had to offer. And sometimes that wasn't much."
 
HOLMDEL
A Partnership In Progress
David Chai, the deputy mayor of Holmdel, has long been a human bridge between Eastern and Western cultures. Born in Nanking "before Japan invaded China" in 1937, he attended high school in Japan for six years before coming to the United States in 1955. "But I still have some memory of the old country and speak the language," he said. "It's been quite helpful."
Helpful, that is, in his work to establish a sister-city relationship between Holmdel and Zhejiang Province, following up on an effort in 1981, under Gov. Brendan Byrne, to make Zhejiang Province into New Jersey's sister state.
Zhejiang province, south of Shanghai on the Yangtze River an the East China Sea, is "a coastal state very much like New Jersey," Mr. Chai said. "It's like us in that it's next to a major financial and metropolitan area. Geographically, it's very similar to us. It's about five times the size and five times the population, so it has a similar density. To think of any city or province in China, it's usually a lot denser than anywhere here. And economically, we have a number of coastal industries -- fisheries, shipbuilding, export-oriented businesses." He is coordinating efforts with the state Department of Commerce to promote trade, noting that Governor Whitman was planning to visit Zhejiang Province on her trip to Asia next year. "There's quite a bit of excitement over that," he said.
 
PRINCETON
All the World's A Stage
Not all international relationships involve governments. This year, the McCarter Theater in Princeton established a partnership with the Market Theater in Johannesburg, recognized worldwide for its challenges to racism in the apartheid era.
In May, Athol Fugard, the renowned South African playwright, actor and director, brought the Market Theater's production of his latest play, "The Captain's Tiger," for its American premiere, to close the McCarter's season. In exchange, the McCarter sent "Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years," written by its artistic director, Emily Mann, to Johannesburg in July for a four-week run.
"It was a huge success, both critically and in audience response" said Jeffrey Woodward, the McCarter's managing director, who was among the delegation that traveled to Johannesburg.
"Having Our Say," the story of two centenarian black sisters, is "very much a play about American history," Mr. Woodward said, "but the issues of race and overcoming discrimination are, of course, resonant in South Africa, so the response was quite loud and moving."
Although the McCarter and the Market have no firm plans for another project, Mr. Woodward met with John Kani, a longtime collaborator of Mr. Fugard's who now heads the Market Theater, when Mr. Kani lectured in Princeton this month. In the meantime, the McCarter extended its hands across the ocean once again for this season's first play, "Electra," produced in association with the acclaimed Donmar Warehouse in London starring the British actress Zoe Wanamaker.
The McCarter's hometown has had an especially rewarding relationship with Colmar, its partner in France, said Mayor Marvin R. Reed. "It's one of the nicest places, and that's what they say about Princeton; that's why we get along so well," Mr. Reed said. Situated in the center of Alsace just west of the German border, Colmar, which dates to medieval times, is considerably larger than Princeton, with a population of about 65,000. "But because of its location between Strasbourg and Mulhouse, it has somewhat the same flavor we have, being between New York and Philadelphia," Mr. Reed said.
Residents of Princeton and Colmar have been "going back and forth for the last 12 years," the mayor said. Those trips have included offical visits by elected officials; exchanges of groups ranging from youth soccer teams to musical groups (the American Boychoir and the Westminster Choir have performed in Colmar), and business trips to discuss investment possibilities. In April, Mayor Reed is expecting a delegation of public utility officials -- covering gas, water, electricity, cable television and Internet access -- from the Colmar area.
The Mayor himself is leaving for Colmar today with a group of 30 from the Princeton Arts Council on an art-and-architecture tour that also includes Strasbourg and Basel, Switzerland. While in town, he may want to stop in at Princeton News, a stationery store, or Princeton Coiffeuses for a haircut. Its owner once spent time at a salon in Princeton, teaching the staff the art of French braiding, Mayor Reed said, and later the owner's daughter paid a return visit to Colmar.
The French may also come to Princeton for the services of Mrs. Lareuse, the French honorary consul. She could not estimate how many French citizens might constitute her client base; "they don't all matriculate at the French consulate," she said. But with about 100 French companies doing business in New Jersey, the number is probably considerable.
Her duties include "almost anything that comes your way," she said. She helps French families living here for extended periods place their children in schools; assists with passports, visas and other paperwork, and, in best diplomatic tradition, attends receptions at the consulate in Manhattan. She works a flexible schedule, for which she is paid "a very small stipend."
As for Colmar, "it's a charming city, with beautiful architecture, beautiful restaurants and excellent vineyards," she said. She should know; she has a family tie. During World War I, her uncle served there as a liaison between the French and American armies and eventually rode in the victory parade through the streets of what is now her hometown's sister city.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property;
Vornado's Chairman on Why Its Gusts Have Abated

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
STEVEN ROTH, the chairman of Vornado Realty Trust, hit New York's office market like a whirlwind last year, buying Bernard Mendik's portfolio of 4 million square feet of Manhattan properties for $650 million as the Mendik Company was preparing to become the city's first real estate investment trust.
The deal came as a surprise, because Vornado was best known as the operator of suburban shopping centers. 
 But having decided to move into the Manhattan office market, Mr. Roth went on a tear, spending an additional $1.7 billion to acquire such properties as the building known as One Penn Plaza, which occupies most of the block bounded by 33d and 34th Streets and Seventh and Eighth Avenues.
In all, Vornado bought all or the large majority of the ownership positions in 20 buildings in the city including most of the buildings on both sides of Seventh Avenue between 31st and 34th Streets. The company has said it plans to transform the area into the urban equivalent of entertainment-oriented shopping mall, with Macy's at 34th Street and Penn Station-Madison Square Garden complex serving as anchors.
But lately, Mr. Roth has been less active. Since announcing an agreement to acquire the 1 million-square-foot building at 770 Broadway at Eighth Street and a smaller structure in June, little news has flowed from Vornado's headquarters in Saddle Brook, N.J. Last week, the company did announce that Mr. Mendik, who had been co-chairman of Vornado, had resigned to pursue private interests and said that it had acquired some property from Mr. Mendik's partners for $104 million.
Some real estate executives have speculated that the steep decline in the price of Vornado's stock (the name comes from a fan company taken over by Mr. Roth's predecessor as a tax shelter) have made it impossible for the company to issue operating partnership units, which eventually convert into common stock, to pay for properties.
Vornado's stock, which reached almost $50 a share earlier this year, has been trading recently in the vicinity of $30 a share. Most REIT industry shares have, of course, taken a pounding in the stock market in recent months. The argument is that if a REIT meets an owner's price with the devalued stock, it will be perceived to have overpaid if the stock price rises to what the REIT managers consider a "normal" level.
Mr. Roth does not appear much in public. Indeed, he proclaims in Vornado's annual report that "we will continue our policy of almost never talking to the press."
But Mr. Roth did appear at a recent state-of-the-market meeting organized by Insignia/ESG, the current corporate form of the old Edward S. Gordon Company.
At that meeting, Mr. Roth conceded that his company's acquisition pace had slowed considerably in recent months. But he said that the ability to pay was not an issue because the company had over $1 billion available to finance purchases.
The reason, he said, is that owners' expectation of what their properties are worth have become overly inflated.
"We have just gone through a period of participating at auctions held by institutions," he said, "and we have been coming in third and fourth. The pricing is wrong. That is why we have not bought a building in six or seven months."
In spite of the big numbers involved in the company's entry to the Manhattan office market, he said, Vornado's cost basis for its buildings is $175 a square foot in a market where new construction costs from $400 to $450 a square foot. Noting that many of the properties were occupied by tenants with rents below the current market rate, he said that the company would be supplied with increasing cash as the leases expired and rents moved up toward market levels. "We have $30 space in a $40 market," he said.
As the rents roll over, he said, they will add $130 million a year to Vornado's cash flow over the next 10 years.
Mr. Roth said the suspicion that some aggressive buyers overpaid for property was reflected in the capital markets. In the early 1980's, he said, interest rates were high, but lenders were willing to finance all of an acquisition. "You could borrow 105 percent of a piece of real estate," he said.
HE said that rates had generally declined from that period until now, but that lenders were willing to finance only a smaller part of a deal. "The rates are low, but you can't borrow more than 60 percent of the cost of an asset," Mr. Roth said. "My theory is that the lenders suspect that the value of the buildings will go down."
Mr. Roth described the debt markets as being "in chaos," apparently referring to the market for commercial mortgage backed securities, where as much as $20 billion in loans has piled up awaiting sale. He said the lack of debt financing would choke off a lot of new building.
As a result, he told the group of real estate brokers and executives, in a time of economic uncertainty caused largely by events in Asia and other overseas markets, , " for the first time real estate's not the bad guys."
"Most people have a stunningly reasonable amount of debt," he said, "and there are almost no defaults in real estate."
In the late 1980's, the recession was preceded by a wave of real estate development, particularly in Manhattan. As a result, many developers could not fill their properties with tenants at rental rates anticipated in their financial projections. Some defaulted, losing the buildings to lenders, who absorbed losses when they were sold.
Of course, tough times can also provide buying opportunities, Mr. Roth noted. That's what he did in 1980, gaining control of Vornado and its valuable real estate, as the Two Guys retail chain the company was then operating faded. He repeated the trick later in the decade, taking control of Alexander's Inc. and its real estate as the retail operations became unprofitable.
Although Vornado has extensive exposure to the retail market, with 59 shopping centers with 12.4 million square feet of space as of the end of last year, Mr. Roth said he "lost faith in retail as an investment in the mid-1990's."
"The retail market is saturated and the retailers are mature and non-differentiated," he told the real estate group. "They are all selling the same products. Retail is going to get murdered in the next recession."
Although best known for its shopping centers and, more recently, for its incursion into Manhattan, Vornado is a broadly diversified company. Mr. Roth said he seeks to invest in "fortress" or "franchise" properties whose very size or unique position in an industry protects them from competition.
One example, he said, is the company's 60 percent interest in Americold Logistics, which operates 80 refrigerated warehouses, with 394 million cubic feet of space. The company accounts for 25 percent of the refrigerated public warehouse space in the country and Mr. Roth said anyone buying a frozen turkey in this area was getting a bird that probably spent some time in one of those warehouses.
Another is the Merchandise Mart in Chicago, a 5.4-million-square-foot building that Vornado bought in April for $630 million. Mr. Roth said the facility was the major trade show building for the furniture industry and that 65 percent of all the contracts for office furniture are signed there annually.
Mr. Roth may have something similar in mind for the fortress he has assembled along Seventh Avenue in the Penn Station area. The properties, which include the 1,700-room Hotel Pennsylvania, had largely been individually owned. Mr. Roth had remarked in a previous interview that "there is a lot you can do when ownership is concentrated in one strong hand."
He told the real estate group that he expected the trend toward public ownership of real estate to continue, but at slower rate than that of the last few years because of the dip in REIT stock prices and unavailability of public capital. Because REIT's are required to pay out 95 percent of their income to shareholders in dividends, they have little in the way of retained earnings and must return to public markets to finance growth.
Mr. Roth said that real estate companies considering adopting the REIT structure would just have to accept the fact that stock prices fluctuate in unpredictable ways. "Our stock dived six months ago when the business was never better," he said.
He said that there was at least one way in which running a public company was not that much different from the family-controlled real estate companies, which are a hallmark of New York real estate.
"Public companies have to deal with analysts and family companies have to deal with cousins," Mr. Roth said. "And they are both pains."

HEADLINE: THE RIGHT THING;
In Dismissals, Silence Has Its Perils

BYLINE: By JEFFREY L. SEGLIN; Jeffrey L. Seglin is a visiting fellow at Harvard University's Center for the Study of Values in Public Life. His column on business ethics will appear the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: righthng@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
YOU walk into the office, and as the day goes on you realize that the guy who sat in the cubicle next to you for years isn't there. It's not just that he hasn't come in to work. There is no trace of him. The family pictures, the plants, the cartoons he liked to clip and post are simply gone. Office scuttlebutt has it that he has been dismissed. But there is no official word: no memo, no department E-mail.
Welcome to the modern workplace, where companies are so concerned about wrongful-termination suits that silence often replaces honest communication. Most managers with power to dismiss have faced the problem:whether to let people know why a colleague has been let go or to lie low. 
 A consequence of the first option is obvious: the risk of being sued for what may be seen as defamation. A consequence of the second may be subtler, but no less serious: creating a climate of fear and being labeled a boss who does not level with the staff.
Who can blame companies for choosing the silent route? In 1997 alone, more than 50,000 wrongful-termination suits were filed in state and Federal courts, according to Edgewater Holdings, an insurer in Chicago.
"The upshot is you get a workplace where the law has made speech dangerous," said Walter K. Olson, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and author of "The Excuse Factory: How Employment Law is Paralyzing the American Workplace" (Free Press, 1997).
One casualty on this battlefield was Paul J. McCarthy, dismissed in January 1994 by a Rochester division of Unisource Worldwide, a big marketer of paper and packaging systems. Mr. McCarthy had sold the unit's packaging machinery for almost four years. Unisource bought the company midway through his tenure. After initially being given no explanation for his dismissal, he said, he later was told he failed to meet "performance related criteria."
Mr. McCarthy contends that he was dismissed because he told supervisors about conduct by a fellow employee that had put a Unisource vendor at a significant safety risk by taking him to a bad neighborhood. The vendor confirms that account, but did not report the incident to Unisource and declined to be identified.
"We sold over $1 million worth of product through his company," the vendor said. "I didn't want to risk losing the business." But he did tell Mr. McCarthy, who was a friend. "He went ballistic on it," the vendor said. "Paul's a pretty righteous person."
 MR. McCARTHY reported the incident to a regional vice president. The vice president told Mr. McCarthy's boss to dismiss him, according to Mr. McCarthy and others involved.
Mr. McCarthy, 39 at the time, was not part of a "protected class," like members of a minority group or older workers, that can sue over a retaliatory dismissal, if that is what occurred. Given New York law's adherence to the notion of "employment at will," Unisource did not need to give a reason for dismissing him.
Patrick Farris, senior counsel at Unisource Worldwide's headquarters in Berwyn, Pa., said, "The company is very comfortable with the decision that it made with respect to his termination."
If there is no legal issue, where is the ethical problem? It's simple. Fear of being sued has led to a situation in which people treat one another badly. They don't talk, or they talk but don't say anything. But this may backfire, said Mary Dollarhide, a management lawyer. Consider a situation, she said, in which a worker in a protected class has been "a lousy performer," and there has been no employer discrimination. "You don't counsel them because you're afraid you're going to get stuck with some bogus lawsuit having to do with their protected status," she said. "When things deteriorate to where you have to fire this person, you're going to end up with an empty personnel file without a lick of evidence that anything was ever wrong."
Not a lot of winners in that picture.

HEADLINE: NEW YORKERS & CO.;
Between the Lines of the Yellow Pages

BYLINE: By MARCIA BIEDERMAN 

 BODY:
IF you want to know which New York businesses are going where, you can find out fast in the Yellow Pages. The new editions landing on doorsteps in parts of the city this month are not much thicker than those of five years ago, but some categories have expanded greatly, while others have shrunk.
Measured by number of listings, which are given free to all business telephone customers, as well as advertisements, the Yellow Pages reveal that auto rental agencies are up in all five boroughs, while florists are down. In three boroughs, the self-storage category is a top gainer, while the podiatrist presence is declining. 
 These shifts can show not only which zones are cold and which are hot in the city's commercial terrain, but also how local businesses are buffeted by stronger economic winds, like the move to managed care.
New national trends often show up first in the New York books, said Mary Jo Howe, vice president for marketing for Bell Atlantic Yellow Pages. For example, she said, the Internet heading was introduced in 1996, "far earlier" than elsewhere.
But the Yellow Pages are not a flawless reflection of the city's economy. An extraterrestrial presented with the five-volume set might conclude that New York has a locksmith, plastic surgeon and escort service on every corner, and that ambulances roar ceaselessly down its streets, hotly pursued by lawyers. But the restaurant and financial services industries, two giant sectors in real life, seem puny.
The Yellow Pages greatly magnifies the presence of a special set of retailers: those that are needed only occasionally.
"The Yellow Pages is so important for formal wear because it's not like a deli or a cleaner," said Marshal Dutko, owner of Baldwin Formals and Harrison Formalwear. "It's an infrequent use."
Still, the economic picture drawn by the Yellow Pages is often accurate. Bus charters and rentals are a top growth heading in every borough but Manhattan, for example, and those industries have been energized by the growing ranks of road-ready older New Yorkers and the success of gambling casinos in Atlantic City and eastern Connecticut.
Indeed, the industry is now fiercely competitive, said Steven Meyerson, director of operations for Muller Tours in Brooklyn.
"There are a lot of mom-and-pops" and intense price rivalry, said Mr. Meyerson, whose eight-year-old company ferries a lot of elderly people to casinos and theaters.
The number of bus companies has resulted in "so much price-gouging that you can't earn a living," said John J. LoCasto, owner of Ultra Express Coach on Staten Island. That, he said, is why he focuses on the market's less competitive higher end. Some years ago, he replaced his standard buses with smaller ones equipped with couches, wet bars and card tables. His Yellow Pages ad dubs the vehicle "the bus that thinks it's a limousine."
Other businesses that have a bigger presence in the Yellow Pages have also undergone strong growth. The self-storage industry, a top gainer in the pages, has grown rapidly during the last five years: from 1993 to 1995, its nationwide revenues rose 20 percent. Car-rental companies occupy more Yellow Pages space, too, and understandably so: each summer weekend, 10,000 vehicles are rented in New York.
In contrast, florists are scarcer in the Yellow Pages than they used to be. Peter J. Moran, executive vice president of the Society of American Florists, cited a likely reason: would-be florists are deterred by the prospect of long hours and relatively low profit margins. "We see fewer shops opening than in the past," he said.
An 800-pound gorilla or two, in the form of direct marketers like 1-800-FLOWERS and wire services like FTD, may be scaring them away. Tony Bonello, who owns two Tony's Greenery florist shops in Manhattan and one in Queens, has a half-page ad in the 1997 Manhattan Yellow Pages. It is, he said, one prong in his defense against these big floral companies, which have captured much of the business. As these big rivals bear down, Mr. Bonello has also invested in a new canopy for one of his stores and set up both a Web site and a toll-free number.
Some shifts in the Yellow Pages signal other forces, like changes in health-care economics. The podiatrist category is declining in the Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn directories, for example, but not because people have fewer foot problems.
Dr. Hiram Chirel, executive director of the New York State Podiatric Medical Association, blames health maintenance organizations, which refer people to approved providers, so "patients are not as attracted by the Yellow Pages ads as they used to be." And since H.M.O. reimbursements tend to be less than the usual office fees, podiatrists have less money for ads, he said.
But why is there an increase in the veterinarian category in the Bronx and Staten Island, but not the other boroughs? The answer may be that those other boroughs are becoming saturated with these professionals. That is why Dr. Stephen Katz opened the Concourse Animal Hospital in the Bronx three years ago. He hoped the competition would be lighter.
The competition has been less intense, Dr. Katz said. Pit bulls are virtually the only animals he sees, he said, with about 12,000 of them on his active client list.
But "you open here, you pay a high price," he said. He performs few procedures on the animals other than giving shots because his clients are so poor.
"It's an emotional heartbreak," Dr. Katz said, "the number of people I have to turn away who have sick animals."
But New York's Yellow Pages has cheerful stories, too, even among the shrinking categories. Ms. Howe of Bell Atlantic said typewriters have disappeared from Yellow Pages elsewhere, but such marginal businesses die hardest in New York "because there are still enough folks doing it." One survivor is Lester Williams, a technician at Gramercy Typewriter Company.
"We still have plenty of work," said Mr. Williams, half of a two-person repair operation that also sells reconditioned electric typewriters. The machines are still used for forms and envelopes, he said, and some writers prefer them to computers because they "like to hear the keys striking as they're thinking." He said he personally repaired the typewriters of Gail Sheehy and David Mamet on his old job at Midtown Typewriter. That company, however, is out of business.

Despite Fed's Rate Cuts, Dangers Remain

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
O.K, the Federal Reserve may have been stingy when it cut its short-term interest rate target by only a quarter of a percentage point at its last policy meeting Sept. 29. But on Thursday, just 16 days later, it more than made up for that, slicing off another quarter point. As if to add emphasis to the central bank's message that it is alert to the world's financial problems -- especially that of its banks -- this cut came in between the regularly scheduled meetings of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
Investors were ecstatic. After the afternoon announcement from the Fed, it took the Dow Jones industrial average less than 45 minutes to surge nearly 300 points. The rally continued Friday. 
 And more upbeat news is on its way. The odds are good for more reductions by the Fed in its short-term interest rate target, the Federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks. After the last two moves, the Fed funds rate is now 5 percent. But by March, investors are expecting that rate to drop to an average of 4.23 percent, based on the current price for the March Fed funds futures contract.
All this is positive. But the signs of world financial distress still abound. Japan is working on banking reform, but its economy is still a mess. Congress has approved more money for the International Monetary Fund, but the United States and its allies still need to agree on new rescue strategies for the I.M.F. And there are many Wall Street firms and banks that still have big bets on bonds and other investments that have -- or can -- go sour.
These problems are reflected in the spreads -- the difference between the yields on United States Treasury securities and other bonds, like corporate, mortgage, junk or emerging market. These spreads have surged since the Russian debt crisis. And although they have come down some, they are still quite high.
As of Thursday, the yield on emerging markets bonds was 12.22 percentage points above comparable Treasury maturities, according to a J. P. Morgan index of emerging market bonds. That was down from a high of 17.05 percentage points on Sept. 10 but still twice the 6 percentage point spread in July.
The spread for American junk bonds, according to a Merrill Lynch monthly index, was at 5.73 percentage points at the end of last month, more than 2 percentage points higher than in June. The spread for investment grade corporate debt was at 1.70 percentage points, higher than it was during the 1990-91 recession.
The danger is clear. At these levels, interest rates are strangling the flow of credit to corporations and countries, which cannot afford to borrow. And if banks reduce their risk-taking and curtail their lending, the economy will slow sharply, and could even fall into a recession.
The spreads reflect two different worries, said Michael Rosenberg, head of international fixed-income research at Merrill Lynch. "There is the worry of increased default and a recession coming," he said. "Also, there is the worry that a significant part of the investment community may still be leveraged and has to sell."
Maureen Allyn, the chief economist at Scudder Kemper Investments, added: "The new risk is that markets are in control of who gets credit and who doesn't." And that may mean so much control has been turned over to the markets that authorities -- like the Fed -- "do not have the levers to do what they need to do."
That is why these spreads are an important monitor for investors. Until they shrink back to more normal levels, the chances of an economic slowdown will be much greater. And until they shrink, there will still be a good chance that hedge funds, like Long-Term Capital Management, and some Wall Street firms, as well, will face the kind of losses that, when reported, could trigger a selloff.
"There is no all-clear signal until spreads come in," Ms. Allyn said.

Art, Cars, TV's: If It's Asian, It's Cheaper

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

 BODY:
ASIAN stocks, bonds and real estate are not all that have been marked down for immediate clearance. From Hyundai's humble econoboxes to Honolulu's choicest penthouses, merchandise made, owned or offered by Asians is also priced to sell.
Just as big-time American corporations and financiers are swooping down on Asian owners desperate to sell their factories or companies, American consumers can practice some vulture investing of their own. 
 Why not start at the top? The top, that is, of One Waterfront Towers in Honolulu. A penthouse with 4,500 square feet of unfinished space, composed of half of the 43d, 44th and 45th floors, with a private elevator and unobstructed views of Honolulu Harbor and Diamond Head, can be had for $995,000. A Chinese investor paid $3 million in 1990. A bank took it over last year, initially offering it for $1.8 million, then $1.5 million, then $1.2 million. The condominium's furnished twin, which cost its owner $6 million in the early 1990's, is now on the market for $2 million.
More modest Hawaiian housing comes with sharp but less extreme discounts, as prices have fallen 10 percent to 15 percent in the last year. About a decade ago, the Japanese were buying up America's prime office towers and golf courses. It is still a matter of one group on the way down trying to sell to another on the way up. But these days, "The sellers are Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Korean and Indonesian," said Sachi S. Braden, a broker with Coldwell Banker Pacific Properties of Honolulu. "The buyers are from New York, California, Arizona, Nevada, places like that."
Asia's reversals have also made it cheaper for Americans to putter around in imported cars, especially those from South Korea. On average, the prices for 1999 Hyundai Motor models will be 4.8 percent below 1998's. The 1999 Elantra, a Hyundai compact made in Korea, will cost $11,499 when it goes on sale next month. Though the new model has a better engine and warranty, an otherwise similarly equipped 1998 model costs $12,493. The company attributes the gap to South Korea's weak currency and economy. (Japanese auto makers, more reluctant to offer outright price cuts, have relied on rebates and other discounts.)
The costs of Asian tourism have also come back down to earth, and then some. At the historic Savoy Homann Hotel in Bandung on Java, suites named for distinguished guests including Nehru of India, Nasser of Egypt and Indonesia's own Sukarno can be had for $65 a night (or less depending on whom you ask), compared with $149 about a year ago.
Asia's woes, and the advantages for Americans, can be contagious. Down in Australia, the currency has also taken such a beating that a Great Barrier Reef cruise, including afternoon tea, snorkel gear and a presentation by a marine biologist, is $76 today, from $105 last year. A ticket to the landmark Sydney Opera House, $48 then, is now $35.
Air fares and tours to Asia and Australia have likewise been discounted. Cathay Pacific's All-Asia passes allow a month of travel from Los Angeles, San Francisco or New York through Hong Kong to 17 other Asian cities for $899, hundreds of dollars less than the cheapest standard fares had been to many destinations. A five-night Hong Kong tour from Japan Orient, based in San Diego, is $900 to $1,100, compared with $1,300 to $1,600 last year.
 NOW might also be the time to buy that Oriental vase, painting or scroll. A fairly standard blue and white porcelain bottle decorated with a dragon dating from Korea's Choson Dynasty in the mid-19th century sold for $20,000 or more a year or two ago, said Sebastian Izzard, a Manhattan dealer. Now, he said, it would fetch no more than $5,000.
All but the best Japanese lacquerware, ceramics and paintings are off by half from the 1990 peak, a Christie's specialist said.
If classic Asian art is still unaffordable even at bargain prices, discounts on electronics may be the ticket. Department store prices for televisions and radios from Asia are down 5.7 percent for the year ended June, according to Ira Silver, chief economist for J. C. Penney. May Department Stores, whose chains include Filene's and Lord & Taylor, reports savings of as much as $10 on some shirts, sweaters and jackets.
Even the most basic commodities are on sale. Energy prices, for oil most of all, have fallen primarily because of reduced Asian demand. Money, as in other people's, has also become cheap, whether for home mortgages or other purposes. Slow growth abroad, and efforts by Japan and other nations to revive their economies by lowering interest rates, have helped lower the rates in the United States.
But as the saying goes, prices this good might not last. The discount sale on the yen abruptly ended early this month, as that currency soared against the dollar. It remains unclear how or when the yen's appreciation will increase the cost of some goods in the United States. As compensation, however, economic reversals that are spreading to Latin America appear likely to lower the cost of other goods, including clothing and fresh produce.
So American consumers have plenty to cheer, as long as the woes remain foreign.

HEADLINE: FIVE QUESTIONS WITH: HIROSHI OKUDA;
Black Belt in Market Share Becomes the Goal at Toyota

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
IN the three years he has been president of the Toyota Motor Corporation, Hiroshi Okuda has become known as much for his black belt in judo as for his outspoken views and aggressive moves to revitalize the once very conservative automobile maker that the stock market values as Japan's largest publicly traded company.
His efforts come at an especially trying time for Toyota. The Japanese domestic market, which it dominates, is mired in a long downturn, and the company's most important overseas market, the United States, is showing signs of stalling. 
 Interviewed in New York last week, Mr. Okuda sidestepped direct comment on the troubles of the Japanese economy or Government efforts to jump-start it, saying Toyota would pursue its goals regardless. But he said the prospect of tough times ahead has left him open to the idea of a strategic hook-up with an American partner. SHARON R. KING
 
Q. In light of Japan's economic problems, have you rethought your goal of achieving a 40 percent share of the auto market there?
A. Regardless of the size of the market, our plan to get to a 40 percent domestic market share hasn't changed. Our current share is 39 percent, and for the past two years we have almost gotten there. I still think we can reach 40 percent. But it is going to be difficult. It is best to set a target that you can very likely achieve, but is still difficult to achieve.
We can solve the problem by introducing new cars. We are probably introducing 12 to 13 different types of cars or vehicles a year. And at the same time, we are also scrapping the older, less successful models.
To do so will take a large investment of people and resources, but I think the company has the strength of resources to do it.
In the global market, we are making progress on our original goal of 10 percent, and we now have set a new goal of 15 percent by the year 2010.
 
Q. The automobile industry is consolidating in much of the world. Will we see further penetration of foreign ownership in the Japanese auto industry? Could a whole company be acquired?
A. That's something that I've been thinking about very much. I think that's quite possible, especially as other currencies strengthen. Although the yen has been strong recently, it has been weak for a long time, and, generally speaking, the stock prices of Japanese automobile companies are low. Therefore, it is possible that an American or other foreign company could acquire one of the weaker Japanese companies. I think that's something that the Japanese auto makers are concerned about, including Toyota.
 
Q. For Toyota, could you envision a partnership with an American company, or an American company buying Toyota?
A. I think there can be two different ways that could work. The first would be an equity acquisition. The second would be in the area of localized technical cooperation. In the manufacture of engines and transmissions, and to develop environmental technologies, we have to make huge capital investments, so cooperation and joint efforts would make sense. Toyota could either provide or procure technology.
 
Q. Your company also has an interest in being known as environmentally friendly. Does that goal correlate with some of the larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles that you now produce, like the Lexus line?
A. First, today's situation is transitional, as new technology replaces old. Second, we must still respond to regional customer tastes as much as possible. For example, in the United States, larger vehicles are more popular. So we work to make our products as clean and efficient as possible, regardless of size.
 
Q. In a country where executives are fairly conservative, you stand out. Do you see yourself as a role model?
A. I don't think so. Everyone is different. But what I can say about Toyota is that before I became president, the company was considered to be very conservative, so I have tried to make us more aggressive. I think our example will be followed by other companies. Companies are being less conservative and that means even more competition, so the more conservative executives might not be around in the future.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Week for Wishful Thinkers

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Has the stock market bear lumbered back into its cave? That is the way it looked this week as stocks roared following the Federal Reserve Board's surprise rate cut on Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week up 6.5 percent at 8,416.76.
One reason investors seem to have high hopes for stocks is that they have already suffered a major mauling in their portfolios. With the average New York Stock Exchange stock down 37.1 percent from its peak and the average Nasdaq stock down 50.5 percent, investors can be forgiven for hoping the worst is over now. 
 The only trouble is that while the Dow and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index are down about 10 percent and 11 percent, respectively, from their July highs, they remain high on an earnings-valuation basis. For example, the S.& P. carries a price-to-earnings ratio of more than 25.
Stocks also look rich over all when judged against the size of the national economy. At the market's peak earlier this year, the value of publicly traded stocks totaled some $11.7 trillion, more than 1.3 times the nation's gross domestic product. Recently, equities were valued at around 1.1 times G.D.P. Typically, according to Kenneth C. Grainger, an independent market strategist in New York and Montreal, stocks are valued at a discount to G.D.P., ranging from 35 percent to 82 percent of output.
When equities exceed those levels, red flags fly. At the end of 1989, for instance, as Japanese stocks neared 39,000, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks was valued around 1.3 times Japan's G.D.P. An economy that is slowing, as is the case here, cannot sustain those kinds of valuations for stocks.
Still, the uneven quality to the now three-month downturn in stocks remains a puzzle. While investors who own small-capitalization stocks have been hammered, those who are in S.& P. index funds are sitting relatively pretty: the funds are up about 9 percent on the year.
What does this inequity in returns mean for the future of the overall market? Some investors have been hoping the blood bath in individual stocks has been so bad that the big-capitalization stock indexes will not suffer a bigger drop from their peaks than they have already seen. Those still holding beaten-down stocks also wonder how they will fare if the indexes do take a dive. Surely these stocks are so far down, investors hope, that they could not decline further.
Unfortunately, history does not bear out either theory. John L. Manley Jr., equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, went back to 1969 and examined how individual stocks and indexes performed in downturns.
What did he find? Sharp declines by a large number of stocks do not preclude bear markets. Rather, they have inevitably preceded them. For example, in May 1969 a bear market began that took the S.& P. 500 down 29.7 percent. But in the 12 months before that overall drop, the average stock fell 18.6 percent.
Mr. Manley's research also found that even when a stock is down precipitously while overall indexes remain aloft, the stock can fall further when the indexes get clipped. "In four of the five cases studied," he reported, "the bad stocks before a bear market were the bad stocks during the bear market."
What does all this mean for equity investors today? While Mr. Manley believes that the Fed's rate cut will support the market for a while, the key to any significant uptrend in stocks will be good news coming out of Asia and Latin America. "Until they appear to be bottoming, which we don't have yet," he said, "as good as the rate cut is, it's still an ephemeral solution."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
Muscleman, or 98-Pound Weakling?

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
AS America awakened from a recession in 1991, the economy had a lot of work to do.
A real estate collapse had left banks in terrible shape. Companies had stopped hiring. The Federal budget deficit had once again started to swell. Incomes had stopped rising for most Americans. Wage inequality had become a national sore. Health insurance was protecting fewer people. Layoffs were spreading to white-collar workers. And as the preliminaries got under way for the 1992 Presidential election, Republicans and Democrats alike promised rapid economic growth that would lift all boats and, in doing so, sweep away these problems. 
 America got its expansion, all right -- one that has now lasted eight years and brought good times to many. But with the global financial crisis spawning talk of the next recession, much of what an expansion is supposed to achieve remains undone. For all the dazzling gains in the stock market, for all the money showered on Americans -- rich Americans in particular -- for as good as these times have felt, the report card on this expansion, if a child brought it home from school, would make a parent wince.
Late in the expansion, in 1996, the economy surged, and it is just now simmering down. But despite the surge, economic growth measured over the entire cycle makes the expansion of the 1990's the weakest since World War II. Economies can expand rapidly only when workers produce significantly more in a given hour of work than they have in the past. And that did not happen in the 90's, any more than it had in the 80's.
The result is painfully obvious in many households. While wealthier families enjoyed big gains, particularly from the booming stock market, most households find that their incomes, adjusted for inflation, are no higher today than they were in 1989, when the last expansion ended. Americans, for the most part, have been running in place for 25 years. And as economies around the world weaken, Americans are unlikely to gain ground soon.
"This has been a long and smooth and untroubled business-cycle upswing," said Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "But it has not overcome the long-run sluggishness of the economy. That depends on deeper things, like technological progress and gains in efficiency. And finding the secret of those, despite all the advances in computer technology, is a job that certainly was not accomplished in the 1990's."
The 1990's expansion, more than others in the recent past, has been market-driven, with Government playing a lesser role. And some economists contend that the growth surge in 1996 and 1997 was evidence of the power of markets, when they are left alone. Yet even some conservative, market-oriented economists, like Robert Lucas, the Nobel laureate at the University of Chicago, argue that the performance of the 90's economy demonstrates that government action must complement market forces.
"We are living through a period of sustained economic growth without inflation, and the unemployment rate has come down to levels I never thought I would see again in the United States," Mr. Lucas said. "But there are obviously plenty of problems. Poverty and income inequality are two. These are problems that cannot be addressed by the markets. They have to be addressed by specific government programs offering specific solutions."
 THERE have been gains, of course. The banks -- if suddenly squeamish about lending -- are certainly healthy again, thanks largely to Government policies, particularly at the Federal Reserve, intended to help them rebuild.
Hiring has come back, quite robustly, starting in 1993. The unemployment and inflation rates, in fact, have fallen farther than anyone anticipated, and that has helped to reduce the percentage of Americans living in poverty roughly to where it was when the last recession began, in the summer of 1990. A sharp decline in poverty among blacks helped to pull down the overall rate.
"Even for unskilled people coming off welfare, getting a job has been relatively easy," said David T. Ellwood, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. "What they have had to worry about is benefits and salary level."
The stronger job market has encouraged education, making young people, in particular, more skilled and competitive, although the gains have been gradual. Thirty-five percent of all 18-to-24-year-olds are taking college courses, up from 30 percent in 1989.
Another hallmark of the 1990's has been capital spending. Companies have used their robust profits and their increasingly valuable stock to buy equipment, particularly computers, and to build factories, stores, malls, hotels and offices.
All this has increased the nation's productive capacity -- so much so that corporate America is producing and offering for sale today much more than even avid consumers want to buy. That, along with a flood of inexpensive imports, has produced another feature of this expansion: buyers have been able to insist on discounts, thereby holding down inflation and increasing the purchasing power of a raise, even a small raise.
Consumer spending has clearly grown. Indeed, as the Federal budget deficit has turned into a surplus, private indebtedness, particularly for consumers, has risen to record levels, giving the economy the sort of boost that Government deficits did in the 1980's.
But that debt accumulation has come at a cost. By one estimate, 5 percent of all the nation's households have filed for bankruptcy protection the last five years.
If the economy goes into a downturn, is it safer to have the Government running up debt, or the citizenry? After all, the Government, in a pinch, can print money or borrow more to meet its obligations, while the citizenry is not nearly so flexible. If layoffs or shrinking stock portfolios or falling home prices were to leave consumers without the means to pay their loans, the defaults and bankruptcies could weigh at least as heavily on the economy as the shock from a collapsing hedge fund.
While the job market is strong, layoffs are nevertheless running ahead of 1980's levels. Many jobs lack company-subsidized health insurance -- 18.3 percent of the nonelderly are without coverage, up from 16.1 percent in 1990. But the robust hiring and the declining unemployment rate had an unexpected payoff.
Fearful of inflation, the Federal Reserve in the past had often cut off an expansion prematurely or watered it down by raising interest rates to discourage business activity. The signal for doing this was the unemployment rate. When it fell below 5.5 percent, the Fed worried that labor shortages would force employers to offer higher wages to get enough workers. Companies would then pay for the wage increases by raising their prices. And up would go the inflation rate.
That dynamic, enshrined in economic theory, is clearly fallible. The unemployment rate is down to 4.6 percent, and the Consumer Price Index, instead of rising, has fallen below 2 percent. Clearly the old worries about low unemployment were not on the minds of Fed policy makers when they cut interest rates on Thursday, the second cut in 16 days. Staving off the recession that is spreading across the globe -- and quelling the panic that has begun to curtail lending, investment and spending -- seemed much more to the point.
Summing up the new thinking, Janet Yellen, chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers and a former Fed governor, said: "As long as production facilities are not overly strained, which they aren't today, then it may be possible to have tighter labor markets than we used to think possible without pushing up the inflation rate."
The most prosperous decade in American history, the 1960's, featured similarly low inflation and unemployment. Citing this comparison, more than a few experts have proclaimed a historic breakthrough in the 1990's. This expansion, they said, heralded a new era of great prosperity -- a victory for the American model of free-market capitalism in which income would be spread, in time, more evenly than it has been in recent years, and more generously.
That is still a popular view in some quarters. "This is the most extraordinary domestic economic expansion in modern history," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, "in terms of economic growth, inflation, jobs and income, although the income may be less than the others."
But for all the optimism, the new era has not arrived. The main measure of any economic expansion is economic growth, which is the rising value of all of the nation's production of cars, appliances, new homes, Broadway musicals, legal advice, long-distance telephone service and the like, added together. By that measure, the 1990's have not measured up.
The 1960's certainly did. Economic growth in that decade averaged 4.7 percent a year, almost double the performance in the 1990's. Indeed, for a century from the Gilded Age until 1973, the economy expanded at a 3 percent annual rate, or more, most of the time. And then, in the early 1970's, the United States tumbled into a rut of tepid economic growth, which still prevails. The pie, in effect, has grown more slowly than in the past, and the 1990's expansion has failed to break this pattern.
The reason is productivity: whether workers are producing significantly more in a given hour on the job this year than they did last year. If so, and if that improvement is multiplied across the work force, then the economy as a whole expands more rapidly. The telephone operator who handles 100 calls an hour in a given year answers 103 the next year and 106 the next; the factory worker similarly stamps out more car hoods, and so on.
Productivity typically expanded better than 2 percent a year before 1973. But in the current expansion, productivity growth has averaged only 1.3 percent a year, despite better performances in a few industries, up only slightly from the 1.1 percent average in the 1980's.
"The difference is not something you would want to make anything out of," said Edwin Dean, chief of the division that compiles productivity statistics at the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. "You are not positive the difference is real rather than a measurement error."
Next month, the 1990's expansion becomes the second-longest since World War II, surpassing that of the 1980's. And early next year, if a recession does not intervene, the expansion will become the longest since the war, finally beating out, in longevity, the great 1960's expansion.
 BUT longevity is not enough. Despite the late burst of growth, the annual growth rate over the entire 90's business cycle -- from the end of the last expansion through this year's second quarter -- has averaged only 2.5 percent, the weakest performance since World War II.
The significance of that figure is that without sufficient economic growth, household incomes cannot increase. And indeed, since 1973, the income gains in periods of expansion for the so-called median household (half of all households earn less, half earn more) have barely offset the losses during recessions. Adjusted for inflation, individual wages and household incomes typically fall in recessions and rebound in the expansions. But while the losses were small and the rebounds robust before 1973, the opposite pattern has prevailed since then, and net gains have been hard to detect.
The 1990's cycle is clearly not an exception. After adjustment for inflation, the median household's annual income, $37,005 in 1997, is roughly where it was in 1989, the final year of the last expansion, the Census Bureau reported last month.
What's more, the 1997 level was only $1,260 above 1973's income of $35,745. Many households in the 1960's added more to their incomes in a single year than their counterparts today have added in 25 years. And they did it with one wage earner, not two or three, working fewer hours than the average jobholder does today.
Such changes hurt. Even in good times, the long working hours strain family life. If a recession should hit, layoffs and wage freezes could rattle families that have gone deeply into debt in the 90's to maintain their spending patterns.
"As the tide recedes, we are likely to find a lot of the old problems that we had before, only more so," said Robert B. Reich, the former Labor Secretary in the Clinton Administration and now a professor at Brandeis University.
 A HUGE problem left unresolved as the expansion appears to wind down is a divisive inequality that has developed among income groups, a trend that took root in the 1980's and that the 1990's expansion has failed to interrupt. Pay for low-income workers, or people earning less than $7 an hour, has increased smartly in this recovery, pushed up partly by a higher minimum wage and the earned-income tax credit, which is, in effect, a Federal wage subsidy.
But the gains among high-end jobholders have been even greater, widening the inequality. And workers in the middle, earning $9.75 to $15.50 an hour, lost ground, after adjusting their pay for inflation.
For Mr. Lucas, the University of Chicago economist, economic growth is not capable of resolving such problems, even if the 1990's expansion survives the global crisis, with help from the Federal Reserve or with some other economic stimulant. Government ingenuity is called for, he said, adding, "You cannot ask too much from economic growth."

Graphs: "How Muscular An Expansion?"
The stock market boomed, the deficit shrank and both unemployment and inflation sank to unexpectedly low levels. But the expansion of the 90's has not broken the American economy out of its slow-growth rut. The graphs show the changes since 1970.
 
Shading in charts indicates business cycles, from the start of one recession to the start of the next, or through the latest data available. Data for 1998 are through the second quarter.
 
INVESTMENT -- With an eye on the future, Americans invested in themselves, adding to the stock of workers with post-secondary schooling. Business invested heavily, too, though not as much as in earlier expansions.
 
GROWTH -- Compared with performance in past expansions, both productivity gains and economic growth have been tepid.
 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCES -- People have worked harder just to restore household incomes and poverty rates to the levels before the last recession.
 
SOURCES OF STABILITY -- The Federal budget was balanced. And unemployment was reduced significantly, without spurring inflation.

A Special Senator

BYLINE: By Bob Herbert 

 BODY:
Quietly in this season of scandal the Clinton Administration has managed a significant advance in the most unlikely of areas: low-income housing.
Three years ago the hard-riding, right-leaning Republican majority in Congress brought a halt to all efforts to bring additional units of affordable housing to poor families. Public housing was in deep trouble and the prevailing political sentiment seemed to be, "Put it out of its misery." 
 The abolition of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which administers the nation's public housing program, was seriously considered.
This regressive effort went further than anything that had taken place during the Reagan years. It was particularly insidious in that it occurred at a time when the nation's overall supply of affordable housing was shrinking and the overall demand, because of stagnating wages and other economic pressures, had increased dramatically. The number of poor families in deep distress -- living in grossly substandard housing, for example, or spending well over 50 percent of their gross incomes on rent -- had reached record levels.
Housing advocates spoke in tones of despair.
Now, suddenly, comes passage of a housing measure that bolsters HUD's budget by $2 billion, that will provide rent subsidies to 90,000 new families, that will begin to mix stable, working families into housing projects that have been overwhelmed by the indigent, and that will begin to desegregate projects that have been racially segregated for decades.
By all accounts, the architect of this turnaround is Andrew Cuomo, who took over as HUD Secretary in January 1997. Mr. Cuomo streamlined the agency and worked hard to salvage one of its most important missions -- to provide safe and decent housing to families shut out of the regular housing market.
In the 1970's the number of new families getting rent subsidies from the Government each year was measured in the hundreds of thousands. Ronald Reagan ratcheted that down to the tens of thousands. By the time Mr. Cuomo became HUD Secretary, the number of new families getting subsidies was zero.
So rent subsidies (in the form of housing vouchers) for 90,000 new families are a big deal.
The new policy of "deconcentration" is also a big deal. The idea is to begin admitting families with working adults and somewhat higher incomes into projects populated almost exclusively by very poor families. The goal is to provide an economic mix and models of behavior that will ward off the social instability that has ruined many public housing projects.
At the same time, Mr. Cuomo, with the support of President Clinton, has insisted that public housing projects begin to desegregate.
"Public housing across the nation is as segregated as private housing," said Mr. Cuomo. "You have black projects and white projects. There are places where you have Asian projects. The President has spoken about one America. So we are saying that where the Federal Government is the landlord, in our own house, let us end segregation once and for all."
The new legislation, which is about to be signed by the President, requires housing authorities to submit for Mr. Cuomo's approval a plan showing how they will begin deconcentrating and desegregating their housing.
The legislation also will end what Mr. Cuomo called a major and "foolish" disincentive to work. Under existing rules, the amount of rent in public housing can increase as a family's income increases. The new legislation freezes rent for the first two years of a family's increase in income.
What is remarkable about Mr. Cuomo's effort is not the scope of the bill. It's the fact that he was able to secure its passage in the midst of the Lewinsky scandal and at a time when Congress is controlled by conservative forces that have long been hostile to the very idea of public housing.
"The progressive forces stood their ground here," said Mr. Cuomo. "There is a real hunger for intelligent, progressive leadership."
"I give Cuomo a lot of credit," said Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "He turned out to be a great negotiator. He did a brilliant job."

HEADLINE: The World;
Israeli Business Flies Like a Dove

BYLINE: By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr. 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM

 BODY:
A FEW hours before boarding the plane that would take him to Washington for the peace talks that started last week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stood on a stage here and handed out etched glass trophies to 53 foreign businessmen whose companies had each sunk $50 million or more into the Israeli economy.
As the executives filed by, each exchanged a greeting with the Prime Minister that was drowned out by a big band blasting "Blue Moon" and "I Did It My Way." Mr. Netanyahu turned to the audience, composed mostly of Israeli business executives, to relay the comments as if they were an informal poll. 
 "About a third said, 'Do everything you can to bring peace,' and another third said, 'Don't give away the store,' " Mr. Netanyahu reported. "The rest just said, 'Good luck.' "
The Israeli business leaders responded by giving Mr. Netanyahu an unsolicited poll of their own. They interrupted his tally to applaud the sentiment for peace, then clapped only politely through the rest.
This weekend, Mr. Netanyahu and Yasir Arafat have been wrangling in Maryland over land, guns and limits on sovereignty. Back home, it is striking how the business community not only has accepted what it sees as the inevitability of an independent Palestinian state, but is already preparing to profit from it.
Israeli executives are hardly peaceniks. The military industry is still at the technological heart of the economy, and corporate leaders tend disproportionately to be former high-ranking military officers. But they have clearly concluded that a settlement with Mr. Arafat is in their interest. And they voice rising impatience with a peace process that, as one leading industrialist grumbled last week, has so far produced "too much process and not enough peace."
Mr. Netanyahu is ultimately governed by his own conceptions of Israeli security as well as his partisan political constraints. But he cannot be unmoved by the business consensus that a peace deal would provide an economic boon to his constituents.
Many Israeli c.e.o.'s, in fact, say that beyond a negotiating breakthrough at the Wye Plantation summit, what they really are waiting for is a final accord with a sovereign Palestinian state because that would remove remaining regional barriers to Israeli exports and investments. Globalized though the Israeli economy might now be, they say, its greatest opportunity for further growth is here in the Middle East.
The awards ceremony that Mr. Netanyahu took part in was at a two-day international business conference organized by the Prime Minister's office to commemorate Israel's 50th anniversary. There was much bold talk of "privatizing peace" through joint ventures with Arab partners, including a Gaza industrial park, a $60 million Israeli-Palestinian investment fund backed by the World Bank, and two binational projects with Jordan -- a tourist airport on the Red Sea and a duty-free industrial zone straddling the Jordan River. "This kind of cross-border cooperation costs a lot less than an F-16, and it offers a much better return on investment," said Omar Salah, a Jordanian investor in the free zone project.
 
Reticent
 The seemingly strong business consensus for a peace settlement does not necessarily translate into direct pressure to cut a deal, however. Israeli corporate leaders are cautious about overt intervention in politics and diplomacy, and most are not natural allies of Mr. Netanyahu and his Likud bloc. They are closer to the political and military leadership that governed under the Labor Party. "My fear is that business criticizing the Government will help them, not us," said Dov Lautman, chairman of Delta Galil Industries and board chairman of the Peres Peace Center, an institute that promotes joint Israeli-Palestinian business ventures.
Still, even Israeli economic officials talk about potential peace dividends. "We hope that the peace process is successful, because then we will be able to do what all other countries in the world do, which is trade with our neighbors," said Max Livnat, senior deputy director general of the Trade and Industry Ministry.
"There can be no dispute that a peace process will be good for the Israeli economy," said Jacob Frenkel, Governor of the Central Bank. "This is not a political statement, it is a factual statement. Our ratings agencies, our investors, all look at the geopolitical situation, and they vote with their feet."
In the days following the signing of the Oslo accords five years ago, business leaders within and outside the region began holding conferences on the brave new business world of a peaceful Middle East. Multilateral lenders and money-center bankers drew up plans for regional investment funds and a Middle Eastern Development Bank. But momentum flagged as the peace process stalled.
Now, however, with talks resuming, some of the optimism is returning. Israeli executives were talking confidently last week of a free trade bloc that would include Israel, Jordan and an independent Palestine as an almost immediate byproduct of a peace settlement; under this vision, broader regional trading arrangements could eventually extend west through Islamic Africa, east to the Persian Gulf states and north into Lebanon and Syria.
Israel as the hub of a Middle Eastern free trade area no longer seems so improbable here. The Israelis like to note that theirs is the only country with free trade agreements with both the United States and the European Union. This is true technically, as the West Bank and Gaza is not a country. But the Palestinian Authority has free trade privileges from both Washington and Brussels. It also has open trade with Egypt and Jordan, and a de facto customs union with Israel.
For potential Middle Eastern trading partners, disentangling the Palestinian-Israeli interrelationship would be more difficult than simply embracing it as a single market. And any regional trade arrangement that included the Palestinians but omitted the Israelis would be like Nafta without the United States, or the European Union without Germany. Israel's economy is now far larger than that of all its contiguous neighbors -- Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Egypt -- combined. Per capita gross domestic product stands at $17,000, well within European norms, and some 20 times greater than Jordan's and Egypt's average incomes.
 
The Dividend
The peace process has already been good for business, Israeli executives say. The Arab boycott of Israel -- and of multinationals that did business here -- began to fracture after the Oslo accords were signed. Foreign investment climbed dramatically from $400 million yearly before 1993 to a reported $2.4 billion in 1996, as dramatized by last week's parade of c.e.o.'s from Boeing, Unilever, Nestle, Cable & Wireless, Johnson & Johnson, Motorola, and other multinational heavyweights. Israeli businessmen are penetrating markets in Asia, Africa and the former Soviet bloc, and Japan, long conspicuously absent from the Israeli business scene, opened a trade promotion office here last year.
Oslo may get more credit than it deserves. The Israeli expansion of the 1990's was also fueled by the worldwide growth of investment in emerging markets. And most of the high-tech companies nurtured by this capital influx have their origins in the Israeli defense industry, not in the peace process; their natural markets are in the United States and Europe, not the Middle East. But the impact of expanded international opportunities should not be underestimated, Israeli business leaders say.
"The economic benefits of the peace process are irrefutable," said Benjamin Gaon, an industrialist. "Our diplomatic relationships have doubled, and we have open business relationships around the world. Gone are the days of secret dealings through intermediaries."
"The business community should not just reap the rewards of the peace process, but should assist it, even lead it," he added. "Peace is too precious a thing to be left in the hands of politicians, or even generals."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Tailoring the S.&L. Crisis To Save Japan's Banks

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AGOOD portion of the financial system was buried under a mountain of bad debts that was growing bigger with each passing day. Yet politicians, pressed by powerful interests and afraid of committing huge sums of taxpayer money to the problem, were dithering about how to respond. Other nations looked on with concern and disdain.
There are striking parallels between the United States in 1988 as it struggled to address its savings and loan crisis and Japan in 1998 as it grapples with a banking system so burdened with sour loans that it has virtually stopped lending.
In those similarities are many lessons about mistakes to be avoided. And given that the United States eventually dealt with the near-collapse of its savings and loan industry -- decisively if belatedly -- there may also be a road map in the American experience toward a solution for Japan and other nations where a recovery from the global economic crisis depends on resuscitating their enfeebled banking systems.
Japan is still in the process of recognizing the severity of its banking problems and that any solution will be expensive and painful. It took a big step down that path Friday when the Parliament agreed on major elements of a plan to spend around $500 billion of taxpayer money to shore up ailing banks and make it easier for the Government to take over insolvent ones.
Now the Japanese Government, which has allowed the problem to fester for years, has to prove to a skeptical world that it has the resolve to use those tools. The Clinton Administration, in particular, is convinced that Japan cannot pull itself out of recession and help address the rest of Asia's woes until it has dealt with the problem. It has grown increasingly impatient with Tokyo for not moving more aggressively.
 
Face Up
 It maybe worth remembering, however, that it took the United States years to face up to the damage done to the economy by the wholesale failures that swept the savings and loan industry during the late 1980's.
Much like their Japanese counterparts now, American regulators and industry executives initially bet that they could wait out the problem, that depressed prices for the real estate they had foreclosed on would bounce back, that a stronger economy would eventually strengthen their borrowers and enable them to pay up.
"The hardest thing is getting a consensus that you have a problem that can't be solved by conventional means," said John E. Ryan, a former head of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency set up to sell off real estate and other assets of failed savings institutions. "It's a very difficult consensus to achieve and we were a long time in achieving it. You can remember the time we spent in this country kidding ourselves and believing that the markets would bail us out."
Indeed, it was only in 1989, after hundreds of savings institutions had failed and economists began frightening politicians into action by estimating that the problems would cost hundreds of billions of dollars to fix, that Congress and the Bush Administration became serious about dealing with the crisis.
In August 1989, Congress passed legislation intended to make it easier for regulators to seize control of insolvent or failing savings institutions and sell off their component parts. The idea was that the financial system's problems and the depressive effect they were having on the real estate market and the general economy were best solved by taking a painful hit in a concentrated period.
The key to making it work was the Resolution Trust Corporation, which quickly became the repository of all the repossessed office buildings, strip malls and houses accumulated by unwise or unlucky or crooked savings and loan managers around the country, as well as their money-losing portfolios of high-risk junk bonds and other questionable assets.
There was not much of a market for many of the properties. To get things moving, the agency sold some real estate and other assets for bargain prices. The sales drew more buyers for other properties, generating more competition and higher prices. The agency packaged some properties together to make them more attractive to investors, and spruced up others.
From 1989 through the early 1990's, the Government shut down 747 savings institutions with assets of $455 billion. By the time they had all been picked apart and sold off by the Resolution Trust Corporation, the gap between what they owed depositors and what all their assets were worth was $84.7 billion. Combined with the $70 billion in losses run up by the several hundred additional savings institutions that had failed between 1986 and 1989, the total bill to the taxpayer and the industry-financed deposit insurance program was nearly $155 billion. But the problem was dealt with in just a few years -- the agency, its job completed, was disbanded in 1995 -- and the country and the economy could move on.
Now governments in Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan, among other countries, are trying to adopt big portions of the American approach. Officials from Japan in particular have spent considerable time with officials at the Office of Thrift Supervision and other regulatory agencies in Washington. The main message they hear from the United States is the necessity of moving quickly.
"The R.T.C. made the very tough decision just to sell at market regardless of what market was," said Jonathan Fiechter, the former top savings and loan regulator in America, who now works for the World Bank advising developing nations how to clean up financial messes.
"In Asia they're running into great trouble with criticism about fire sale prices, since you're often selling assets of people who are friends of very senior people," he said. "The lesson of the R.T.C. was that eventually you get through it."
 
Loss of Face
 But it is by no means clear that Japan, whose problems dwarf those of other nations, has accepted that lesson. Banks are reluctant to seek help from the Government voluntarily, since doing so involves a loss of face for the managers, if not the loss of their jobs.
Big borrowers, especially construction companies that are major contributors to the governing Liberal Democratic Party, are pressing the Government to give banks more time. Troubled banks continue to hide their losses from regulators.
Japan has cleared a big hurdle in proving willing in principle to spend huge sums of money on the problem. But Bert Ely, a consultant who tracked the savings and loan crisis here, said the Japanese plan so far has been nothing more than a facade, since the Government has been unwilling to force banks to prove they can survive or shut them down.
"It looks almost entirely like what we were doing before 1989 in the sense of delaying the inevitable, postponing a resolution of the banking problems and of the bad loans," Mr. Ely said.
"We learned that the hole in fact kept getting deeper," he added. "It's like a credit card balance. It doesn't peak and then subside, the problem just keeps getting bigger."

HEADLINE: The Microsoft Trial Begins

 BODY:
When the Justice Department filed its antitrust suit against Microsoft last May, both sides were hoping for a quick resolution. But with the trial set to begin tomorrow, those hopes are gone. The case against Microsoft has broadened in scope, encompassing new charges of predatory conduct against big-name rivals. If these allegations are proved, the courts may well be asked to consider drastic remedies, including increased regulation or even a breakup of Microsoft. Many experts worry that such steps could stifle innovation and enterprise in the nation's most dynamic business sector.
The Justice Department, and 20 attorneys general joining the suit, were right to worry about Microsoft using its monopoly status to coerce other companies. It is not in the public interest for any one company to have an Internet chokehold. But it is also right for Justice to have to prove its case in court. No matter who wins the arguments in the next couple months, no one doubts that the case will end up in the United States Supreme Court. 
 From the beginning, the core of the case against Microsoft has been that the company used illegal tactics to try to muscle Netscape, the maker of a Web browser that is the main rival to Microsoft's, out of the market. The focus originally was on Microsoft's decision to combine its own Internet Explorer browser with its basic Windows software, forcing anyone who used Windows to take the browser. The expanded suit argues that Microsoft also used strong-arm tactics against such other giants as Intel, Apple, I.B.M. and America Online to force them to use Microsoft products. These tactics, the Government charges, were based on a fear at Microsoft that Netscape's Navigator browser and Sun Microsystem's Java programming language might some day supplant Microsoft's dominance with its Windows operating system.
The fireworks in the trial will come in two ways. First, the Government plans to call witnesses from affected companies, some of whom will be reluctant to testify against Microsoft. Nevertheless, the Government thinks it can get them to make their complaints about Microsoft public. Second, there will be plenty of parsing of interoffice E-mails and other exchanges that the Government claims show that Microsoft was eager to kill off Netscape. In response, Microsoft will argue that such talk should be dismissed as locker-room bravado, not an actual business strategy.
Microsoft's main argument is that incorporating its browser into Windows was designed to improve the basic product. In June, in fact, a Federal appeals court accepted Microsoft's argument that it has the right to incorporate any software into its system if doing so offers advantages to consumers. But the court based its ruling on an earlier consent decree, not on broad antitrust law. The Government has assembled persuasive evidence that Microsoft's tactics violated prohibitions against using monopoly power in one area to crush the competition in others.
No one claims this has been an easy time for Microsoft. Besides the antitrust suit, the company faces strong business competition and a global recession that could restrict its phenomenal growth. But as Microsoft looks to expand its reach into Internet commerce, business software and software for consumer products like cars and telephones, it is critical to insure unfettered competition. In weighing the evidence, the courts and the public should recognize that the Justice Department is not trying to punish one company for its success but to guarantee that success will be possible for future innovators as well.

HEADLINE: Tourism, Seen From Both Sides

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I know that complaining is part of being a New Yorker, but I'm still embarrassed to read all my fellow citizens' complaints about tourists. For years, I've been telling people New York was a great city like London or Paris. We should be proud that the world finally agrees. 
 More important, the tourist trade generates many lower-paying service jobs that don't require M.B.A.'s or other advanced degrees. This allows people who don't work on Wall Street (or have the good fortune to be successful artists) to participate in our economy.
If some people find this a little inconvenient, perhaps they should think of the others in this city who are benefiting from the tourist trade.

HEADLINE: Higher Hopes In Baghdad For Ending U.N. Embargo

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 16

 BODY:
With Washington sapped by scandal and the United Nations arms inspectors weakened by infighting, Iraqi officials are expressing confidence that they are closer than ever to having some sanctions against their country eased and that they can avert a military strike even if they stonewall against inspections.
"Until February, the United States felt free to threaten or actually use power anytime we objected to intrusive inspections -- it was simple," a senior Iraqi official said, speaking on condition he not be identified. "Now it is clear they are restricted to only two circumstances: if we threaten a neighbor or if we resume the manufacture of weapons. There is no more carte blanche." 
 Most diplomats from other countries agree, at least, that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has come a long way in shifting the burden of making the case for sanctions toward the United States and the United Nations Special Commission, known as Unscom, which is charged with dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and long-range missile systems. Until that is done, the Security Council has said, the sanctions will remain.
On Thursday, for example, a group of scientists and experts are to meet here to examine whether Iraq loaded some of its missiles with deadly nerve gas. The United States made the charge. But Switzerland, which conducted independent tests of the equipment, says it found no proof. France, whose scientists did tests of their own, may, though tepidly, back the United States's contention.
Last week, one of the most senior United Nations officials, assistant Secretary General Denis Halliday, a 34-year veteran of the United Nations who had administered the "oil-for-food" program meant to blunt some impact of the sanctions, resigned his post in anger.
"Sanctions are starving to death 6,000 Iraqi infants every month, ignoring the human rights of ordinary Iraqis, and turning a whole generation against the West," he said in an interview here. "I no longer want to be part of that."
Even Britain, while continuing to side with the United States, has considerably toned down its criticism of Iraq. Last week, its chief delegate, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, said Iraq may have made enough progress in eliminating some weapons to deserve a hearing on whether some sanctions should be lifted.
"I think we have succeeded in splitting the unanimity of the Security Council, questioning the motives of Unscom, and above all bringing in the Secretary General of the United Nations into the decision making process as a neutral party," a high-ranking Iraqi official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
In the latest confrontation with the United Nations, Iraq has banned all inspections since Aug. 5, and Secretary General Kofi Annan has suggested a "comprehensive review" of Iraq's effort to eliminate its banned arms. Such a review would take place after inspections are resumed, a decision Iraq has yet to make.
The acting United States representative here, A. Peter Burleigh, insisted, however, that not much has changed. "There is no Security Council member, friend or foe of Iraq, expressing any sympathy toward Baghdad as it continues to openly defy the will of the international community and its obligations under Council resolutions," he said.
The inspections Commission itself, however, has been put on the defensive as one of its inspectors, Scott Ritter, a former American Marine, quit in August, charging that both the United States and Mr. Annan caved in to Iraq. Since then, he has drawn more fire on the inspection regime by acknowledging in several interviews that while working for the United Nations he received intelligence about Iraq from Israeli Government agencies.
One senior Western diplomat here, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the chairman of the Commission, Richard Butler, "has lost of a lot of trust." And the damage done to the Commission from such revelations was underscored by Mr. Butler himself, who reprimanded Mr. Ritter for divulging secrets of his work.
And there was another blow to the sanctions regime last week. The International Atomic Energy Agency, itself a United Nations agency based in Vienna, reported to the Security Council that it had no evidence that Iraq has "nuclear weapons, or nuclear weapons usable materials or the capability to produce such items."
The finding prompted Russia to renew its call for the Security Council to close the "nuclear file" on Iraq and reward it by lifting some of the sanctions.
For now, the United States would surely use its veto on the Security Council to prevent such an outcome. But Iraq officials here made clear that they see a definite limit to how long the United States can push the sanctions, and a nearly unlimited possibility for eroding the consensus on keeping them in place.

HEADLINE: Almost, But Not Quite, Deja Blue All Over Again

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
NO, it's not your imagination. New York really does seem to be living through 1987 all over again. Just look at the calendar: Tomorrow is Oct. 19, the very date that will live in financial infamy as Black Monday, when the stock market plunged 23 percent.
And there are other, creepier parallels, as a glance over some old and new headlines will attest.
Then, as now, Donald J. Trump was bent on gracing the city's skyline with a new "world class" tower -- although back then it was the West Side ("Celebrities Open Wallets to Fight Trump's Project"), while this time it's the East Side ("Trump Starts New Tower Near the U.N."). 
 Then, as now, scandal rocked Wall Street's elite -- except then it was insider trading starring Ivan Boesky, not hedge-fund havoc with John Meriwether. And then, as now, George Steinbrenner was threatening to move the Yankees to New Jersey.
As they do today, tourists thronged the streets, to the increasing annoyance of the natives. In the city, prices of luxury co-ops were in the stratosphere, as they are now, and new office towers were sprouting in midtown, a little to the north and west of today's hot spot, Times Square. Unemployment dropped to levels unseen in years, like nowadays.
But the stock market began falling from its peak in the summer, just as it did this year. Worrywarts brooded about the city's growing dependence on Wall Street. And, as if to confirm those fears, Salomon Brothers on Oct. 12, 1987, announced big layoffs -- much as Merrill Lynch announced last week (on Oct. 13, to be precise) that it was eliminating thousands of jobs, including 1,000 employees and outside consultants in the city.
Sure, there are differences, and not merely the Land Rovers in place of Jaguars as status symbols. Investment in the stock market is more pervasive, thanks to mutual funds and retirement plans, but investors seem less likely to be spooked -- at least so far. After all, they still have the gains they made during three years of astonishingly high returns.
And most important, interest rates are far lower than they were in 1987; in fact, they are lower now than they were just last week, thanks to the Federal Reserve's actions on Thursday.
After the Crash of 1987, there were some immediate forecasts of gloom and doom, but many in the city pooh-poohed the notion that Wall Street's troubles would have a broad effect on most New Yorkers. For a time they seemed to be right.
But by the end of the following year, New York City government revenues had fallen sharply, including toll collections, since there were fewer commuters into Manhattan. The jobless rate began to climb. By the spring of 1989 many who had bought apartments at the peak found that they could not sell them for enough to cover their mortgages.
The real recession had begun.
It turned out that axing all those fat cats on Wall Street had an effect on other people -- restaurant owners, accountants, lawyers, bicycle messengers, real estate agents, panhandlers. It just takes a while for the economic effects of any change to filter out into the broader society.
None of this means that a similar recession is just around the corner in the city that considers itself the world's financial capital. This time around, the national economy is in much better shape: The Federal Government is not running a deficit, inflation is not a worry, and Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, isn't raising interest rates as he was in 1987. The city's finances are in far better shape too, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has already budgeted for lower tax receipts from Wall Street.
But those who forget history -- well, you know. Or, as they say on Wall Street, "The most dangerous words in the English language are, 'It's different this time.' "

HEADLINE: Yale, Clinton's Alma Mater, Is Little Moved by Drama

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Oct. 14

 BODY:
During the Vietnam War and the Watergate crisis, the campus of Yale University, like many others, was politically energized if not radicalized. The university chaplain, the Rev. William Sloane Coffin Jr., took a prominent role in opposing the war, and many undergraduates viewed the resignation of Richard M. Nixon as a triumph over the forces of evil.
No such passions grip the Yale campus today as President Clinton faces an impeachment drama in which a number of Yale alumni are playing central roles. 
 "There is no sense here that we are witnessing a great historical moment," said Nicole Itano of Boulder, Colo., 20, managing editor of The Yale Daily News. Glenn Hurowitz, 20, of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., the newspaper's editorials editor, said that students were "tired of this stuff and tired of our leaders doing nothing to define the other issues."
Last month, The Daily News urged Mr. Clinton to resign "to put this incredible, indelible blemish of American history behind us and restore the assumption of honesty and personal integrity in our highest elected official."
That was during the tenure of the class of 1999, now seniors. A new editorial board, composed of juniors, takes a different position, arguing against what the editor in chief, Isaiah Wilner, 20, of Seattle, called "an open-ended Congressional witch hunt."
"The Beltway has escaped from the rest of the country," Mr. Wilner said. "The Judiciary Committee needs to set a time limit and to limit itself to the Starr report issues."
President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, were members of the class of 1973 at the Yale Law School. They had planned to take part in a 25th reunion celebration next weekend and attend a luncheon honoring Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who graduated from the law school in 1964. But the trip was abruptly canceled last Friday. A White House spokesman said the President wanted to be available for Middle East peace talks.
Mr. Clinton's private lawyer in the Lewinsky case, David E. Kendall, and a new White House coordinator of his political defense, Gregory B. Craig, also went to the law school. Brett Kavanaugh, a main author of the Starr report, has a bachelor's and a law degree from Yale.
All that has had little impact on undergraduates' thinking.
"There was no particular affection on this campus for George Bush, who was even more closely identified with Yale, and there is no particular disaffection with President Clinton," said Dan Sommers, 21, an economics and politics major from Manhattan, who nevertheless favors the President's resignation.
What Mr. Clinton did in private is his own business, Mr. Sommers said, "but he involved almost everyone in the Cabinet in defending his lies, and he has weakened the Presidency so much that nothing substantive has happened in Washington since January, at a time when we badly need strong leadership."
The impact at the law school has been far greater. The Yale Law Review's editor, Laura Ahn, declined to discuss Mr. Clinton's situation, and several professors spoke only on the condition of anonymity.
"There is a powerful sense of betrayal," a professor said. There had been a surge of optimism and hope when the President took office, but now he is seen by most people here and elsewhere as just another pol."
Several teachers recalled the traditional cocktail party at the law school on the opening day of classes in the fall of 1992. "The first-year students," one said, "knew that Bill Clinton had stood where they were standing only 20-odd years before, and they were filled with idealism and ambition because he was running for President."
Prof. Akhil Reed Amar said that what he called "the hard-edged view that nothing in the Starr report comes even close to an impeachable offense" made him "a little nervous" in view of the possibility that Mr. Clinton may have committed perjury in grand jury testimony.
Mr. Amar, a law school professor who is considered an expert on both the Constitution and criminal procedure, said: "I would argue that even if the charges are true, and he is technically impeachable, this would not be a sensible exercise of the awesome, disruptive power of impeachment. In this I am affected by the fact that the American people twice voted for Bill Clinton knowing to a considerable certainty what his character is like."
His greatest fear, Professor Amar continued, is a deeply partisan debate, which would be bad, he said, "for the process and the country."
The historian John Morton Blum, a professor emeritus, was equally critical of Mr. Clinton and Congress, describing them as "the worst leadership combination this country has had since Calvin Coolidge." Mr. Clinton, he said, has "a lifelong record of dissembling" and "lax principles about anything, public or private."
Professor Blum said he opposed resignation because it would move the country too close to the British model, where a prime minister who loses the confidence of the House of Commons must quit, and he opposes impeachment because he does not believe that "lies told to conceal adultery" are impeachable crimes. But he confessed to seeing no way out, because he found "a crippled Presidency, which is the third alternative, worse than the others."
A conversation with a group of graduate and undergraduate students at Timothy Dwight College evoked little sense of the moral outrage that dominated college campuses on other issues at other times.
Lyneise Williams, 33, an art history student from Cincinnati, spoke of detecting "a shifting set of values among political activists, a harsh new morality among Republicans, journalists and the religious right."
But a few shreds of doubt emerged about the wisdom of Mr. Clinton's continuing in office. Andrew Gerber, 21, an English major from Bethesda, Md., said the tactics of Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel, bothered him deeply. But he said he could not help wondering, "What does it say about the President's judgment that he would do these things with Monica when he was already under suspicion by a lot of people about extramarital affairs?"
Alex Kirshner, 21, a history major from Chicago, said he thought there was no avoiding a lengthy impeachment proceeding, and "that makes you wonder how Clinton can emerge as an effective leader." Still, only Mr. Sommers among the eight in the discussion group said he thought Mr. Clinton should resign.

HEADLINE: Taiwan's Old Soldiers, Forsaken in New York

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
They have been together for five bitter decades, and they will stay together, it seems, for the foreseeable future.
As teen-agers in the 1940's, they became Nationalist soldiers in China and followed Chiang Kai-shek to Taiwan. As middle-aged bachelors in the 1960's and 70's, they fled to the United States, angry that Taiwan did not have a pension system for veterans. As graying immigrants with no immediate relatives within a hemisphere, they toiled in menial jobs in Manhattan's Chinatown. And since 1989, William Wong, Chi-ching Tung, Tong-yu Yang and Hsi-shan Chang have occupied the same half-bedroom in a dilapidated apartment on the Lower East Side. 
 It is a story that only Mr. Wong, now a rickety 66, can tell. The ashes of the other three rest in a tea container and two cardboard boxes atop a shoddy bookcase, next to Mr. Wong's bed.
"It's too expensive to put them in a crematorium, a minimum of $50 each month," said Mr. Wong, who began storing the remains of his comrades after Mr. Yang died in 1989.
Together, these four men have come to symbolize the penury and pathos saturating the lives of many of the 100 or so Nationalist veterans in Chinatown, and thousands of others scattered throughout the country.
For years, the veterans in Chinatown stayed in Chinatown, unable to speak English, afraid to venture beyond its borders. Loneliness was pervasive, and the men often had only one another, and their memories, as company.
But now, after decades of hiding in the shadows of society's margins, they are seeking recognition and help. In recent months, a growing number of veterans in New York have demanded more retirement benefits from Taiwan's Government -- benefits that they say could mean the difference between life and death. And to press their case, they have staged demonstrations in Chinatown, appealed to politicians and courted the Chinese-language news media.
"Everyone has a sad story," said Charlin Chang, president of a veterans' group called the R.O.C. Veterans' Self-Support Association of U.S.A. "Everyone. And we are all getting older."
As with anything broaching Taiwan politics or history, the campaign has elicited polar reactions in New York and abroad. Nationalist loyalists are among the veterans' staunchest defenders. But some ethnic Taiwanese -- particularly those who view the Nationalists as invading outsiders -- have little sympathy, and wonder aloud at what point self-pity stops and self-reliance begins.
For the veterans, though, the goal is not just money. Deep in the sunset of their lives, these men are also struggling to gain respect for what they have been through, and understanding for how they fell through life's cracks.
"They came for the American dream, but perhaps their luck was not right," said Wallace Chow, a senior assistant at the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, Taiwan's de facto consulate in New York. "It is sad, but maybe this is just a mistake in history."
The story of Mr. Wong and his comrades is typical of those who drifted from China to Taiwan to New York's Chinatown. As young men without much formal education, they joined the army or navy, patriotic and adventurous. But after the Nationalist forces were defeated by the Communists and fled to Taiwan, the men never returned to China or their families.
As the decades passed, they became increasingly disillusioned with the soldier's life. Soldiers earned only a pittance and were not supposed to marry; those who did forfeited their salary, food rations and housing.
Those who quit the military found civilian life just as difficult. They did not have skills or family. So some veterans decided to join commercial fleets, jump ship in New York and enter the United States illegally, convinced, as Mr. Wong put it, that "America was heaven."
It was not.
They had heard about great jobs and big houses, but instead they found only backbreaking work at restaurants, sweatshops or construction companies, in a neighborhood with a surplus of bachelors. Most remained unmarried and socialized mainly with one another, swapping stories about their misspent youth.
A determined few worked with matchmaking services in China to find wives. But many of those matches ended in divorce, particularly after the wives discovered that their husbands were poor.
Few veterans moved out of Chinatown. Few picked up much English. And over the years, they found themselves being passed by or overwhelmed by the changing landscape. More families moved in, modern buildings went up, and the flow of Chinese immigrants and the dialect they spoke changed.
These days, some veterans collect cans and bottles to survive. Others, Mr. Chang of the veterans association says, take advantage of free bus rides from Chinatown to Atlantic City that are sponsored by the casinos. The casinos offer a free meal and $10 for the day, which the veterans pocket rather than gamble with.
Then there is the story of Tzu-cheng Chang. Mr. Chang, a 76-year-old veteran and bachelor, had worked in a restaurant for more than 30 years before quitting four years ago because of asthma and arthritis. He survived on food stamps.
In July, Mr. Chang's barber in Chinatown noticed that the man had not dropped by for a few weeks. Concerned, he phoned Mr. Chang. No one answered. So on July 30, firefighters entered Mr. Chang's tiny apartment on East 17th Street in Manhattan. There was a foul smell. Mr. Chang had been dead for days.
In September, more than 60 veterans, some in wheelchairs, demonstrated in Chinatown to call attention to the plight of Mr. Chang, Mr. Wong and others, and to clamor for changes to Taiwan's system.
Before 1970, Taiwan offered its retiring soldiers only a lump-sum severance of about $10 for nonofficers, with shoes and a blanket tossed in.
"Our country was poor," said Ma Kai Nan, director of the overseas liaison department of Taiwan's Veterans Affairs Commission, in a telephone interview from Taipei. "Life was difficult, and we couldn't offer the soldiers much."
In 1970, Taiwan established a special fund for nonofficers, disbursing the equivalent of about $350 per month per veteran. But there was a catch: except for those who lived in mainland China, overseas veterans had to return to Taiwan twice a year to claim the money in person.
As a result, many veterans in the United States have not received their money, because they are too infirm to travel and because the cost of the trip would exceed the stipend. In addition, some veterans are still in the United States illegally, and would be unable to return if they left.
So instead, the veterans want, among other things, to be able to register at any unofficial consulate to claim their money.
"We've been cheated and lied to from when we were 17 to now," Mr. Wong said. "We have been patriotic, we have sweated, we have shed our blood, but the Taiwan Government has not given us anything."
To date, the campaign has largely swirled in the New York area, partly because Chinatown holds the largest concentration of veterans and partly because veterans elsewhere in the country live too far from one another to organize effectively. A small number of veterans, meanwhile, have managed to rebuild their lives, finding spouses and better jobs, and are uninterested in participating.
But there are hints that the campaign may be working. While the United States Government has no official position on the matter, several New York politicians, including Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, have vowed to help. And Taiwan's Government plans to amend its policy, requiring that the veterans return only once a year, said Mr. Ma of the Veterans Affairs Commission.
But whether this support is based on legitimate policy considerations or just pity for a dwindling group of desperate men remains a matter of opinion.
Some people say that while the veterans' stories may be sad, their lives have not been discernibly worse than millions of Taiwanese who endured economic and political hardship. Moreover, some veterans already qualify for Government assistance in the United States, so for them to receive more from Taiwan would look like double dipping.
In addition, the veterans are viewed by some Taiwanese as relics of another era -- dinosaurs from the authoritarian regime of Chiang Kai-shek who are out of touch with modern Taiwan.
"People might think, 'Why are we giving these old soldiers some money?' " said Tzu-shong Yang, a former president of the East Coast chapter of the Democratic Progressive Party, Taiwan's main opposition party. "They have no ties to Taiwan, and there are plenty of other people in Taiwan who are suffering even more."
Interestingly enough, if the veterans moved to Taiwan today, they would be eligible for benefits that did not exist when they left, including free housing and medical care. But most do not want to return, afraid to go back to a country that was a backwater when they left, and is now the world's 17th-largest economy.
So they remain in the United States, many living in squalor.
Mr. Wong, for instance, has lived in the same grimy two-bedroom apartment on Essex Street for 30 years. Only the roommates have changed. Four people now live in a crammed two-bedroom apartment of 350 or 400 square feet, paying $175 per person per month.
The bathroom does not have a sink. The kitchen does, however, and that is where all the roommates leave their toothbrushes, along with the dirty dishes.
A tattered white sheet dividing Mr. Wong's bedroom in half gives him the only privacy from his latest roommates, whom he does not count among his friends. Mr. Wong does not have a closet in his half, and hangs his clothes on a coat hanger nailed to the wall. There are no pictures on the cream-colored walls; the paint is peeling.
A bookcase, unsteady, holds the remains of his three colleagues. The ashes of Mr. Yang, who died in 1989, are in a tea container, which is wrapped in a Nationalist flag. Those of Mr. Chang, who died in 1990, are in a cardboard box. And the ashes of Mr. Tung, who died in 1997, are in a similar box, with a framed photograph of him taped to the front.
"I miss my friends," Mr. Wong said with a sigh, cradling the containers. "Some day, I'd like to be able to bury them with the proper respect."
For years, Mr. Wong shared a bedroom with Mr. Tung, a navy veteran from Sichuan province. But after Mr. Tung died, Mr. Wong rented the other half out to a man who grew up in Communist China. The two men do not get along.

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: THE SENATE;
Schumer and D'Amato Look for an Edge

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato charged across upstate New York yesterday, mocking Representative Charles E. Schumer as "the Phantom" for missing votes in Congress this year. Mr. Schumer campaigned by marking the six-year anniversary of Mr. D'Amato's pledge, later abandoned, not to run again if voters rewarded him with a third term.
With identical props -- a videotape player and a television monitor -- to display their latest attack advertisements, Mr. D'Amato and Mr. Schumer used a crisp and pleasant fall Saturday to offer the scathing assessments of each other that have come to define their campaign for United States Senate. 
 Mr. D'Amato said Mr. Schumer was a derelict legislator who had neglected his Congressional duties by skipping votes this year. Mr. Schumer said Mr. D'Amato was untrustworthy, offering as evidence the promise the Senator made in the heat of the 1992 campaign to retire from politics if voters sent him to Washington for a final term in which, Mr. D'Amato said then, he would not be guided by re-election concerns.
The exchanges came as the candidates headed into the last two weeks of a contest that both campaigns view as excruciatingly close.
Their choice of campaign stops indicated where Mr. D'Amato and Mr. Schumer see their strengths. Mr. D'Amato campaigned in five upstate cities. Mr. Schumer campaigned in Manhattan and Albany, and at the last minute flew to Rochester to campaign at a soccer game.
It was Mr. D'Amato's second swing upstate in a week, and it suggested the importance that the Republican Senator had attached to a strong showing in a part of the state where Republicans have historically done well, but which has suffered from a stumbling economy that some Republicans think could cause them problems this year. Yesterday was also, for Mr. D'Amato, a day of familiar attacks: for the 17th day in a row, he assailed Mr. Schumer for missing votes in Congress this year as he campaigned for higher office.
Mr. Schumer has a 77 percent attendance record in Congress this year, missing slightly more than 100 votes, mostly on procedural matters or on bills that passed by overwhelming margins. His lifetime attendance record during his 18 years in Congress is just under 93 percent.
To make his point, Mr. D'Amato described his efforts to bring aid to upstate New York after it was devastated by winter storms this year. Speaking at an airport terminal in Rochester to about 100 supporters, Mr. D'Amato noted that Mr. Schumer was absent when an emergency aid bill first came up in the House.
And Mr. D'Amato noted that although Mr. Schumer was present when the bill came up for a final vote, he voted against it. "We're better off if the Phantom hadn't shown up," Mr. D'Amato said, "because the Phantom voted against aid to the North Country."
Mr. Schumer has said he opposed the measure, as did most other Democrats, because he viewed it as a partisan bill that financed the emergency assistance with deep cuts in housing funds.
In Manhattan, Mr. Schumer took advantage of one of Mr. D'Amato's most famous 1992 campaign moments -- his pledge to retire from politics -- with the help of a blowup of the Oct. 18, 1992, front page of The Daily News. "D'Amato Stunner: My Last Run," the headline said.
Mr. Schumer has repeatedly described Mr. D'Amato as untrustworthy -- the tag line on a new Schumer advertisement that features the Daily News headline is "Too many lies for too long" -- and he said this broken promise was evidence of that.
Mr. Schumer noted that Mr. D'Amato said in 1992 that he wanted to spend six years in the Senate without having to hear people assert that his behavior was motivated by re-election concerns.
"Do you know what he did right after he got elected?" Mr. Schumer said. "He became chairman of the national Senate Republican Campaign Committee, the most blatantly political position you can hold. Then, shortly after that, he embarked on his partisan and political inquisition of the First Family.
"It's too late to hold Al D'Amato to his promise not to run. But in 17 days, we can make him keep that promise."
In Rochester and Syracuse, Mr. D'Amato responded to Mr. Schumer by repeating the explanation he gave when he first signaled, shortly after Election Day 1992, that this was one campaign promise he might not keep.
"I had just come out of a debate," the Senator recalled. "I was tired. And I meant it at the time. It was a tough campaign. Lots of nastiness."
Mr. D'Amato said that in light of his victory, and with some rest, he reconsidered his position and decided that he would like to continue his career in the Senate.
Mr. D'Amato was traveling in what his aides considered friendly territory yesterday, and at the arranged rallies in airport terminals, he was greeted by chants of "Six more years." Even so, the Senator found himself scrapping with a reporter at one upstate news conference over his attacks on Mr. Schumer's attendance record.
"He may find that personally embarrassing," said Mr. D'Amato, referring to Mr. Schumer's reaction to attacks on his attendance record. "But don't you think that it's reasonable or fair to pull that out? I ask you, in all intellectual honesty -- forget the fact that you don't like me."
When the reporter challenged that assertion, Mr. D'Amato responded acidly: "It's dripping through. In all intellectual honesty, you tell me that is not fair?
"You mean to tell me I should not point out his missed votes, his poor votes, his votes that hurt the people? That's what a campaign is about."

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: CONNECTICUT;
Riding High as Election Nears, Rowland Promises Opponent a Job

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Lots of candidates promise more jobs if elected, but Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut is going them one better: he is promising one to his opponent.
Reflecting supreme confidence that he will be re-elected Nov. 3 and his continuing effort to boost his reputation for bipartisanship, Governor Rowland said he would welcome his Democratic opponent, United States Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, into his second administration. 
 "I have a great deal of respect for Mrs. Kennelly," the Governor, a Republican, said in comments released today by an aide. "She is very smart and capable, and some of the things that happened in her campaign are not her fault -- there are a lot of other external factors. I'd be willing to talk to her about any field she'd be interested in working in."
Mrs. Kennelly did not refuse. She said through her spokesman that various people have tried to discuss future options with her, but that she was thinking only about becoming Governor. Asked if Mrs. Kennelly would give Mr. Rowland a job, her campaign manager, Jonathan W. Pelto, said, "John Rowland would certainly have a voice in any Kennelly administration, and a role if he chose one."
Governor Rowland first made the offer on Friday, during a visit to The Connecticut Post of Bridgeport. "I'm very fond of her," he was quoted as saying in today's issue. Despite his lead of 30 to 44 points in various state polls, he cautioned, "I don't want to be presumptuous, and I don't want to be condescending in suggesting that something's going to happen." As possible positions, he mentioned her concern about child safety and her criticism of his leadership of the State Department of Children and Families.
The two once had a warm personal relationship. During the six years they served together in the House of Representatives, they often had dinner together and their staffs held joint birthday parties. An aide to the Governor recalled that when the two were doing television commentaries for a Presidential debate in Hartford in 1996, they hugged and he called her "Babs."
The Governor often heralds his ability to work with Democratic legislators, and a spokesman said he had appointed two Democrats as commissioners and one as his chief legal counsel, who has since resigned. Mr. Rowland also reappointed Mrs. Kennelly's sister, Louise Bailey, to the University of Connecticut Board of Trustees, and did not stop the Criminal Justice Commission from reappointing her brother, John M. Bailey, as Chief State's Attorney.
The relationship has deteriorated in recent days as Mrs. Kennelly began jabbing at Mr. Rowland after months of trying to talk mostly about her vision for the state. The Governor, after holding his tongue during their first debate, responded in kind during two debates this week.
Mrs. Kennelly's change in tone apparently is the result of pleas by her advisers, who see little hope of picking up many undecided voters but are eager to give loyal Democrats a reason to go to the polls. Her current television advertisement is an attack on Mr. Rowland's record for enforcing environmental laws.
"It should not pay to pollute," Mrs. Kennelly says in the ad, standing at water's edge, as workers behind her labor in anti-contamination suits. "We have laws on the books to preserve our air and our water. They're not being enforced." The ad, which also shows a gavel and a person in handcuffs, closes with a narrator saying, "When Barbara Kennelly is Governor, polluters won't get off the hook."
Governor Rowland, ever feistier in debates, has continued to run only positive television commercials. On Friday, he began a minutelong ad that describes the improvement in the state's economy over the last four years. "But there's still more to do," he says, looking into the camera. "We can cut taxes further, rebuild our cities, and create better jobs for the future. I'm asking for your vote so we can keep building a better Connecticut together."

HEADLINE: Embattled Sex Shops Find A Survival Tactic Works

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE 

 BODY:
Three months after a spate of highly publicized padlockings heralded the arrival of the Giuliani administration's crackdown on New York City's sex shops, a string of legal victories by adult business owners has turned what looked like a speedy rout into a war of attrition.
Since the crackdown began in late July, 59 of the 144 strip clubs and adult video stores affected by a new zoning law have closed or shifted to nonadult entertainment, city officials said. But while the industry has clearly been wounded, it has not been run out of the city's residential neighborhoods as some had hoped. 
 To the frustration of sex shop opponents, state Supreme Court judges have continued to uphold a legal strategy that for now is allowing some shops and clubs to stay open under the new law. Three judges have ruled that if adult video stores, or in some cases strip clubs, limit adult entertainment to less than 40 percent of their floor space or merchandise, they can remain open.
The continued survival of the adult businesses, even in a watered-down form, is a victory for the industry. But it remains to be seen how long the businesses can withstand what are believed to be plunging profit margins and soaring legal expenses.
Herald Price Fahringer, the lawyer representing the majority of the 144 sex shops affected by the new law, said the sex shops were holding their own and in some cases gaining ground. He said the two Harmony Theaters in Manhattan that were closed in the first round of padlockings wanted to rebuild to meet the 40 percent standard and reopen.
But he accused the Giuliani administration of denying the businesses the permits they need to reconfigure. Mr. Fahringer said he would file a lawsuit in Federal court within the next two weeks accusing the city of delaying building permits and harassing sex shops through repeated health and fire code inspections.
"The city is interested in simply closing these business, not getting them to conform with the law," Mr. Fahringer said.
Last month in Queens, Judge Alan LeVine ordered the reopening of Goldfinger's, a Rego Park strip club padlocked under the new law, after lawyers for the club complained the city was dragging its feet in issuing a construction permit.
The new law bars any business that devotes a "substantial portion" of its floor space or merchandise to adult entertainment from operating in residential areas or within 500 feet of a school, church or another sex shop. Department of Buildings guidelines define "substantial portion" as more than 40 percent.
Over the objections of lawyers for the city, Judge LeVine ruled that Goldfinger's could reopen with only curtains cordoning off the 40 percent "adult" section of the bar, court officials said. The judge had ordered the club to build permanent walls but said that as long as the city failed to issue the building permit, it could reopen with only curtains.
City officials denied any intentional delays. Gaston Silva, the city Buildings Commissioner, said his department was not withholding permits from sex shops. "In no instance are we delaying anything," he said.
Steven M. Fishner, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's criminal justice coordinator, said health and fire inspectors were visiting the sex shops but said the businesses had not been made targets. "We're treating them as we treat all other businesses," he said.
Mr. Fishner said that in the last six weeks the city had also issued criminal summonses at 11 sex shops it says violate the new zoning law. The summonses, unlike the lengthy nuisance abatement court actions the city is using in efforts to padlock the clubs, can only result in fines.
Mr. Fahringer, the lawyer for the sex shops, cited the court actions and summonses as examples of unusual tactics of the Giuliani administration and pointed out that zoning violations were usually resolved with administrative hearings.
Despite sex shop owners' legal victories, the crackdown has succeeded in changing the tone of New York's once burgeoning sex shop industry to tepid from bawdy. Many adult video stores have torn down their more overt signs and constructed adult back rooms that make up less than 40 percent of their floor space.
Strip clubs have been hit much harder, and many have had to lay off dancers. Still-employed dancers complain that their earnings plummeted when they began dancing with bikinis on to avoid having the clubs considered "adult."
But in a ruling on Sept. 23, Judge Steven W. Fisher of Queens presented what could prove to be salvation for the strip clubs. Causing angry protests from local residents, Judge Fisher allowed Wiggles, another Rego Park strip club, to reopen after it built new cigar and television rooms and restricted nude dancing to a room that made up less than 40 percent of its floor space. It was the first ruling to apply the 40 percent standard to strip clubs.
And last week, Judge Arthur W. Lonschein of Queens ruled that the formerly all-adult Fair Theater in East Elmhurst, Queens, could remain open because it was now showing adult films in less than 40 percent of its theaters. The rulings all come in the wake of an August ruling by Judge Stephen G. Crane of Manhattan that the 40 percent standard was valid in adult video stores.
But city officials pointed to other rulings in their favor, and warned that the city might appeal rulings it disagrees with. Watered-down sex shops, Mr. Fishner predicted, will not prove to be economically viable.

HEADLINE: Wisconsin Welfare Experiment: Easy to Say, Not So Easy to Do

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE 

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE

 BODY:
In building a bridge from welfare to work, Wisconsin, perhaps more than any other state, has prided itself on doing things right. It has spent heavily and pledged lavishly to give poor families the tools they need, from baby sitters and bus passes to case managers and community service jobs. On paper, no state has done more to replace welfare checks with workers' supports.
But a year after moving from the shelves to the streets, Wisconsin's celebrated effort bears only an intermittent likeness to the program of customized employment services outlined in planning documents and praised from the Oval Office on down. In practice, even supporters of the program complain that uneven casework and unresponsive bureaucracies can make services cumbersome, if not impossible, to use. 
 Some administrative glitches are inevitable, of course, in an effort to move tens of thousands of low-skilled, single mothers into the work force. And despite their frustrations, many former welfare recipients have achieved a kind of back-door success simply by walking away from the program to find jobs on their own. Still, the gaps between generous theory and bumpy practice are noteworthy here because Wisconsin's ethos -- less welfare, but more help -- has helped shape a national consensus on aid to the poor.
"What we see in Milwaukee isn't what we envisioned," said State Senator Alberta Darling, one of a half-dozen Republican legislators who have balanced their enthusiasm for the program's theory with frequent criticism of its practice. "There have been problems from the get-go, with child care and management systems. We're not demanding enough of the people delivering the services and there are a lot of excuses on the table that I don't find acceptable."
Administrative problems were just what the state was trying to avoid when it privatized the program -- called Wisconsin Works or W-2 -- in Milwaukee County, which accounts for 87 percent of the state's 11,000 welfare cases. But despite the effort to import business-world efficiencies, many of those in the program describe their caseworkers as distant and distracted figures who neglect to return phone calls rather than the partners in self-sufficiency depicted in state manuals. Many recipients find themselves bouncing between part-time or temporary jobs, suffering income gaps that planners failed to anticipate.
And the state's offer of subsidized child care, a crucial support service, has foundered on the confusion between rival agencies, one public, the others private, whose staffs and computers often fail to communicate. This year, as many as 60 percent of the child-care placements begun by one agency were invalidated by another, leaving thousands of bewildered mothers with no one to care for their children.
Albirta Glenn was left to search for a job on her own, though she lacked child care and was facing an eviction threat. When Sheila Baker was laid off, she did not look to her caseworker for help. "They don't return phone calls," she said. "I'll find a job better working with myself than working with them."
Ta-Tanisha Powell had so many problems getting her child care approved that she left her job to care for her son herself. Indeed, the bureaucratic foul-ups forced her back on the welfare rolls, after she had proudly worked her way free.
"I'm just really frustrated now, ladies," she said, in tears at a recent meeting with the two child care officials who share authority over her case. "I've been working for six years and I never had to deal with anything like this."
 
Big Drop in Rolls Even With Problems
Despite the snags of its start-up year, Wisconsin Works enjoys broad support. It has cut the rolls by 70 percent in the last year alone, while producing no sign of the surging deprivation that some critics feared.
In a recent interview, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson cited the decline in the number of welfare recipients as compelling evidence of the program's success. "I'm extremely happy," Mr. Thompson said. "We expected about 36,000 cases left on the rolls, and we're down to 10,875. It's exceeded any and all expectations."
Mr. Thompson, a three-term Republican who has staked much of his reputation on Wisconsin Works, acknowledged that "we've had some problems," particularly with child care. But he called them inevitable growing pains during "the biggest change in social welfare policy in 60 years," and he said he had moved quickly to fix them.
"Taking that into consideration, it's been handled extremely well," Mr. Thompson said. "There should be no apologies."
J. Jean Rogers, the state official with daily oversight of W-2, said the agencies were good and getting better with experience and smaller caseloads. "It's a matter of, 'Is the glass half-empty or is the glass half-full?' " she said. "I think the customized aspects of W-2 have room to grow. But I think there's 100 times more customized service than there was" under the old welfare system.
State Senator Darling said Governor Thompson had moved quickly to fix problems once they were identified. But John Gardner, a member of the Milwaukee County School Board, argues that the inefficiencies were built into the program. Each of the five private agencies that run the program gets paid a flat fee, no matter how many people they place in jobs. Each serves an exclusive territory where other agencies cannot compete.
And much like a health maintenance organization, each theoretically has an incentive to withhold services. The less they spend, the more their profits rise. "In theory it's a privatized model of efficiency," Mr. Gardner said. "In reality it's a politically gerrymandered cartel." But while Mr. Gardner complains of "an abysmal implementation," he also said the hassles had prompted many recipients to find work on their own. "It works despite itself," he said.
 
Setting the Pace For Welfare Changes
Governor Thompson has run experimental welfare programs since first taking office in 1987. But Wisconsin Works, which went into effect in September 1997, is by far his most ambitious effort. While every state is running a work program, W-2 is unusually bold. It demands work from everyone who receives state aid, virtually without exception. To help make that possible, it has financed thousands of community service jobs, like clerical work at the W-2 agencies, at $673 a month. And it pledges abundant support services to keep people moving up an earnings ladder. State officials say the program will spend 45 percent more per person than the old welfare system.
But administrative difficulties were quick to arise. In child care, one problem stems from the power-sharing arrangement between the county workers who used to run the welfare system and the private agencies that have otherwise displaced them. The private agencies determine child-care eligibility. The county workers review the arrangement and pay the child care providers. By leaving a role for the county workers, the state sought to preserve their jobs. But the result brought conflicts among cultures, procedures and computers.
Thousands of recipients left their appointments at the private agencies, thinking their child care had been approved, only to find a later snag. Many child care providers went unpaid, and some began declining W-2 cases altogether. "The Milwaukee community is rapidly losing faith in our ability to make the child care component of W-2 -- and thus W-2 itself -- work," Ms. Darling and five other Republican legislators wrote Governor Thompson in July.
Ms. Powell's case is instructive. Her problems began in March when the county stopped paying her son's child care center for reasons she has yet to determine. "I went to pick him up, and they said, 'You're not authorized, you can't leave him here any more,' " she said. She then left a full-time job as a security guard for part-time work as a nursing aide.
But when she tried to return to full-time work a few months later, she found herself in a Catch-22. The private agency authorized full-time child care. But given her part-time schedule, the county declined to approve it. "I tried to call six times," she said, "and I never got called back." After her make-shift baby-sitting arrangements kept falling through, Ms. Powell was forced to quit. Now she is unemployed for the first time in years and awaiting a community service job. "This infuriates me," she said.
Richard Buschmann, who oversees child care for the Milwaukee County Department of Human Services, said glitches like those arose in as many as 60 percent of the cases in the program's first six months. Since then, the county replaced its director of human services, added staff members and streamlined its procedures. Though Mr. Buschmann said service had greatly improved, he added: "It's not working well yet. We still have a ways to go."
 
Aiming for Service That's 'Customized'
While the child care problems are widely acknowledged, the quality of the broader case management remains subject to dispute. In theory, the privatized caseworkers are the all-purpose coaches at the program's heart, routing clients to everything from job fairs to drug counseling. In practice, many clients describe their workers as impersonal clerks, urging them to look for work on their own or warehousing them in group motivation classes that lead nowhere. Though the program envisioned that each caseworker would have just 55 clients, a study for the County Board of Supervisors found some caseworkers with more than 150 clients.
Mr. Buschmann, the county official, remains a strong supporter of the program, but he agrees that it has provided less personal attention than it advertises. "Everybody talks that stuff, about the 'individualized approach,' 'customer service,' " he said. "But in the first year, there was such a drive to move the mass through the system, you couldn't do that." With smaller caseloads now, Mr. Buschmann predicts the individual attention will increase.
Julia Taylor, director of YW-Works, one of the five private agencies, said customized casework was already on the rise. "There's a lot more of that going on than people realize," she said.
William Martin, who runs the largest W-2 agency, Employment Solutions, said, "I feel pretty proud about the quality of the casework." But he also said the amount of contact between caseworkers and clients was "all over the waterfront," depending in part on "the ability of the individual to articulate their needs."
 
Plenty of Help, Or Not Enough
Michelle Crawford, 38, said YW-Works had made an extraordinary effort to help her, as she faced the break-up of her marriage and problems with domestic violence. First, it combined her community service work with several months of psychological counseling. Then it placed her in a training program to run a plastics-molding machine. Eight months after joining W-2, Ms. Crawford has a full-time job with a plastics company, starting at $7.40 an hour. "They treated me with respect," she said.
But Ms. Glenn said she received little help when she applied to her agency in August. At the time she was utterly destitute and perhaps more troubled than her caseworker knew. Having moved to Milwaukee three months earlier, she was living in a partly boarded-up house that was under police surveillance for drug activity by neighbors. Without birth certificates for her four young children, she could not enroll them in school. But she says her caseworker told her to spend 30 days looking for a job on her own, with little help or supervision.
Pat DeLessio, a public interest lawyer who helped Ms. Glenn secure a community service job, said her client's case exemplified the system's laissez-faire approach. "They should have helped her get the kids in school," Ms. DeLessio said. "They should have made sure her shelter was stable. And they should have monitored her job-search closely."
Agency officials said they had tried to follow up with Ms. Glenn, but she had not answered their letters.
With or without customized service, many former welfare recipients do seem to be working. But the work is often part-time, low-paying, and quick to end. There are no thorough studies of W-2. But a study of the transition period, by John Pawasarat of the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, found 75 percent of those hired lost their jobs within 9 months. Only 28 percent sustained projected annual earnings of $10,000 for two consecutive quarters.
Ms. Baker's seems an illustrative case. Until the transition to W-2, she had spent 11 years on welfare, giving little thought to employment. But once she was forced to do community service, she went out and found a job on her own. She became a dishwasher at the Bradley Center, Milwaukee's major arena.
But the work is seasonal. And once she found it, her contact with W-2 essentially ended. Although officially she received "case management services" for six months, Ms. Baker does not even know her caseworker's name. Her pay stub shows earnings of $3,555 for the first half of this year, or $483 less than she would have earned in a community service job. She left the Bradley Center for a housekeeping job over the summer, then lost it when her child got sick. Now, once again, she is looking for work on her own.
"They need to work on trying to help people a little more," she said.

HEADLINE: Political Feuds Rack Haiti: So Much for Its High Hopes

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti

 BODY:
Four years ago this month, Haiti's future seemed so promising that people here were dancing in the streets. American troops had just overthrown a brutal dictatorship, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was on his way back from exile, and a procession of foreign aid donors and investors was following in his wake.
Today, those hopes for an era of prosperity and stability have evaporated, and with them the patience of most Haitians. A 16-month political squabble between Mr. Aristide and other leaders of the fracturing Lavalas coalition has left the country without a working government, the population to fend for itself, and Haiti's foreign allies disillusioned and exasperated. 
 In an effort to break the impasse, the United States has sent one high-level emissary after another, with nothing to show for it but broken promises and frustration.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, Anthony Lake, the former national security adviser, and Bill Richardson, the former chief delegate to the United Nations, all have tried to negotiate a settlement -- and all have failed. As a result, the Clinton Administration, which four years ago was hailing Mr. Aristide's restoration as a major foreign policy triumph, has changed its tune.
"It's a national disaster," said Chavannes Jean-Baptiste, leader of the country's most prominent peasant group and a former Aristide ally.
Because of the impasse, President Rene Preval, Mr. Aristide's hand-picked successor, has been unable to get a Government budget drawn up and approved for a second consecutive year.
In the cities, civil servants -- teachers and doctors included -- have gone months without being paid. In rural areas, grievous social problems, like an illiteracy rate that is the highest in the hemisphere and a life expectancy that is the lowest, go unattended but for the work of private relief organizations.
Foreign donors have pledged more than $1 billion in aid, but much of that remains on hold because Government ministries, some now without senior staff, are unable to organize programs or comply with other requirements for spending the money. What is worse, there are no signs that the stalemate will end any time soon.
"All the institutions are paralyzed and the Cabinet is not functioning," Mr. Jean-Baptiste said. "Misery is advancing, public services are lacking, aid is not flowing and there is no budget to confront the emergency. The situation is one of total desperation and confusion, and nobody is opening an exit door."
The crisis began in June 1997, when Prime Minister Rosny Smarth resigned to protest what he described as efforts by the Aristide camp to undermine his program. Since then, Mr. Preval has sought four times without success to nominate a new Prime Minister who can win the approval of Parliament, which is dominated by a left-center party of former allies who accuse Mr. Aristide of reneging on promises of power sharing and of trying to install a dictatorship.
"The heart of the matter is the use Aristide has made of his influence and his domination from the sidelines, with the President's complicity, of many institutions in this country," said Gerard Pierre-Charles, the main leader of the party, the Organization of the People in Struggle. The worse the situation becomes, he added, "the more Aristide likes it, because he has this messianic idea that he and only he will be the one to save Haiti from chaos."
In private, many American policy makers, too, express irritation at what they describe as Mr. Preval's passivity and Mr. Aristide's duplicity, while in public, Washington is showing signs of mounting impatience with the squabbling.
"Frankly, we have been disappointed that Haitian political leaders have taken so long to resolve their differences," Ms. Albright said during a visit here in April. "The Haitian people deserve a democratic form of government and they deserve the ability to have the fruits that the international community is trying to give them."
Mr. Preval declined requests for an interview, and members of Parliament aligned with him were back in their home districts, where communications have been disrupted by Hurricane Georges. Mr. Aristide, who holds no public office and spends most of his time in his walled mansion on the outskirts of the capital, was unavailable for an interview. He was said to be traveling abroad.
On the streets, the mood is one of despair with the situation and anger at political leaders. In a poll the United States Information Service conducted in cities and towns here this summer, nearly three-quarters of those surveyed said they would leave Haiti if they could; more than 60 percent said they did not intend to vote in the next election, and a majority said that elected officials "care nothing at all" about their problems.
"If this were Monaco or Luxembourg, you could just laugh and say it's all a commedia dell'arte," said Frantz Voltaire, who has served as chief of staff to former Prime Minister Robert Malval, who was Mr. Aristide's representative here during the military dictatorship. "But it's not. There is poverty everywhere and growing misery on the streets."
Diplomats and employees of international relief organizations say they worry that the impasse is also eroding faith in democracy. Ordinary Haitians seem unsure whom to blame for the paralysis, but know that because of it, prices are rising, unemployment is growing, salaries are stagnant and the promises of better times made in 1994 are going unfulfilled.
"We were all hoping that something good was going to happen," said Wilner Andre, 35, an unemployed father of four. "But to me, democracy is just a word that the Lavalas Government uses to make money. You vote, and nothing changes, so why bother to vote? The big eaters are still in power."
What appears to be keeping the country afloat, diplomats and political and business leaders say, is the money that Haitians living abroad, especially in the United States and Canada, are sending back home. Those remittances are estimated at $500 million to $700 million this year, or more than double the entire Government budget.
But that money has not been enough to halt a conspicuous slide in every measure of life here. Per capita income has dropped to about $250 a year, and last month, when the United Nations published its annual "human development index," Haiti, already the poorest nation in the hemisphere, had slipped to 159th in the world. At the start of the decade, when Mr. Aristide was first elected to office, after 33 years of dictatorship, Haiti ranked 124th.
Among the poor, people like Donasyon Dieusibon, 33, a fruit vendor and the mother of five, say they can feel that deterioration in their daily life. The new school year, for instance, began on Oct. 5, but Ms. Dieusibon, a widow, is keeping her children at home, even though she recognizes that education is their only hope for a better future.
"Just look at the streets," she said as she tried to sell bananas outside the main post office here. "There's no activity, and so I can't sell anything. That means I can't afford to buy books or supplies or clothes for my children, and so they are not going to attend school this year."
Ordinarily, Haitian diplomats might be able to mitigate some of that damage through lobbying for aid in foreign capitals. But Foreign Minister Fritz Longchamp acknowledged that, because of the impasse, more than half of Haiti's 32 missions abroad are currently without ambassadors, including those in the United States, France and Canada.
For similar reasons, the justice system is also stalled, eroding faith in the rule of law. Judges who have resigned or been dismissed for corruption have not been replaced, meaning that many cases are not being heard, much less decided.
"The whole country is on hold, and if this mess is not resolved soon, we are going to have not only an institutional void, but also a major constitutional crisis," warned Lionel Delatour, leader of a business group that supports economic and political reforms.
"We have had our window of opportunity, but it is closing," he added. "The political actors are unwilling to budge, and civil society is too weak to have its voice heard or to play a broker's role. We are so deep in the hole that we can no longer see how to get out."

HEADLINE: 1998 WORLD SERIES: YANKEES VS. PADRES -- NOTEBOOK;
Braves Lack the Finish Of a Great Champion

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The Atlanta Braves are not playing in New York this weekend, which means they are not playing in the World Series for the third time in their seven-season run as a division champion and therefore will not win the World Series for the sixth time in those seven seasons.
Although the Braves, whose streak goes back to 1991 (and does not include the strike-shortened 1994 season, remain the most consistently good team of the 90's -- the enduringly best since the 1949-64 Yankees -- something has to be missing from the mix that gets them to the post-season year after year, at least something that rears its ugly head in October. 
Conversations with officials from several other clubs elicited views that could explain the Braves' problem this way: The Braves' starting pitching, the best and deepest in the major leagues, dominates in the regular season because no team can match the starting five. In the playoffs, however, rotation depth is less critical, and other teams usually have three solid starters.
With that advantage neutralized, the Braves need more help from their hitters and fielders, and they don't get it often enough. Moreover, errors and other defensive lapses have undermined the Braves' ability to win.
"One thing the Braves have that no one else has is depth in the starting rotation," said Dave Dombrowski, the Marlins' general manager. "Over a 162-game season, that is very difficult to beat. I don't think you can beat them unless you match up the same way. But in a short series most clubs you're playing are going to throw three quality starters at you. The fifth starter is not a factor. The fourth starter may or may not be a factor."
The rest of the team, however, falls short of their pitching in championship status, another general manager said.
"They're not that good a club if you take away their starting pitching," said the general manager, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "If you put their starting pitching on several National League clubs, those clubs would be better. Their bullpen is ordinary at best. Their defense is average at best. If they don't hit home runs, they're going to struggle because they're not going to score. They've done it with starting pitching and timely hitting for years."
An executive of another club suggested that the Braves spend so much money on their starting pitchers that they don't have much left to spend on bolstering their hitting.
"Maybe they have four good hitters," he said. "If the other team's pitching can neutralize those hitters, they can beat them. If you pitch well against them, you have a good chance of beating them because their offense and their bench aren't that great. If you match up with starting pitching, you can neutralize their power."
In the league championship series, the San Diego Padres' pitchers shut down most of the Braves' key hitters. Andres Galarraga had two hits in 21 at-bats for a .095 batting average and four runs batted in. Ryan Klesko had one hit in 12 tries (.083). Chipper Jones batted a relatively torrid .208 but drove in a single run, matching Klesko's output.
Andy Ashby held the Braves to 1 run in 7 innings in the first game, Kevin Brown shut them out on 3 hits in the second and Sterling Hitchcock stymied them in two starts, allowing 1 run and 5 hits in 10 innings.
The Braves have also had critical defensive breakdowns. They hurt the Braves in the league series against Florida last October, and a relative flood of errors killed them against San Diego this year.
From the double error by Andres Galarraga on one play in the first game to Danny Bautista's muffed catch of a fly ball in the last, the Braves self-destructed in the series that sent the Padres to New York this weekend. Eight errors in six games is not the formula for post-season success.
"There are no perfect clubs," Dombrowski observed. But he added, "You tip your cap to the Braves because they're there every year."
Gerry Hunsicker, Houston's general manager, has experienced the post-season the past two seasons and was not ready to find fault with the Braves for their latest loss. He gave credit to the Padres, who also defeated the Astros in the division series.
"I think the Padres were an overlooked team coming into the playoffs," Hunsicker said. "They were underrated. This is a team that for four and a half months was arguably the best team in the National League. Suddenly, in September, they had a slide and everybody forgot about them. We got Randy Johnson and the hype got carried away. The impact Randy would have on our team was overexaggerated."
While everyone was expecting great things from the Astros and the Braves, Hunsicker said, people were underrating the Padres' pitching.
"They have quality starters and the best closer in baseball," he said. "In low-scoring games, if your pitching is going to keep you in the game, then it's just a matter of who rises to the occasion. This season it happens to be Jim Leyritz. Right now, Jim Leyritz is playing like Superman."
 
 
For Lack of a No. 1 Starter
 In the five years of their modern resurgence, the Cleveland Indians have never had a legitimate No. 1 starting pitcher. That may very well be the reason they have not won the World Series and are not playing the World Series in Cleveland this weekend.
"It always helps to have that big No. 1," John Hart, the Indians' general manager, said. "We readily admit we don't have one of those dominant Cy Young marquee guys. But we usually have five or six guys who are good. Maybe they're going to pitch anywhere from 2 to 4. We've done it without a dominant No. 1 guy. Does that keep you out of the World Series? No. Does it keep you from winning it? I don't know."
In their four successive forays into post-season play, the Indians have started Dennis Martinez, Orel Hershiser, Charles Nagy, Ken Hill, Jack McDowell, Jaret Wright, Chad Ogea, Bartolo Colon and Dwight Gooden. At times some of of those pitchers were considered No. 1's, but they were past their prime with the Indians.
"As we built our club," Hart said, "we built it as an American League team -- small ball parks, lack of pitching. We built our club early on around offense. To win and still compete economically, we thought we would sign starting pitchers that would be able to keep us in games and hope to develop front-of-the-rotation starters. Along the line, we tried to sign some guys, but that didn't work out."
The Indians pursued Roger Clemens, John Smoltz and Alex Fernandez as free agents and Pedro Martinez and Randy Johnson in trades. They still await the arrival of a pitcher of that caliber. The system they have built, Hart said, has carried the club to four consecutive division titles and three A.L. championship series.
"It's probably not the perfect world, but you kind of have to deal with what you have to work with," he said. "There's not a bottomless pit where you can go out and say we're going to have a star at every position.
 
Thaw in the Union
 The strong union feeling about players who served as replacement players in spring training of 1995 during the strike is apparently thawing. The melting of bitter feelings can be seen in the post-season shares voted by players on high-finishing teams. For the most part, based on a survey of club votes, players have treated replacement players like anyone else.
The Yankees, for example, voted Shane Spencer, the home run legend, half a full share based on the time he was with the team during the season. Rick Reed of the Mets automatically received a full share because he was with the team all season, but Jeff Tam, a relief pitcher, was voted a share equal to the percentage of the season he spent with the Mets.
Boston players voted pitcher Ron Mahay a one-quarter share, as did the Chicago Cubs with infielder Jason Hardtke. Catcher Mandy Romero will get a partial share based on service time from San Diego and a $3,000 cash award from Boston, where he was traded June 21.
Among players who were not replacements, Randy Johnson, who pitched for Houston the last two months, was voted a full share, and Jim Leyritz will receive $10,000 from Boston's post-season players' pot and about 54 percent of a share from San Diego.
A player automatically receives a full share if he is with a team from June 1, but the Yankees voted Orlando Hernandez a full share even though he missed that date by a couple of days. Hideo Nomo missed by four days, and the Mets voted him a three-fourths share. The Mets acquired Tony Phillips, Willie Blair and Jorge Fabregas on July 31, but the players voted Phillips a three-quarters share and the other two about one-third.

HEADLINE: BRITAIN ARRESTS PINOCHET TO FACE CHARGES BY SPAIN

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

 BODY:
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who reigned over Chile as a dictator for 17 years and came to symbolize the excesses of military rule in Latin America, has been arrested in London after Spain asked that he be extradited for the presumed murders of hundreds of Chilean and Spanish citizens, the British authorities announced yesterday.
General Pinochet, 82, who stepped down as Commander in Chief of the Chilean military seven months ago, was arrested by the British police on Friday night, little more than a week after he arrived in London for surgery on a herniated disc. 
 The highly unusual arrest sets up what promises to be a legal struggle that could have wide implications for the prosecution of alleged human rights violators under international law. It also appeared to break fresh ground in holding former leaders granted immunity in their own countries internationally accountable for human rights abuses committed during their rule.
The arrest warrant said the general was wanted for questioning for "crimes of genocide and terrorism that include murder."
The Chilean Government immediately demanded General Pinochet's release, arguing that he has diplomatic immunity since he sits in the Chilean Senate. But so far the British and Spanish authorities have shrugged off the Chilean protests.
Britain's Interior Ministry said in London that the final judgment on whether to extradite General Pinochet lay with Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, who has up to 40 days to decide. The British authorities refused to say where the general was being held; nor did they set a date for his questioning.
In Chile, where the general took power with American backing after overthrowing the leftist Government of Salvador Allende Gossens in 1973, people were caught off guard and reaction was so far muted except for a few small demonstrations by Pinochet supporters.
To this day, however, Chileans remain deeply divided over the Pinochet legacy. Approximately a third of the country views him as a hero, another third views him as a villain, and the rest voice ambiguous opinions to pollsters.
More than 3,000 Chileans were shot in the streets or "disappeared" during his rule, and a senior member of his Government was imprisoned under United States pressure for the murder of a former Foreign Minister, Orlando Letelier, in Washington in 1976.
But General Pinochet also cast a long shadow in economic affairs, initiating a privatized social security system and other free-market policies that are still models from Argentina to Mexico. Under a Constitution that he guided to enactment, the general was able to become a Senator for Life upon his retirement from the military, a position that afforded him continued political influence and immunity from prosecution.
Relatives of people who disappeared and political opponents have filed lawsuits in Chile seeking to take away his immunity, but they are given little chance of success.
A senior Spanish judicial official said yesterday that Judge Baltasar Garzon issued the international arrest warrant against General Pinochet on Friday after Interpol warned that the former dictator was about to be released from a hospital and would probably leave London.
A British Foreign Office spokesman, who declined to be identified, said the general's arrest was "a judicial matter, one for the police and the magistrates." But he added, "One point that does fall to us: He does not have diplomatic immunity in this country." The spokesman declined any further comment.
An official who spoke on condition of anonymity said General Pinochet had been arrested "at the direct, specific request of the Spanish authorities."
Spanish lawyers said the request for his extradition had been sent to Scotland Yard through Interpol. The request was based on the European Convention on Terrorism, which requires members to help one another in matters related to terrorism.
In Britain, the request presented a quandary for the Labor Government of Tony Blair, whose party, while in the opposition, vocally criticized the Conservatives for allowing two previous visits by General Pinochet.
On both occasions, in 1991 and 1995, when the Conservatives were in power, the general arrived with little publicity in his capacity as the head of the Chilean Army to meet with military contractors. The Labor Party called the first visit "appalling."
Yesterday, however, Labor officials were reluctant to claim any credit and seemed caught between a commitment to honor election pledges and a desire to maintain good trade and diplomatic relations with Chile.
Robin Cook, the Foreign Secretary, cast the detention as a purely judicial act resulting from the extradition request by Spain. Indeed, the Foreign Office said, Mr. Cook told the Chilean Foreign Minister, Jose Miguel Insulza, that the arrest "was entirely a judicial matter, and that the Government has no power to intervene."
The initial arrest warrant was based on a single case of the kidnapping and disappearance of a Chilean leftist leader, Edgardo Henriquez, 35, in 1976. The Spanish judicial official said Judge Garzon was planning to send to the British authorities on Monday the names of 78 other people of various nationalities who were also kidnapped in Chile and taken to Argentina, where they disappeared between 1976 and 1983.
Judge Garzon has also demanded the extradition of various former Argentina junta rulers, but Argentina has refused to abide by warrants. The focus of his investigation is the so-called Condor Plan, in which the military juntas of various Latin American countries allegedly collaborated to eliminate their enemies.
Both President Eduardo Frei of Chile and President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina have resisted the Spanish legal motions, arguing that they infringe on their nations' sovereignty.
Human rights and international law experts expressed enthusiastic support yesterday for the British arrest, and said it could have wide implications.
Legal experts noted that since the Geneva Conventions signed after World War II, all countries theoretically have been obliged to take responsibility for crimes against humanity, thereby denying safe haven to promoters of international crimes like genocide. Nevertheless, suspected war criminals, once granted amnesties in their own countries, have usually been safe from prosecution when they traveled abroad.
But Ruth Wedgwood, a professor at Yale Law School, said: "Extradition law has changed radically in the last 10 or 15 years. Torture and disappearances are considered such gross crimes that they are often held to be subject to international jurisdiction."
"Extradition law used to have an exception for politicial crimes, for ordinary crimes motivated by politics," she added. "But if it is a gross violation of humanitarian standards, there's increased unwillingness to conclude that it was a political crime."
Juan Garces, a Spanish lawyer representing 4,000 victims of the Pinochet rule, said the case against the general was based on international legal principles that there is no immunity for those responsible for crimes against humanity, even if they served as heads of state.
Diane F. Orentlicher, a law professor and director of the War Crimes Research Office at American University in Washington, said the British and Spanish actions put "teeth into the legal principle" that perpetrators of crimes against humanity are international criminals. "The central point of all of this is that crimes against humanity transcend the concerns of the countries where the abuses are committed," she said. "In theory, there should be no safe haven for world class criminals, but the central problem has been the enforcement of the law depends on the mobilization of the world's conscience."
The Chilean Government said yesterday, however, that it would file a formal protest against General Pinochet's arrest. President Frei, in remarks to reporters on Chilean television, said, "We think they are violating diplomatic immunity."

Being Different Hurts

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Young people, even in Dixon, Ill., may be "increasingly enchanted with buying, having, spending and status," as your article notes (front page, Oct. 14).
But even that marketing-spurred enchantment cannot explain the cruelty of peers like the boy you describe who demanded a poor girl's seat on the school bus with the words, "Move it, trailer girl." 
 That kind of cruelty, aimed more and more at those perceived as different, is either fostered or goes unmentioned in homes, schools and houses of worship.
As we in our small congregation in Brooklyn begin another year of children's education, we are, above all, teaching the value of respect for one another, for teachers and for those whom many of us may see as different.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The more pernicious effects of coming from a lower socioeconomic family were missing from your Oct. 14 front-page article on Wendy Williams.
I kept thinking about how I was "tracked" with the less talented children and how later, as my more financially secure friends traveled and took important summer internships during college, I was busy working on a paint crew. 
 Growing up poor in America usually means more than hurt feelings: in several important ways, it means being denied a fair chance.
I was fortunate to have supportive parents and several life-changing public school teachers.
I can't help but wonder how much longer America can afford to deny low-income people the same opportunities everyone else takes for granted.

HEADLINE: THE 105TH CONGRESS;
A Look Back at a Legislative Term

BYLINE: By MONICA BORKOWSKI 

 BODY:
Following is some of the major legislation that the 105th Congress approved or failed to approve. 

WHAT CONGRESS DID:
 
1997
 
BALANCED BUDGET Approved legislation aimed at balancing Federal budget by 2002. The legislation extracted $115 billion in savings over five years from Medicare and slowed the growth of discretionary spending. It included a $24 billion program to provide health care coverage for up to five million uninsured children, to be financed by increasing Federal tax on cigarettes by 15 cents a pack over five years.
 
TAX CUT Approved first Federal tax cut since 1981, $95 billion over five years. Bill included cuts in taxes on capital gains and estates, new tax credits for families with children and tax credits for higher education.
 
FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION Cleared legislation to modernize the F.D.A. and speed up process for approving prescription drugs and medical devices.
 
MEDICARE In Balanced Budget Act, made vast changes in Medicare, offering new health insurance options to elderly, broadening coverage of preventive services and creating financial incentives for managed care plans to serve rural areas.
 
CHEMICAL WEAPONS TREATY Senate approved Chemical Weapons Convention, which bans development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, transfer and use of chemical weapons.
 
GINGRICH REPRIMAND House voted to reprimand Speaker Newt Gingrich and fine him $300,000 for bringing discredit on the House by using tax-exempt money to promote Republican goals and giving House ethics committee untrue information for its inquiry.
 
PAY RAISE Approved a 2.3 percent cost-of-living pay increase for members of Congress, the first increase in five years, adding more than $3,000 to base pay of $133,000.
 
1998
 
TRANSPORTATION Approved largest public works program in nation's history -- more than $200 billion over next six years for roads, bridges, buses, subways and ferries in virtually every Congressional district.
 
INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE Passed legislation overhauling the I.R.S. Law gives new rights to taxpayers who get into serious disputes with I.R.S., establishes outside board to oversee I.R.S. management and policies, and strengthens role of taxpayer advocate, an internal ombudsman for complaints from individuals.
 
HIGHER EDUCATION ACT Approved legislation that reduces interest rate on Federal college loans to lowest level in 17 years. Bill expands Pell grants for college students, includes money for improved teacher training and recruitment, and allows colleges to notify parents when students are caught in drug and alcohol violations.
 
PUBLIC HOUSING Amended 1937 law that established the framework for public housing. New legislation revamps public housing and gives local housing officials more authority.
 
I.M.F. FINANCING Approved $18 billion for International Monetary Fund with new restrictions on its loans to foreign governments.
 
FARM ASSISTANCE Agreed to include $6 billion in emergency farm aid as part of $60 billion agriculture spending bill.
 
TAX CUT Approved $9.2 billion in tax cuts over 10 years. Package renews several expiring business tax credits and provides limited relief to farmers, self-employed people and some families.
 
NATO EXPANSION Senate voted to expand North Atlantic Treaty Organization to include Poland, Hungary and Czech Republic.
 
 
IMPEACHMENT House voted to begin full-scale, open-ended inquiry into possible grounds for impeachment of President Clinton.
 
 
WHAT CONGRESS DIDN'T DO:
 
TOBACCO Senate failed to cut off Republican filibuster of legislation to regulate tobacco products. Bill would have raised price of cigarettes $1.10 a pack over five years, cost tobacco companies $516 billion over 25 years, given Government new authority to regulate tobacco advertising, and imposed penalties if smoking by teen-agers did not decline.
 
MANAGED CARE House-passed bill to define patients' rights and set uniform nationwide standards for health insurance died in Senate.
 
ABORTION Senate, 64 to 36, failed by 3 votes to override Presidential veto of bill banning a form of late-term procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion. House voted to override veto, 296 to 132.
 
FAST-TRACK AUTHORITY House failed to renew negotiating authority that would allow President to negotiate trade agreements that Congress could accept or reject but not amend.
 
EDUCATION SAVINGS ACCOUNTS Passed legislation expanding a program that would allow contributions of up to $2,000 a year to special savings accounts for students in elementary and secondary schools. Money would have to be used for expenses like tutoring, computers and school tuition. President vetoed the bill on the ground that it weakened public education.
 
CAMPAIGN FINANCE House approved bill that would ban unlimited, unregulated donations to political parties and curb issue-advocacy commercials by outside groups in the 60 days before an election. Senate failed to break a Republican filibuster on similar bill.
 
BANKRUPTCY House passed bill to overhaul bankruptcy system and make it more difficult for consumers to walk away from debts. Bill died after Senate Democrats opposed it and White House threatened a veto. MONICA BORKOWSKI

HEADLINE: EASY MONEY: A special report.;
For Russia and Its U.S. Bankers, Match Wasn't Made in Heaven

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN and TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
The House of Unions, like so many buildings in Russia, has served many different masters. In the 18th century, a Crimean prince commissioned its construction in Moscow. Russian nobles later converted it to a private club. Lenin, Stalin and Brezhnev lay in state behind its bright green facade.
And in June, as Russia lurched toward a financial crisis that set off global shock waves, the House of Unions was rented for a glittering celebration of capitalism, with one of the country's most ardent bankers, Goldman, Sachs & Company, as its host. Goldman flew in former President George Bush, paying him more than $100,000, and entertained Russia's former Prime Minister. But between toasts to United States-Russian ties, the talk was about what really mattered to Goldman and many Wall Street brethren: deals. 
 True, Russia was a mess, the Government's bank accounts were almost empty and even the postal system was near collapse. But Goldman wanted to become Russia's leading deal maker, paid handsomely to finance the Government and newly private businesses. Now was the time to prove that Goldman could come through with money in a crisis.
So in the days preceding its elegant soiree, Goldman helped the Government raise money by selling $1.25 billion in bonds. A few weeks later, it arranged a complex deal in which short-term debt was exchanged for long-term debt to give Russia financial breathing room.
It was not enough. By late August, the Russian Government stopped paying what it owed on much of its debt. Buyers of the bonds that Goldman sold now hold nearly worthless paper. Goldman itself escaped the blood bath: in the course of those bond deals it earned tens of millions of dollars in fees and protected hundreds of millions of dollars it had at stake in Russia. When the Government defaulted, Goldman said its losses were "absolutely minimal."
Senior Goldman executives expressed regret that Russia's economic program collapsed and that the deals that bear Goldman's imprimatur did not always work as intended. But they defended the firm's role there as "very constructive" and attributed the country's troubles to problems that had little to do with investment banking. Goldman maintains a small office in Russia.
But the firm's troubled bond deal and the skillful protection of its own money are a window on the role that many investment banks played in the breathless rise and fall of the newly liberated Russian economy. To critics, including Russian officials, analysts and some investment bankers who worked in Russia, Wall Street helped hook Russia on easy money, rarely saying no or advising clients to take it slow. They fed the seemingly insatiable appetite for borrowed money.
Bankers helped the Russian Government borrow billions from foreign investors before it could reliably collect taxes to pay them back. Bankers flattered the country's oligarchs, an emerging class of elite businessmen, with generous loans that many commercial banks shunned as too risky. They helped regional governments raise money for farms through "agro bonds," even though the system of money-draining Soviet-style collectives never ended.
With the help of investment bankers, Russia built a roaring bond market, but never developed a bricks-and-mortar banking system that provided loans the conventional way. Nor did Russia attract much investment from multinational companies. Such companies have committed about $8.7 billion to the country, while Russia's governments and businesses have incurred more than four times that much in short-term debt that must be repaid within a year.
"What the Russian problem reflects is that today's bankers often don't have long-lasting concerns about customer-client relations," said Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve and an occasional adviser to Russian government officials. "You just do the deal and get out."
Mr. Volcker noted that Russia was part of a broader problem in many emerging markets, where local companies and governments have tried to raise money quickly by issuing securities even before they are ready to handle the demands of shareholders and debt payments. "Greed prevails over prudence," he said.
Russia's experience stands in sharp contrast to the developing world's other heavyweight, China. In the last seven years, foreign companies have invested about $181 billion in China, much of it to finance long-term industrial joint ventures or wholly owned foreign factories. Though investment bankers eagerly knocked at the door, Beijing has restricted the freedom of its companies and local governments to borrow money abroad, fearing such money could leave as quickly as it came.
Some Wall Street bankers acknowledge that in pursuit of profits they glossed over some warning signs about Russia -- corporate corruption, failure to pay loans on tts. Many bankers acknowledge privately that they courted Russia more eagerly, and sometimes with less discretion, than they did many other darlings of the developing world, including many countries where capitalism had much longer to gestate.
"In a short time, we went from having a sovereign government that was not considered credit worthy to a situation in which virtually every regional government and every top company was coming to the investment banking community or being approached by them to talk about stocks and bonds," said Jim Dannis, head of European emerging markets for Salomon Smith Barney. "We very rapidly had an oversupply of services, followed by a sudden collapse."
 
The Rush
A Market Ripe For the Picking
From November 1996, when J. P Morgan and SBC-Warburg jointly marketed Russia's first international bond since the days of the czar, to August, when the country defaulted on its debt, there was a stampede of bond and stock deals. The rush was so great that bankers sometimes nearly tripped over themselves in pursuit of clients that some thought marginal even at the time.
In the summer of 1997, for example, many leading investment bankers crowded first-class sections on Aeroflot flights from Moscow to the central Siberian city of Irkutsk, where the soil was underlain with permafrost and a local energy company, Irkutskenergo, was thinking of raising money abroad.
Managers at the power plant had so many suitors that they made bankers prove their mettle: Those who wanted to underwrite Irkutskenergo's bond were required to provide up-front loans of $50 million, then guarantee in writing that the company would pay interest rates only modestly higher than what the United States Government pays, bankers who competed for the business said. Most scoffed, but several investment banks accepted Irkutskenergo's terms. SBC-Warburg, the Swiss-British investment bank, eventually won the company's nod to underwrite the bond.
There were a wave of stock deals, too. Shares of 28 Russian companies, including a department store, several banks, half a dozen energy companies and a few industrial concerns, were offered to the public by big Wall Street names including Salomon, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, and Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette and trade on the New York Stock Exchange through direct or indirect listings. All those Russian stocks now trade at one-fifth, one-tenth, even one-twentieth of their offering prices, meaning that investors who bought in early and held have lost most of their money.
For an immature market, Russia also took on some of the financial trappings of developed countries, with Wall Street help.
For example, Credit Suisse First Boston, the Swiss-American investment bank, pioneered a way for foreign speculators to buy and sell high-interest Russian government debt. The bank was one of the most active traders in Russia, adding to an already overheated market. It was also one of the biggest sellers of Russian debt derivatives to foreign investors, earning big profits in 1996 and 1997 but losing what analysts expect will amount to $500 million to $2 billion this year because of its heavy exposure in Russia after the country defaulted.
Indeed, nearly every big Wall Street firm had an active and growing operation in Russia before the collapse. From the start, however, Goldman, Sachs stood out. In 1992, under its chief executive, Robert E. Rubin, who is now the United States Treasury Secretary, Goldman was named banking adviser to Boris N. Yeltsin's new Government, recruited to help attract foreign investment. Business was slow, however, and Goldman pulled out of Russia entirely in 1994, angering some senior Russian officials, bankers said.
When Russian markets took off two years later, however, Goldman rushed back in -- and opened its checkbook to make temporary loans as a prelude to winning investment banking business. Goldman's willingness to shell out big, up-front loans bolstered Russia's confidence that Wall Street was unlikely to shut off the financing spigot, and that even companies with spotty track records could count on a flow of money from abroad.
Investors -- including big mutual funds and hedge funds -- also complain that Goldman was so eager to prove its underwriting prowess to the Russian Government that it flooded the international market for Russian bonds in the final weeks before the country defaulted. Moreover, Goldman used a bond deal to pay back one of its own temporary loans. It also used $550 million of its own capital to create momentum for its second big bond deal, but reduced that exposure to Russian bonds shortly after the deal was complete. Those moves raised some concerns among investors, especially because the bonds are now worth much less than they were when they were first sold.
But Glenn Earle, a Goldman managing director who oversees the firm's Russian business as head of its new markets team, dismisses such criticism as "largely carping from competitors and the misrepresentation of sound transactions with the advantage of 20/20 hindsight."
"We made a very significant impact in the Russian market," Mr. Earle said. "We had the very high-profile assignments, the most difficult ones, which we were pitching for along with all the other major banks. It is obviously extremely unfortunate that the market turned out this way. But the speed and extent of the collapse was both unforeseen and unforeseeable by our competitors and ourselves."
Still, the firm's tactics were among the most aggressive of Western banks scouting business in Russia's still-untapped market, other bankers said. Goldman, for example, made loans as sweeteners to Russian companies that were considered by most commercial banks to be risky borrowers. The idea was to lock up new investment banking in the future by advancing them money, a practice common to many, but not all, of its investment banking rivals.
Goldman officials said that they were not eager to make such loans and that they fended off many Russian demands for cheap short-term financing. But they said that in some cases they considered it the price of making business contacts in Russia's fledgling banking market.
Goldman made loans to at least four clients, the oil giant Yukos, the Russian banks Inkombank and Menatep and its largest client, the Russian Government. The firm said those loans were often arranged in conjunction with other Western banks, and that its chief rivals recruited or tried to recruit the same clients.
 
The Oligarchs
Goldman Courts A Young Tycoon
The loans sped Goldman's rush into Russia's feverish market. An early target: companies controlled by the oligarchs, businessmen who control most of the country's big industries. A few such businessmen have acknowledged that they took control of Russian national companies in auctions that were deeply flawed, allowing them to buy once-prized national energy and mining companies at fire sale prices. Analysts suspect that many big Russian conglomerates have siphoned cash from the companies they took over, putting it in foreign accounts.
Russian officials speak openly of their worries that the conglomerates, many of them publicly listed, often flouted the law. "Most of the companies were ignoring most of the regulations and used to violate them all of the time," said Dmitri Vasiliev, who recently resigned as chairman of Russia's Federal Commission for the Securities Market. "It's not easy to enforce securities laws here because we don't have the courts we need to prosecute violators."
Eager to forge alliances with businessmen who could one day prove to be Rockefellers or Gettys, Goldman sought to develop close relations with Menatep. The bank was the financing arm in the empire of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a 35-year-old, tough-talking businessman who controlled one of the country's biggest business networks, including Yukos and other big oil concerns. Goldman's calling card: a $200 million loan for Menatep.
Bankers who have had direct dealings with Mr. Khodorkovsky said that he used Menatep and Yukos to wangle cash out of smaller companies in which Menatep had big equity stakes. Some of those subsidiary companies are publicly listed, and they have minority shareholders who do not benefit from profits at Yukos or Menatep. Yukos has also pledged much of its projected short-term earnings as collateral to go on a huge borrowing binge, analysts said, raising serious doubts about the company's ability to pay its debts.
Mr. Khodorkovsky, as well as Menatep and Yukos officials in Moscow, declined repeated interview requests by telephone and fax. A lawyer for the company in Washington declined to comment, and was unable to obtain a response from company representatives.
Yukos had approached several banks, including Morgan Stanley and Chase Manhattan, seeking a $500 million loan in the summer of 1997 -- some more than once -- but was repeatedly turned away. Then Goldman entered the picture. Late last year, Goldman arranged for a group of banks, including Credit Lyonnais and Merrill Lynch, to join in lending Yukos $500 million, with oil-export earnings used as collateral, in advance of a proposed bond offering.
The banks had hoped to repackage the loan as a security and sell it to other investors. But as was often the case in Russia, their ardor was not matched by market demand: Much of the loan remains on their books, meaning that Yukos still owes them money. While Yukos missed a debt payment last spring, putting the loan into technical default, Goldman says the payments are now current, and does not consider it a loss.
Goldman's help in raising money for Yukos had a direct impact on some American companies. The Dart Management Company, which oversees Russian investments of the Michigan industrialist Kenneth B. Dart, has stakes in several formerly indepedent oil companies that Yukos now controls.
E. Michael Hunter, Dart's manager in Russia and a former banker, said Yukos routinely squeezed profits out of its new subsidiaries by forcing them to sell oil to the parent company at below-market prices. Yukos then resold the oil abroad at market prices and collected the profits at the expense of its subsidiaries.
Mr. Hunter said he wrote letters to Goldman's chairman and chief executive, Jon S. Corzine, and the heads of other banks in the lending syndicate detailing Yukos's business practices. He urged the banks not to accept the disputed oil exports as collateral for the loan they made to Yukos. Mr. Hunter said his pleas were rejected by the banking syndicate's lawyer.
"I think they are horribly bad at doing due diligence," Mr. Hunter said of Goldman and Yukos's other bankers. "They were moved by greed, frankly. They preferred to hitch their horse to these guys rather than to face the truth."
Goldman officials said that they believed that Yukos acted legally under Russian law, though the firm declined to discuss the details of its relationship with the client.
 
The Investors
So Many New Bonds, So Little Confidence
Since the default in August, investors in Russian bonds have criticized Goldman and another top adviser to Moscow, J. P. Morgan, for their work in issuing Russian bonds. Investors and some rival bankers argue that bond issues underwritten by those two firms swamped an already-soggy bond market, accelerating a loss of investor confidence.
By the spring of this year, Russia found it nearly impossible to issue any more ruble-denominated bonds in its domestic market. After a flood of issues over three years that left Moscow struggling to pay interest on tens of billions of dollars in borrowings, investors lost faith and declined to buy more short-term Russian debt. The Government was also having great difficulty collecting taxes. So, it sought bankers who would help find new sources of foreign money. Before the summer, Russia had issued a cumulative total of $4.3 billion in medium- and long-term dollar bonds overseas, and that market was viewed as potentially much larger.
To the Russians, Goldman was the key. It underwrote a $1.25 billion issue of dollar-denominated bonds known as Eurobonds in June -- the first new dollar bonds Russia managed to sell since the fall, before Asia's turmoil spread. Goldman also arranged a $6.4 billion bond swap in July, which allowed investors in Russia's short-term ruble debt to exchange their holdings for longer-term dollar bonds. This offered at least temporary breathing space for the Government.
Combined with a separate $2.5 billion Eurobond issue underwritten by J. P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank in late June, the investment banks tripled the total supply of Russia's dollar bonds in just six weeks -- from $4.3 billion to nearly $15 billion -- despite growing investor squeamishness about emerging markets.
Many bankers judge the merits of a bond or stock deal by whether prices rise or at least hold firm after the issue is sold to investors. That's because clients do not want to see the market value of their securities plummet, which makes it harder to raise money later. Russia's summer bond deals did not pass that price test: while the new issues prompted a brief market rally, they soon tumbled.
J. P. Morgan's Russia Eurobond index gives the tally: the Russian benchmark bond price hovered above $100 all year until the new issues began reaching the market in June. By late July, just before the giant Goldman swap of ruble bonds for dollar bonds, the benchmark price had fallen to just above $80. But it was soon after that Goldman bond swap, in late July, that the bottom fell out. The crash to about $50 directly preceeded Russia's default.
In fact, some investors in Russian dollar bonds complain that the deals contributed to the default: With the international bond market collapsing along with the domestic one, the Russian Government saw another of its channels for raising money blocked, perhaps concluding that it had little left to lose by defaulting.
Steve Merrell, a manager for the IDS Global Bond Fund and an active investor in Russian dollar bonds, said that underwriters torpedoed the market with the deluge of new issues, undercutting prices.
"In hindsight there was no plan," Mr. Merrell said. "Just take as much money as the market will give and hope it holds together."
A senior J. P. Morgan banker responsible for the firm's business in the Russian region said that his institution acted with good faith in Russia and that the firm considered the June bond deal it underwrote to be a success.
Likewise, Michael Sherwood, head of Goldman's emerging-markets syndicate desk in London, argued that Goldman's June bond deal was well received by investors, selling out in less than an hour and raising much-needed money for Russia at a tough time.
The July debt swap, he said, fell short of Goldman's goal of relieving Russia's domestic debt burden, though he said that it was the right thing to do. The reason the swap failed, he said, was because it was too small, not too large. If investors had opted to swap more of their short-term ruble debt for long-term dollar bonds, the deal might have allowed Russia to continue to pay interest on all its debt, avoiding default. He said he suspected that investors might have chosen not to participate in Goldman's swap because they had a false sense of confidence that Russia would continue to honor its high-interest ruble debt, a favorite source of income for speculative hedge funds. Many also may have hoped that the International Monetary Fund would pump enough money into Russia to insure that it did not fail.
Whatever the merits for Russia, the deals were good for Goldman. The firm earned fees of about $56 million for arranging the July debt swap alone, rival bankers say, though they add that that fee is standard in the industry for the work performed.
Part of the proceeds Russia raised from the June bond issue also went to pay off Goldman's half-share of $500 million in short-term financing known as a bridge loan to the Russian Government late last year. That loan, Goldman officials acknowledge, was made to put its name at the front of the list of banks jostling to be named advisers and underwriters for the Government. Goldman officials said they had an agreement with the Government to have the loan repaid as soon as Russia raised money through a foreign bond offering. Goldman was the underwriter for the first such offering made after the loan was extended.
Rival bankers and investors say the bridge loan raises the question of a conflict of interest because Goldman, with nearly 4 percent of its partners' capital tied up in that one loan, was highly motivated to market the June bond deal -- and make sure that it was big enough for Russia to pay Goldman back. Goldman itself at that time was preparing to issue shares to the public, a move that would require the private partnership to open its books to scrutiny for the first time in its 130-year history. A large bridge loan to the Russian Government, unsecured by collateral and made at a time of considerable turmoil in emerging markets worldwide, would have raised a red flag for brokerage firm analysts and credit rating agencies, which view that kind of lending as high risk.
Goldman also had a great deal of its own capital at stake in the second bond deal, but managed to take it off the table well before the August default. The firm said that it sought to generate momentum for the July debt swap by buying ruble-denominated securities in the days leading up to the swap for the purpose of including them in the swap transaction -- a standard, though somewhat risky, underwriting activity, not altogether unlike a publisher snapping up books from stores to try to get the title on the best-seller list. After the swap was completed, that left Goldman with a store of newly minted Russian dollar bonds valued at about $550 million. Goldman disclosed in financial documents that it had the right to participate in the swap offering in this way.
But the story has another twist: Even as Goldman proclaimed publicly as recently as its elegant House of Unions party that it was in Russia for the long term, the firm appears to have had limited faith in the country's financial future. Goldman confirms that its trading position on Russian debt went from "quite long" in the days around the swap to "flat" or even "short" by August, meaning that it substantially trimmed its $550 million holdings of Russian bonds or even had trading positions that would have benefited from a fall in prices of those bonds.
Goldman officials declined to talk in detail about the trading the firm does on its own account. But officials said the international dollar bond market was large, accommodating large buy and sell orders each day, and that Goldman was an active trader in that market. The firm, these officials said, frequently buys large blocks of bonds and sells them to investors when it thinks the price is right, a practice they describe as a routine part of Goldman's core business.
Rival bankers agree that Goldman would not have been wise to invest lots of money in Russian dollar bonds at such a volatile time -- though other firms do often keep a store of bonds in which they are dealers to facilitate trading. But several bankers who followed the transaction noted that Goldman accumulated its holdings of Russian bonds specifically to create momentum for its swap deal, then quickly sold the bonds when the deal was done, a sequence that Goldman does not deny. Goldman officials said that market demand for Russian dollar bonds was still strong when it trimmed its position. But other bankers said Goldman's heavy selling almost certainly worsened the sharp drop in Russian dollar bond prices in the days following the debt swap.
Moreover, by quickly selling off its own holdings just after it led investors to buy the same securities suggests that it was worried more about the firm's own money than the long-term interests of its client, the Russian Government, these bankers say.

HEADLINE: As Elections Near, Both Parties Reassess Prospects

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Just over two weeks from Election Day, Republicans are retreating from their hope that the White House scandal will drive huge gains for their party, while some newly confident Democrats are daring to predict that they will even pick up Congressional seats this year.
As a volatile election season enters its final stretch, strategists in both parties said this week that the environment for candidates seems to have returned to that of January, before the scandal broke: Most incumbents are still widely favored to win, and there are no overarching issues playing to one party's advantage. 
 Many strategists in both parties agree that, for now, it appears that Republicans, who hold a thin 11-seat majority in the House, will pick up no more than a dozen seats there, perhaps far fewer. These experts also expect that the Republicans will fall short of a net gain of five Senate seats, which would give the party the magic 60 votes needed to cut off a Democratic filibuster.
As recently as late August, after President Clinton admitted that he had had an inappropriate relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky and had misled the public about it, Republicans and Democrats alike boldly offered scenarios of how the matter could cost Democrats dozens of House seats and perhaps five Senate seats.
But now, instead of chastising Mr. Clinton, many Democratic candidates are waiting anxiously for results of a poll being conducted this weekend for the House campaign of former Representative Jay Inslee in Washington State. Mr. Inslee is the only Democrat broadcasting a television commercial that attacks his opponent for dragging out the impeachment inquiry. If the poll finds that Mr. Inslee is gaining support, other Democrats may run similar advertisements.
Still, as lawmakers who were stranded in Washington forging a budget deal headed back to their districts to campaign this weekend, there was great uncertainly -- and a feeling that more political gyrations lie ahead. Political professionals and candidates in both parties said they could not recall a in which where there was so much uncertainty over how to proceed so close to the election. The next few days will be critical as candidates scramble to buy their final waves of television commercials and put in place those messages for the all-important close of their campaigns.
"It's unprecedented in my experience how unsettled the national environment is two weeks from a national election," said Steve Elmendorf, the chief of staff to Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the minority leader. "This thing could tip either way."
Ed Brookover, who as political director of the National Republican Congressional Committee offers a more upbeat assessment than many in his party, said he expected Republicans to gain House seats "in the 10-to-15-plus range." His forecast of gains, he said, was now "not as big as in that last week in August but certainly bigger than we ever expected last June."
Mr. Brookover's counterpart at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Paul Frick, said: "I feel fairly optimistic. What we know right now is that the same races that we thought were in play in January are in play today. We haven't had many additions to our list of vulnerable incumbents."
This is a significant shift -- at least in expectations. Even this late in the campaign, some Republican candidates were clinging to the idea that the Clinton scandal would be their ticket to Capitol Hill, said Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster.
"There is this fundamental belief that this alarm clock is going to go off and everybody is going to wake up and say, 'We really despise this guy Clinton, and anybody whose been around him we're throwing out,' " Mr. Fabrizio said. "It's just not going to happen."
Republicans have been forced to reassess their prospects because voters have made clear that they want the nation to put the scandal behind it. And with the hardy economy and no galvanizing issues to arouse the electorate, the dynamic seems to favor incumbents.
Another factor that suggests a status quo outcome involves the realities of the field this year: There are relatively few races in which no incumbent is running, usually the most competitive contests. Prospects for a major shift have also diminished because there are well under 100 truly competitive House races this year, probably fewer than than 50.
"The fact that we're holding our own is a real break for us," said Jon Hutchens, a Democratic media consultant based in Denver whose company is handling about 40 races.
Some Democratic strategists are counseling their candidates to come up with messages that do not simply attack Republicans for trying to prolong an impeachment inquiry but meld that notion with the idea that by emphasizing the scandal Republicans are giving short shrift to important policy matters.
"All it takes is one to start a flood," Saul Shorr, Mr. Inslee's media consultant, said of the prospect that other Democrats may follow his candidate's lead and denounce the impeachment proceedings. "Republican incumbents who are in marginal districts with suburban bases outside the South should be concerned."
Rather than wait for the poll results on the Inslee race, another Democratic challenger, Ralph Neas, in suburban Maryland, began broadcasting a radio advertisement that castigates Representative Constance A. Morella for voting for an open-ended impeachment inquiry. Mr. Neas has an uphill battle and clearly is hoping that the move will enliven his campaign.
"I favor censuring the President but then getting on with the business of Government," Mr. Neas says in the advertisement. "The facts don't justify an impeachment."
Despite a resurgence of confidence, there is no reason for jubilation among Democrats -- only relief that things do not look worse. Few Democrats dare to boldly predict, as some did early this year, that their party will retake the House. And most strategists on both sides are still expecting Republican gains, but ones that are more modest than even seemed realistic a few weeks ago.
Mindful that the dynamics could shift yet again, Mr. Brookover said in an interview on Friday, "I've never seen a climate where with 17 days to go there's not a clear picture about what you need to do to win."
And Mr. Hutchens put it this way: "Here we are, two weeks out, and no one has a clue either on an outcome or a solid handle on how you're going to influence that outcome. The vast majority of campaigns on both sides probably wish Clinton would go to Bulgaria for a couple of weeks -- at least it would all be less unpredictable."
While most candidates are now reluctant to use public speeches or advertisements to try to turn the Lewinsky scandal to their advantage, Democrats and Republicans are planning to use the matter in more discreet mailings and telephone calls and other efforts to embolden their hard-core voters and get them to the polls.
The Democratic pitch is that Republicans are unfairly dragging out the impeachment inquiry; the Republican pitch is to link Democratic candidates to a President who they say has brought disgrace to the office and the nation.
The Democratic Party is about to launch a comprehensive radio campaign that will be concentrated in black and Hispanic areas. The advertisements will feature Hillary Rodham Clinton and Jesse Jackson, who will implore loyal Democrats to vote. "The Republicans are hoping you won't bother to vote," Mrs. Clinton says in one commercial. "I'm Hillary Clinton and I'm asking you to prove them wrong."
With recent polls showing a backlash against Republicans pressing for the impeachment inquiry, the party's candidates are no longer raising the matter in their commercials. But some Republicans are still arguing that the scandal could play to their benefit, particularly in conservative districts in the South.
Significant gains for the Republicans on Election Day would make it harder for Democrats to turn back any move toward the impeachment of Mr. Clinton.
"Not to acknowledge it is to ignore the elephant sitting in the room," Mr. Brookover said. Like some Democrats, he said the best option for Republicans may be to talk about the scandal indirectly. "It's a matter of putting it in people's face, 'This President has done something wrong,' or alluding to it, 'We need to deal with it so we can move on.' "
Since the party that controls the White House traditionally loses seats in midterm elections, Democrats are already planning to declare victory even if they suffer moderate losses.
"My benchmark is the six-year-itch," said Jill Alper, political director of the Democratic National Committee. She laid down the party line early by citing the tradition of voters getting restless with a President and his party after six years. "Losing less than 26 House seats and losing less than six Senate seats is a huge victory for this party," she said.

HEADLINE: Pay Was Up in 'Gilded' Year For University Leaders

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
University presidents still do not come close to basketball players or venture capitalists in earnings, but a growing number have compensation packages in the half-million-dollar range once thought of as the preserve of corporate executives.
Three private university presidents -- at Rockefeller University, Vanderbilt and the University of Pennsylvania -- received pay and benefit packages greater than $500,000 in the 1996-97 school year, according to a study by The Chronicle of Higher Education in this week's issue. 
 Ten more private universities, including four in the New York area -- Columbia, New York University, Yale and Hofstra -- paid their presidents between $400,000 and $500,000, and 33 more paid between $300,000 and $400,000, The Chronicle said, making it the "most gilded" year since it started reporting executive pay six years ago.
Forty-six top executives at private universities were paid more than $300,000 in 1996-97, up from 38 the previous academic year.
Other universities in the New York region whose total presidential compensation exceeded $300,000 in 1996-97 included Long Island University and Dowling College on Long Island, Princeton University and Ithaca College.
"It is striking how many are earning at that level," said Scott Jaschik, The Chronicle's managing editor. "It's been going up even though a few of the biggies are gone," he added, referring to Peter Diamandopoulos, the former president of Adelphi University, and John R. Silber, the former president of Boston University, whose compensation packages of more than $500,000 made them the previous kings of The Chronicle's survey and the targets of faculty anger.
The disclosure of Mr. Diamandopoulos's rich compensation -- in 1995-96 he received $523,636 in salary and deferred bonuses -- helped set in motion the New York Board of Regents investigation that removed him from office.
The presidential salaries have generally increased faster than faculty salaries. Although some faculty members, particularly in areas like business and medicine, have six-figure salaries, the average salary and compensation for a full-time faculty member at a private institution in 1996-97 was $74,132, according to the American Association of University Professors.
In general, university officials defended the pay packages, citing the demands of the university president's job.
"Some of these people run $2 billion operations with 15,000 employees that are really major corporations, though they are nonprofit," said Morton O. Schapiro, an economist who studies higher education and is a dean at the University of Southern California.
Many officials also pointed to the robust health of their institutions -- rising numbers of student applications, hefty fund-raising, strong research and successful faculty recruitment -- as signs of their chief executives' prowess.
Richard M. Furlaud, the former chairman of the board of trustees at Rockefeller University, said the university had been in "bad shape" when it asked Torsten N. Wiesel, a Nobel laureate and chairman of its faculty, to take over when David Baltimore resigned as president in 1991. "We were running a substantial deficit and had a lot of problems," he said. "He did so rather reluctantly," Mr. Furlaud added, "but he did an absolutely spectacular job."
Although Rockefeller's board could not persuade Dr. Wiesel to accept a raise during most of his tenure, Mr. Furlaud said, it finally pushed him into taking a $50,000 raise (to $350,000) and a $133,333 bonus. With other benefits, that raised his total compensation to $546,966, making him No. 1 on The Chronicle's list. Dr. Wiesel steps down as president next month.
John R. Hall, chairman of the Vanderbilt board, told The Chronicle that the university's reputation and endowment had bloomed under Joe B. Wyatt's chancellorship. His $525,496 in compensation put him second in The Chronicle's survey.
And P. Roy Vagelos, the chairman of the University of Pennsylvania's trustees, said Judith Rodin, Penn's president, was "one of the top five" presidents in the country and had fully earned her compensation, The Chronicle said. Her $514,878 compensation placed her third on The Chronicle's list.
Martin Lipton, chairman of the trustees at New York University, said L. Jay Oliva, N.Y.U.'s president, was "a principal architect" of the university's transformation from a "regional university to a prestigious national research institution." Dr. Oliva received a salary of $428,469 and $23,174 in benefits.
Not everyone is convinced that the high level of pay is appropriate.
Saul B. Cohen, a member of the New York Board of Regents and a former president of Queens College, said he thought such salaries were "out of line."
"The notion that a university president should have salaries comparable to those in industry is fallacious," he said. "What it is reflecting is the professionalization of the university presidency, which I think is inappropriate."
But Tom Ingram, president of the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges, said, "There are top corporate executives who compare what they do with their university presidents and say they wouldn't trade jobs for a minute," he said.
The Chronicle said that only two presidents of private research universities -- Norman Lamm of Yeshiva University and H. Patrick Swygert of Howard University -- had total earnings of less than $200,000 in the 1996-97 year.
The Chronicle's survey of 475 private colleges and universities, which was based on filings with the Internal Revenue Service, did not include public universities, where pay is substantially lower and where about 80 percent of all college students are enrolled.
At the State University of New York, for example, which has 64 campuses and about 400,000 students, the chancellor's salary is $250,000. At the City University of New York, with 200,000 students, the chancellor's salary is $178,523.
Mr. Ingram, of the Association of Governing Boards, said he believed that the leaders of most public universities were "under-appreciated and under-compensated."

According to a survey of 475 private colleges and universities, 46 chief executives made more than $300,000 in 1996-97, up from 25 in 1993-94. The 10 highest in salary, benefits and special payments:

HEADLINE: A Billion, A Trillion, Whatever

BYLINE: By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
THE concept of a trillion has shifted in recent weeks from a fuzzy, imprecise and somewhat abstract notion into a hard-edged number like, say, 47 or 254 or 7,453.
Indeed, because of the Long-Term Capital Management fiasco, trillion has become the next big thing. (Of course, the Federal budget passed $1 trillion several years ago, but nobody pays attention to it.)
Before this recent shift in consciousness, a trillion, at least in everyday usage, was an expression more akin to zillion, gazillion and jillion. It was a way of connoting scads, heaps, plenitude and humongosity. In this it was like a light year. No one ever experienced a light year and no one ever saw a trillion anything. It was a poetic concept like all the stars in the heavens and all the grains of sand on the beaches. 
 But when Long-Term Capital Management's troubles became newsworthy in early October, it was reported that the firm had entered into "exotic financial transactions" valued at $1.25 trillion. Derivatives and forward contracts might not be universally comprehensible, but the basic image conveyed by the news stories was not at all meant as an abstract concept, like stars in the Milky Way. Anyone who plays poker could understand it; a group of people, a very finite group of people, were sitting around a table and making bets trying to win a pot worth $1.25 trillion, a figure even more impressive when it is represented like this: $1,250,000,000,000. That is quite real. It is so real it is scary.
For perspective, it may be useful to note that if somebody wanted to distribute $1 trillion equally among all 240 million Americans, he would have to dispense more than $4,000 to every man, woman and child.
Putting a dollar sign in front of very big numbers tends to make them real, though this does not always work for other units of wealth. For example, one can go to the Numismatic Museum in upper Manhattan and gaze at the quintillion pengo note that circulated in Hungary during a period of hyperinflation after World War II. Despite it's 18 zeros, 6 more than those of a trillion, it is not really awe inspiring. Even in the heyday of the pengo, one probably couldn't get much for a trillion, or quartillion or quintillion of them.
 
Devaluing the Millionaire
But there is a lesson here. Dollars, like pengos, fluctuate over time. And just as there are forces of inflation and devaluation affecting currencies, so there are semantic shifts in the numbers that come to be associated with money. Take millions and billions, which were as mythical as trillions were before Long-Term Capital helped make them a household concept.
There was a time when a million dollars was a pretty high standard. Telling somebody they looked like a million was considered a high compliment. Similarly, a millionaire was a rare species, generally depicted in cartoons as a cigar-smoking person in a top hat. Now, according to "The Millionaire Next Door," a best seller since it appeared in 1997, there are 3.5 million of them. That's 3,500,000, households. Though this is not exactly a dime a dozen, it is not one in a million either.
And within the last decade, some people began to be designated as billionaires. This has led to some confusion between the categories, notably the assumption that millionaires and billionaires are related subspecies who graze together. This is a fallacy that may be made clear by the following facts: A person with the net worth of $1 is closer in wealth to a person with a net worth of $50 million than the person with $50 million is to the person with $1 billion. Much, much closer. After all, the person with $1 is only $49,999,999 behind the millionaire, while the millionaire is $950,000,000 behind the billionaire.
This co-mingling of truly fat cats and the merely plump has long bothered John Allen Paulos, a Temple University mathematician who has written entertainingly about mathematics in everyday life. He advocates using scientific notation to describe the rich. For example, instead of the indistinct millionaire or multimillionaire, which could mean anyone who possessed more than a million or less than a billion (which the British refer to quite correctly as a thousand million). Mr. Paulos thinks exponents would help put the very rich in their appropriate places. For example, if one were to read about a 6 X 10 to the seventh power centerfielder, one could immediately determine that this was a $60 million variety of millionaire. A 3 X 10 to the sixth powoer adolescent baby sitter would be established a $3 million member of the phylum. And so forth.
Greater precision could also be achieved by borrowing from Indian usage. Indians, who number at least 8 X 10 to the eighth power , have an increasingly useful word -- crore -- which means 10 million. And should the time come when the currently awesome trillion turns out to be small potatoes, there is the googol, which is the number 1 followed by 100 zeros, or 10 to the one-hundreth power . And if that's not enough, there is the googolplex which is 10 to the power googol.

Numbers are relative. The word myriad is related to the Greek words for both countless and 10,000. And the Egyptian hieroglyphic for a million was the god for air and space. Now, with 3.5 million Americans worth at least $1 million, the new rich are billionaires and the Federal budget is over $1 trillion. Beyond trillions there are big numbers.

HEADLINE: The Nation: A Poll-Watcher's Guide;
Stalking the Elusive Likely Voter

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. KAGAY; Michael R. Kagay heads the polling staff at The New York Times.

 BODY:
WITH midterm elections just around the corner and the impeachment inquiry of President Clinton set to start shortly afterward, public opinion polls are more numerous, more important and possibly more confusing than usual.
In any election year, pollsters try to predict which voters will go to the polls and what they will do when they get there. Turnout is important, but issues and circumstances like the state of the economy are what often drive the result. 
 But this year, the conventional wisdom has it, turnout is everything. If the Presidential sex scandal galvanizes Clinton opponents, Republicans win. If the widespread public distaste for impeachment proceedings mobilizes a backlash vote, Democrats may gain the upper hand.
So pollsters are focusing even more than usual this year on figuring out who will really take the trouble to vote, searching for that mythical beast known as the "likely voter."
In assessing pre-election polls, here are some things to look for:
 
Accurate Sampling
Good polls start with good samples of the population from all geographical areas and segments of society. In recent decades this has been accomplished by "random digit dialing," in which a computer selects area codes and exchanges and then makes up the last four digits at random to form complete telephone numbers.
For decades pollsters have demonstrated how 1,000 or so people can accurately represent all adults in the entire nation -- plus or minus a few percentage points, the potential fluctuation that is inherent in every poll because it is a sampling rather than a census.
 
Likely Voters
In the period leading up to any election, pollsters make a big mistake if they try to represent all adults in their polls. In the 1996 Presidential election, only about 49 percent of all adults actually voted. In the 1994 midterm election, about 39 percent voted.
Thus it is critical to screen for likely voters by discarding the opinions of half to two-thirds of all adults polled.
Each polling organization has its own screening method. The Gallup Organization, which polls for USA Today and CNN, has one of the most elaborate and well-tested systems. It gives respondents points for voting in past elections, their current intention to vote and their knowledge of where to go to vote, among other factors. Respondents score from zero to seven points; Gallup then picks those respondents with the most points, working down until they reach a percentage of the total group that is equal to the expected nationwide turnout (expected to be 39 percent this year).
The New York Times/CBS News Poll, by comparison, screens in several ways. "Likely voters" in this year's polls are those who say they voted in either 1996 or 1994, who say they are paying attention to this year's campaign, and who say they will definitely vote in November.
"More likely voters" differ by saying they voted in both 1996 and 1994.
The Times has found that its polling results become more pro-Republican when the focus is limited to likely and more likely voters, suggesting that if turnout is lower than usual this year, it will help Republicans. But Gallup does not find nearly so strong a pattern, suggesting that the contest remains very close at all levels of turnout.
David W. Moore, vice-president of Gallup, maintains that the organization's standard "likely voter" questions should still be adequate even in this unusual year. Mr. Moore says a person who shows little history of voting in past elections but who becomes motivated to vote this year by the Presidential scandal or the impeachment hearings might well be overlooked as a likely voter. But he added that he thought the people most likely to be roused to vote by the scandal or hearings would probably be strong Republicans or strong Democrats who are already frequent past voters.
 
Phrasing of Questions
Even though the latest Gallup and Times/CBS News polls issued last week agree in many areas, Gallup found that most Americans believe their incumbent Representatives deserve re-election. The Times/CBS News poll, on the other hand, found Americans to be narrowly split on the issue.
Closer examination suggests that the discrepancy may be due to the different wording of the questions. Gallup asked: "Please tell me whether or not you think each of the following political officeholders deserves to be re-elected. First, most members of the House of Representatives; second, your own representative."
The Times/CBS News poll linked re-election to job performance, and also asked whether it is time to give new candidates a chance, thus offering a potential reason why a respondent might prefer not to re-elect an incumbent.
Both sets of questions clearly show that people like their own Representative better than they like Congress in the aggregate, and both organizations find, each using its own questions, that willingness to re-elect incumbents is higher now than it was in 1994.
 
Multiple Polls
It is a pollster's maxim that the truth lies not in any one poll but at the center of gravity of several polls. When polls agree, it often means the findings are solid. But when they disagree, it often means the findings are more fragile or tentative.
The best advice, therefore, is to track the findings of several organizations.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "It All Depends"
The results of any opinion poll vary depending on who is asked the questions and how the questions are phrased.
 
FINDING LIKELY VOTERS
Polls that take the pulse of the general population do a bad job forecasting election results because so many people don't vote. So pollsters try to find people who are likely to vote.
 
A recent New York Times/CBS News poll showed that when asked which party's candidates they preferred in the Congressional elections, respondents tended to lean more toward Republicans as the focus narrowed to likely voters.
 
Registered voters
Democrat -- 45%
Republican -- 37%
 
Likely voters
Democrat -- 47%
Republican -- 42%
 
More likely voters

Republican -- 48%
 
HOW QUESTIONS ARE PHRASED
The phrasing of poll questions can make a big difference. The Gallup poll asked people to rate Congressmen one way; The New York Times and CBS asked it another way.

The Fed Breathes Life Into the Markets

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve unexpectedly trimmed interest rates by one-quarter of a percentage point late on Thursday, and it was like a 1998 version of the shot heard round the world. Investors everywhere went on a buying spree.
 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had one of its best weeks ever, rising 72.03 points, or 7.3 percent, to 1,056.42. Speaking in Hong Kong, Byron Wien, chief United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, predicted the Federal REserve would contiue to cut interest rates into 1999, spurring economic growth and allowing stocks to continue to rally. A slowdown in growth and fear of a credit crunch were the reasons for Thursday's paring of the Federal funds rate.
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been in negative territory recently, is suddenly posting a respectable gain of 500 points, or 6.4 percent, for the year.
 Stocks in London, Frankfurt, Paris, Zurich, Hong Kong, Toyko and elsewhere also surged in response to the Fed's action.
 Treasury securities and the dollar also gained. The prcie of the bellwether 30-year bond climbed, pushing its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, below the important 5 percent level to end the week at 4.97 percent. The dollar rose against the mark and trimmed its losses against the yen.

HEADLINE: The Capitalist;
A Miami Fish Story

BYLINE: By Andrew Zimbalist; Andrew Zimbalist is a professor of economics at Smith College and the author of numerous articles and books about the sports industry.

 BODY:
How could a baseball team in a major media market win the World Series and lose $34 million? The owner of the Florida Marlins, H. Wayne Huizenga, claims that's just what his team did last year. He hoped that his proclamation of penury would shame Broward and Miami-Dade Counties into building him a new, retractable-roof ball park. When it didn't, he went ballistic. Putatively to stop the team's financial bleeding, he conducted the most radical fire sale of players in baseball history, lowering the Marlins' payroll from $53 million in 1997 to $13 million in mid-July 1998 and leaving many baseball fans wondering exactly what Bud Selig was doing in the commissioner's office. At the same time, Huizenga tried to arrange a sale of the Marlins to his longstanding associate and team president, Don Smiley, for $169 million. 
 As the Marlins stumbled through this season, losing 108 games, Huizenga refused to provide any details about the team's 1997 finances. However, Smiley issued a confidential report on the team to prospective partners in his effort to complete the purchase. Smiley's "Private Placement Memorandum" reports a variety of financial information for 1997 as well as projections for 1998 and beyond. Based on these projections, payroll figures from Major League Baseball and my own calculation of ticket sales (actual attendance multiplied by the average ticket price), the picture for 1997 looks like this:
 
Revenues (in millions)
 
Ticket sales: $23.9
Broadcasting: $23.2
Concessions: $1.8
Other: $10.0
Total: $58.9
 
Costs (in millions)
 
Payroll: $53.5
Team Operations: $18.9
Player Development: $5.1
Scouting: $5.1
Latin American Operations: $0.6
Stadium Expenses: $5.0
Total: $88.2
These numbers suggest an operating loss of $29.3 million. Quibbling over a few million dollars aside, what's the problem? Did Huizenga's Marlins really lose around $30 million? Of course not. Huizenga is employing an accounting trick as familiar to sports franchise owners as Mark McGwire's home runs are to viewers of ESPN's SportsCenter.
Huizenga owns Pro Player Stadium and the team's cablecaster, Sportschannel Florida. Pro Player was built in 1987 and is amply stocked with all the revenue-generating accouterments of a modern sports facility. Yet there is no mention in the team's reported revenues of income from luxury boxes, even though Pro Player Stadium has 195 suites that rent for between $55,000 and $150,000 a year. Nor is there mention of income from club seats, although the stadium has 10,209 club seats selling for between $900 and $3,500 a year.
Bob Kramm, president of the stadium corporation, estimates that in 1997 an average of 65 luxury suites and 5,000 club seats per game were sold. Assuming that the average suite rented for $100,000 and the average club seat sold for $2,000, the gross revenue from these two sources would be $16.5 million. Huizenga attributes none of this revenue to the Marlins and all of it to his separate business entity, Pro Player Stadium.
Similarly, Huizenga sells naming rights to the stadium, worth by conservative estimates about $2 million a year. Since the stadium is shared with the N.F.L. Dolphins (also owned by Huizenga), let us attribute half of this value to the Marlins. Parking for approximately 788,000 cars during the baseball season at $5 a car in 1997 brought an estimated $3.9 million. Sales of signs and advertising at the park and in the team program produced an estimated $6 million. (The Cleveland Indians' signage and ad sales at Jacobs Field yielded $8.8 million in 1997 on an average attendance of about 44,000.) Sales of merchandise brought in something like $3 million in net income. (The Indians' figure was $4.5 million.) All told, that's $13.9 million in ball-park revenue attributed to the stadium company, not the Marlins.
Further, the revenue from concessions appears to be substantially understated. Fans spend an average of $10 on concessions, with about 40 percent of that going to the team. With total 1997 attendance of 2.4 million, the Marlins' net concessions income should have been around $9.4 million. Yet the team is credited with only $1.8 million, a discrepancy of $7.6 million. In all, $38 million in revenues are credited to the stadium rather than the Marlins ($16.5 million from luxury and club seating, $7.6 million from concessions, $6 million from signage, $3.9 million from parking, $3 million from merchandise and $1 million from naming rights).
Even though the Marlins receive only a small portion of stadium revenue, they still are charged $5 million to cover "stadium expenses." These expenses presumably are used to pay off Huizenga's debt service on the county industrial bonds that he assumed when he purchased the park. The yearly service on this debt has been estimated at around $5 million, but since the stadium is also the home facility of the Dolphins and the site of special events throughout the year, the Marlins share of this debt should be no more than half.
Huizenga plays the same game with Sportschannel. According to Smiley's prospectus, an independent appraiser estimated that the Marlins' contract with the cable station is undervalued by more than $2.1 million a year. Herein lies a powerful reason why Huizenga wanted to sell his team to Don Smiley. Huizenga's deal with Smiley included an extension of the Sportschannel contract through 2024. Under that contract, the Marlins were to receive rights fees well below market value. While that didn't help the Marlins, it increased the station's value from an estimated $85 million to $125 million.
Unfortunately for Huizenga, the deal fell through when Smiley's fund-raising efforts came up $50 million short. So in August Huizenga began to talk to John Henry, a Boca Raton commodities trader and minority owner of the New York Yankees. They reportedly have reached a deal for $150 million plus other considerations worth, by my calculations, about $50 million. But all is not lost. Apparently, Henry acceded to a 10-year extension of the Sportschannel contract.
Adding the $2.1 million in lost cable revenues to the $38 million in lost stadium revenues brings the total earned by -- but not credited to -- the Marlins in 1997 to $40.1 million. But that's not the end of it. Smiley's prospectus suggests "other" revenues of $10 million. No details are provided. In 1997 the Marlins beat the Indians in the seventh game of the World Series. The Indians reported net postseason ticket revenues of $6.8 million. Presumably this is part of the "other" $10 million for the Marlins.
Then there is roughly $2 million that comes from Major League Baseball Properties as licensing and sponsorship income. This leaves only $1.2 million for all "other" sources of revenue: roughly 15 preseason games at the Marlins' publicly financed spring training ball park; special functions; net income from the team store in Fort Lauderdale (since closed) and so on. Finally, in the "Private Placement Memorandum" Smiley reports that he intends to lower general and administrative expenses by $3 million a year, suggesting there is that much padding in the current budget.
In short, if the Marlins financial statement is adjusted for related-party transactions and bloated costs, what appears to be a $29.3 million operating loss in 1997 becomes instead an operating profit of $13.8 million (adding $40.1 million in additional revenues and $3 million of bloated costs). Why else would Don Smiley, who as team president knows its financial predicament as well as anyone, have wanted to buy the team?
 Why does Huizenga want to sell a profitable team? Perhaps the same reason he sold Blockbuster to Viacom: he can get a good price for it with a nice capital gain and he can control the terms of the deal to benefit his other holdings, including Sportschannel and the Pro Player Stadium corporation. Further, Huizenga has owned the Marlins since 1993 and by now has used up his player amortization allowance (a tax benefit that allows an owner to set aside up to 50 percent of franchise value and then depreciate this sum, usually over five years). Thus, the substantial tax-shelter value of the club is exhausted.
Meanwhile, the team finished the 1998 season with a payroll of $13 million. Seven million of this was from the insured contract of pitcher Alex Fernandez, who was on the disabled list all season. As such, the insurance company was responsible for at least 70 percent of the $7 million, so the actual payroll disbursements for the 1998 Marlins were probably below $10 million.
With average attendance at Pro Player down from 29,555 in 1997 to 22,157 in 1998, ticket revenue fell by around $6 million. Auxiliary stadium income also took a proportional hit, but the player payroll was down by more than $40 million -- more than offsetting lower stadium income. Thus, Huizenga's Marlins were even more profitable losing in 1998 than they were winning in 1997.

HEADLINE: A Peace Agreement That's Bound to Fail

BYLINE: By John J. Mearsheimer; John J. Mearsheimer is a professor of political science at the University of Chicago.

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration claims that it has made progress toward bringing peace to Kosovo. Don't believe it. The deal arranged by Richard Holbrooke is likely to fail sooner rather than later.
The Clinton team wants to end the fighting between ethnic Albanians and Serbs through a settlement that leaves Kosovo as a province within Serbia. It fears that any deal allowing Kosovo its independence would encourage ethnic separatism in Bosnia and Macedonia, two multi-ethnic states that the Administration is struggling to hold together. 
 In this the Yugoslavian President, Slobodan Milosevic, shares American aims. Kosovo is not like Bosnia, which Mr. Milosevic tried to tear apart. Where the United States and Mr. Milosevic part company, of course, is that the Serb leader believes that the solution is using police and army troops to crack down on ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
Mr. Holbrooke's deal, which is more a loose agreement than a coherent plan, would have the Serbs cease all military and police operations in Kosovo and send home all the Serbian forces that have moved into the province over the past seven months. Any troops left in Kosovo would be made to return to their barracks.
The agreement also seeks to give the Albanians limited autonomy. Specifically, it calls for new elections within nine months for Kosovo's parliament and executive, and for creating a police force that reflects Kosovo's ethnic composition. Some 2,000 civilian monitors would be put on the ground for at least one year to monitor Serbian compliance. The threat of NATO air strikes would be held over the Serbs.
This deal is doomed, however, because neither the Albanians nor the Serbs are likely to stick to it. Friday's extending of the deadline for Serbia to comply with its troop withdrawls is a sign of things to come.
There is near-unanimous agreement among Kosovo's Albanians that full independence is the only acceptable outcome. Even the moderate Ibrahim Rugova, the most influential Albanian leader and an advocate of nonviolence, says adamantly that autonomy within Serbia isn't enough. Albanians might be amenable to delaying a final decision on Kosovo's status for three years if they receive significant autonomy in the meantime, as the Clinton Administration proposes. But when the time is up they will insist on independence and fight to achieve it.
In Mr. Milosevic's eyes, any degree of autonomy for Kosovo will only aid the Albanian push for independence. Ethnic Serbs have been leaving Kosovo for decades, mainly because job opportunities are poor. In 1961, 227,000 Serbs lived in Kosovo; the number today is about 180,000.
With autonomy, the situation for Kosovo's Serbs would rapidly go from bad to worse. If Albanians controlled Kosovo's main institutions, they would make life very unpleasant for the Serbs.
The Albanian authorities would find ways to move Serbs out of government jobs and to shut down Serbian-owned enterprises. Serbs would lose control of the educational system, and classes would soon be taught only in Albanian. Because Albanians would control the police, Serbs would have little protection from ethnic violence. Militant Albanian separatists would have easy access to arms from neighboring Albania and would surely renew their drive to push the Serbs out.
Faced with a bleak economic future and the threat of violence, ethnic Serbs would probably flee even faster, just as they left Sarajevo after it was placed under Bosnian Muslim control in 1995. Autonomy for Kosovo, in short, would mean that the local population would become almost 100 percent Albanian.
Mr. Milosevic is unlikely to let the situation reach that point. Instead he is likely to make excuses not to hold elections and to delay changes in the police force, while moving Serbian military forces across the border. Open conflict with the Albanians would be likely to follow, and we would be back at square one. Only this time NATO would find it harder to threaten air strikes, because Mr. Milosevic could take the 2,000 civilian monitors hostage.
There is no good solution for the United States to support, but the least bad option is to convince both sides that the best thing for them is a a real partition separating Kosovo from Serbia. Selling independence to the ethnic Albanians is a no-brainer. And although it may seem far-fetched, there are convincing reasons for the Serbs to let Kosovo go.
Kosovo is an important cultural and historical symbol for the Serbs; it was the center of their medieval empire. Nevertheless, there is reason to think that Serbia might part with the region if the right incentives were provided. Again, demography is the key. Given the imposing disparity in birthrates between Albanians and Serbs (today, 16 Albanian children are born for every Serb baby), the population of Kosovo will continue to shift against the Serbs. Moreover, as the head of the nationalist Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts recently pointed out, Serbs will be a minority in Serbia itself by 2020 if Kosovo remains within its borders.
With numbers like that, Serbia won't be a Serbian nation-state anymore. Hence partition is in the long-term interest of Serb nationalism.
The United States can offer both carrots and sticks to bring the Serbs along. As a stick, we could threaten to train and arm Albanian separatist forces and to give them tactical air support should the Serbs refuse a fair partition deal.
As a carrot, the United States could guarantee Serbs leaving Kosovo safe passage to their new homes and compensation for their loss of property and jobs. We could lean on our European allies to help create a fund for that purpose.
Yes, independence for Kosovo would complicate the Clinton Administration's efforts to hold Bosnia and Macedonia together. But those are lost causes anyway.
The effort to stitch Bosnia back together has failed: the Bosnian Serb and Croatian communities both reject the joint Bosnian government, and only the presence of NATO troops keeps the peace. Macedonia is another Kosovo in the making. Ethnic Albanians make up somewhere between 25 and 40 percent of the Macedonian population, and their numbers are growing, as is their desire for independence.
It is hard for Americans to understand that the breakup of large countries into smaller states can sometimes lead to stability. But unless we intend to intervene in Kosovo and to occupy Bosnia and Macedonia forever, the only way to stop the spread of violence and civil war is to help the antagonists find the best ways to divorce.

HEADLINE: Book Publishers Seek Global Reach And Grand Scale

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL 

 BODY:
Borders are as flimsy as bookmarks in the global realm where Thomas Middelhoff is preparing to take power as the new chief executive of the Bertelsmann media and publishing conglomerate.
On a September morning, Mr. Middelhoff, 44, rises to field questions in German at a news briefing in Gutersloh, Germany. The following afternoon, he is in a dark, wood-paneled room of the 21 Club in Manhattan to go through the same business ritual in English. 
 His son's electronic messages trail him from Germany, which he answers in both languages. Five years from now, Mr. Middelhoff declares, upper-level employees at Bertelsmann headquarters in Gutersloh will speak English as the official corporate language. And for those who blunder by referring to Bertelsmann as a German conglomerate, Mr. Middelhoff, a self-described global citizen, vigorously and frequently offers corrections.
"We are not a German company," he insisted, adding, "We are a real global company."
That sentiment is spreading in the world's $80 billion-a-year book market, which is not only becoming more concentrated among mega-publishers, but is increasingly a borderless territory with the expansion of electronic bookselling and global deals. Such deals cross nations and languages and range from Bertelsmann's purchase of Random House and its recent partnership in Barnes & Noble's electronic bookstore to moves by the largest French publisher, Hachette Livre, to acquire a majority stake in a British consumer book company, the Orion Publishing Group.
With these global shifts has come a new generation of issues for the publishing industry -- from the protection of intellectual-property rights and the balance of power between individual authors and behemoth publishers to concerns about whether consolidation will crowd out smaller houses and lead to homogeneous literature.
"The whales are eating the whales," said Martin P. Levin, a former publishing executive and lawyer who specializes in mergers and acquisitions of publishing companies. "It used to be that the whales were eating the minnows. Now the appetites are so much bigger. This is a watershed moment in publishing, where we have never seen this kind of concentration before with global ownership and the big getting bigger."
The zest for global reach has also taken hold at chain booksellers like the Borders Group, which is preparing for eventual superstore saturation in the United States by opening branches in Singapore, Britain and Australia. The electronic bookseller Amazon.com this month is opening two European Web site versions of its operation with distribution points in Slough, England, and Regensburg, Germany.
"I do think that the world is becoming a smaller place every year that goes by," said Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief executive, who said that the growing expansion of electronic book sales could lead to more diversity and choice in literature.
But he also said that the increasing consolidation of publishers bears watching. "If you get too much concentration on the publishing side," he said, "then you could start to get problems with ideas and the ability of authors to get multiple outlets for their work. If you took it to an extreme, it could be bad for the industry. It could be bad for society."
To a certain extent, this global fever has spread to midsized and small American publishers, which in a variety of ways are casting about for partners, acquisitions or alliances to publish directly into foreign markets, a trend propelled by the slow growth of book sales.
"It's tough enough to make money in the U.S. market," said Steven S. Schragis, publisher at the Carol Publishing Group, which last year foundered in an attempt to merge with Batsford Publishing in London. "There's always been the avenue of selling your rights to foreign publishers, but you can make more money by exploiting your own copyrights directly -- i.e., release it directly yourself."
Last month, Prima Publishing, an independent company in Rocklin, Calif., absorbed the employees of an inactive German publisher to establish Prima Deutschland, which will try to tap the German market for games with a division publishing game-strategy books.
"It's incredibly myopic for any company in the world that is truly becoming a global village not to use its core strength to expand overseas," said Ben Dominitz, Prima's founder and chief executive. "We tend to look at technology companies for models and not publishing companies."
The bigger shifts in global ownership and book selling are so new that no one is quite sure what impact, if any, such changes could have on literature and culture.
But the trends are pronounced enough that the chairman of the Frankfurt Book Fair, Roland Ulmer, sought to draw attention to the changes earlier this month in an opening speech at the huge annual bazaar of books and publishers from all over the world.
Mr. Ulmer noted that by as early as next year, more than 90 percent of the American book market will be controlled by the 20 largest competitors. On the technical, medical and scientific side of publishing, the concentration is even greater, he said, with three foreign companies dominating 90 percent of the United States market.
Within the sprawling halls of the Frankfurt Book Fair, the joke was that there was more gossip this year about buying companies than of buying books. At panel discussions, futurists with technology backgrounds floated the heretical view that copyright protection was a medieval concept, arguing that it had no place in a digital world, where information could be transferred with a few computer-keyboard clicks.
The rights directors of publishing houses held their own forums to debate how globalization and electronic commerce had shifted the international flow of books and the frontiers of language markets.
The rights to a book generally are not global; for example, selling a book that was published in the United States in a foreign country may violate a British publisher's rights to sell that same book in Britain. But those territorial boundaries are hard to enforce at an electronic bookstore, which may not always know which book is the British version or the American version.
Sitting at his own cramped booth at the Frankfurt fair, Andre Schiffrin, director of the not-for-profit New Press in New York, said he was certain his public interest publishing house would feel the effects of globalization.
In some ways, it is to his advantage because he expects some authors to start coming to him for an alternative from the corporate publishing houses. But he said the new bonds between Bertelsmann and Barnes & Noble provided further impetus to seek new sales and marketing outlets, like public forums to promote his authors and their ideas.
Such global shifts in ownership and book selling are also viewed warily by authors.
For Stephen King, whose best-selling books are also successful in other countries, globalizaton is the "literary equivalent of grazing the rain forest to make hamburgers."
"It lowers the I.Q. any time there is consolidation and there is more of a focus on bestsellers," he said.
The National Writers Union, a New York-based group with a membership of more than 4,000 freelance writers and authors, has decided that it needs to become global by forming alliances with other international unions so it can follow the activities of large multinational publishers, according to Jonathan Tasini, the union's president.
"What writers are now starting to see is what we've seen in other industries," he said. "Their industries are being run by companies with no national flag and when that happens you feel a loss of control," said Mr. Tasini, who added that he expected that as the companies grew, they would look for ways to economize, such as through tougher negotiations with authors.
At least three of the top American publishing houses -- two of them newly merged companies -- are now reviewing their standard forms of contracts with authors. Contracts are the critical agreements that define the relationships between authors and publishers, establishing what a writer will be paid and who has the rights to sell a title in foreign countries.
At Bertelsmann's Random House, contracts are under review, a routine step in the wake of the merger with Bantam Doubleday Dell, to edit out anachronistic language, a company spokesman said.
Mr. Middelhoff of Berteslmann, who will be formally promoted to chief executive in November, said that despite the criticism and concern of some authors, globalization of ownership and bookselling might in some ways increase the diversity of voices in literature. Through electronic bookstores, writers will have the ability to reach selected audiences through an efficient delivery system, he said.
But he also thinks that an elite of internationally successful authors will develop, probably numbering no more than 25. And, he added, it will probably be impossible for authors to break into those ranks unless they write in English.
He holds that view, in part, because he thinks that English will become an increasingly dominant force in commerce -- the common language of business by the next generation. And Bertelsmann is already shifting in that direction, according to Mr. Middelhoff, who noted that communications about major company issues were written first in English and then translated to German.
With most of Bertelsmann's revenue coming from outside Germany, Mr. Middelhoff said it was important to stress the company's global reach and its corporate culture -- a decentralized structure with local, independent managers.
"We are Bertelsmann with a specific culture," Mr. Middelhoff said. "And this specific culture is not influenced by one special country."

HEADLINE: MICROSOFT ON TRIAL: THE PRELUDE;
More Enduring Than Politics

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
The Government's antitrust scrutiny of Microsoft, the world's largest independent software company, has spanned Republican and Democratic Administrations and involved hundreds of Government lawyers and investigators. But it has by no means been an example of consistent, coordinated public policy. Nor, by all accounts, of politics.
Instead, like the software industry itself, the Government's pursuit of Microsoft has taken leaps, hit dead ends and evolved in ways no one could have controlled or predicted back when it started in 1989. 
 It was in November of that year, on a hot afternoon at a computer-industry convention in Las Vegas, Nev., that William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, looked like he'd been dragged to the news conference with a senior executive from I.B.M. -- which at the time dominated Microsoft and the entire computer industry.
The two companies -- I.B.M., then leading maker of personal computers and Microsoft, the leader in PC operating system software -- were collaborating on the design and marketing of a new operating system called OS/2. But Microsoft was also beginning to sell a competing product, Windows.
The industry trade press was full of worried articles: which system was going to become the new standard?
With Mr. Gates standing uncomfortably at his side, James A. Cannavino, an I.B.M. divisional president, said that the two companies wanted to "clear the air." OS/2 was the future, he said. As for Windows, he added, it would remain a niche product for under-equipped computers. Windows, he asserted, would never receive all the advanced features of OS/2.
Mr. Gates certainly did not look happy. But he did not disagree.
The news conference got little attention, just a few articles deep inside newspapers and trade publications. But a few weeks later, Norris Washington, a senior antitrust lawyer with the Federal Trade Commission, happened to read one of those articles, in Byte magazine.
"I.B.M. and Microsoft have now defined their unified vision of graphical operating environments," the article said, "and it looks sort of like a U.S. economic model," divided into lower-, middle- and upper-class products.
As Mr. Washington saw it, I.B.M. and Microsoft were colluding to divide the operating-system market -- a potential violation of antitrust law.
Soon the F.T.C. staff opened an investigation of Microsoft and I.B.M. And since that small first step, Microsoft has been under unrelenting scrutiny from Federal antitrust investigators for a constantly evolving series of allegations and charges, month after month, year after year, for the last nine years.
Now comes the antitrust trial scheduled to begin on Monday, with a multiplicity of charges woven of threads drawn from more than a dozen different investigative inquiries during that nine-year span.
Microsoft, today the most feared company in the software business and carrying a stock-market value of nearly $234 billion, presents a huge and highly visible antitrust target.
Yet, while the company's allies ask, "What is the Clinton Administration's political agenda in going after Microsoft?" the answer seems to be there is none.
In interviews, more than a dozen current and former senior antitrust officials -- whether friends of the Government or of Microsoft -- all say the Justice Department's antitrust suit is a natural outgrowth of the previous investigations. As for politics, all the officials agreed that the antitrust division operates independent of the Administration's political considerations.
Charles Rule was the assistant attorney general who headed the antitrust division during the Bush Administration, and he is now a Washington lawyer who serves as an adviser and advocate for Microsoft.
"When I was there," Mr. Rule said of his Justice days, "the White House was punctilious in terms of never getting involved in whatever we decided to do. There was no communication between antitrust and other branches of Government." Asked if he believed that policy had changed under the Clinton Administration, he said: "Not really. I've seen nothing to suggest it."
Joel I. Klein heads the antitrust division now, and in an interview dealing with his division's role in the Clinton Administration's technology policy, not specifically relating to the Microsoft case, he said: "There is no statutory restriction, but as a practical matter, civil and criminal prosecutions are invariably carried out without any political contact."
Mr. Klein said, by way of examples, that he might discuss merger cases involving military or aviation industries with the Defense Department or Transportation Department. "But never the White House," he said. "For a significant case, we might call the White House and say: an hour from now we are going to hold a press conference."
"The last time there was any interference," he added, "was the Dita Beard-ITT case." Mrs. Beard, a lobbyist for the ITT Corporation, was accused in 1972 of having written a memo saying that a $400,000 donation to the Republican National Convention had "gone a long way" toward settling antitrust suits brought against the company by the Nixon Administration's Justice Department. The authenticity of the memo was never proved, and Mrs. Beard always denied writing it. In any case, Mr. Klein says, "since Watergate, it's been immaculate."
In the case of Microsoft, neither President Clinton nor Vice President Al Gore has ever volunteered a comment. In answer to a question during a news conference in May, just before the suit was filed, Mr. Clinton said: "I have taken the view that I should not comment on matters within the Justice Department. At this time, I do not think I should depart from that policy on this case, even though it obviously will have a big impact on an important sector of our economy. But I have to say, based on what I know to date, I have confidence in the way the antitrust division in the Justice Department has handled the matter."
Since then, Mr. Clinton has said nothing else about the case, publicly at least. And Mr. Gore, who generally represents the Administration on technology issues, has never commented at all.
In Mr. Rule's opinion, the Administration would be foolish to involve itself, even if it were politically acceptable to do so. "It would be a little odd for the Administration to push the Justice Department in this suit," he said. "It would be a policy mistake and a political mistake. I would be hard pressed to explain why they would do that."
Taking sides in the highly charged technology world is dangerous, particularly since the Democrats rely on Silicon Valley companies for political donations and support. In fact, the present and former Government officials all said the suit was simply a natural extension of the inquiries conducted during the last nine years.
They began at the F.T.C. Soon after Mr. Washington read that article in Byte, the F.T.C. staff opened an investigation of the Windows-OS/2 question. But as has happened so often in the following years, turns in the market made the initial inquiry irrelevant. Microsoft abandoned its agreement with I.B.M., and Windows quickly grew to be the industry standard, while OS/2 remained a cipher.
But as that issue faded, once Government investigators began looking at Microsoft they found other things that troubled them.
In 1991 Mr. Washington, who still works for the F.T.C., informed Microsoft that the investigation was being expanded. The agency, his letter said, was now trying to determine whether Microsoft was using its dominant position in operating-systems software to stifle competition in other areas. That general idea lies at the heart of the present suit.
One former senior F.T.C. official said the commission staff had confidence in the case but realized that the Reagan-era commissioners, who had to approve any suit, might have a different view. "We knew the commission might have difficulty with a monopolization case," the former official said. "They hadn't brought a case in years."
And in fact, in 1993 the commission voted 2-2 on the question of whether to file formal charges. The deadlock served as a dismissal. Then, a few months later, the Justice Department decided to pick up the case.
"It was farther along than most cases we got," recalled Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division who is now at the Brookings Institution. "Usually a case would be two or three people complaining and a few documents," he said. "But this was a fully researched record. They gave us the files and briefed us on what they had done."
The Justice Department lawyers picked up the same thread. "The general idea behind our inquiry," Mr. Litan said, "was that they should not be allowed to use their monopoly in operating systems to cement a monopoly in other areas."
In 1995, Microsoft and the Government reached a consent agreement in which the company promised to stop forcing PC makers to buy one copy of a Microsoft operating system for every computer sold -- instead of one for every computer on which the operating system, MS-DOS or Windows, was installed. The company also agreed to stop tying the sale of one software product to the sale of another. The charges in the present suit are similar in many ways.
Even with the agreement, the Government investigations continued. That same year, Justice Department investigators showed up at the offices of the Netscape Communications Corporation for the first time to ask questions about their next line of inquiry. "America Online had been complaining," a senior Netscape executive recalled, "because Microsoft was bundling the Microsoft Network," a competing on-line service, "with Windows."
Once more, market forces overtook the investigation. The Microsoft Network never grew particularly popular while America Online prospered and grew. But, not surprisingly, new complaints filled the void. In May 1995, Anne Bingaman, the Assistant Attorney General who headed the antitrust division, remarked: "We get complaints about Microsoft all the time. We have become a kind of Microsoft complaints center. And we take them very seriously."
In 1996, Netscape's first complaint arrived. In a letter to the Justice Department, Netscape said that Microsoft was using its dominance in personal-computer operating systems to force or persuade computer makers to favor Microsoft's browser, used to explore the World Wide Web, over the one marketed by Netscape. The next year the Justice Department formally charged Microsoft with violating the consent agreement by tying sales of Windows to installation of the company's Web browser on new computers.
"It seemed like a slam-dunk violation of the consent decree," a natural extension of that case, recalled Mr. Litan, who had left the department by then.
A Federal District Court judge agreed, but an Appeals Court panel overturned that ruling this summer.
In the meantime, last May the Justice Department and 20 state attorneys general filed their new suit against Microsoft, which is scheduled for trial on Monday. It contends that Microsoft has engaged in bundling, tying and other predatory behavior similar in many ways to the numerous previous allegations and investigations of the last nine years.
"A good part of this case is just Round II of the case we dealt with in Round I," in the early in the 1990's, Mr. Litan said.
Or, as the former senior F.T.C. official put it, "there's certainly a common thread that runs all the way through here." But through the years that thread has been twisted, pulled and spun by hundreds of different hands.

Microsoft Corporation, the Government's most aggressive move against a monopolist in almost 25 years, is playing out against a century of antitrust laws so broadly worded and court rulings so ambiguous that both sides are citing the same rulings to support their opposing arguments.
Whatever the outcome of the trial, scheduled to begin today in Federal District Court in Washington, an almost certain appeal will leave to the Supreme Court the task of bringing legal order to 100 years of clashing antitrust doctrines. 
 The case focuses on Microsoft's Windows, the operating systems that controls about 90 percent of all personal computers sold today. The Government says its objective is to curb illegal monopolistic business practices that threaten to render large parts of the economy vulnerable to the vicissitudes of a single company. Microsoft asserts that the case is intended to give the Government control over which features can be added to Windows.
However grand the economic stakes, the legal dispute is narrow. The Government says that Microsoft's contracts with computer manufacturers and with companies that provide access to the Internet illegally stifle competition.
The contracts prohibit manufacturers from substituting Netscape Communications Corporation's Navigator browser for Microsoft's Internet Explorer. They also prohibit them from removing from the Windows main screen, or desktop, links to sites on the World Wide Web run by Microsoft or its partners.
Microsoft's contracts with companies that connect people to the Internet and with businesses that sell goods and services on the Web require favored treatment for Internet Explorer over Navigator in exchange for links on the Windows desktop. In the wake of the lawsuit, Microsoft has voluntarily dropped some of these requirements, though it could reinstate them at will.
Microsoft says that its contracts are legal because they produce tangible benefits for customers, including easier Internet access.
The Justice Department says that the bundling of Explorer with Windows 95 and the inclusion of the browser as part of Windows 98 amount to "tying," an illegal practice that forces customers of one product to purchase another. The contracts with manufacturers and Internet services are illegal, the Government says, because they are intended not only to create a monopoly in the browser market but to protect Microsoft's existing monopoly in operating systems.
The latter threat is key, according to the Justice Department. Browsers have the potential, like an operating system, to act as a software platform on which other programs run. So contracts intended to drive browsers out of the market would also insulate the Windows monopoly.
Many antitrust experts say the problem facing the Justice Department is that the courts have provided no clear definition of tying and no clear guidelines for determining when contracts are illegally exclusionary.
Prof. Lawrence J. White of New York University, who was chief economist of the Justice Department's antitrust division in the early 1980's, says that the courts treat tying as an unusual practice when in fact it is ubiquitous. No one, he said, "would challenge the right of manufacturers to tie erasers to the tip of pencils, tires to an automobile or buttons to shirts."
His point, shared widely among economists, is that some tying benefits consumers if, for example, it results in products that are easier to use or enables a company to recover development costs.
But tying can be bad if it locks in monopoly power. The courts, Professor White says, have not offered enough guidance for distinguishing good tying from bad, which is the nub of the legal dispute.
Microsoft says it needs only to show that bundling Windows and Explorer passes what might be called a "gross" consumer benefits test -- that it offers an immediate benefit, whether or not it causes long-term damage to competition and, therefore, ultimately to consumers.
The Justice Department says that Microsoft's practices must clear a higher hurdle: yielding "net" consumer benefits that are immediate and large enough to balance possible long-term harm to competition.
So which test of consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws? The simple answer is that no one knows for sure, which is why both sides can reasonably cite the same cases without fear of embarrassment.
Consider a 1985 case, Aspen Skiing Company v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corporation, and a 1951 case, Lorain Journal Company v. United States.
In the first, Aspen Skiing, the owner of three major ski runs in Aspen -- the monopolist -- had for years sold a ticket in cooperation with Aspen Highlands, a competitor, that gave skiers access to both companies' runs. When Aspen Skiing unilaterally canceled the agreement, its rival's revenues shriveled and the rival sued. The Supreme Court ruled that Aspen Skiing had violated antitrust laws because there was no evidence its action helped consumers.
In the Lorain Journal case, the only local newspaper in Lorain, Ohio, refused to sell advertising to companies that advertised on a new radio station. Here, too, the Supreme Court ruled that the exclusionary practice did nothing to benefit consumers.
Indeed, in Aspen Skiing, the Court even forced the monopolist to do business with its rival, a precedent that augurs well for the Justice Department, which seeks to force Microsoft to install Netscape's browser alongside its own.
But Charles F. Rule, a legal consultant to Microsoft, says that in both cases the courts threw out exclusionary practices only because they offered no consumer benefit. The courts, he argues, never pounced on practices that resulted in lower prices or better products or service.
Nor did the courts in either case call for balancing immediate benefits against hypothetical long-term harm. Mr. Rule argues that Microsoft's practices produce demonstrable consumer benefits. Besides, he says, unlike the actions taken by The Lorain Journal or Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's contracts do not prevent consumers from installing Netscape's browser or from using the Web sites of Microsoft's rivals.
In truth, though, neither case answered what consumer benefit test should apply to product design.
In Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 et al. v. Hyde, another case cited by both sides, the Supreme Court in 1984 recognized that surgeons and anesthesiologists provide an integrated service. Yet, the court said, a hospital with monopoly power would still not be allowed to force surgical patients to use its panel of anesthesiologists if consumers wanted to purchase the two services separately. That principle could undercut Microsoft's defense that the functional interdependence of Windows and Explorer requires bundling.
But Microsoft will point to a strong concurring opinion that called for a tougher standard for the Government to meet when it alleges tying. Microsoft will also draw support from several court rulings that allowed I.B.M. to change the design of its computers in ways that made it hard for vendors to attach peripheral equipment.
But perhaps Microsoft's best argument is that nowhere has the Government identified a single case in which the courts explicitly called for throwing out a tied product on the basis of a balancing test. The courts, Microsoft will emphasize, steer clear of redesigning technically sophisticated products.
The Justice Department's rejoinder is to note that the sole purpose of antitrust law is to protect consumers, so it makes no sense to bless practices that provide a dollar's worth of benefits today but, by stamping out competition, drive prices up by $1,000 tomorrow.
The Justice Department will ask the court to at least insist that monopolists use the least exclusionary means possible to achieve whatever services they provide customers.
Experts agree that the courts will subject Microsoft's restrictive contracts with Internet companies to a balancing test. But exactly how the court will decide whether consumers are helped or hurt is up for grabs. A balancing test would have the courts weigh the immediate benefits to consumers of one-click access to Internet sites and of features of a bundled Windows-Explorer package versus the harm over time of diminished competition in the markets for browsers and operating systems.
But a test that makes good sense in theory can prove fiendishly difficult to use in practice. "Balancing tests are impossibly difficult and arbitrary," said Rep. Thomas Campbell, a Republican of California who is a former law professor at Stanford University. "The practical effect of balancing is to hand defendants like Microsoft almost certain victory."
Microsoft argues -- and many antitrust experts agree -- that the courts have in fact gravitated away from a balancing test toward a simpler "predation" test for exclusionary contracts. Under this standard, a contract is illegal only if it is intended to drive out competition and thus to pave the way for a monopolist to raise prices later. Microsoft will have an easier time defending itself against a charge of predation, which amounts to victimizing its customers, than it would defending itself against a charge that its bundled product does consumers slightly more harm than good.
The antitrust record, says William F. Baxter, who headed the antitrust division under President Reagan, is littered with "contradictory, ambiguous and sometimes nonsensical" verdicts.
He and other legal experts agree that if nothing else, that record leaves plenty of legal leeway for the Supreme Court, should it hear the Microsoft case, to stiffen the spine of the antitrust law.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "A Well-Traveled but Still Muddy Road"
As the Justice Department and Microsoft prepare to go to trial today, each side is looking to previous Federal antitrust cases to buttress its arguments. But considered together, antitrust precedents can be so contradictory that both sides are sometimes finding support in the same cases.
 
Case -- Lorain Journal vs. U.S. (1951)
 What happened -- The Journal, an Ohio newspaper with a local monopoly, stopped accepting ads from businesses that also advertised on a local radio station.
 Decision -- Lorain Journal lost
 Interpretation --
 THE GOVERNMENT'S VIEW: The court ruled that a monopolist, like Micro-soft, cannot impose conditions on partners, like computer makers, to exclude rivals, like Netscape.
 MICROSOFT'S VIEW: The Journal lost only because its policy did nothing to help consumers -- unlike the integration of Microsoft's browser and its operating system.
 
Case -- ILC Peripherals vs. I.B.M. (1978)
 What happened -- I.B.M. was accused of designing its computers in a way that stopped rivals from selling peripheral devices like disk drives.
 Decision -- I.B.M. won
 Interpretation --
 MICROSOFT'S VIEW: The court said I.B.M. needed to make a plausible claim that its product design helped consumers. Microsoft believes its operating system satisfies this requirement. It also points to the court's reluctance to judge the value of product designs.
 
Case -- Jefferson Parish Hospital District vs. Hyde (1984)
 What happened -- A hospital required its surgical patients to pick their anesthesiolo-gist from a list provided by the hospital. An anesthesiologist denied employment charged the hosptial with illegally tying one service to another.
 Decision -- Jefferson Parish won
 Interpretation --
 THE GOVERNMENT'S VIEW: The court said two products are illegally tied if consumers want to buy them separately and can afford to do so. Tying two products cannot be justified by their functional relationship.
 MICROSOFT'S VIEW The case involved two services, not product design -- like the bundling of its Windows and Explorer software. A concurring opinion anticipated that today's Supreme Court would make tying harder to prove.
 
Case -- Aspen Skiing vs. Aspen Highlands Skiing (1985)
 What happened -- The owner of three of Aspen, Colo.'s four major ski runs ended a joint program with the owner of Aspen Highlands under which they both sold tickets allowing skiers on any of the mountains.
 Decision -- Aspen Highlands won
 Interpretation --
 THE GOVERNMENT'S VIEW: The courts did not let a monopolist design products to stifle competition.
 MICROSOFT'S VIEW: As in Lorain Journal, the court ruled against the monopolist only because its business practice did nothing to help consumers.
 
Case -- U.S. vs. Microsoft (1998)
 What happened -- Appeals court reversed a lower court order that prohibited Microsoft from requiring PC makers that licensed its Windows operating system to also license its Explorer browser.
 Decision -- Microsoft won
 Interpretation --
 MICROSOFT'S VIEW: The appeals court said that combining Windows and Explorer was permissible because it provided benefits that would be unavailable if the products were bought and combined by the consumer. The court warned against overriding a firm's design of technological products.

HEADLINE: Bells and GTE Hope to Win by Losing at Supreme Court

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
There tend to be two sorts of regulatory disputes in the communications industry: the wildly Byzantine and the merely arcane.
The Byzantine seemed on display at the Supreme Court last Tuesday as some of the nation's most prominent lawyers wrangled over the Federal Communications Commission's plan for bringing competition to local telephone markets. They relied not on broad constitutional principles but on subtle interpretations of dense subsections of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. 
 But the complexity of the courtroom arguments tended to obscure something that became clear later in the week: Some factions within the local telephone industry might actually prefer to lose a big part of this case in the interest of expediting a more important victory later.
At stake are the terms under which the local telephone incumbents -- the five Bells and the GTE Corporation -- must open their networks to competitors, be they upstarts or long-distance carriers hoping to enter the local business. The local telephone market is worth about $100 billion.
"The court realizes that the telecommunications industry is essentially the central industry," said William P. Barr, the former Attorney General who is now chief counsel for GTE and who argued before the court on Tuesday. "This case raised fundamental issues about how competition will unfold and the structure of that market in the future."
Shortly after the Telecommunications Act of 1996 became law, the F.C.C. issued an order that told the states how to set prices for the various elements of the local phone companies' networks that competitors might want to use. In that order, the commission did at least two things that the Bells and GTE despised.
The first was to mandate what is known as a "forward-looking" pricing model. Under such a system, a local incumbent is allowed to recover only those costs that it would bear if its network were of the most modern and efficient type. An equivalent would be if a taxi driver charged customers based on the costs of operating his car but was told to pretend that his car got 50 miles to the gallon and was in tip-top shape.
The long-distance companies think that is a great idea because it gives them cost-effective access to local networks without having to bear the cost of building such networks themselves. "It is not economically possible to build loops to every house in America," Bruce J. Ennis Jr., who argued for the newly merged long-distance giant MCI Worldcom Inc. at the Supreme Court, said in an interview, referring to copper telephone lines. "We need to be able to lease elements from the incumbents."
But many taxis, and many equivalent phone networks, are decrepit gas-guzzlers. The local phone companies think they should be allowed to pass along the sometimes higher costs of maintaining and operating even the oldest parts of their networks to the new carriers that want access to those systems.
Not long after the F.C.C. order came out, the Bells and GTE sued the Government, charging that the Telecommunications Act did not give the commission authority to tell the states to use a forward-looking pricing system. Last year, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in St. Louis agreed. Significantly, the court did not rule on the merits of the commission's rules -- whether forward-looking price models were fair to begin with.
The local phone carriers also challenged another provision of the F.C.C.'s order, which forced them to offer the different parts of their networks as complete packages for their competitors, largely alleviating the need for their rivals to do such assembly work themselves. The St. Louis court ruled against the commission on that score, as well, and both issues were argued at the Supreme Court last week.
The commission's uniform national pricing rules never went into effect, forcing the Bells and their competitors to take up the matter in proceedings before 50 different state utility commissions. The upshot, though, is that many, if not most, of the states have adopted forward-looking pricing schemes similar to what the commission proposed two years ago anyway -- and which the local phone companies had hoped to avoid. If the Bells and GTE want to appeal those state decisions, they must litigate state by state.
So now comes the rub for the Bells and GTE. Remember: the Eighth Circuit, which has already demonstrated sympathy for the local companies, never ruled on whether the forward-looking cost models were fair. If the local phone industry succeeds in convincing the Supreme Court that authority to set local-network pricing models does lie with the states and not with the commission, the fairness question has no chance of rebounding to the Eighth Circuit.
So now, some lawyers for the local phone industry are thinking that it may actually be better for them to lose in the Supreme Court by having the justices declare that the commission does indeed have jurisdiction. That would send the case back to the Eighth Circuit. And that way, the local companies could hope to have the lower court consider the merits of forward-looking pricing -- and perhaps declare it unfair across the country. "I think there's a good chance that we lose on jurisdiction," said a lawyer who works for a local phone company. "And to me, No. 1, it's not that bad."
Whatever the outcome, an Eighth Circuit ruling on the merits of forward-looking pricing might end up with the same parties back before the Supreme Court. But for the Bells and GTE, some of their proponents believe, a loss now might be the best chance at eventual victory.

HEADLINE: MICROSOFT ON TRIAL: THE LAW;
Mr. Sherman's 1890 Nod to Populism Has Often Been Broadly Interpreted

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
The legal tool that the Government is using in its assault on the Microsoft Corporation -- the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 -- is brief, vague and malleable. The combination has meant that this bedrock statute of antitrust policy has been at turns toothless and powerful over the years, depending on the politics and economics of the day as interpreted by the courts.
Sponsored by Senator John Sherman, an Ohio Republican who was the younger brother of the Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, the act was passed as a nod to a popular backlash against the rise of the industrial trusts in oil, steel and railroads. Farmers, laborers and small-business owners -- sizable voting groups -- resented the trusts as vehicles of concentrated power. But the trusts, large national holding corporations, were viewed by many others as engines of modernization and industrialization. 
 Economists at the time opposed the Sherman Act, and the law that Congress passed was a vaguely worded compromise. No one knew what impact it would have, but one senator, quoted in Matthew Josephson's "The Robber Barons," explained that nearly everyone agreed that "something must be flung out to appease the restive masses."
The act's two key provisions, Sections 1 and 2, mention "conspiracy," "restraint of trade" and "attempt to monopolize." Yet while the Sherman Act is now interpreted as the Magna Carta of competition, it never uses the term. After it was passed, critics of the trusts derided the "impenetrable" language of the Sherman Act and called it the Swiss Cheese Act.
But by the early 1900's, the political climate had changed. The growing antagonism for the trusts, especially as income gaps widened, was tapped by an avowed trustbuster, Theodore Roosevelt, who became President in 1901.
"The Sherman Act has always been an elastic piece of social legislation, used to attack perceived exploitation and the aggregation of power," said Eleanor Fox, a professor at the New York University Law School.
The model trust -- and the principal target of the trustbusters -- was Standard Oil. Shrewdly, Roosevelt made a distinction between good trusts, which thrived because of their superior efficiency, and bad trusts, which grew not as the result of inevitable economic forces but because of unfair business practices.
Throughout the 1880's and 90's, Standard Oil's rivals had complained about the company and the business practices of its founder, John D. Rockefeller. But during those years, the price of kerosene -- burned to light the nation's homes -- declined steadily. So Standard Oil, it could could reasonably be argued, was an "enterprising monopoly."
In the early 1900's, though, Standard Oil raised prices in the United States to prop up its profits at a time it was engaged in a price war against Royal Dutch/Shell in Europe, where Standard Oil did face genuine competition. When consumers were hurt by the Standard Oil monopoly, popular support for antitrust action against the company swelled, encouraged by Roosevelt and his successor, William Howard Taft. The Federal suit against Standard Oil was filed in 1906, and the Supreme Court approved the breakup of the company in 1911.
Standard Oil and the Microsoft case, historians observe, have some common themes. Both were dominant companies of their day, and William H. Gates, the Microsoft chairman, has been called a modern Rockefeller.
"But there is no Presidential involvement and there is no real consumer dissatisfaction in the Microsoft case," said Ron Chernow, author of "Titan," a best-selling biography of Rockefeller.
"And Rockefeller," Mr. Chernow added, "never went through the kind of honeymoon period of widespread public adulation and favorable press coverage as Bill Gates has had."

HEADLINE: Patents;
Congress has extended itsprotection for Goofy, Gershwin and some moguls of the Internet.

BYLINE: By Sabra Chartrand 

 BODY:
CONGRESS moved to rewrite American copyright law earlier this month when it passed two hotly contested pieces of legislation. The first lengthens protections by 20 years for an array of 20th century cultural icons, including Mickey Mouse. The second guarantees on-line providers of artistic material that their responsibility for copyright infringement will be limited as the digital age progresses.
On Oct. 7, a year and a half after the Copyright Term Extension Act was first introduced and after intense lobbying for it from powerful copyright holders like the Walt Disney Company and Time Warner Inc., Congress passed the bill and extended the life of copyright protection for the creators of original works. Since 1976, copyrights have been good for the life of an artist plus 50 years. 
 The new legislation lengthens copyrights for works created on or after Jan. 1, 1978, to the life of the author plus 70 years and extends copyrights for works created for hire and owned by corporations to 95 years, from the current 75.
With its vote, Congress prevented Disney's copyrights for several of its most lucrative cartoon characters from becoming public property in the next few years. Mickey Mouse, first copyrighted in 1928, had been set to pass into the public domain in 2004; Pluto, Goofy and Donald Duck would have followed in 2009.
Several days after the copyright extension legislation passed, the House and Senate approved the On-Line Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act. That legislation protects Internet service providers from liability for unwittingly transmitting material that infringes on a copyright.
Both bills generated plenty of controversy during the last year. Opponents argued that they were unconstitutional, stifled creativity and research, or threatened privacy and competition. But the proposals had powerful support from large corporations, artists' interest groups and the Patent and Trademark Office.
Both bills fit neatly into the patent agency's efforts over the last several years to modify American intellectual property laws so that they "harmonize" with those in Europe and Japan. In 1995, controversy raged around a bill that altered the life span of an American patent from 17 years from the date of issuance to 20 years from the date of application -- making United States law identical to patent-term laws in Europe and Japan. It passed anyway.
The philosophical basis for copyright protection is twofold: to protect the rights of artists to profit from and control the use of their work and to preserve public interest by guaranteeing that eventually the right to use the works will pass into the public domain.
Arguments over which of those purposes takes precedence have flared off and on since the first copyright law was passed in 1790. It bestowed protection on artists for 14 years from publication, with an option for a further 14-year renewal. That legislation lasted until 1831, when the initial term was extended to 28 years with a 14-year renewal. In 1909, the renewal term was stretched to 28 years. Then, in 1976, the renewal period was extended again to 47 years and copyright protection for the life of the author, plus 50 years, was given to anything published after 1976.
That law seemed to satisfy artists and corporate copyright holders until the expiration date of many valuable copyrights drew near. An impressive list of mid-century works of art were set to lose their copyrights over the next few years, including the songs of George and Ira Gershwin as well as the Disney cartoon characters. This would have happened just as the potential for new uses of characters, songs and images is expanding with new markets on digital television, cable services and the Internet.
In Europe, artists and their heirs already had two extra decades to control and profit from copyrighted works. So in the United States, heirs like the Gershwin Family Trust, large corporations like Disney and Time Warner, and organizations like the Motion Picture Association of America and the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers began lobbying for a change in Federal law.
Opponents argued that copyright holders were trying to change the rules of the game they had originally accepted and said that creative and cultural expression would be stifled if the public was not allowed free and fair access to works of art.
Copyright holders and their heirs, in turn, insisted that artistic work is property, just like real estate, paintings or jewelry, and that they should be able to pass on their wealth to their descendants. Their supporters said that if American works of art fell into the public domain 20 years before European ones, the United States would lose its advantage in the international trading arena.
The global economy was cited as a central reason for the other piece of copyright-related legislation. To protect content on the so-called information superhighway, Congress voted to limit liability for on-line copyright infringement. Proponents called it a big step forward in freeing companies to expand into electronic commerce and deliver movies, music and other content over the Internet.
The bill limits the infringement liability of Internet access providers that unknowingly store, transmit or link World Wide Web users to copyrighted material. Providers like America Online or Yahoo will not be liable if the transmission is initiated by another person, if the storage or transmission happens via automatic technological processes and if no copies of the material are kept any longer than necessary to complete the transmission. The provider is also exempt from liability if it did not know that the material in question infringed a copyright and did not make money from any activity directly related to infringement.
The bill is so-called implementing legislation for two treaties agreed upon by the World Intellectual Property Organization, and Congress must still ratify those treaties. Even though the 105th Congress is close to adjournment, other copyright-related proposals are still pending. A list of pending legislation is available on the United States Copyright Office's site on the World Wide Web (http:// lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/penleg.html).
President Clinton is expected to sign both newly passed bills into law.

HEADLINE: China and Taiwan Agree to Keep Their Discussion Going

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, China, Oct. 18

 BODY:
As a senior official from Taiwan ended a landmark visit here, China and Taiwan promised to continue talking but also reiterated their profoundly different visions about the island's political status.
The differences, extending even to what they ought to discuss, suggest that a solution to one of Asia's most dangerous rifts remains distant. 
 "Only when the Chinese mainland has achieved democracy can the two sides of the Taiwan Strait talk about reunification," said Koo Chen-fu, the 81-year-old tycoon representing Taiwan here. His statement followed an hour-and-a-half discussion with China's President and Communist Party leader, Jiang Zemin.
This morning, after Mr. Koo had a blunt exchange of views with Deputy Prime Minister Qian Qichen, Mr. Koo complained that Beijing still failed to recognize "one simple fact, which is the existence of the Republic of China."
His use of that name reflects the decades-long rift. In 1949 the Republic of China, governed by the Nationalist Party, lost a civil war to the Communists, who then founded the People's Republic of China. The Nationalist Government fled to Taiwan, which Beijing has considered a renegade province ever since.
After the morning meeting a Chinese spokesman, Tang Shubei, said Taiwan must "look upon the mainland objectively and bravely face up to the international situation." He added, "Don't be an ostrich."
Still, both sides seemed eager to put the best face on this visit and to keep the diplomatic wheels spinning. Even if they produce no breakthrough, continued talks are seen by both sides -- and by keenly interested bystanders like the United States -- as a way to head off a disastrous conflict that nobody wants.
China is anxious to negotiate Taiwan's return to the motherland. Taiwan has become a relatively prosperous democracy. More and more its people have an independent identity, and its Government vows that it will not even consider reuniting with the mainland until China, too, is transformed.
Mr. Koo, leader of Taiwan's semiofficial Straits Exchange Foundation, came to the mainland on Wednesday to meet with his counterpart, Wang Daohan, 84, the leader of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.
The two elder statesmen met in Singapore in 1993. But a second meeting scheduled in 1995 was canceled by China, which was angered by what it saw as moves by Taiwan toward independence. Relations reached a dangerous low in the next year as China shot missiles near Taiwan during the island's presidential election and the United States warned China to back off by sending two aircraft carriers near the area.
China has vowed to attack Taiwan if it declares independence and is pressing for political negotiations aimed at bringing the island under its wing. It has offered greater autonomy than that granted last year to Hong Kong -- if Taiwan will accept Chinese sovereignty. The offer includes the right to preserve its capitalist economy, hold elections and maintain its own army.
But Taiwan refuses to negotiate about its political status, insisting that China must acknowledge that Taiwan's Government is already sovereign in practice. Instead, Taiwan wants to talk about matters like fishing disputes and the treatment of cross-strait visitors and businesses.
During the current visit, the two sides pledged to continue the newly reopened dialogue, and Mr. Wang accepted an invitation to visit Taiwan at an undetermined future time.
Reflecting both sides' desire to keep up positive momentum, the question of future agendas was blurred: the Chinese said Taiwan had agreed to include political matters, while the Taiwan representatives said today that the practical issues they wished to discuss included, of course, a political element.
The meeting this morning between Mr. Koo and Mr. Qian included the most pointed and honest exchanges in a visit mostly filled with smiling toasts and visits to tourist sites.
In his meeting with President Jiang late this afternoon, which lasted half an hour longer than scheduled, Mr. Koo said in an interview, the divisive central question of Taiwan's political future was not directly discussed. He described the meeting as pleasant and friendly, and said the two had engaged in a general discussion about the meaning of democracy, with Mr. Jiang emphasizing that the mainland had its own needs and path.
A central goal of China, and of many of Taiwan's business leaders, is for Taiwan to lift its restrictions on direct travel, commerce and communications across the strait at a time when the island's investment and trade here are climbing. Mr. Koo said the restrictive policy represented Taiwan's effort "to strike a balance between security and commercial concerns."
"If we could get assurance that China will not use force against us, then we could talk about this," he said in the interview.
The Taiwan representatives, while expressing a desire for friendly dialogue, took several opportunities to publicize their positions.
When Mr. Wang, the Chinese official, agreed to make a return visit to Taiwan, the Taiwan delegation immediately suggested that he go in early December, so he could view at first hand the country's democratic legislative elections. The Chinese said that would be a bit too soon.
During the current visit, officials back in Taiwan complained that China was aggressively continuing its strategy of isolating Taiwan diplomatically, courting some of the 27 countries that still recognize Taiwan.
In this morning's meeting, Mr. Qian, the Chinese Deputy Prime Minister, said it was only a natural development that more countries would switch allegiance from Taiwan to the mainland, since that was the official United Nations position, according to Chinese media accounts.
The third-ranking member of the visiting delegation, Kang Ning-hsiang, has a well-known history as a democracy advocate on the island and is now associated with a pro-independence opposition party. The Taiwan officials asked if he could be one of the small group attending the Koo-Jiang meeting, but the Chinese refused. So this evening, when Mr. Koo gave a final news conference, Mr. Kang was also given a chance to speak, and he made his plea for democracy in China.
This morning, Mr. Koo surprised the Chinese by announcing that Taiwan was considering asking to join an American-led multinational program in North Korea that aims to forestall production of nuclear weapons ingredients by helping to provide other energy sources. China is generally annoyed by such efforts by Taiwan to gain international acceptance, but today it had no clear reaction.
Mr. Koo said he was encouraged by the visit. "We'll keep talking, and we'll find ways to narrow the differences," he said in the interview. "We do have the patience."
But diplomats here wonder and worry how patient China will be on reunification, which it calls its overriding foreign policy goal.

HEADLINE: Next Year in Congress, It's Back to the Surplus

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Faced with the first Federal budget surplus in a generation, the Clinton Administration and the Republican-controlled Congress squabbled throughout this year's tax-and-spending negotiations. In the end, they spent more than they had agreed to a year earlier but deferred until next year any of the big decisions about how to take advantage of the nation's newfound fiscal health.
The debate over the surplus is likely to become only more intense and more complex in 1999. 
 In the next year, Congress and the White House intend to take up substantial overhauls of the two biggest and most politically sensitive entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare, both of which might need to draw on the surplus to solve their long-term financial problems.
Republicans, increasingly frustrated at their inability to enact a conservative agenda, have vowed not to let President Clinton block their tax-cutting plans again, even if it means defying his insistence that the surplus be left untouched until Social Security's solvency is assured.
Meanwhile, the Pentagon is lobbying the Administration and Congress for substantially more money after years of cutbacks.
For their part, Democrats in Congress have a long list of pent-up spending demands, and with Mr. Clinton needing support from the party's liberal wing as he faces impeachment proceedings, they may get at least tacit support from the White House.
Never mind that the economic outlook is suddenly murky, and that any downturn would create considerable pressure to stimulate growth through tax cuts and spending increases. Added to that is the fact that a severe recession could call into question the assumption that the Government will enjoy surpluses for years to come.
"The first thing we learned this year is the difficulty politicians have keeping their hands off of surpluses," said Robert Bixby, the policy director for the Concord Coalition, a fiscal watchdog group.
"The temptation is certainly there to spend more money, and the temptation to go for more tax cuts is great," Mr. Bixby said. "Fiscal discipline only held because there was so much disagreement over how to divide up the spoils that they gridlocked."
In purely economic terms, gridlock is not a bad thing, at least to many economists, like Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. In not passing a big tax cut for the fiscal year that started Oct. 1 or dramatically increasing spending, Congress and the Administration agreed by default to let the Government run a surplus for a second year in a row. This fiscal year's surplus is projected to be on the order of $70 billion, or roughly the same as the surplus in the year just completed.
Running a surplus effectively means that the Treasury is able to pay down some of the $5.5 trillion national debt. Reducing the Government's borrowing needs frees up more money in the economy for investment by the private sector, helping to create jobs and improve productivity.
Reducing the national debt, however, is not seen by either party as an accomplishment with much political appeal. So Republicans are pressing ever-harder to use a big chunk of the surplus for tax cuts, arguing that putting the money back in the hands of the people is the best way to prevent Washington from spending it.
"We will be back in January with more Republicans," Speaker Newt Gingrich said on Thursday as the budget negotiations drew to a close and members of both parties prepared to head home to campaign. "Then we can have a tax cut."
Democrats say they have no intention of squandering their new claims to fiscal responsibility. But there will be considerable pressure from Democrats to use part of the surplus to help deal with the problems in Medicare and Social Security. And largely at Mr. Clinton's behest, the budget deal worked out last week called for about $20 billion more in spending than envisioned in the 1997 bipartisan balanced budget agreement.
Although that money was labeled "emergency" spending and is supposed to be for one-time payments to help farmers, improve security at United States embassies around the world and help prepare for the year 2000 computer problem, among other uses, it is still likely to create increased pressure to renegotiate the tight spending caps under which Congressional appropriators are operating. Neither party likes to be seen as cutting money for popular programs, emergency or not, and the caps for next year could leave both parties chafing.
"There will be tremendous pressure to reopen the budget agreement as far as how much money is permitted under the discretionary spending caps," said Richard E. May, a former Republican chief of staff for the House Budget Committee.
Mr. Clinton's demand that the surplus be set aside until he agrees with Congress on a plan to shore up Social Security for the retirement of the baby boom generation proved to be perhaps the year's most successful political maneuver, uniting Democrats and leaving Republicans fuming at their inability to cut taxes.
But there is no consensus about how to use the surplus to help Social Security; indeed, the Administration has always been vague about what Mr. Clinton has in mind. And the surplus will be only one element in reshaping Social Security, with considerable attention being focused on whether the system should permit individuals to invest a portion of their payroll taxes in the financial markets, a debate that has sharpened since the global economic crisis has sent Wall Street reeling.
Dealing with Medicare, long a flashpoint in partisan politics, could prove equally contentious. "Anyone who thinks a Medicare or Social Security solution is going to be easy," said Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee, "is mistaken."

HEADLINE: U.S. Still Unsure on Northwest-Continental Deal

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Talks between the Clinton Administration and Northwest Airlines ended inconclusively yesterday, with lawyers for the airline unable to overcome the Administration's objections to Northwest's bid to buy a controlling stake in Continental Airlines, participants said.
According to one account, the antitrust division of the Justice Department has until the end of today to file suit to block the deal, which has had a big impact on the domestic airline industry since it was announced in January. But one person close to the negotiations said that the Government had some wiggle room and assured Northwest yesterday that it would not take action today. 
 The Government has received several extensions from Northwest since it began reviewing the deal earlier this year, but the airline recently declined to give the Government more time to force it to make a decision.
"In many ways, it is up to Justice," a second person who was briefed on the negotiations said yesterday. "If they wanted to be super conservative, they would file tomorrow."
Officials at the Justice Department declined to comment, as did spokesmen for Northwest and Continental.
Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest airline, aims to acquire a majority stake in Continental, the fifth-largest carrier, from a Texas investment group for $311 million plus 4.1 million shares of Northwest stock. The two carriers intend to enter into a broad alliance, combining frequent-flier plans and selling seats on each other's flights while maintaining separate managements, boards and employees.
The so-called virtual merger touched off a series of deals between the other large airlines, though none involved the purchase of an equity stake, which requires Government approval. United, the nation's largest airline, entered into an alliance with Delta Air Lines, the third largest, while No. 2 American Airlines linked up with U S Airways.
The alliances were announced at a time when concern in Washington about the power of the big airlines to dominate major airports was already on the rise. Earlier this year, the Transportation Department proposed a series of guidelines designed to prevent larger carriers from preying on smaller airlines. The Justice Department has been investigating several carriers, including Northwest, for antitrust violations, while several bills designed to promote more airline competition were introduced in Congress.
Because the other alliances were formed in response to the Northwest-Continental proposal, whatever action the Government takes will affect not only that deal but the others as well.
Earlier this year, United and Delta abandoned their plan to sell seats on each others' domestic flights because of objections by Delta's pilots. But last week, Gerald Greenwald, United's chairman and chief executive, said that the carriers would seriously consider reviving their proposal if the Northwest-Continental deal went forward.
"If this is approved, we are going to have all the airlines trying to emulate it as much as possible," Kevin P. Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, which lobbies on behalf of several large corporations, said yesterday.
Mr. Mitchell, who argues that the deal would hurt competition, added that the Justice Department asked him to give his opinion in a formal statement, which he said they were planning to include in their lawsuit should they move to block the transaction.
Northwest has said that it will put its Continental shares in a trust controlled by a slate of independent directors and has vowed not to buy any more Continental stock. But the Government is not satisfied with the trust, which expires after six years.
If the Government does go to court, Northwest and Continental could decide to walk away from the deal. But a person with knowledge of their plans said they were ready to fight because they are convinced the Government has a weak case.
"They run substantial risk of losing should they bring their case," the person said of the Justice Department. "They are on weak legal and factual ground, and they don't have an economic case."

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL;
Ruling Today by Arbitrator On Guaranteed Contracts

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
More than 220 National Basketball Association players with guaranteed contracts will find out today whether they are to be paid during the management lockout, a long-awaited arbitrator's decision that may affect leverage in the league's dispute with the players and have major ramifications on American sports-labor law.
But neither the players nor the owners are counting on the ruling by the arbitrator, John D. Feerick, to speed up negotiations, especially if Feerick finds in favor of the players, an award that could approach $800 million in salaries. 
 N.B.A. attorneys have indicated to the union that if the decision goes against management, they would seek to have it vacated by appealing to Federal District Court in Manhattan and then, if necessary, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, a process that could prevent the players from getting paid for several months.
The N.B.A. has already canceled the first two weeks of the regular season because of the labor dispute.
The league has other litigation pending in Manhattan Federal Court. If the players win the ruling, the N.B.A. intends to renew its motion to disqualify Feerick. The motion was brought last summer on the grounds that no collective bargaining agreement existed and therefore he had no jurisdiction to hear the matter.
"If he rules in our favor, I think it emboldens the spirit and the resolve of the players," said Billy Hunter, the union's executive director. "But we understand that won't end the lockout. It just means they have to pay 200-some players."
Feerick will have taken the full 30 days to render his decision. Whatever he decides, his ruling will be watched carefully. There is no precedent for locked-out athletes being paid. During the N.B.A. summer lockout of 1995, players who missed paychecks did not file a grievance. Neither did National Hockey League players who were locked out for the first three months of the 1994-95 season.
A ruling for the union would be significant for all future negotiations between players and owners. The deterrent factor of a lockout is that employees subject to a collective bargaining agreement do not get paid once the agreement expires and they are unable to reach a new agreement.
If Feerick finds in favor of the players, there will be no economic incentive for those with guaranteed contracts to quickly reach an agreement. They would essentially be paid for not playing basketball.
If Feerick finds in favor of the owners, the reality of not being paid may spur the players to reach an agreement more quickly.
But Hunter disputes this notion, and in a conference call Friday talked openly about the entire season being canceled before the players would back away from their ultimate goals.
"I'm not at all concerned," Hunter said. "There's been no demonstration that there's going to be a change in our resolve."
Another significant development could be the departure of many players to Europe until the dispute is settled, according to at least two player agents.
"I think it would be a case-by-case basis, but yes, there's already some people talking about that," said Bill Strickland, a member of the union's agents advisory committee.
Steve Kauffman, another member of the committee, said he would explore the possibility of one of clients, Nets center Rony Seikaly, signing with a professional team in Greece.
"We wouldn't look to void his deal with the team," Kauffman said. "But we would want him to have the right for him to work temporarily until he could come back and honor his contract."
Russ Granik, the N.B.A. deputy commissioner, said the league has approved the idea of players earning a living elsewhere until the lockout is settled.
Proposals exchanged last week that included the concept of a luxury-tax system on player salaries appeared to reflect the first signs of progress in negotiations since the lockout began July 1. But both sides have termed the figures in each other's proposal as unacceptable, and it is unclear whether either side was willing to compromise.
"I don't think we should get too carried away about the possibilities just yet," Granik said. "When they explored the idea of a tax system, we were taking the players at their word that they wanted to make some headway. But to call their first proposal meaningless is charitable. They proposed something that has no impact. That can't be the solution."
The owners' goal is to slow the growth of player salaries in relation to leaguewide revenue over the next three years, while the players want to keep earning as much as possible.

HEADLINE: In One East Texas Town, the Bloom Is Off the Rose

BYLINE: By CAROL MARIE CROPPER 

DATELINE: TYLER, Tex., Oct. 16

 BODY:
When this year's Rose Queen walked onto the stage on Thursday night in her jeweled gown with a 16-foot train, she became part of a tradition dating to 1933, when this East Texas town may have actually deserved its nickname, "Rose Capital of the Nation."
Tourists from across the state and the nation, and even from some foreign countries, come to the annual Texas Rose Festival, which reaches a crescendo in a Saturday morning parade featuring floats heavy with roses that carry elaborately costumed duchesses, ladies in waiting and, of course, the queen. 
 But the festival is rapidly becoming the most colorful part of Tyler's rose industry. The days when most of the bushes containing red, yellow and pink roses sold in this country were grown on this sandy stretch of Texas prairie are long gone. Today, if a local man makes his living in roses, he is just as likely to do it packaging rose bushes grown elsewhere -- in California or Arizona, perhaps.
Only 10 to 15 major growers are left of the literally hundreds who grew roses here in the late 1950's, when Tyler produced more than 20 million bushes a year.
Cary Nix, who supplied most of the 16,000 roses used to decorate this year's 13 festival floats, is one of the few local growers remaining. "It's gone downhill pretty quick," he said of the business. "A lot of the young kids don't want to take it up."
Factories, making tires, air-conditioners and other products, have moved into this town of 80,000, as they have into other rural communities, providing steady jobs and higher hourly wages than farm labor. Young people have gone away to college and taken desk jobs. Then there is the weather.
One of the area's benefits is its long growing season -- about 245 days. But a hard freeze can still come early and kill bushes, and a drought can dry them up when growers do not have irrigation systems. The weather in competing areas, like California, is more predictable.
"It's hard work," Mr. Nix said, "and a lot of people just found something else to get into that wasn't such a gamble."
Mr. Nix, 39, is a fourth-generation rose grower. His 19-year-old son, Chad, donned white tie and tails to escort the Duchess of the Rose Growers to the coronation this year. But Mr. Nix said Chad wants no part of rose farming.
"He wants to get his degree in business," Mr. Nix said. "He wants to kind of get into marketing."
Even Mr. Nix's 11-year-old son turns up his nose at the idea. Unless something changes, Mr. Nix will be the last of his line in the business.
Roses are not the first thing one thinks of when Texas comes to mind -- notwithstanding the song "The Yellow Rose of Texas." The Lone Star State is more commonly associated with mesquite and scrub brush than with showy flowers.
But roses were first grown here commercially in the mid-1800's, imported by the Shamburger family, who came to the area from Tennessee. Others took up growing roses after a plant disease destroyed most of the area's fruit trees in the early 1900's. The industry boomed in the 1940's and 50's, as refrigeration made the cold storage of roses possible and young World War II veterans returned to Tyler and formed cooperatives to market their roses, said Brent Pemberton, a researcher in ornamental plants at Texas A&M University.
In 1949, 44 percent of all the rose bushes sold in America were produced in Tyler, he said. But only 5 million bushes will be grown in Tyler this year, though an additional 17 million will be processed here. Of the 50 million roses grown in the United States, Dr. Pemberton said, California is expected to produce 30 million plants, while Arizona is expected to grow 15 million.
So, while tourists may bring more than $2 million into the local economy during this festival, the Texas rose it celebrates has been toppled from its throne by fancier plants from farther west.
California growers, Jackson & Perkins in particular, have been adept at marketing to a more affluent audience, said Dr. Pemberton. They spend money to develop new hybrids and sell them by mail order in glossy catalogues.
Meanwhile, Texas growers have kept to old standbys like Mister Lincoln, a red tea rose, and Peace, which has yellow-pink blossoms. Their crop is more likely to go to garden centers and nurseries, sometimes sold as loss leaders.
Texans like Mr. Nix display a trace of cynicism about their competitors' ability to charge higher prices. "They'll come up with a new pink and there's already a pink the same color," he said. "Maybe they just put out new names for them."
But such business concerns don't seem to matter at festival time.
The social whirl surrounding the festival and the queen's coronation have become a part of Tyler culture -- the town's version of a debutante ball.
The queen's parents may spend $100,000 or more to buy her extravagant gown, sponsor a float for her to ride and hold a free afternoon tea at Tyler's municipal rose garden, said Lyn Long, one of the women who volunteer to arrange the rose baskets for the floats.
Just having your daughter be a lady in waiting costs at least $10,000, she said.
"It's a little snobbish thing," Mrs. Long said, only half joking. "Every mother wants their daughter to grow up and be in the Rose Festival."
The question is: How many daughters -- or sons -- will want to work in the fields the festival celebrates?

HEADLINE: THE TECHNOLOGY TRADE: A special report;
Chinese Said to Reap Gains In U.S. Export Policy Shift

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH and ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
Shortly after he took office in 1993, President Clinton traveled to Silicon Valley to lay out his vision of a robust American economy buoyed by high-technology companies that could compete anywhere in the world.
The night before his speech, Mr. Clinton went out to dinner with two dozen executives, some of whom complained bitterly about Government rules impeding the overseas sale of computers and other cutting-edge technologies. 
 Mr. Clinton grabbed a pad, furiously took notes, and promised relief, one executive recalled.
Over the next five years, the President delivered, personally presiding over what industry executives and Government officials agree was one of the most sweeping relaxations of export restrictions in American history.
"These reforms," Mr. Clinton said in a 1993 letter detailing the changes to a leading computer executive, "can help unleash our companies to compete successfully in the global market."
In the years that followed, the new rules helped Mr. Clinton fulfill his vision of a centrist Democratic Party with close ties to American business. Grateful high-technology companies showered the Democratic Party with campaign contributions, cementing a new financial base for a party that has historically struggled to raise money from corporate America.
Administration officials portray the initiatives as one of Mr. Clinton's most lasting legacies, saying it bolstered national security by helping to make America's economy the world's strongest. The flood of new exports also created high-paying jobs at home.
But critics, including Republicans in Congress and some former Clinton Administration officials, argue that the high-technology exports had a serious side effect, strengthening countries like China, which some view as a potential adversary. Mr. Clinton, they contend, was blinded by his enthusiasm for securing this country's global edge and insufficiently attentive to his policies' effect on America's long-term national security.
House and Senate committees are examining whether China took advantage of the looser rules on exports to enhance its military and to obtain technology that it passed on to rogue states, including North Korea. The Senate Intelligence Committee and a special House panel, which are scheduled to report their findings in early 1999, have held a series of closed-door hearings this fall.
An examination by The New York Times of the Administration's export policies on China, based on interviews as well as Government and industry documents, shows that the looser regulations enabled Chinese companies to obtain a wide range of sophisticated technology, some of which has already been diverted to military uses.
The new rules allowed American companies to sell a host of products without prior Government approval, from high-speed computers to machine tools to communications gear subject to restrictions during the cold war. While the regulations fostered trade, they made it much harder for intelligence agencies to track how American equipment was used overseas, Administration officials said.
Until 1993, most sales to China of goods with possible military uses required American companies to obtain a Government license naming both the customer and the location in which the equipment would be installed.
Senior officials acknowledge that President Clinton decided to change the rules without a rigorous review by intelligence officials or other national security experts.
In 1995, Central Intelligence Agency analysts wrote a report warning of the military implications of technology transfers to China, but it never became an official assessment because senior aides felt it was "not well done and lacked analytical depth," an American official said.
The Government's last serious examination of technology sales to China, they said, had been conducted by the Reagan Administration in 1984 at a time when the United States was trying to build up China as a counterweight against the Soviet Union.
Since then, the Soviet Union has collapsed. And China has been caught selling missile equipment to nations like Iran and Pakistan while using its new access to Western technology to expand its economic and military power.
Paul Wolfowitz, a former official in the State and Defense Departments who participated in the 1984 study, asserted that international developments since then argue for a tightening of controls on sales to China, not a loosening.
"There is an urgent need for a fundamental review of export policy to China especially because China is in the process of becoming -- albeit still quite slowly -- the major strategic competitor and potential threat to the United States and its allies in the first half of the next century," said Mr. Wolfowitz, who is dean of the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.
But another China expert sees Beijing's improvement of its technologically backward military as more benign.
"Its overall policy is not to be a trouble maker," said A. Doak Barnett, a professor emeritus at Johns Hopkins, who added that "gradually building up its defense establishment is something I would expect it to do but in my view it's not threatening."
Whatever China's intentions, the Clinton Administration over the last five years has approved export to China of $3 billion in technology with military or civilian applications, about 5 percent of overall American sales to China.
A report prepared for the Commerce Department last December concludes that the Administration has little means of knowing whether this equipment is harming American national security or being used by Chinese industries to challenge American competitors and jobs.
"It may be too late by the time that U.S. industry and/or Government realize there is a problem emerging in either of these areas," the confidential report says.
American intelligence agencies are trying to assess how much the Chinese military has gained from the imports. Officials say they have already concluded that China's army gained access to some of the high-speed computers sold to civilian customers since 1996, when the rules on computer exports were eased. The officials said the agencies were unable to assess how the equipment was being used because they lacked basic information about the deals.
Clinton Administration officials said that the Chinese have returned the one computer that was improperly diverted and that a new agreement between the two countries will improve the ability of American officials to check the whereabouts of equipment exported to China.
Representative Christopher Cox, the Southern Californian Republican who heads the select House panel on technology transfers to China, said, "There's always been a tension within the Government about which exports are proper."
But, he added, "these days without question the overriding impulse to sell, sell, sell is in the ascendancy."
 
The Old System
Cold War Rules Get New Scrutiny
The United States and its Western allies zealously guarded their technological edge during the cold war, forbidding the sale to Communist bloc nations of any item with a conceivable military use. Military contractors did not chafe too much under the restrictions because the Pentagon had a seemingly limitless budget for their wares.
In 1983, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping complained bitterly about the restrictions on technology exports, prompting the Reagan Administration to ease some of the rules for China. It was seen in America's interest, Mr. Wolfowitz recently told Congress, to help Beijing develop the military muscle needed to counter the "formidable threat" from the Soviet Union. In addition, he said, China had been helpful in arming the Afghan rebels.
But the United States maintained tight controls over what he termed the most sensitive technologies -- those that could improve China's missiles or anti-submarine capabilities.
The fall of Communism brought a precipitous drop in the Pentagon budget, prompting the defense industry to scramble for new markets. Companies that once made spy satellites for American spy agencies began making equipment for cellular networks that served China or Russia.
They quickly confronted a significant obstacle to making money on sales to former adversaries. The cold war-era rules remained largely in effect, and they were being interpreted by career officials who had devoted their lives to blocking exports to Russia and its allies.
Enter Bill Clinton. His 1992 campaign had been driven by the slogan "It's the economy, stupid." Aides say Mr. Clinton's views on foreign policy were framed by his experiences as a governor of Arkansas, a poor state that looked overseas for investments and markets, and he arrived in Washington determined to expand trade.
In an immediate sign of this policy's political importance, Mr. Clinton sent the Democratic Party's chief fund-raiser, Ronald H. Brown, to take over the Commerce Department, which promotes American exports.
The Pentagon was traditionally the strongest voice against technology exports, and Mr. Clinton made several appointments calculated to change the culture. William J. Perry, an executive at a Silicon Valley company who was vocally opposed to the existing system of export controls, was named Deputy Defense Secretary and then Defense Secretary. John M. Deutch, a professor with similar views, was named to a senior post at the Pentagon, and then became Director of Central Intelligence.
Mr. Perry, testifying at his confirmation hearing to be Deputy Defense Secretary, told senators in February 1993 that controlling dual-use technology is "a hopeless task." He continued, "It only interferes with our companies' ability to succeed internationally if we try to impose all sorts of controls in that area."
Mr. Perry said, "We really need to bear down" on controlling the most critical components necessary to build weapons.
President Clinton took a personal interest in the new policy. Shortly after he returned from his foray to Silicon Valley, he spelled out his intentions in a letter to Edward McCracken, the chief executive officer of computer maker Silicon Graphics. Company officials had complained to Mr. Clinton over dinner about export rules.
"One reason I ran for President was to tailor export controls to the realization of a post-cold war world," Mr. Clinton wrote.
After noting the need to retain strong controls in some areas to combat the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, Mr. Clinton detailed his intention to "unleash our companies to compete successfully in the global market." The United States, he said, would slash red tape and loosen controls on the overseas sale of computers, telecommunication equipment and machine making tools.
 
The New System
Relaxed Rules Benefit Chinese
Those restrictions were an integral part of the cold war. For decades, every proposed export of technology was weighed by a committee of Western nations. It had authority to block sales involving military hardware or so-called "dual-use" equipment that had military or civilian applications.
Even before the committee disbanded in 1994, the Clinton Administration moved to ease restrictions on the sales of many dual-use items. The new rules allowed companies to export many categories of technology without applying for a Government license.
American companies were delighted with the new system, which relieved them of a time-consuming and frustrating process. But the benefits came with a cost. Because sales could be made without export licenses, the Government and its intelligence agencies no longer had a record of many deals that involved dual-use equipment. There was no way to trace patterns of sales, to know, for example, how many decoding devices were being sold to a particular country.
Commerce Department internal documents show that China has been a major beneficiary of this policy. According to a 1995 estimate, more than $1.9 billion in annual trade with China had been removed from Federal scrutiny.
A ban remains in effect on the sale to China of the most militarily potent technologies, like ballistic missiles, spy satellites and advanced fighter aircraft. Beijing buys those weapons from Russia, Europe and Israel.
"China has benefited more than any other country from U.S. decontrols on certain dual-use commodities enacted in late 1993 and early 1994," one Commerce Department document says. "There has been a 60 percent decrease in the number of individual export licenses required for trade with China (from 2,229 in 1993 to only 925 in 1994)."
The rules shifted much of the burden for controlling exports to the companies making the deals.
Previously, the applications for licenses to sell sophisticated electronic equipment overseas were scrutinized by Pentagon and intelligence analysts. One crucial question was whether the customer was really a "front" for military users barred from buying such equipment.
The Clinton Administration's new policy relied on industry executives to raise questions about their own sales. They were required to seek a Commerce Department license only if they believed the equipment would end up in military hands.
Aerospace officials say they are ill-equipped to make such evaluations.
Last year, the Administration began making public the names of questionable customers, to warn exporters. But industry officials said the list of about a dozen nuclear production facilities was a tiny slice of what was available and ignored entities involved in missile activity.
The problem is particularly acute, industry executives said, when the deals involved China, where the military has long played a role in commercial ventures and where it is difficult to distinguish between military officers' personal and professional dealings.
One of the first deals under the new rules, a 1994 sale of telecommunications equipment to China, illustrates the complexities. The Commerce Department's decision to allow such exports without a license made it easier for AT&T and other American companies to sell hundreds of millions of dollars in sophisticated equipment to Chinese companies building civil telecommunication networks.
An examination of the deal by the General Accounting Office, the audit arm of Congress, found that the equipment was sold to a Chinese-American joint venture, Hua Mei, "without Commerce review, even though the company was partially controlled by several high-level members of the Chinese military."
AT&T officials in turn told the audit agency that "they did not ask the Commerce Department to determine if Hua Mei was a civil end user, nor were they required to."
It is not known whether the company has put the equipment to military use. But Pentagon officials told the G.A.O. that in 1994, China's army was seeking to buy this same type of technology as it moved to improve its communications networks.
 
The Reassessment
A Computer Sale Sets Off Alarms
By 1995, the Pentagon was urging Congress to look more closely at export policy. Military officials noted that the effect of technology was cumulative, and that while individual sales might appear benign, a combination of cutting-edge acquisitions would allow an adversary to build much better bombs or radars.
President Clinton, documents show, was moving in the opposite direction.
According to a 1995 Commerce Department document, the President "made clear," in private conversations he had with Mr. Brown, that "he does not believe we have done enough to streamline and liberalize."
The document mapped out how Mr. Brown should lobby high-level Administration officials to ease controls on computer exports and shift items like communications satellites, engine technology and commercial data-scrambling devices. Such items were on a list of equipment that required a State Department license, and companies believed they could close more deals if authority over the exports were moved to Mr. Brown's Commerce Department.
Their enthusiasm for the Commerce Department was well grounded.
When it comes to proposed sales of an item regulated by the State Department, the Pentagon holds a virtual veto, a privilege it exercised regularly during the cold war.
The Commerce Department is responsible for promoting American exports. When it weighs an overseas deal, the Pentagon has only one vote out of five agencies, and the right to appeal if its objections are overruled, which has been rarely used.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher insisted that his department retain jurisdiction. He was overruled in early 1996 by Mr. Clinton, opening the way to billions of dollars of satellite sales to Chinese companies.
At about the same time, the Administration was weighing whether to lift restrictions on the export of some advanced computers. Officials asked outside consultants to study the issue, and they came back with a report that asserted the controls were pointless. The powerful computers manufactured by American companies would soon be widely available from foreign competitors, the report said.
The Administration asked the consultants to assess whether computer sales could pose a threat to the American military. Their report did not take a position, saying the Government did not have enough information to draw a conclusion.
This left the issue to Mr. Clinton, who decided to fulfill his pledge to the Silicon Valley executives and relax the restrictions.
"The President made a judgment on what the threat was, and the President's judgment was reflected in his decision," said William A. Reinsch, Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration. The new rules took effect early in 1996.
Soon after, Chinese companies bought 77 of the high-speed computers, which can be used to predict weather patterns but can also scramble secret communications or design powerful nuclear weapons.
Disclosure of those sales prompted Congress to reinstate license requirements for some advanced computers.
This year, the Central Intelligence Agency and other Federal agencies concluded that at least some of those computers are being used by China's military. The details of their use remain unclear, officials said.
A review by the G.A.O last month called into question the Administration's basic assumptions in lifting the controls on computers. Contrary to what the consultants said in their report, the international market for advanced computers remains strongly dominated by American companies.
Congress acted after The New York Times reported that two American aerospace companies were under investigation to determine whether they went too far in sharing rocket technology with Chinese scientists seeking to determine the causes of a failed satellite launching in 1996. The inquiry, which continues, has since been broadened to include a failed launching in 1995. Rocket technology for ballistic missiles is similar to that used to send satellites into orbit. Both companies have denied wrongdoing.
Just this month, Congress reversed Mr. Clinton's 1996 decision and returned satellite exports to the State Department. At the same time, lawmakers created a senior Pentagon position for technology security after concluding military officials' role in controlling exports to countries like China had been "significantly and improperly reduced over the years."
 
The Fallout
Report Cites a Loss Of Oversight Role
The military significance of America's exports to China is hotly debated.
China's army is in the throes of modernization. For now, Beijing is more of a regional power than a global threat.
A commission headed by former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld concluded last July that the looser controls on exports, coupled with lax enforcement, had increased the possibility that rogue nations like Iran or North Korea would build ballistic missiles that could hit the United States.
China "poses a threat to the United States" by supplying technology to these pariah states, the report said.
Commission members said they were startled at how much the Government had freed the export of dual-use technology and how little American officials could do to track its use or assure it was not diverted to terrorists or foreign militaries.
"What's particularly troubling," said R. James Woolsey, a commission member who was Mr. Clinton's first Director of Central Intelligence, "is that the massive decontrol in the last few years of the export of dual-use technology in general, and specifically to China, has made it almost impossible for the U.S. to monitor where such technology has gone much less exercise any control over it."
Another commission member, Barry Blechman, said technology transfer "is a central reason why we reached our conclusion."
Mr. Blechman is president of DFI International, the Washington consulting firm that prepared a confidential report for the Commerce Department last December on technology transfers to China.
The report concludes that China does not pose a direct threat to American competitiveness in high technology. But it might in the future, especially in areas like electronics, which by 1996 had become China's top export back to the United States.
Then President Clinton's policy might wind up being turned upside down with China jeopardizing the same high-paying jobs that President Clinton used to justify increasing exports to China.
According to the report, the concern is that "as Chinese manufacturing becomes more sophisticated and technical in nature" -- thanks in part to American and Western exports of that technology -- "Chinese high tech products could potentially undercut such products (and therefore jobs as well)."

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: POLITICAL MEMO;
Challenger Presses Dodd In Lopsided Senate Race

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Oct. 18

 BODY:
A man with little to lose makes a dangerous debate opponent. So in mock debates, aides to Senator Christopher J. Dodd have been trying to rattle him in preparation for going lectern-to-lectern this week with his Republican challenger, Gary A. Franks, a former Congressman with low poll ratings.
Mr. Franks promises fireworks at three debates, which start Friday. Just for starters, he said, he plans to demand that Senator Dodd release a letter from the Justice Department certifying that he is not under investigation for any of the fund-raising irregularities that occurred when he was general chairman of the Democratic National Committee. 
 Senator Dodd, 54, says he did nothing wrong, that he was among the first to call for an investigation, and that his role was limited to serving as "a party spokesperson and a figurehead."
But Mr. Franks, 45, who attacked Mr. Dodd first for being too close to the President, and lately for distancing himself from him, said he plans to "turn up the volume" at the debates and in new television advertisements this week.
"We're ready to go at him," Mr. Franks said as the gowns and tuxedos drifted out of a candle-lit Republican reception at the Maritime Aquarium in Norwalk on Saturday night. "We have a lot of new material that we've been saving for the debates, and we're going to hit him extremely hard by just telling people about his record."
Mr. Franks refers derisively to the Democratic chairmanship as "a moonlighting job" for the Senator. "Chris Dodd should not be able to -- excuse my French -- skate -- on that issue when he was chairman of it," he said.
The University of Connecticut issued a poll this weekend showing Mr. Franks 40 points behind, although he says his own polling has showed him within single digits of Mr. Dodd. In any case, Mr. Franks has been blessed with an opponent who is a favorite punching bag of conservatives beyond Connecticut. Senator Dodd has a leftish voting record, has been friends with President Clinton for 30 years, and has the bad fortune to have led his party at a time it was raising money from monks and foreigners. Now, at the last minute, critics of Mr. Dodd are giving Mr. Franks some help just to keep the heat on Mr. Dodd.
Last week, Mr. Franks was so low on money that to stave off the political obituaries for a few more days, he refused to release a Federal disclosure form showing his dismal campaign finances that had been mailed to Washington and soon would be public anyway.
But on Thursday, like one of those service patrols that rescue stranded motorists, the Republican National Committee came along and promised to fill Mr. Franks's tank with as much as $320,000 -- enough for a heavy run of television advertising in this compact state. Mr. Franks's campaign does not come close to meeting the strict criteria that the national parties usually use to determine if a race is competitive enough to finance. But the Republican Party is flush, Gov. John G. Rowland is on a roll and Mr. Franks is one of the party's few prominent black candidates -- all of which qualify Mr. Franks for what amounts to political mad money.
Then on Friday, Mr. Franks was on Rush Limbaugh's radio show, making a pitch for donations. This appearance resulted from Mr. Franks's assault on Senator Dodd for referring in passing to Mr. Clinton as "the idiot" for his handling of the Monica Lewinsky matter. Mr. Franks's staff hauled a big desk and black chair down the stairs of his headquarters in Waterbury so that for the benefit of the one television camera that showed up, he could sit behind the desk and demand that Mr. Dodd apologize to the President, since the remark could undermine the United States overseas.
Even Mr. Limbaugh seemed skeptical at first. "Are you trying to get laughs here with this?" the host asked. But as Mr. Franks explained that this was a terrible example to set for children, Mr. Limbaugh caught the spirit, and soon the two were agreeing that Mr. Dodd's slip of the tongue could qualify as "hate speech."
Senator Dodd, who has been in the House or Senate for 24 years, said he thinks enough Connecticut voters know him that harsh charges will not be credible. Despite his lead, he has taken no chances, and has responded in person and in ads to several of Mr. Franks's volleys. "I'm really not the issue," Senator Dodd said over a chicken salad in a Hartford diner.
"Education, health care, the economic program of this country -- those are the issues," Senator Dodd said. "I think to make me the issue, and disregard the issues that voters care about, is a perilous strategy.
Mr. Franks's attacks on Mr. Dodd do not always seem to square with the record. Mr. Franks said that during the debates he plans to revive his criticism of a comment Mr. Dodd made in February about a child-care bill that the Senator sponsored and that was later passed.
"He said exactly what he said," Mr. Franks said, which was that stay-at-home moms have the luxury of being able to go off and play tennis and cards all day at the country club."
In fact, the Congressional Record indicates that Mr. Dodd was making the opposite point.
In arguing for tax credits for mothers who work at home, he said: "It is not a question of, 'I want to go play golf or go to the club and play cards.' These are people trying very hard on their own or with their spouse to hold their families together."
Although he is more open than most candidates about his relish for going for the jugular, Mr. Franks says his candidacy has a higher purpose. He asserts that his "empowerment message" and his candidacy are inspirations for fellow black people.
"When I ran every one of my elections, it's helped the community," Mr. Franks said. "It's helped the black community. It's helped my state, as well," he said. "This race will speak volumes for this state and also for this country."

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: THE VOTERS;
A Bitter Fight for Senate Is Just Politics Upstate

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

 BODY:
This is the time of year in Cortland, N.Y., when leaves turn red and gold and signs sprout on front lawns with the names of favored candidates. This year's crop offer an instructive guide to the neck-and-neck Senate race between the Republican incumbent, Alfonse M. D'Amato, and his Democratic challenger, Representative Charles E. Schumer.
Neither one appears on a single lawn. 
 That may not be unusual, given the adage that all politics is local. In Cortland County, a lovely stretch of rolling hills and pretty old towns south of Syracuse, the creation of a new judgeship has fired a lively race between William Ames and Richard Van Donsel, whose names alternate about evenly along the leaf-strewn yards. When national politics do come up in conversations, it is almost always about President Clinton's problems -- almost always with a dollop of sympathy for the President and disdain for his perceived tormentors.
But if the key to victory in the Senate race lies in upstate communities like this, it has not been found yet. Mr. D'Amato has the advantage that most people here are registered Republicans and know little about his opponent, while Mr. Schumer has the consolation that Cortland voters regularly elect Democrats and do not particularly like what they know of the incumbent.
Even Mr. D'Amato's attempt to fan the old upstate-downstate rivalry against Mr. Schumer is not generating much heat. From up here, Mr. D'Amato's hometown, Hempstead, L.I., seems not much closer than Mr. Schumer's Brooklyn constituency.
The Senate race just has not caught on, said Bruce Hollenbeck, who runs Hollenbeck Cider Mills on Route 392, just east of Virgil. "Upstate is mostly Republican, so I think D'Amato is probably hard to beat here. Schumer, I don't know the guy."
Mr. Hollenbeck's friend Sidney N. Greenberg, a lawyer who said he was "closer to 87 than 86," said of the race: "I know Schumer is a good guy, but I can't point to anything he's done. D'Amato, in my view, is just another politician, and I mean that in the pejorative sense."
Kenneth T. DeMunn, who owns JTS Lumber Inc., said: "D'Amato leaves a very bad taste. Too much of the buddy system. Schumer looks like a real nice politician, but then all politicians do. We don't know what he's for. They both talk of good schools, low taxes, but nobody's telling us how."
While Mr. D'Amato enjoys considerable name recognition after 18 years in the Senate, he must also put up with an image expressed in terms like "slippery" or "typical politician." Mr. Schumer is best known here as the Democrat who beat Geraldine A. Ferraro in the primary, and increasingly as the brunt of Mr. D'Amato's attack advertisements. Both must contend with the public's tangible irritation with all politics, brought on by the Clinton business.
"I don't like either one of them," Irv Goodrich, a retired math teacher at Cortland High School, said yesterday. "D'Amato has been in there long enough and should be investigated for all the stunts he's pulled. I don't know much about Schumer, but I don't think his record is that spectacular. He seems like he is strictly a metropolitan New York person. I guess I'll be looking for the lesser of two evils."
From the day the campaign began, Mr. D'Amato has flooded television with ads like the one showing New York City Democrats turning into sharks as they swim upstate, and he has hammered away at Mr. Schumer as a wastrel liberal from Brooklyn. Mr. Schumer, who has unleashed scathing attacks of his own, branding Mr. D'Amato as a liar and extremist, has also played up the fact that his father lived in Utica as a boy, and that he is at home all over the state. More recently, the Senator has attacked Mr. Schumer for missing votes in Congress, a criticism that appears to resonate less here than the upstate-downstate divide does.
The political schism between the two parts of the state dates back at least a century. Robert J. Spitzer, a professor of politics at the State University of New York College at Cortland, said the predominantly rural conservative upstaters have traditionally perceived New York City and its suburbs as a greedy bastion of liberalism, whose profligate welfare programs suck the hard-earned dollars of the northern counties. The upstaters have also felt that New Yorkers look on them, if at all, as hicks and throwbacks. Above all, there is the sense that the small cities and rural hamlets upstate are overshadowed by the vast wealth and population of Greater New York.
But the old stereotypes are coming undone. Despite a majority of registered Republicans, the County Legislature here has long been controlled by Democrats, while New York is now run by a tough Republican mayor. More important, the flow of largess has reversed and is going northward these days, as upstate has fallen on hard times while New York City has enjoyed a boom.
Cortland and its population of 48,000 have been especially hard hit, a fact that figures in conversations and in the local paper, The Cortland Standard, far more than politics.
Unemployment is at 7.3 percent. Rubbermaid recently pulled out of town, leaving Cortland residents grumbling that the company left right after a decade of tax breaks expired. Smith Corona, which once employed thousands, has all but closed up shop now that nobody needs its typewriters anymore.
But none of that has fully stilled the upstate-downstate resentments, or their invocation in political campaigns. "Is it effective? Probably is, because candidates never pass up a chance to use the argument," Mr. Greenberg said. "They're always crying that downstate is trying to impose its will on upstate."
But Mr. DeMunn was not convinced the theme would help Mr. D'Amato. "He's viewed as a New Yorker, too. Hempstead is even farther from upstate than Brooklyn," he said. "They're all seen here as sharks, as a group of people from New York City out to do you harm."
Even those who do not resent the downstaters see a huge divide.
Victor Siegle, who owns a software business, JobOrder, and heads two regional economic development panels, knows that upstate benefits from downstate prosperity. But the differences between the regions are so profound, he argued, that the two probably should be separated.
"Even though we'd lose money, we'd be better off independent, like Puerto Rico," he said. "It's so frustrating to see powerful forces run our lives."
Mr. Siegle, who is Jewish, did not see anti-Semitic overtones in the "sharks from Brooklyn" image. In fact, he said, most people were unaware that Mr. Schumer was Jewish.
Of the regional schism, Professor Spitzer said: "The split is less pronounced than it was several decades ago, but it's still very much a part of New York politics. But if you look at the Senate race, D'Amato is under significant handicaps. He's had three terms, and the third is traditionally the critical election for U.S. Senators. There's a general feeling that D'Amato has worn out the welcome, a sense that it's time for somebody else. On the other hand, Schumer is from downstate, from Brooklyn, and still not that well known. His biggest problem is getting known."
Attacking his opponent has always been Mr. D'Amato's main campaign weapon, Mr. Spitzer said. "It's often said that nastiness turns voters off, but the fact is that negative campaigning is effective for the most part," he said. "But of course it's a double-edged sword."
The edge pointed at Mr. Schumer is allowing Mr. D'Amato to shape the challenger's image. So Mr. Schumer's most urgent task, said Jeff Stonecash, a professor of political science at Syracuse University, is to start shaping his own identity. "Schumer is lost if the incumbent takes the initiative to identify him."
The Congressman's image here is certainly fuzzy. "There's been so much negative advertising that I don't really know what Schumer stands for," Fred Jacobs, a retired Smith Corona worker, said yesterday. "D'Amato has been to Cortland several times when various companies have been going out of business. He supports us even though he hasn't been able to stop company closings."
John Nozynski said he knew what would bring out the vote. "We'd like to see someone represent us who is honorable, even-handed, sensitive to our needs, and doesn't just talk on TV," he said, expressing a nostalgia as poignant and noble as the grand Victorian mansion that he maintains as curator of the "1890 House" museum on Tompkins Street.
The house was built by the first magnate of Cortland, Chester Franklin Wickwire, whose wire factory once covered many acres. On a trip to New York City, Mr. Wickwire espied the mansion that James A. Bailey, of Barnum & Bailey fame, had just built himself, and ordered the architect Samuel Burrage Reed to build him a replica in Cortland.
It is a stunning example of the heyday of Victoriana, and Mr. Nozynski has painstakingly restored original wall patterns and furniture. Among these relics of Cortland's proud roots, Mr. Nozynski resisted the notion that upstaters would fall for something as crass as a campaign of slurs. "Please don't paint us as people who would fall for that," he said. "I think there's more to the minds of New Yorkers than something as glib as that."

Slavery Echoes in the Prism of a Film

BYLINE: By MARGO JEFFERSON 

 BODY:
While film executives raise their eyebrows and ponder the fate of "Beloved" as a high-profile "race movie," let us consider other more interesting and honest ways in which it can be seen.
This big, rich film, based on Toni Morrison's extraordinary novel of the same name, has been called "my 'Schindler's List' " by its star and co-producer, Oprah Winfrey. Which means that it is a harrowing, fact-based story about people who outwit and outlast war, holding out for a future that no one intended them to have. 
 "Schindler's List" was about Germany's war against the Jews. Think of slavery as the American South's war against African-Americans, and think of slaves as war veterans and survivors who, like prison and concentration camp inmates, have to reconstruct their souls as well as their bodies when the war ends.
But "Beloved" is also a women's picture, Hollywood's time-honored antidote to the war movie. It is a fierce melodrama (never a derogatory word in my book) about a woman cast out by her community -- in this case, the newly freed, self-consciously respectable black community of Ohio -- for sins committed as a sexual being or a mother. Never mind that her deed was noble as well as monstrous. Sethe, played by Ms. Winfrey, must work through her destiny of punishment, expiation and sacrifice.
What a pleasing irony that the only other big Hollywood film I can recall that so effectively joins the war drama to the women's picture is "Gone With the Wind." We get only brief flashbacks to plantation days here (I need hardly say how different the perspective is), and we have no Civil War battles. The blacks of this world have left their plantations, and Sethe has managed to improve her lot simply by acquiring what Scarlett O'Hara deemed the mark of her degradation: a piece of property no one else cared for and a subsistence living.
We have a troubled couple, too: Sethe and Paul D, the brother of her long-lost husband, trying to make sense of each other and trying to make a life together. But the stars, Ms. Winfrey and Danny Glover, look much more like the people we see every day than like the ones we usually see in the movies. It has been a long time since filmgoers were allowed to be moved watching hard-working middle-aged people fall in love and make love.
Finally, "Beloved" is a multilayered ghost story in which the unquiet dead return to claim the living. Sethe and her youngest daughter, Denver, live in a haunted house, in thrall to the angry ghost of Sethe's dead child. When Paul D moves in, the isolated, unhappy Denver grows jealous; so does the ghost, for she takes human form, calling herself Beloved. And what does she want? Nothing less than Sethe's soul.
Black families are rarely viewed as prey to the kinds of psychological complexities that have been at the center of the West's intellectual history since Freud. But here we are in "Beloved," nine years out of slavery, with a full-blown Freudian family romance. Children witness the primal scene (their mother having sex with a man who is not even their father); daughters punish the male intruder with rejection or attempts at seduction; sisters compete for their mother's love. And over it all is a past that has laid siege to every sanctioned notion of what a family can or should be. What emotional burdens -- call them curses -- does someone who has endured certain horrors pass on to the next generation? The children of survivors are nurtured on their parents' nightmares as well as on their love.
When "Beloved" was first published in 1987, some were uncomfortable with its supernatural aspect. But it was a brilliant choice. Ghosts embody what is almost past enduring: murder, imprisonment, guilt and shame over deeds that cannot be undone. The 19th century produced some of our greatest ghost stories. And not only novels; I am thinking of black folklore, of all those slavery-shaped tales in which bloody bones rise up to utter curses and devils stroll into backyards to make small talk before the deadly bargain is struck. Richard Wright wrote that if Edgar Allan Poe had been black, he would not have invented horror, horror would have invented him. In "Beloved," the inventor and the invention are as one.
The director of "Beloved," Jonathan Demme, understands all of these elements, though sometimes he staggers under their weight. He works well with actors (don't just think of "Philadelphia" or "The Silence of the Lambs," think of "Melvin and Howard" and "Something Wild"), and he has a first-rate cast here. Ms. Winfrey is very good as Sethe, who both invents and is invented by horror. She projects self-protective sternness, but also vulnerability at those moments when Sethe finds herself opening up slightly, against her will. As Paul D, Mr. Glover is even better. He is such an attentive actor, making emotional shifts (from wariness to bravado to a wordless melancholy) with unfussy honesty.
But it is Kimberly Elise as Denver and Thandie Newton as Beloved who give the most fascinating performances. Ms. Elise is the moody, isolated child in a family where tragedy has sopped up too much parental emotion. Born in Ohio, Denver is the one least marked by slavery, the one filled with silent yearning for another life. For her, freedom means finding a way to live and thrive outside that memory- and mother-haunted house. Ms. Elise's work is subtle and nuanced. Ms. Newton's is uncanny and amazingly bold. Despite looking like a lovely young woman, her Beloved begins human life where she left off when she died: as a voracious infant who can barely walk or talk, who smears food all over her face and stuffs it into her gaping mouth, who weeps, rages, giggles, demands her way, then vomits and goes to sleep if she is thwarted. And she rolls her eyes constantly, the way slightly brain-damaged children do, but also the way those repellent caricatures of pickaninnies used to. She is terrifying to watch.
In the end, "Beloved" is a powerful story of postwar reconciliation. And I certainly hope it will reach audiences with at least the force of "Gone With the Wind." The tale is every bit as compelling and infinitely more truthful. (How can there be reconciliation without truth?) It is also infinitely more generous, and in this way reminds me of William Wyler's film about World War II veterans and families, "The Best Years of Our Lives." (Isn't it interesting that the Civil War feels as close, sometimes closer, as World War II?)
In Wyler's film, too, the war has ended, but the changes it has wrought are everywhere. How do people grapple with what they saw and did, with the physical, psychological and spiritual damage they suffered? How do they resume a life with their families, or put together a family from whomever is left over? And how, between the hard cold social and economic facts of life and the subtler but no less implacable emotional ones, do they learn to claim the right not just to life or liberty but to the pursuit of happiness?

CORRECTION-DATE: October 28, 1998, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
The "Revisions" column on Oct. 19, about ways of characterizing the film "Beloved," misstated the relationship between two characters. Sethe and her lover, Paul D., are unrelated; he is not her brother-in-law.

HEADLINE: Stronger U.S. Sales Lift McDonald's Profit

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: OAK BROOK, Ill., Oct. 19

 BODY:
The McDonald's Corporation, the world's largest restaurant company, said today that its third-quarter profit rose 7.4 percent as the company bolstered sales in the United States and weathered economic slumps overseas.
Net income rose to $482.2 million, or 69 cents a diluted share, from $448.9 million, or 63 cents a share, in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. The results were in line with forecasts of analysts polled by the First Call Corporation, which tracks company earnings. 
 Sales in the United States, which have flagged in recent years, rose 3.6 percent, to $4.6 billion, on promotions like Monopoly games and Teenie Beanie Baby plush toys, while the company lowered costs. The fast-food company said it was confident it could withstand weakened economies in Asia and Latin America by buying supplies and financing restaurants locally.
Total revenue rose 7 percent, to $3.22 billion, from $3.01 billion in the quarter a year earlier.
Nevertheless, the shares fell $1.0625 yesterday, to $67.125.

HEADLINE: An Orange County Suit Is Said to Be Settled

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif., Oct. 19

 BODY:
Goldman, Sachs & Company will pay $4.8 million to settle a lawsuit by an Orange County agency contending the firm had failed to warn it of the risky investment strategy that plunged the county into bankruptcy in 1994, the agency said today.
The Orange County Transportation Authority said it had reached an agreement in principle to settle the lawsuit it filed against Goldman, Sachs in 1996. 
 A spokesman for the agency said that the agreement, which must still be approved by a Federal judge, would also settle Goldman's countersuits against both the authority and the county. An official with Goldman could not be reached for comment.
Orange County filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 6, 1994, after its investment pool sustained losses of more than $1.6 billion on risky investments. The county emerged from bankruptcy in June 1996.
The Orange County Transportation Authority, which provides bus and other transportation services and finances local freeway construction, said it had deposited about $1 billion in the pool and lost more than $225 million when the pool crashed.
The authority sued Goldman, which underwrote its debt, contending that the firm failed to warn it of the risks. The authority also accused the firm of breaching its fiduciary duties and negligence.
Earlier this year, the authority lost its suit against Goldman in Los Angeles Superior Court and had been preparing to appeal. But Goldman also filed a countersuit against the authority, contending that it should not have been held responsible for advice to the authority.
The settlement is the latest in a string reached during the last year to end litigation resulting from the bankruptcy. The county has so far recovered more than $730 million from related legal actions, mainly civil lawsuits against former financial and legal advisers.

Day of Light Trading Lowers Long Treasury Yield to 4.97%

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose slightly yesterday in a session of quiet trading.
Dealers said the slow market was a natural lull from the rally experienced late last week. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 2/32, to 108 4/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, slipped to 4.97 percent, from 4.98 percent on Friday.
 Bills accounted for far more volume than usual, partly because of the regular weekly bill sale carried out yesterday afternoon.
One trader attributed the decline to the rally in long-term bonds that followed the unexpected move by the Federal Reserve late on Thursday to cut interest rates for the second time in three weeks.
"Bills rallied so far after the rate cut last Thursday, they just had to back up," said a head trader at a primary dealership.
Activity in other maturities was "just quiet," the head trader said, adding that "everybody's still in weekend mode."
Govpx, a bond-pricing service, registered turnover of $47.5 billion, 18 percent below average when compared with Mondays during the fourth quarter of 1997.
The Treasury sold $16 billion of three-month and six-month bills at average discount rates of 3.85 percent and 3.86 percent, respectively.
"It seems like people are just looking around and noticing that the Fed funds rate, while lower, is still well above every other issue," said a bond trader at a primary dealership.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Auto Makers Experiment With New Fuels

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Struggling to comply with Federal fuel-economy and emissions regulations even as Americans buy ever-bigger family vehicles, auto makers have quietly begun experiments with oil companies to develop new and potentially cleaner fuels.
Ford and General Motors have already entered long-term partnerships with oil companies, while Chrysler plans to announce on Wednesday a program with immediate goals: testing vehicles over the next two years that would burn a promising type of synthetic fuel made from natural gas instead of crude oil. 
 The synthetic fuel is similar to diesel and can be burned in diesel engines. Chrysler's goal is to develop a new generation of diesel engines that, using the synthetic fuel, would burn as cleanly as the cleanest gasoline engines, said Loren K. Beard, Chrysler's manager of fuels technology. Many auto makers are planning to replace some of their gasoline engines with more fuel-efficient diesel engines. For one thing, this would allow them to build ever-bigger sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks without violating Federal fuel-efficiency rules.
But obstacles remain. The Syntroleum Corporation, which has a small factory that will supply synthetic fuel for the tests, estimates that mass production would push the fuel's cost down to $1.50 or less a gallon. Still, even reducing the cost to that level would require considerable investments in new equipment at natural gas fields, as well as persuading service stations to set aside pumps and tanks for the new fuel.
A principal Chrysler experiment will involve a blend of only 20 or 30 percent synthetic fuel with the rest being regular diesel, said Mark A. Agee, the president and chief operating officer of Syntroleum, which is based in Tulsa, Okla. The blend might then be competitive in price with premium grades of gasoline.
Bernard I. Robertson, Chrysler's vice president for engineering technologies, predicted that premium grades of diesel, consisting of a blend with synthetic fuel, would become available within five years. Future diesel cars and light trucks will probably require the premium grades, much as current models require unleaded gasoline to reduce pollution, he said.
Diesel engines produce up to 30 percent better fuel economy than gasoline engines. But they emit more air pollution, although the latest models are far cleaner than the sooty diesels of the 1980's.
The domestic auto makers are all developing diesel engines now for large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, which earn the highest profits per vehicle. So-called light trucks -- a category including vans as well as sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks -- are allowed to meet a lower average fuel economy than cars. But auto makers have had trouble meeting even this standard with the recent popularity of such models as the Dodge Ram full-size pickup and the huge Ford Expedition and Chevrolet Suburban sport utility vehicles.
Federal and California regulators are drafting new, tougher emissions regulations that could be hard for diesel engines to meet. In response, auto makers have been working on cleaner engines and cleaner fuels.
The process for making the synthetic diesel from natural gas is loosely based on a technique first developed in the 1920's. But tighter air quality standards and auto makers' difficulties with fuel-economy standards are forcing a reconsideration of the technology.
Ford has already begun experimenting with the synthetic substitutes for diesel, while G.M. plans to do so in the coming months, as part of their efforts to produce an extremely high-mileage car in cooperation with the Federal Government. Because the fuel burns so cleanly, it could have applications in cars as well as light trucks, said Sara R. Tatchio, a Ford spokeswoman.

HEADLINE: Tense Times at the Mideast Summit

 BODY:
The Middle East peace talks in Maryland are in overtime, and may yet fail. But they were saved from extinction yesterday by some intense American diplomacy and the decision of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, not to let a new terrorist attack in Israel abort the negotiations.
The grenade assault in Beersheba yesterday intensified Israel's security concerns. The Maryland summit will not succeed unless the Palestinians demonstrate that they are fully committed to preventing terror attacks and cooperating with Israel to bring suspects to justice. But those are not the only issues that must be resolved. The Palestinians have grievances over Israel's failure to live up to past commitments, including the opening of ports and industrial facilities essential to Palestinian economic health. Israel has also backed off the promise of one additional West Bank withdrawal beyond the 13 percent now being discussed. 
 These talks must resolve these leftover issues and lead to immediate negotiations on claims on Jerusalem, the future of West Bank Jewish settlements and the nature of a possible Palestinian state. Otherwise, the Oslo agreements are likely to expire unfulfilled next May, with potentially devastating consequences for the peace effort.
Failure in Maryland could also weaken Washington's ability to play a constructive role in Mideast diplomacy. The Clinton Administration has invested time and prestige in these negotiations. If the personal efforts of President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright cannot nudge Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat to an agreement, it is hard to imagine what will.
No fair-minded person expects Israel to compromise its security or Mr. Arafat to accept humiliating conditions in exchange for Israel keeping promises it agreed to long ago. But an anxious world demands that both leaders keep at these negotiations and make the reasonable compromises necessary to save a dangerously troubled peace.

HEADLINE: Earnings at J. P. Morgan Tumble by 60%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
J. P. Morgan & Company's third-quarter earnings plunged a greater-than-expected 60 percent as slumping worldwide markets hurt trading revenue. Its stock, already battered in anticipation of bad results, rose 3.77 percent yesterday on optimism that the worst was over at the nation's No. 4 bank.
Profit from operations fell to $122 million, or 58 cents a share, from $396 million, or $1.96, in the like period a year earlier. The results fell short of the average analysts' estimate of 81 cents a share. 
 Net earnings fell to $156 million, or 75 cents a diluted share, and included a one-time gain of $34 million from the sale of the firm's investment management business in Australia.
Shares of J. P. Morgan rose $3.375, to $92.875.
Investors said the Federal Reserve's rate cut last week might help banks by pushing markets higher, increasing trading revenue and making it cheaper for banks to borrow.
"A lot of investors have pulled away and they want to get back into the financial sector because they expect the Fed to ease again," said Fred Meinke, a money manager and bank specialist at First Capital Group, which oversees $40 billion.
Russia's default and devaluation, and anticipation of a worldwide economic slowdown, dragged down markets worldwide in the third quarter. This hurt United States banks and securities firms that do business abroad.
J. P. Morgan said it would bolster profits by cutting expenses in 1999 by $400 million. This includes making deeper job cuts than the 5 percent, or 800 to 900 job cuts, that the bank already announced for its work force of about 16,500.
"There will be selective job cuts, but no across-the board staff reduction plan," said Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman at J. P. Morgan.
And instead of announcing hedge-fund losses, J. P. Morgan said "substantially all" of the $900 million that the unregulated funds owe the bank on derivative and foreign exchange contracts was secured by cash and Treasury and agency securities.
Still, the third quarter was bad for J. P. Morgan, said Raphael Soifer, a bank analyst at Brown, Brothers Harriman. "Nobody that's involved in capital markets or emerging markets had a good quarter."
At J. P. Morgan, total revenue fell 32 percent, to $1.3 billion. After a one-time gain of $34 million after tax, profit fell 61 percent, to $156 million.
Noninterest revenue fell 28 percent, to $1.04 billion, dragged down by an 82 percent drop in trading revenue, to $119 million. J. P. Morgan lost $130 million in Russian trading.
Revenue from making markets, or acting as a middleman on trades, fell 61 percent, to $260 million, as liquidity in many markets began to dry up. Revenue from finance and advisory, including debt and equity underwriting, fell 25 percent, to $413 million.
The company increasd profit through gains in its securities investments, which doubled to $136 million. Investment management revenue also gained, climbing 11 percent, to $224 million. Investment banking revenue fell 2.5 percent, to $312 million.
"Their total investment banking revenue was good," said Joan Goodman, a bank analyst at the Pershing division of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. "They were lower by about 3 percent, but were better than expected."
"Another good thing is they reduced expenses," she said. Operating expenses fell 17 percent, to $1.1 billion.

HEADLINE: Grenades Wound 67 in Israeli Bus Station

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG 

DATELINE: BEERSHEBA, Israel, Oct. 19

 BODY:
As the peace talks in Maryland entered their fifth day, a grenade attack on a busy bus terminal in this modern desert town today left 67 people wounded, one gravely, and cast a shadow over the fragile negotiations.
It began when a Palestinian man ran wildly through the bustling station during the morning rush hour, drawing notice just as he hurled a grenade at a shelter filled with young soldiers. The soldiers heard a hissing sound and leaped to their feet screaming, before the explosion chased and knocked them down. 
 There was a silence, followed by the boom of a second grenade as the soldiers, nose to the asphalt, realized that they were the victims of a terrorist attack.
Then the incident ended as sloppily as it began when the attacker ran into a stopped bus whose driver pummeled him and held him for the police.
By Middle Eastern standards, it was an unsophisticated attack, although it could not have been better timed to disrupt the peace talks.
No group claimed responsibility. Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the leader of the militant Islamic organization Hamas, said he did not know if his group was responsible, since, he said, its political and military wings are separate. But he endorsed the attack in spirit.
"The occupation exists, the resistance continues and this is a link in a chain," he said.
About a third of the wounded were uniformed soldiers and military students on their way back to a nearby army base and school after a weekend break. Like the civilians -- commuters and bus station employees -- most suffered superficial but painful shrapnel wounds. At noontime they lay surrounded by flowers, relatives and army buddies at the Soroka Hospital here, many with cellular phones tucked by their sides. All wore tags with their victim numbers, which had been chalked into the asphalt at the bus station, marking where they had fallen.
Tamar Glustron and Shelly Bental, both 19, friends and military police officers, had been chatting about clothes when they first noticed the man and heard the sibiliant sound as he pulled his grenade key.
Later that morning, stunned, they rested side by side in hospital beds, pierced by shrapnel. Plastered with bandages, they wimpered with pain and tried to put on brave faces after a visit from President Ezer Weizman.
"I remember," Ms. Glustron said, "pulling myself to my feet and thinking: 'No way. He wanted to kill me. He wanted to kill all of us.' What for? It's for nothing that I was hurt. They feel so helpless they know only to talk with violence. It's very sad."
Her mother, Hannah, sat at the bedside, squeezing her daughter's hand. "The peace process should be accelerated so these things don't happen again," she said.
At the hospital, Dr. Naftali Meidan, the deputy director, said two patients, a 14-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl, were in serious condition after shrapnel penetrated their abdomens and chests. A 47-year-old man was listed in critical condition after undergoing hours of surgery.
The police said the Palestinian, a West Bank resident, had confessed to the attack. At a roadblock near Hebron, they later arrested four other young Palestinian men driving an Audi, whom they suspected of being his accomplices.
An Israeli radio report said the attacker lived in Dahariya, a southern West Bank town under Israeli security control.
But Palestinian security officials have identified him as Salem Rajab al-Sarsour, 29, a construction worker and father of five from the Palestinian side of Hebron, Reuters reported. His wife, in traditional Islamic dress and sitting beneath a poster of Sheik Yassin, said she would give praise to God if her husband turned out to be the assailant -- "a fighter for the sake of God," Reuters said.
Mordechai Nachmani, the police commander of the Negev region, said, "The person we are holding has told us that those who put him up to it suggested this location as a target."
Speaking on Israeli radio, the bus driver said, "He ran into the bus and fell." The driver, Avner Yaakov, continued: "I fell on him. I gave him a few good wallops, and within seconds civil defense police had him in handcuffs."
Beersheba, a quiet, economically depressed town where Israeli-born Jews, Israeli Arabs, Russian immigrants and Bedouins coexist, has been immune from serious terrorist attacks until now, even though it lies just south of the West Bank.
The usual frenzy that follows such attacks was absent. There were few protesters, and none shouting, "Death to the Arabs."
A couple of hours after the attack, as workers scrubbed blood and flesh off the sidewalk, normal business resumed at the bus station.
"We cannot function in fear," said Eli Cohen, 38, a bus driver. "I do take precautions, like looking at each passenger. If I see someone who looks suspicious, who looks Arab or is carrying a bag, I can stop and ask him for an ID, or take the bus right over to the police station."
People even awaited their buses in the remains of the shelter that had been blown nearly to bits. One, Sarah Waltner, a Holocaust survivor with numbers tattooed on her forearm, perched on the edge of a ragged chair that had lost its back.
"I'm never afraid," she said. "He who is destined to meet death can't escape his destiny. What can we do? Even if it is unusual in Beersheba, as a people we are used to it."

Government Attacks Gates As Microsoft Trial Opens
The antitrust trial against Microsoft opened in Federal court in Washington with a pointed personal attack on the credibility and integrity of William H. Gates, the company's chairman.
Mr. Gates said in a taped deposition, part of which was shown in court, that he knew little if anything about the main charges leveled against his company. But in its opening statement, the Government sought to portray Mr. Gates as a key director of a campaign to crush his company's main rival, Netscape Communications. Microsoft will give its opening statement today. Page A1. 

In 127 pages of written testimony, James Barksdale, Netscape's president and chief executive and the Government's leading witness, supplied a firsthand perspective of the disputed meeting between Microsoft and Netscape that is critical to the case. The Government contends Microsoft executives proposed that the two companies divide the market for browser software. Microsoft replies that the prosecutors are misinterpreting a routine business meeting. C4.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Stock Prices Rise Again; Dow Up 49

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock prices moved higher again yesterday, the sixth advance in the last seven sessions, as investors remained optimistic about the economic benefits of recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.
By the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 49.69 points, or six-tenths of 1 percent, to 8,466.45. The gain left the Dow up 7.06 percent for the year and less than 10 percent below its July 17 peak. 
 Broader market measures also registered gains, and small-company stocks, battered for months this year, extended a recovery that began earlier in the month.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 5.97 points, or six-tenths of a percent, to 1,062.39. The Nasdaq composite jumped 27.78 points, or 1.71 percent, to 1,648.73, and is now up 5 percent for the year. And the Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks surged 9.58 points, or 2.8 percent, to 352.45. Since Oct. 8, the index is up by 14 percent. Even with those gains, the small- company index is still down more than 19 percent for the year.
At just under 715 million shares, volume on the New York Stock Exchange was comparatively light. Last Friday, 1.02 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board.
The gains yesterday came on the eleventh anniversary of the 1987 crash, when the Dow index fell 508 points, or 22.6 percent, its biggest one-day percentage decline.
Many traders who were not in the business 11 years ago said the anniversary meant little.
Indeed, there is little evidence that the third Monday in October has stirred up bad thoughts in the stock market since Oct. 19, 1987.
According to Birinyi & Associates, the stock market research firm, since that so-called Black Monday the Dow has risen eight times on the third Monday of October, and declined the other three.
Traders said they felt a bit more confident about the market's most recent behavior since the Fed unexpectedly reduced interest rates last Thursday, but some expressed skepticism about whether the central bank's step was sufficient.
For the moment though, investors seem to think the Fed is doing the right things to prevent an economic downturn in the United States.
For the third straight session, bank and other financial service sector stocks, beneficiaries of lower interest rates, moved higher. So, too, did retailers. And cyclical stocks like autos, chemicals and paper companies also did better.
J. P. Morgan, a Dow component and the nation's fourth-largest bank holding company, rose 3 3/8, to 92 7/8, despite a third-quarter earnings report that was worse than expected. Even with the rise, however, the stock remains well below its 52-week high of 148 3/4.
Other big banks, battered following Russia's default in August and the resulting problems in other emerging markets, also rallied.
BankAmerica rose 3 3/16 a share, to 52 13/16. And the Bankers Trust Corporation was up 3 3/8, to 54 3/4.
Retailers gained on optimism that consumers, whose spending represents about two-thirds of the economy, will continue to buy goods and services at a healthy pace.
Among the big gainers were Wal-Mart Stores, which rose 2 1/8, to 68 3/4. Analysts at Goldman Sachs & Company added the stock to the firm's recommended list yesterday.
Goldman also raised its ratings on the Dayton Hudson Corporation and the Costco Companies.
Dayton Hudson rose 1 5/16 yesterday, to 44 3/16. Costco jumped 2 7/8, to 54 13/16.
In another sign that the recent turmoil may be ending, a number of merger deals were influencing the market yesterday.
Shares of Kroger, the supermarket company, fell 3 5/16, to 45 7/16, after it announced it would buy Fred Meyer, a smaller supermarket company, in a stock deal valued at $8 billion.
McKesson, the nation's largest drug distributor, lost 12 5/8, to 76, after it announced a deal to buy HBO & Company, the largest supplier of computerized patient-monitoring systems, in a stock swap valued at $14 billion.
But owners of First Brands, the maker of Glad Wrap and STP oil treatment, were smiling broadly yesterday.
The stock jumped 12 3/8, to 36, after Clorox agreed to buy the company for stock valued at $39 a share.
As they sifted through the market's moves over the last week, technicians said that it now appeared that the steep downdrafts of September and early October may have come to an end and that the lows were not likely to be retested anytime soon. But they said it was too soon to say much more than that.
"We have finally started a fall recovery phase," said Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, "but I am not at all convinced this is a new bull market."
Mr. McCabe said the market was probably staging what he called an "interim" recovery that could push the Dow up to 8,600 to 8,800 by the middle of next month.

HEADLINE: On the Eve of Glenn's Shuttle Flight, Concerns Over a Lull in Launchings

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
Behind the excitement of the coming spaceflight of Senator John Glenn is quiet apprehension about hidden dangers.
Safety experts agree that the space shuttles, like temperamental hot rods, must run regularly or become balky and their launching crews rusty. But the shuttles have flown little of late. So Senator Glenn's flight is seen, at least in theory, as unusually risky. 
 In response, the space agency is taking precautions like having ground crews do many more dry runs meant to sharpen their skills. It says these rehearsals will offset any dangers, though some private experts say the odds of disaster still might be unusually high.
"We've been concerned," Dr. Seymour C. Himmel, a senior member of NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, said in an interview. "When you have a hiatus like this you have to keep your skills honed."
Dr. M. Granger Morgan, head of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, agreed. "There are concerns whenever an organization that has to perform a high-reliability job stops engaging in continual practice," he said.
The thunder of Mr. Glenn's blastoff aboard the shuttle Discovery, set for Oct. 29, is to occur after an unexpected silence of nearly five months at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
This is the longest time between shuttle launching attempts since the recovery from the 1986 Challenger disaster, when the spaceships were grounded for more than two years. The first crew to fly thereafter, in 1988, consisted of all shuttle veterans, mostly former military test pilots used to putting their lives on the line.
The current gap in flights was caused by unforeseen delays in building the international space station, a global effort whose payloads are to dominate the shuttle agenda for years. The delays stem from Russia's financial woes and have raised concerns among Federal and private safety experts, especially given the high visibility of Mr. Glenn's flight.
The space agency itself has changed its public stance on the dangers posed by a flight slowdown.
A year ago, before the gap opened up, Wilbur C. Trafton, then head of space flight for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, told Congress that inactivity was dangerous. If work on the station is delayed, he warned, then "the shuttle quickly drops below what we think is a safe flight rate, which is about five flights a year."
That problem has come to pass in that the five-month gap, if repeated over the course of a year, would amount to an annual rate of fewer than three flights. Even so, NASA officials dismiss it as minor. They say that better analyses show that the shuttle can safely fly fewer times a year and that the rigorous exercise of ground crews and managers is removing any possible peril.
"We normally launch every six to eight weeks," said Dave King, a shuttle official at the Kennedy center at Cape Canaveral, Fla. "But when summer brought a five-month pause between launches, we went to work developing a practice schedule that would keep the team fresh."
Robert B. Sieck, head of shuttle operations in Florida, said that he had talked with Mr. Glenn about the slowdown and that the Senator, a veteran of the astronaut corps, was unruffled by it.
"We're going to be just as safe as ever because we have the rules and requirements and procedures that protect us," Mr. Sieck said in an interview. "The teams are going to make sure that nothing bad happens."
Mr. Glenn himself has repeatedly played down shuttle risks.
"Of course there is a small danger," he said when his flight was announced in January, but he added, "NASA's done an outstanding job" of keeping the risks as low as possible.
On his nine-day flight, Mr. Glenn, 77, and six other astronauts are to conduct more than 80 scientific experiments. The Senator's are to center on the aging process.
The shuttle is, by far, the most complicated machine ever to fly into space, and therein lies the danger -- there are more things to go wrong. It has 230 miles of wiring, 417 circuit breakers, 600 fuses, 950 switches and 2 million parts, half of which are meant to move.
The shuttle's three main engines release energy equal to 23 Hoover Dams and loom as a safety factor because they work at dangerously high heats, pressures and speeds. Its twin booster rockets are a special worry because one of their kind leaked blistering hot flames that touched off the Challenger explosion, which killed six astronauts and a high school teacher.
Fueling and launching the fleet of four winged spaceships and refurbishing them between flights takes a standing army at the Florida spaceport, which employs about 14,000 people and pumps a billion dollars into the state's economy every year.
The current break in shuttle flights came as the space station project fell on hard times. Originally, orbital construction of the big outpost was to have started in November 1997. But as that date neared, and as Russia's problems multiplied, NASA pushed back the launching of the first station component.
The flight of Mr. Glenn was announced on Jan. 16 of this year, as the space agency was struggling to reduce the repercussions from the station's delay on the shuttle, which is to be the main transporter into orbit of the outpost's many parts. Among other things, the agency was planning hundreds of layoffs at the Florida spaceport.
Things got worse. On May 31, NASA announced that the start of the station's orbital construction would be postponed even further, from June to November, making the orbital outpost overdue by a full year.
That schedule still holds, barely. And it has thrown planning for all shuttle flights into disarray.
As silence at the launching pads was forecast to last for five months, NASA analysts got edgy, as did the agency's overseers. So a wide program of safeguards was undertaken in Florida.
For instance, on Aug. 20, some 150 launching team members labored through a mock countdown bedeviled by troubles like false sensor readings and bad weather.
"The test plan and problem scenarios are kept secret," Debbie Frostrom, a shuttle expert who helped draw up the drill with senior engineers known as gremlins, said in a statement.
During the overall slowdown, the spaceport is doing three times as many mock launchings and four times as many fueling simulations as normal, said Mr. Sieck, the head of shuttle operations. It is also conducting its first comprehensive assessment of all procedures and systems since the restart of shuttle flights a decade ago.
Astronauts, the ultimate beneficiaries of such care, have made their presence felt in Florida in the slowdown. On July 16, C. Gordon Fullerton, a former shuttle commander, gave the keynote address when the entire center stopped regular work for a day to focus exclusively on heightening safety.
Private experts said it was conceivable that all the extra practice and precautions would actually make the Glenn flight safer.
"They've had time to fix all the small things," said Dr. Elizabeth Pate-Cornell, head of industrial engineering and engineering management at Stanford University.
But Dr. Charles Perrow, a Yale sociologist and author of "Normal Accidents," a study of high-tech risk, said the slowdown and all the attendant changes could add complexity to an already complex equation, undercutting safety.
"It's certainly going to heighten the difficulty," he said. "Whether that means new danger, nobody probably knows."
Dr. Himmel of NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, a team of independent experts, said he was confident that the heightened precautions were sufficient to ward off unusual perils.
"The important thing is to realize that when you get into something that is extraordinary, everybody has to be made aware of that fact and to do the job right," he said.
The lull is to ease up a bit after Mr. Glenn's flight. The first station launching is set for Nov. 20 when a Russian rocket is to lift the initial element of the outpost into orbit.
The shuttle Endeavour is to carry aloft the shuttles' first station payload on Dec. 3, in theory paving the way for dozens of other shuttle trips in service of the station over the years, helping to keep launching teams sharp and the fleet safe.

Chart: "KEEPING TRACK: Rusty Shuttle?"
Because of unforeseen delays in building the international space station, there will be fewer space shuttle flights this year...and the gap in time between the last flight in June and the flight of Senator John Glenn on Oct. 29 has safety experts concerned.

To the Editor:
Prof. James Heckman of the University of Chicago is right when he points to early intervention programs for preschool children and early elementary students as a better investment than tax credits for higher education (Economic Scene, Oct. 15). 
 While Mr. Heckman points out that college students in four-year public universities pay only 20 percent of the cost of their education, unmentioned was that parents pay far more for child care and other early education programs: an average of 60 percent of the cost of all forms of child care and up to 100 percent of the cost of care in many cases.
Despite the fact that numerous studies have shown the societal benefits of good-quality early education, the large public and private investments that have reduced a college student's portion of tuition to 20 percent have not been made in early education.

HEADLINE: Kroger to Buy Fred Meyer, Creating Country's Biggest Grocer

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY

 BODY:
The Kroger Company said yesterday that it would acquire Fred Meyer Inc. in a deal that would create a supermarket giant with $43 billion in annual revenue and 2,200 stores in 31 states.
Kroger will pay about $8 billion in stock for Fred Meyer and assume $4.8 billion of the company's debt, further consolidating the grocery business and creating the largest supermarket chain in the country. With the latest transaction, Kroger regains the spot it lost to Albertson's Inc. as the nation's largest supplier of eggs and milk. 
 The acquisition gives Kroger the status of the leading chain, stretching from the fast-growing Western markets, where Portland-based Fred Meyer is strong, to the Midwest and the Southeast, where the Cincinnati-based company has many stores and much visibility. The move also gives Kroger even greater purchasing power and substantial economies of scale.
The combined company will retain the Kroger name and continue to be run from Cincinnati. Both chains' stores will retain their names and local management teams.
Fred Meyer shareholders will receive one newly issued share of Kroger stock for each Fred Meyer share, which puts the value of the shares, based on Friday's closing price, at $48.75. After the stock swap, Fred Meyer shareholders will own 38 percent of the combined company.
Fred Meyer shares declined $4.8125 yesterday, to $44.1875, and Kroger shares closed at $45.4375, down $3.3125. The market's inital reaction indicated that investors might have concerns about the logistics of integrating the companies, while some might have expected Kroger to acquire the much larger Safeway Inc.
Still, managements of both companies called the transaction a "powerful strategic combination." Joseph A. Pichler, chairman and chief executive of Kroger, said, "Together, we will have the No. 1 or No. 2 market share in 33 of the nation's largest markets."
The acquisition is not expected to affect Kroger's earnings per share in the 1999 fiscal year and is expected to contribute substantially to earnings thereafter, though the companies did not say by how much. Kroger said it expected to save about $225 million within three years, with approximately $75 million of that in the first year.
"We will achieve economies of scale by leveraging purchasing, information technology, manufacturing and distribution across a much larger store base," Mr. Pichler said. Some of the cost cuts will come from laying off an undisclosed number of office workers, but not from job cuts at stores -- now about 90 percent of the companies' combined work force of 300,000.
Mr. Pichler will continue to run the combined company while Ronald W. Burkle, chairman of Fred Meyer, will become chairman of the executive committee of Kroger's board. Robert G. Miller, vice chairman and chief executive of Fred Meyer, will become vice chairman and chief operating officer of Kroger. In addition to Mr. Burkle and Mr. Miller, four other Fred Meyer nominees will join the Kroger board, which will be expanded to 19 directors from 13.
"I have been a longtime believer in consolidation in the supermarket industry," Mr. Burkle said, adding that teaming up with Kroger helps both companies because it creates a national powerhouse.
The deal was approved by both companies' boards and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.
Antitrust problems are not expected. Where there is overlap, as in Arizona, the stores operate different formats. For instance, Fred Meyer operates drugstores as well as superstores that sell everything from jewelry to Jello, while Kroger sticks mainly to bread-and-butter items. Even so, Government regulators may require the company to sell some stores before the deal is approved, but that is not likely to derail the acquisition.
In all, Fred Meyer, which has annual revenue around $15 billion, operates 800 food and general merchandise stores in 12 states from Alaska to Texas. Kroger, with revenue of $28 billion, operates 1,398 food stores and 802 convenience stores, most of them in the Midwest and the Southeast, as well as 34 manufacturing plants.
Analysts said the combined businesses will create an industry leader with strong management, substantial potential for earnings growth and the store formats and locations to compete with nontraditional food retailers, like Wal-Mart, that now sell a range of grocery items, from lettuce to soup.
They added that one concern was whether management would be able to integrate the combined company's far-flung operations, especially when Fred Meyer is still trying to digest the businesses of other chains it recently acquired.
Last year, the company acquired Quality Food Centers and Ralphs Grocery Company in separate deals worth about $2 billion. It also purchased Smith's Food and Drug Centers for $1.96 billion.
"They operate different types of formats and Fred Meyer has different operations in different markets," said George E. Thompson, an analyst who follows the industry for Prudential Securities. "That is going to make it complicated, there is no question about that."
Still, he and other analysts said the benefits of the deal outweighed the potential pitfalls. "Kroger has made investments in technology and systems, and they have done a lot of cost-cutting and elimination of replicated functions throughout the organization from a systems standpoint," said Bonni Z. Bleustein of Credit Suisse First Boston. "They also get an excellent management team in the Fred Meyer group."
In purchasing Fred Meyer, Kroger also regains its long-held bragging rights as the largest industry competitor ranked by revenue. The distinction was grabbed in August by Albertson's when it announced that it would acquire American Stores Company for $8.3 billion, creating a chain with $36 billion in revenue and 2,500 stores in 37 states.
Some other recent deals include Safeway's announcement last week that it would acquire the Dominick's supermarket chain for $1.85 billion, and the acquisition in May by Royal Ahold of Giant Food Inc. for $2.6 billion. Such combinations, which spread a company's costs over a much larger store base, are expected to continue and to make it increasingly difficult for small, independent grocers to compete on price, marketing and store location terms.
"The independents clearly have more and more of a competitive disadvantage," Ms. Bleustein said.

The Kroger Company announced plans to acquire Fred Meyer Inc. for about $8 billion in stock plus the assumption of almost $5 billion of debt. The deal increases Kroger's national coverage and would reinstate Kroger as the nation's No. 1 grocery chain, a position it lost to Albertson's a few months ago.

Manhattan is America's Qatar, but it specializes in paper instead of oil. When the markets boom, youthful bankers in handmade shirts and English shoes chug-a-lug Chateau Margaux, governments go on binges of borrowing and building, and service workers from all around the world crowd into the city. 
 When markets turn sour, lamentations rise from the wreckage of upside-down mortgages and repossessed Jaguars, and everyone vows not to let it happen again.
It would be nice to report that, as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said last week, "the city is in a better position now than it was in the past" to weather a market downturn. Sadly, that isn't true.
Wall Street's booms and busts are often dizzily disconnected with the rest of the world.
The great 1980's "Bonfire of the Vanities" blowout came at a time when Asian competition was gutting basic industries like cars and steel, and hundreds of thousands of workers found pink slips in their pay packets.
Conversely, the powerful resurgence of American industrial competitiveness that started in the late 1980's coincided with Wall Street's desert years of 1987-91.
The disconnect hasn't been quite as violent in the 1990's, and the stock market didn't get truly giddy until about a year or so ago. Times have been good throughout the American economy, and the long boom on Wall Street was roughly in sync with the solid gains racked up by industries from manufacturing through health care and high-tech.
But markets ventured into uncharted territory when the Dow jumped about 30 percent from January to July of this year despite growing signs of a global slowdown. The average company's stock price leaped to more than 30 times its earnings, which by any historical standard is just silly.
The junk bonds of the 1990's are the Internet stocks, little companies with shaky revenue and no earnings but with stock market valuations in the billions. Reality started to bite in August, and results are sharply down at all the Wall Street companies.
Merrill Lynch and City Group have already announced the first big rounds of layoffs.
This time around, the securities companies claim to have been more disciplined in their hiring in the 1990's, and the boom in tourism, the sprouting of Silicon Alley high-tech companies and flourishing ethnic communities in Queens and Brooklyn all suggest a more diversified economy than in the 1980's.
A comparison of city employment just before the 1987 market crash and at the end of 1997 does show a slight drop in the concentration of jobs in the sector of the economy that is most sensitive to stock market fluctuations -- the so-called FIRE sector: finance, insurance and real estate.
These jobs accounted for 18.3 percent of all city jobs in 1987, but only 16.4 percent of all jobs by the end of 1997. Measured by dollars, however, the concentration has actually gotten worse. FIRE jobs now account for 33.9 percent of all payrolls in New York City, a big jump from 26.5 percent in 1987.
Concentration of jobs and payrolls in the security industry, where cuts are likely to be the sharpest, is much worse on all counts. As of the end of 1997, security industry employment accounted for 5.5 percent of city jobs, up from 5.3 percent in 1987, and for a staggering 19.3 percent of city payrolls, up from just 11.3 percent 10 years before. In other words, here we go again. Does this have to happen?
The answer is no, but it will take 10 years or more of disciplined public policy and enlightened governance to get off the Wall Street treadmill.
The success in reducing New York City's crime rate over the last few years is a hopeful start and in the long run may prove to be the city's most successful economic development program ever. But it is no more than a first step.

By any measure, the burden of doing business in New York is uniquely high: the personal and the business taxes, the cloud of regulations that surrounds everything from painting an apartment to renting a car, the armies of grabby inspectors, the work rules, the payments to "expeditors" to clear the most routine regulatory processes, the extraordinary burden of state and city debt. Is it any wonder that businesses, especially small ones, continue to flee the city?
It was no act of God but neglect and bureaucracy that chased away basic industries like manufacturing and shipping. Even today, Gov. George Pataki spends hundreds of millions to polish up Buffalo's football stadium and the Port Authority plays lower Manhattan real estate mogul, while the Brooklyn waterfront, which offers possibly the finest deep-water harbor on the Eastern Seaboard, is left to the wharf rats.
The problem may be that market crashes just don't last long enough to generate the pain needed for true reform.

FREIBERG, SYLVIA

 BODY:
FREIBERG-Sylvia. Died suddenly in Newton, MA., on October 20, 1998, less than three years after the death of Sam, her beloved husband of sixty-one years. Loving mother of Peter and Eileen. Caring mother-in-law of Joe Tom and Barney. Devoted grandmother of Solana and Sabrina. Born in Russia eighty-seven years ago, Sylvia grew up in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and lived most of her life in the Bronx. Short, smart, savvy and very funny, she was a woman who kowtowed to no one, even in pre-feminist times. Her abiding interest in people and politics made her a lively companion and was probably the reason she seemed so much younger than her years. While second to none in her love a good (or bad) joke, and a good (or bad) mah jongg game, her serious side was never far away: She continued to wish for political and economic justice for all people. Her family and friends will miss her, but she would be the first to say, "I had a good run."

HEADLINE: 30 Designs That Changed the Face of the Automobile

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LAMM; Michael Lamm is a co-author of "A Century of Automotive Style: 100 Years of American Car Design."

 BODY:
SCIENTISTS have theorized that biological evolution marches through time not in a smooth, straight line, but by fits and spurts. The same holds true of art. And automotive design, like all forms of art, includes specific works that changed the direction of everything that followed.
Over the last 100 years, dozens of automobiles stand out from the tens of thousands of models that have been produced around the world. Some were decades ahead of their time; others were pioneers of styling trends that swept the industry, for better and sometimes worse. 
 For the first quarter of the 20th century, the most influential automobile designs came from the Europeans. Until the late 1920's, American manufacturers routinely copied them. But the growing influence of American coach builders, who made custom car bodies for the very wealthy, soon prompted the manufacturers to set higher standards, and to copy some styling elements that had been found only on limited-production Packards and Pierce-Arrows.
Furthermore, visionary auto executives like Alfred P. Sloan Jr. of General Motors realized that the relatively inexpensive process of changing a car's appearance could whet the public's appetite for new designs, inducing them to replace old cars before they wore out.
From the late 20's on, American car design led the world except for a brief period after World War II, when Italian designs from Ferrari, Lancia and Alfa Romeo set new standards.
Automobile design did not evolve in a vacuum. It borrowed from other industries and from popular culture. Whatever was handy, trendy or sexy was fair game. Designers incorporated aspects of Art Deco and Art Moderne into their styling in the 30's. Streamlining, a catchword that had much less to do with aerodynamics than with shapes, was applied to everything from pencil sharpeners to toasters and, of course, to automobiles. Locomotives, ships, aircraft and rockets have served as influences, as have fish, birds and other animals, including the human body.
Eighteen months after Charles A. Lindbergh flew across the Atlantic in 1927, Auburn brought out a show car, the Cabin Speedster, that looked like a small, wingless airplane. In 1929, Lincoln offered the LeBaron Aero Phaeton, with winglike front fenders, uncovered cockpits for the front and rear seats and a stubby, upright tail. Designs of the 50's were dominated by tail fins, which Cadillac -- inspired by the Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter plane -- had introduced on '48 models.
As America embarked on its space program, Oldsmobile made the rocket its styling theme. For 1959, rocket shapes appeared along the tops of the fenders from front end to taillights. The mako shark is said to have inspired the 1963 Corvette Sting Ray. And the front views of mid-70's Lincolns and full-size Mercurys were classic indeed -- their grilles were based on architectural themes from ancient Greece. Angular and immense, these were Parthenons on wheels, mass-produced on the assembly line.
There have been striking, distinctive designs -- from Citroen, for example --that actually had little influence on the look of other cars. There are those now viewed as icons of their era, like the 1955-57 Chevrolets, which were derivative rather than trend-setting. And while some auto makers, like Packard and Duesenberg, had great appeal, they were not imitated too often.
What follows is a selection of cars whose designs did make a difference. Not all are classics; indeed, some are not remembered today. But each broke new ground, popularized a nascent idea or was widely copied. In some cases, their influence is still being felt. The list is not all-inclusive, and there are notable absences. For instance, there are no entries from the late 80's and 90's, a period when the shape of cars often flowed more from Government rules on safety, fuel economy and the environment than from the imaginations of designers. That may be changing, and the late 90's, like the early 30's and mid-50's, could be another golden age of car design. More and more distinctive models keep appearing, many of them -- like the Volkswagen New Beetle and the Plymouth Prowler street rod -- obviously inspired by cars of the past.
Such inspirations are nothing new.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Photos
 
1901 Mercedes racer
 When the engines of most cars were stuffed under the seat, a few pioneers put them up front. Mercedes was not the first to do so, but it popularized this configuration, which included the front-mounted radiator and hood.
 
1904 Packard
 Automobiles looked pretty much the same around this time, but Packard helped to establish the importance of styling touches that made its cars instantly identifiable. Starting in 1904, all Packards had a distinctive "ox yoke" radiator grille in which the central section bowed upward and was adjoined by flat shoulders that tilted downward. In 1906, Packard added hubcaps with a recessed hexagon, and starting in 1930, these premium American cars had a spear along the hood.
 
1911 Panhard Labourdette skiff
 This striking boat-tailed French car was a trailblazer in several respects. Its hood ran smoothly into the cowl at the front of the passenger compartment, when hoods generally ended abruptly against the flat front of the body. The Labourdette was very low-slung for the time, and the front fenders flowed gracefully into short running boards.
 
Mid-1920's Miller race cars
 A California race-car developer, Harry Miller, dominated American racing in the mid-1920's with these very low, long-hooded, innovative cars, which inspired many imitators. The 1932 DeSoto, for instance, proudly copied the Miller grille.
 
1929 Cord L-29
 Front-wheel drive allowed the designer of this American car, Alan Leamy (who was inspired by Miller racers), to make the L-29 just 51 inches high, more than a foot lower than the typical 1929 sedan. Not only did other cars subsequently shrink in height, but the Cord's louvered, chrome-plated, V-shaped grille was quickly copied by Chrysler, Reo and others.
 
1932 Graham Blue Streak
 Even into the 30's, most cars consisted of separate elements: a small house over the passengers, a hood over the engine, fenders over the wheels, an exposed gas tank and a trunk at the rear. The Graham's designer, Amos Northup, broke with tradition by rounding and integrating these elements into one harmonious whole. He hid the radiator cap and gas tank, added more surface to the fenders to hide the mud spatters underneath and painted the entire car one color -- an unusual treatment at the time.
 
1933 Pierce-Arrow Silver Arrow
 The headlights were integrated into the flush front fenders of this American show car, of which only five were built. Thirteen years later, a similar treatment would appear on postwar models.
 
1934 Chrysler Airflow
 This American design was copied overseas by Peugeot and two relatively young foreign companies, Volvo and Toyota. But the design was a failure in the United States, and it taught auto makers that the public cared more about stylistic streamlining than true aerodynamics. But the Airflow did establish some universal trends. By moving the rear seat ahead of the axle, instead of over it, passengers rode much more comfortably. Large gauges were arrayed across the instrument panel instead of being clumped in the middle. And the Art Deco trim added lavish style to the interiors.
 
1936 Cord 810
 Gordon Buehrig, a top designer of the 30's and the man responsible for many of the striking Duesenbergs, devised a completely original design for the Cord, which still looks fresh today. The car's front was squared off in what came to be called a "coffin nose." The 810 was extremely low to the ground and had neither running boards nor a conventional grille -- the air intakes were slits that wrapped around the hood. The headlights were hidden behind lids. The Cord sent designers rushing back to their drawing boards. Although many of its touches were imitated, the car's overall shape was not.
 
1938 Cadillac 60 Special
 The highly successful first design by Bill Mitchell, who went on to direct General Motors' styling in the 60's and 70's, grafted the sloping trunk of a coupe onto a sedan, used thin chrome frames around the windows, fenders that were creased along the top and squared off at the rear, and a roof line that ended in a thick rear pillar resembling a convertible's.
 
1938 Lincoln Zephyr
 Bob Gregorie, Ford's chief designer then, used a low grille with thin bars that flared back like a cat's whiskers. The design was a sensation, and other cars' grilles, previously high and vertical, quickly became low and horizontal. Two years later, Gregorie remade the Zephyr into the Continental, one of the first modern sports-luxury cars. Its clean, unornamented design was capped by an exposed spare tire at the rear.
 
1941 Cadillac
 This car was the first to wear what would become a signature touch for Cadillac: the "tombstone grille." It consisted of an "egg crate" of chrome bars in a wide, bold expanse, which, along with the tall hood, resembled a tombstone. Even today, Cadillac uses variations of this treatment, which has been copied extensively throughout the industry.
 
1947 Cisitalia 202
 This striking coupe by Pininfarina, the Italian design firm and body fabricator, ushered in a new look. The hood was set lower than the long, flowing front fenders, the grille was oval and low, the rounded wheel cutouts framed the tires. The Cisitalia's pure, unadorned form gave designers a new way to look at the automobile.
 
1947 Studebaker
 Virgil Exner, who developed the far-out Chrysler designs of the 50's and early 60's, conceived the tight, simple, squarish lines of postwar Studebakers. The smooth sides were broken only at the rear, where raised fenders made the car look like an animal ready to pounce. G.M. and Chrysler, among others, copied the look.
 
1947 Kaiser and Frazer
 Designed by Howard Darrin for a new car company spawned by the Kaiser steel and aluminum conglomerate, these two brands made their debut in January 1946 and shared the first postwar "envelope body." Without protruding fenders, the sides flowed uninterrupted from front to rear.
 
1948 Cadillac
 The first tail fins -- a trend that dominated the industry for 15 years and lives on in the taillights of today's DeVilles -- were inspired by the Lockheed P-38 fighter plane. Frank Hershey, who later designed the original two-seat Ford Thunderbird, got the credit.
 
1949 Jaguar XK120
 No other car embodied the spirit of the postwar sports-car revolution as well as this one. The XK120 roadster helped to inspire the Chevrolet Corvette, Ford Thunderbird and many others. The car's antecedents were the 1939 Talbot coupe by Figoni and the 1938 BMW 328MM. But it was the Jaguar's subtlety of line -- and the way the coupe's rear roof line flared out and tucked in at the bottom like a "C" -- that inspired imitators.
 
1949 Buick hardtop
 The idea of a two-door hardtop, a coupe without roof pillars behind the front doors, was not original to G.M., which offered the style in 1949 on Cadillacs, Buicks and Oldsmobiles. But Buick's rendition best captured the public's fancy. In part, the car was inspired by Sarah Ragsdale, the wife of a Buick engineer, Edward T. Ragsdale, who always drove convertibles but never lowered the top because she didn't like to have her hair mussed. Instead, Buick hardtops offered the convertible look without the fuss of the wind or the rattles of an open body. The hardtop became the dominant body style of the 50's and 60's.
 
1951 General Motors LeSabre
 This far-out show car was a rolling laboratory for G.M. styling ideas, many of which eventually went into production. The most striking was the panoramic wraparound windshield.
 The LeSabre was also the personal car of Harley Earl, who was probably the most influential car designer ever.
 
1953 Studebaker coupe
 Bob Bourke, a designer working under Raymond Loewy, the pre-eminent industrial designer, lent a sporty Italian edge to this thoroughly American car. As a result, other American designers began to clean up their acts, as evidenced by the simpler, less ornamented 1957 cars from Chrysler.
 
1957 Chrysler, DeSoto and Plymouth
 Virgil Exner's "forward look" emphasized soaring tailfins, thin roofs, lots of glass, clean and simple body sides and restrained ornamentation -- elements that temporarily made the Chrysler Corporation the leader in automotive design, a distinction previously held by G.M. Another '57 Chrysler design, the Imperial, started the trend toward curved side glass.
 
1958 Ford Thunderbird
 The busy-looking second-generation T-Bird was not as graceful as the two-seater it replaced, but it proved much more influential, inspiring a slew of personal-luxury coupes, like the '63 Buick Riviera with its four bucket seats.
 
1961 Lincoln Continental
 Elwood Engel's rectangular, almost austere sides looked as if canvas had been stretched over a wire framework, then formed with compressed air blown in underneath; it was a styling idea used subsequently throughout the industry.
 
1965 Ford Mustang
 Lee A. Iacocca may have gotten the credit, but whoever thought up the Mustang, it proved to be one of Ford's better ideas ever. Affordable, youthful and capable of being outfitted to suit every buyer's taste (thanks to a long list of options), the Mustang introduced the long-hood, short-deck look and quickly inspired a wave of "pony car" copycats, both American and imported, which played off the design.
 
1966 Oldsmobile Toronado
 A modern take on the '36 Cord, with its front-wheel drive, hidden headlights and louvered grille, the Toronado also contributed two much-imitated styling innovations: thick "lips" around the wheels and an imposing rear roof line that flowed into the rear fender.
 
1968 Pontiac GTO
 The grille and bumper became one piece, molded of urethane and painted the same color as the body. The front-end treatments of most modern cars still mimic the GTO's.
 
1969 Jaguar XJ6
 Although the form of the classic E-Type Jaguar form was voluptuous, organic and feline, it was not heavily imitated. The elegant, softly rounded XJ6, however, has been copied for three decades.
 
1974 Volkswagen Golf
 While the Austin Mini had a tremendous effect on small-car engineering, it was the Golf, designed by the Giugiaro design firm in Italy and initially called the Rabbit in the United States, that spawned a number of subcompact, hatchback imitators.
 
1984 Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager
 Volkswagen actually developed the minivan in 1949, but the concept acquired a practical form when it was brought to the Chrysler Corporation by a marketing executive, Hal Sperlich, who had defected from Ford. The minivan wasn't so much a leader in styling as a packaging innovation. The front-wheel-drive van had a low floor, and thereby a low roof, and unlike most vans at the time, it could fit easily in most garages. Growing families loved the spacious cabin, cup holders and four-cylinder engine, which was far less thirsty than the V8's of conventional large station wagons.
 
1986 Ford Taurus
 With the original Taurus, a radical departure from American sedans, Ford's head designer Jack Telnack, tapped into the right combination of Euro and aero. American designers are still using the Taurus's smooth, organic shape. Even Chrysler's two generations of cab-forward sedans contain a lot of Taurus DNA.

HEADLINE: Who Is Served by More Concrete?

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER; Keith Schneider, a former national correspondent for The Times, is executive director for the Michigan Land Use Institute.

 BODY:
ADDISON, VT., which lies on a fertile ridge near Lake Champlain, has long defined itself by two seemingly unchangeable resources: green pastures that feed hundreds of dairy cattle and old state Route 22A, the region's main highway that runs through the center of town.
Five years ago, though, this peaceful balance was upset when the Vermont Agency of Transportation announced a plan to widen the two-lane highway, which was heavily trafficked and needed modernizing. 
 The proposal to add 14 feet of asphalt to the 26-foot-wide road ignited a civic rebellion over small-town values, historic integrity and the quality of life. In a region where space had never been an issue, 14 feet of pavement was suddenly the only issue.
"The problem was, they wanted to take this rural highway and make it like an Interstate," said Margaret Barnes, a member of the Addison board of selectmen. "It would increase speeds. It would invite more traffic. People would go flying through town. It was a big change, and people here said they just didn't want it like that."
While classic in its dimensions, the dispute turned out to be novel in its results. In Addison, Route 22A will grow only six feet. And throughout the rest of Vermont, road building will never again be the same: the state became the first to rewrite road design standards to reflect new public expectations that highways should serve not only cars and trucks, but the surrounding community as well. That change occurred in 1991, when the Federal transportation-spending law was amended to give citizens and local governments more authority to determine how projects were planned.
Such ideas have swirled around the discussion of roads in Vermont and elsewhere since the 1960's, but with limited effect. Highway agencies did not have to consider public opinion until projects were too far along and therefore unstoppable.
"Addison was one of the many places in this state where we were having trouble," said David Scott, the director of project development for the Vermont Agency of Transportation. "With almost every project, people told us, 'No, that's not what we want.' We were at a standstill. It was change or do nothing. We had to remember who we work for. So we changed."
Vermont is by no means alone. Addison's protest and the new attitudes of Vermont's engineers reflect a formidable transition in the setting of transportation priorities. What began a decade ago as a neighborhood movement to open the highway planning process to more public oversight is now influencing transportation policy and spending in countless communities, many state capitals and especially in Washington.
The new approach has led to some surprising line items in Federal highway spending bills. The 1991 law -- a $155 billion, six-year package -- provided billions of dollars to communities to help them develop alternatives to reduce air pollution, and billions more to increase mass-transit ridership. Bus routes in major cities were expanded and new light-rail lines were started in Dallas and other Sunbelt cities.
Then three years ago in Chicago, the Transit Authority thought about shutting down a lightly used, deteriorating subway line that operated from suburban Oak Park through the West Side to the downtown Loop and out to the city's South Side.
Instead, the authority was persuaded to try a different approach: spend money rebuilding the line, develop the areas around the stations and the riders will come. Using Federal transportation money, the authority is working with Bethel New Life, a church-based community development corporation in Chicago, and the Center for Neighborhood Technology, a nonprofit civic organization in the city, to develop a $10 million housing and shopping district around the subway stop at the intersection of Lake Street and Pulaski Road -- in the heart of the city's West Side.
"There is an intimate connection between transportation and how land is used within walking distance," said David Chandler, the manager for economic development at the Center for Neighborhood Technology. "In some sense, this is so obvious. But somehow we forgot until the last few years."
Hank Dittmar, a director of the Surface Transportation Policy Project, a research and advocacy organization in Washington, said that awareness is beginning to work its way through the road-building apparatus. "We needed to think more broadly about our auto-dominated transportation system," Mr. Dittmar said. "It's not working well. It's leading to unbelievable traffic congestion. It's degrading the quality of life. It's resulting in neighborhoods we don't really want to live in.
"Cars are important," he added. "We all use them. At the same time, though, we need to start adding some other choices for people."
Last summer, again with bipartisan support, Congress passed a new $217.3 billion, six-year transportation spending law. It will most likely result in the investment of more Federal money to repair existing roads and constructing alternatives than it will to build new highways.
Indeed, the 1998 law is so flexible in its spending priorities that, of the $169.5 billion directed to Federal aid for highways, more than half can be spent on other transportation options. These include building light-rail lines, increasing urban and suburban bus services, constructing bicycle paths, developing transportation technologies to reduce pollution and paying for land-use planning that encourages healthier downtowns and communities where people can walk around more easily and conveniently.
AUTO companies, oil producers, truckers and developers are convinced that the new direction will lead to more congestion and harm the nation's economy. But they also quietly acknowledge that transportation may be the one area of major domestic policy in which lobbying muscle by the wealthiest industries has failed to deliver what they most wanted.
"Since 1970, the only transportation option that has shown consistent increases in every decade is a single driver in his or her car," said William Fay, the president of the American Highway Users Alliance, a Washington trade association for auto manufacturers, insurance and oil companies and others. "The question is, do you believe the purpose of public policy is to engineer social behavior, or do you believe, as we do, that the purpose of public policy is to facilitate a public need?
"There's no mystery about why roads are congested," Mr. Fay continued. "We aren't building enough new ones."
But Federal policy makers point to two related trends to explain the shift. The first is that years of intensive highway construction has resulted in a distinctively American pattern of sprawling development. A generation ago, many families could function well with one car. Today, more and more families must own and manage fleets of vehicles to survive in the suburbs.
THE second idea is that America has spent nearly $1 trillion over the last decade on transportation, mostly on roads, and traffic snarls are worse than ever.
According to the Department of Transportation, the number of cars and light trucks increased to 193 million in 1995 from 72 million in 1960, a 265 percent increase. During the same period, the population grew just 44 percent. Americans drive a combined 2.2 trillion miles annually, more than double the number of miles in 1970.
"You look at numbers like those, and you reach one conclusion: we can't build our way out of congestion," said John Horsely, the Federal Government's associate deputy secretary of transportation. "The number of miles we are driving is increasing two or three times faster than the population. There is no way we can keep up by building three times as much road capacity."
For the moment, light rail, or modern trolleys, is the hot alternative. Among the 25 cities considering light-rail systems are traffic-choked Sunbelt cities like Austin, Tex., Albuquerque, N.M., and Phoenix.
Though embraced in many communities, the move to invest billions in light rail worries some analysts. According to a study published last summer by Jonathan Richmond, a researcher at the Taubman Center for State and Local Government at Harvard University, most of the nation's new light-rail systems are not attracting hordes of new riders to public transit, as their promoters hoped, and have not relieved traffic congestion very much. The reason, Mr. Richmond said, is that most light-rail passengers were riding the bus.
For instance, an average of 27,000 daily riders used the light-rail line in Portland, Ore., in 1996. But a survey found that just 12,000 of the passengers were new to the mass-transit system.
"We have to get away from an obsession with a particular technology and see how we can improve the entire transportation system," Mr. Richmond said. "We've failed to adequately assess the performance of these rail systems."
George Boulineau, the director of planning and programming at the Georgia Department of Transportation, said the Atlanta subway system has attracted passengers and performed well. But his agency is also intent on constructing a second beltway around Atlanta to relieve congestion. The proposed highway has generated an opposition movement among residents and some local officials.
"There are no silver bullets to solve our problem," Mr. Boulineau said. "Whatever combination you choose, we think new road capacity still needs to be part of the picture."

HEADLINE: In the Debate Over Speed, There Are Few Facts, No Limits

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
WHEN Congress imposed a national speed limit of 55 miles per hour after the oil embargo of 1973, it said the move would save billions of gallons of gas. But little did Congress know just how much ink would be spilled debating whether such a speed limit would be good for the nation. 
 Speed limits have become a red-hot topic in which no new study is very likely to change minds. And since states were again given the right to set their own speed limits in 1995, the debate has grown louder.
"It's like gun control, because you have people who want the freedom to drive as fast as they like on one side, and on the other side you have people who are afraid of the speeders," said Edmund J. Cantilli, a forensic engineer and former professor of transportation and safety engineering at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute.
Sorting through the debate for a semblance of truth can be as tricky as finding the fuel pump in a new car.
The argument for driving more slowly certainly plays well at a gut level. "Because speeding reduces the time drivers have to avoid crashes, it increases the likelihood of crashing and the severity of crashes that do occur," according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. In other words, you not only have a greater chance of avoiding a deer if you are going slowly, but if you do hit one, it will probably roll off your car. At a faster speed, it may go through your windshield.
On a more abstract level, many studies have made a connection between higher speeds and a greater number of fatalities. After Congress set a national speed limit of 55 m.p.h., the National Research Council estimated that 4,000 fewer people died in car crashes as a result. A more recent National Highway Traffic Safety Administration study said that speed was a factor in 30 percent of all fatal crashes in 1997. The agency also said that there was an increase in the number of highway fatalities in states that raised speed limits in 1996, while states that did not raise their speed limits did not see a jump.
But there is pressure to go faster in all areas of life, from tennis serves to fastball pitches, from computer modems to microprocessing chips, from faster fast food to even quicker diets. And as more states adopted a 65 m.p.h. speed limit, the pressure to raise it grew on holdout states like Connecticut, which raised its speed limit this month to 65 m.p.h. on 334 miles of highways.
"Our Yankee and puritanical traditions go down hard," State Senator Biagio Ciotto, a co-chairman of the Connecticut Legislature's transportation committee, said recently. "I'm not a nut for speed. But the highways were designed to handle this speed. The time has come."
Certainly many people agree that the time for higher speed limits has not only arrived but is long overdue. They note that roads today can carry cars more safely at higher speeds, and that cars themselves handle better and are safer thanks to features like air bags, stronger door beams and radial tires.
Many people contend that the economy would benefit from people speeding up because goods could get to customers faster, reducing transportation costs. (The counterargument is that the decreased fuel efficiency related to higher speeds will drive up environmental costs.) And more lax speed limits will free police resources to go after drunken drivers. Speed limits, many people argue, are just a source of income for states, insurance companies and makers of radar detectors, and represent a law that makes people feel as if they are criminals for breezing along on the highway at what feels like a perfectly safe speed.
Finally, studies show that raising or lowering speed limits does not really change how people drive. A 1992 study conducted for the Federal Highway Administration said that lowering limits as much as 20 m.p.h. or raising them as much as 15 had little or no effect on actual speeds.
"The majority of drivers did not drive 5 m.p.h. above the posted limit when speed limits were raised, nor did they reduce their speed 5 to 10 m.p.h. when speed limits were lowered," the study said.
Mr. Cantilli, the consultant, said the problem with speed limits is that they are generally no longer set by traffic engineers who, before Congress began chanting "55 Saves Lives," used to study a road's design and traffic patterns to determine a speed limit that made sense.
Today, blanket limits are ordained without much thought, Mr. Cantilli said, and drivers know it.
"It creates a situation in which drivers don't know what the safe speed is for a section of road," he said. "Some drivers will drive too fast, and some will drive too slowly. It all comes back to the fact that people no longer see that someone is trying to figure out what is a reasonable speed for the road."

HEADLINE: Ludicrous! Impractical! Exorbitant! I'll Take It!

BYLINE: By JACK SMITH; Jack Smith is connoisseur at large for The Robb Report, a monthly magazine.

 BODY:
IT'S outrageous, Herb Chambers conceded, to pay $1 million for a McLaren F1 sports car. "It makes no economic sense at all," said Mr. Chambers, who lives on a sprawling estate in Old Lyme, Conn., equipped with a helicopter and a helipad.
As for the McLaren's center-mounted driver's seat, it's totally impractical. "It feels just like a Formula One race car," Mr. Chambers said. "It makes getting a ticket from a toll booth a real adventure." 
 And nobody really needs a car with 600-plus horsepower and a top speed of 230 miles an hour. "I have to send it to Montvale, N.J., to have it serviced," he said. "It costs $500 to rent a runway at the local airport to road-test it." As he said this, he glanced at the car's instrument panel to make sure the oil and water had warmed.
"Are you in?" he asked his passenger, who was struggling with the door of the F1, which slams down like a guillotine.
Hatches and latches secured, Mr. Chambers nudged the shift lever into first gear and gently engaged the clutch as the silvery, wedge-shaped supercar rolled slowly onto a country road and toward a highway. Once the car was on the entry ramp, the genteel tappa-tappa of camshafts and valves suddenly became a high-pitched, metallic scream as the McLaren accelerated onto Interstate 95, pinning its driver and passenger to their seats. The landscape was a blur.
"There's really no way to justify it in ordinary terms," Mr. Chambers yelled above the cacophony about the car. "That's the beauty of it."
Or, to some, the horror. Although there are cars -- a vintage Bugatti or a Delahaye, say -- that cost $1 million or more because they are rare or they have a certain provenance, the McLaren's appeal is more visceral. It is built to do one thing: scream down the road as fast as is humanly, or mechanically, possible.
So, too, are other $1 million-plus rare birds like the Porsche 959, Ferrari 288 GTO and Ferrari F40, though its value has dropped to a third of that amount since 1990.
Soon to come, if not already plying American roads, are street-legal versions of the Porsche GT1, the Mercedes CLK-LM, the Nissan R390 and the American-made Panoz GT-R1, each sleeker, sexier and scarier than anything ever built for the masses.
One reason car makers sell barely domesticated versions of all-out race cars (yes, the McLaren F1 began as a road car, but it also won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1995) is the "homologation" rules of racing: to compete in the GT1 class, a minimum number of cars must be sold to the public.
For the last few years, that minimum has been one, but given the economies of scale, if you're going to build one for the street, why not build a couple dozen?
Though Madison Avenue hypes sex appeal and power in the most garden-variety conveyances, mainstream auto manufacturers are reluctant to admit that the most exhilarating and testosteronic cars of all even exist. With good reason, said Dick Fritz, who managed Ferrari's racing team in the 70's. "European car makers are leery of American litigiousness," he explained. "If something happened, it would be easy to convince a jury that cars like these shouldn't be on the road."
The majority would not be if it weren't for Mr. Fritz's company, Ameritech, which specializes in making race-bred road rockets comply with Federal safety and environmental regulations. That means more than adding license plates. Mr. Fritz designs and installs American-mandated catalytic converters, evaporative emissions controls, on-board engine diagnostic systems, passive restraints (air bags), impact bumpers, side impact reinforcements, headlights, center-mounted stop lights and "various warning buzzers and lights." This road prep may cost $100,000 or more.
WHICH raises the question, Who buys these cars?
"Typically, these are dynamic, high-powered guys in their 40's and 50's," said Mr. Fritz, whose clients include Ralph Lauren, Clint Eastwood and David Letterman. "They're not old money. Most of them have started their own businesses and they have a lot of toys: airplanes, racing boats.
"Most of them are good drivers, but," he said with a wince, "some aren't. Frankly, it's scary to think of a McLaren or F40 in the hands of a bad driver."
Fortunately, he noted, it generally takes more than money to acquire a supercar. "The factories don't want one of these cars to wind up in the hands of somebody irresponsible," Mr. Fritz said. "It's usually by invitation."
Herb Chambers was in Biarritz, France, when he got his. "The McLaren factory told me to charter a plane and fly to England to look at the car," he said. "If I bought the car, they'd pay for the plane. That sounded fair. I wanted to see if it was really a $1 million car."
His skepticism was well founded; in the late 80's, rich car buffs were paying $1 million or more for the Ferrari F40 on the presumption that it was worth that much because somebody else would eventually pay more. But during the recession of 1991, the Ferrari frenzy cooled and prices fell to a level of $300,000 to $350,000, where they remain.
Mr. Chambers fits Mr. Fritz's portrait of a typical client. The 56-year-old Boston-born entrepreneur never went to college, but joined the Navy, hoping to become a fighter pilot. (He admits to having a hankering for speed.) When he got out, he used $1,000 to start a copy-machine repair service; when he sold A-Copy in 1983, it was the largest copy-machine sales and service company in the United States.
Into the void came cars. "I decided I always loved cars, so why not buy a dealership?" he said. "I bought my first in 1985. Now I own 13 locations with 23 franchises in three states. I love the business. You can really feel something for a car; it's hard to get excited over a copy machine."
Mr. Chambers had already owned a succession of Ferraris and Rolls-Royces. Nonetheless, he had never seen anything like the McLaren. "I fell in love with it the moment I saw it," Mr. Chambers acknowledged as the F1 rolled up to his helicopter and stopped.
"It was simply spectacular, but there was nothing gaudy about it," he exulted. "Everything is done to enhance performance, with no thought to cost. For instance, most car makers won't cut weight by 10 percent if it costs them 200 percent more to do it. But McLaren does."
THE weight-saving strategies include a body sculptured from carbon fiber, a featherweight tool kit with pieces cut from gold-plated titanium and a miniature battery. Together, they produce a car weighing 2,840 pounds, nearly 400 pounds less than a Corvette.
As for power, it is immediate, with no turbo lag. This is because the McLaren eschews turbo charging; instead, the 6.1 liter V12 incorporates 48 valves and 4 camshafts to produce 627 horsepower -- some 280 horsepower more than the Corvette's -- and 550-foot-pounds of torque.
The F1 remains on the ground at high speeds because of aerodynamics: the body is shaped like an inverted airfoil, with 6-inch diameter fans sucking air from beneath the car and shooting it out the back to enhance the vacuum effect.
The McLaren people took Mr. Chambers for a ride on a test track. "When it was over, I stepped out and I was sweating profusely," he said. "It was the most exciting ride of my life."
He went home with the McLaren and has never regretted it. "There are some things in life you buy, and then you ask yourself, Why did I ever do that? I bought a Lamborghini Countach once, and two days later, I didn't know why I bought it. It had all these wings sticking out of it. But this, I don't even have to drive it to enjoy it. I can just stand there and look at it."
Yet the car is hardly devoid of amenities. "Look," Mr. Chambers said, opening a panel between the door and the rear-wheel well. "Each car comes with its own matching luggage with the serial number on it. They also give you a Tag Heuer watch with the car's serial number on it.
"A watch," he repeated -- and laughed.

HEADLINE: Bound by an Uncommon Love

BYLINE: By BILL DONAHUE; Bill Donahue has contributed to The New York Times Magazine, Outside and others.

DATELINE: CENTRALIA, Wash.

 BODY:
IT'S pouring, of course. The rain is coming down in sheets here at the annual picnic of the Portland, Ore., Edsel Owners Club, and all these unwavering fans of the most ill-fated car in American history are huddled under a tree. Twenty loyalists, scratching plastic forks through the greasy puddles atop their potato salad and shivering, improbably, on an August afternoon.
They are salt-of-the-earth folks. There's a paunchy couple in matching green rain slickers, and a moment ago, celebrating his refurbished Edsel, the husband said, "I done the mechanic work and she done the cooking." Everyone laughed. But now, in the rain, the Edsel people look vanquished, like a baseball team cowering in the dugout, one out from losing the World Series. 
 "Probably it's just a passing shower," someone says.
The downpour persists. For Edsel people, it has been a miserable century, even though their car began with a glimmer of hope. Early on, long before the Ford Motor Company released its first line of Edsels in September 1957, it enlisted the poet Marianne Moore to dream up a brand name. She suggested Mongoose Civique, Aeroterre and Utopian Turtletop -- names that might have enhanced the mystique of the first Edsel ads, with autos covered in sheets traveling, ghostlike, along desolate roads.
Ford chose instead to give its new car the leaden first name of Edsel Ford, the son of the company's founder. Neither the name nor the design inspired middle-class suburbanites to shell out $2,500-plus.
Right away, they understood that the medium-priced Edsel, built on Ford and Mercury frames, was nothing but the same-old same-old festooned with a few gimmicks. The 1958 Edsel had a round speedometer and a signature three-part grille whose middle section resembled (to invoke the ancient slur) an Oldsmobile sucking a lemon. The car also had a "Teletouch" automatic transmission that could be operated by pressing buttons on the steering wheel. Or so Ford said: because of shoddy quality control, a forceful punch was often required.
Amid a recession, chrome-laden Edsels gathered dust in showrooms. The car became so uncool that, the year after it was introduced, beleaguered owners were giving away Edsels at Sunday-school raffles.
In 1959, Ford desperately erased many of the Edsel's Jetsonesque features. It lowered the car's sticker price and rejiggered its ad campaign to pitch the car to working-class Joes. Sales still floundered, and in 1960, after selling a grand total of 109,466 Edsels, Ford threw in the towel. All told, the fiasco cost the company $350 million.
And so the Edsel now oozes that loser charisma. It shines -- like Richard Nixon, Tonya Harding and certain death-row inmates -- as the inevitable target of a most tender affection. The Edsel Owners Club has 25 chapters and a 50-ish membership, which has remained at 1,000 for two decades. Two other rival clubs collectively lay claim to 1,200 Edsel devotees, and the Edsel people retain a small but distinct niche in the vintage car world, a realm that encompasses 500,000 or so restorers bound by their need for parts. "Rolls-Royce people want their cars to be as good as new," said Dave Brownell, the technical editor of Hemmings Motor News, a thick magazine packed with tiny ads. "For Chevy guys, it matters how shiny the engine is. But Edsel people feel the need to save every Edsel they see. It doesn't matter what shape it's in, because they've got a sense of humor. They're not going to grab you by the collar and shout that they have the best car in the world."
Indeed. As the Edselites assemble outside Portland to drive north to the picnic, they are intensely subdued -- murmurous, with their hands in their pockets. Truman King, a 71-year-old former truck driver and the proud owner of a 1960 Edsel Ranger two-door, says almost nothing and drives with both hands on the wheel all the way to Centralia. Slightly built, Mr. King is ruddy and has a raspy voice. He talks quietly about a journey he just took with two friends to the national convention of the Edsel Owners Club in Detroit. "I got the hard-luck award," Mr. King said. "Broke down three times getting there." The fuel pump quit in Idaho, then again in Montana; the generator went dead in Iowa City.
THREE guys traveling around, eating steak and potatoes at diners all over the country. It sounds pleasant enough, but it still is hard to comprehend Mr. King's fervent brand loyalty. He has bought 20 Edsels since a two-door sedan he bought for $150 in 1970. He and his late wife, Bettie, often worked in the garage until nearly midnight, she cleaning parts as he installed new rings and pistons. He points out, with a dewy gleam in his eye, that for 1960, Edsel made only 295 Ranger two-door hardtops. "This car," he exulted, "it's rare."
Mr. King pulls onto the picnic grounds and carefully backs his turquoise Ranger into the long row of Edsels under the trees. The cars are cream-colored and forest green, and some are the color of pistachio ice cream; there is an enchanting music to the whole pastel procession.
"I guess things weren't so hectic back in the 50's," Mr. King says. "And once in a while you kind of wish you could go back to that area of time." He climbs out of the car gingerly and heads for the picnic table.
It is a tame picnic, no beer, no tunes, no squealing tires. Once the rain subsides, everyone wanders toward the cars, where Russ Waterhouse, 53, is lingering beside his gleaming '59 Edsel Corsair convertible. He's wearing an Edsel T-shirt, an Edsel windbreaker and an Edsel golf cap, and he is pensive. Two days ago, his third wife filed for divorce. "This," he says, gesturing, "is the second divorce this car has gone through. She knew when she married me that I'm into Edsels."
Mr. Waterhouse is a disabled iron worker (his ankle was ravaged years ago by gangrene), and he rebuilt his Corsair in 1980 while recovering from testicular cancer and undergoing chemotherapy. "Some days I was so weak I'd just limp out and work for 10 minutes," he recalled. "I'd weld a rust hole, maybe, or sand a fender or clean something." The body work alone took six months of daily devotion, and today he is still assiduously restoring his Edsels.
He keeps three in mint condition (his four others are cannibalized for parts), and his five-car garage is full of grilles, hubcaps, doors, hoods and chunks of chrome trim. And the funny thing is, he said, his friends razzed him back in high school when he drove "the Great White Snail," his parents' new '59 Edsel wagon.
But they were just joking, right? "No," Mr. Waterhouse says, "it kind of stung. And there was this girl, Carol. When I showed up one evening to take her out, her father saw the wagon and said, 'No way.' After graduation, when I went into the service, she sent me a Dear John letter."
In the distance, a few Edsels are pulling out, going home. Mr. Waterhouse will soon leave as well, in search of a small house with a shop large enough to store his cars. Soon, he will find a place of his own. He will start over.
"But eventually the Edsel's back seat -- it, uh, did work for me," he said, smirking. "And the Edsel was the family car, too. I can remember all of us going to the beach in it. I can remember riding there one time and my dad's driving and I'm in the back with a friend and we're trying to stay up all night. We're singing, 'Black Land Farmer,' 'Ballad of Thunder Road' -- all the songs on the radio, and we're singing them loud. We had a ball in that car. Over time, you know, the bad vibes fade away."

HEADLINE: Dave and Audrey Get Down to the Nuts and Bolts

BYLINE: By LESLEY HAZLETON; Lesley Hazleton's new book is "Driving to Detroit: An Automotive Odyssey," from which this article is adapted.

 BODY:
In the summer of 1996, I left my Seattle houseboat and began a 13,000-mile odyssey around the United States, ending up in Detroit the following January for the International Auto Show. My intent was to drive deep into America's national obsession with the automobile and, as a committed environmentalist who loves and writes about cars, to try to resolve some of my own conflicted feelings. I visited places where cars are venerated, despised, built, rebuilt, armored, raced, crashed, crushed -- even buried. Among them was Spring Hill, Tenn., in the hills south of Nashville, where Saturn had become a model of modern industrial relations. I spent a day just before Christmas touring the huge complex. Then, at 5 in the evening, I began making cars. 
 I JOINED three other workers stationed around a huge rotating machine, where our job was to feed a robot. Officially, we were preparing dashboard molds for foam injection. In fact, we were simply loading and unloading the machine for the robot, which injected the foam and then wiped its nozzle as if it were wiping its nose -- an infuriatingly human gesture.
This was one of the simplest tasks on the entire assembly line. Squirt some filler release into a hole. Lift a plastic mold and place it on a protruding lip of the machine. Bang a board with your knee to drop three locks to hold the mold in place. Check the locks. Push a black button to bring the lip down into the right position for the next guy. Wait for the machine to rotate and present you with a new lip.
That was it. A 10-second job to be repeated ad infinitum.
At least there was time to talk. Dave Steadman, a blond, lanky man who usually did this job, stood beside me to make sure I made no mistakes. We connected almost instantly. He used to be in the Coast Guard, part of the time on the 44-foot self-righting motor lifeboats; in the spring, I had spent a week on those boats at the Motor Lifeboat School at the mouth of the Columbia River.
As the machine clanked and rotated, and I shoved on molds and banged buttons, Dave told me how he had left the Coast Guard to work at the Buick City plant in Flint, Mich., only to get laid off in the early 80's. He showed me the crooked middle finger on his right hand, a result of a conveyor belt accident. He had been out of work for 10 years until Saturn started up and he moved South.
"I've just turned 40," he said. "That means 17 years to go."
"To what?" I asked.
"Retirement."
"Seventeen more years of?"
I couldn't finish the question, not wanting to insult him. I couldn't imagine doing this job for more than a hour, let alone 17 years.
He nodded. "You got it," he said. "Why do you think they pay me so well? They pay me to be bored." (With bonuses, Dave said, he makes about $55,000 a year.)
Sure, working at Saturn had its good points. "It's fairly loose," he continued. "We decide within the team when to take a break, determine our own vacations and schedules, do our own quality checks, swap jobs within the team. There are 14 of us and we get on well, but for all that, it's really just another job on the line."
He missed what he called "the old world" back in Michigan. "All my friends are still up there. I know people go on about living down here being basic American values and so on, but the truth is I find it bland. Besides, the fishing's no good. Only bass. No steelhead, no salmon."
The team called a 10-minute break, and a memo detailing the latest contract negotiations was distributed. There would be a $2,000 ratification bonus, an annual college tuition grant for all Saturn workers and their family members, and extra bonuses based on quality and customer-satisfaction surveys. The sticking point was post-retirement health-care benefits.
Dave and I sat down, opened our Diet 7-Ups and got into the issue of quality. I argued that when the average price of a new car is half the average annual income, the least anyone could expect is that it have no defects.
"If you worked on the line," he said, "you'd be a lot more forgiving."
"How so?"
"Say there's a rattle or a loose wire," he responded. "I'd think maybe the guy on the line was hung over that day, or maybe he had an argument with his wife or trouble with the kids. His mind was elsewhere. You see how it is: you can't keep your mind long on this kind of work. You'd be inhuman not to wander off. And that's when mistakes creep in."
"Still, there are fewer of them nowadays," I said. "American cars are much better made. How come? Not as much drugs and alcohol? Higher awareness of quality?"
"Nah," he said. "It's because we're afraid for our jobs. Back in the early 80's, it never occurred to us we could be laid off. You got a union card and the job was yours for life, so there was no reason to work hard or make sure quality was high. Now we know what can happen."
With a half-grin, half-grimace, he added, "Plus, I've got a dozen team members who are going to get on my case if I don't do my job properly."
TWO hours later, I left Dave and moved from one of the simplest jobs on the line to one of the most complicated: assembling the whole instrument panel. Steering wheel, indicator and windshield wipers, gauges, dashboard liner, the lot.
Audrey Rody, who was assigned to teach me this job, was facing a tough challenge.
I guessed she was in her mid-30's. Despite a mass of long, brown curly hair, she had a boyish way, maybe because she was wearing a leather work apron, its pockets so full of connectors and screws and bolts that it took me a while to realize she was six months pregnant.
"Is this your first?" I asked.
She burst out laughing. "Honey, I'm 43 years old. And a grandmother. I married again not long ago, and" -- she spread her arms wide and stared at her belly -- "just look what happened. This sure is the last thing I ever expected."
"How long will you go on working?"
She laughed again. "Do you know how much kids cost? I'm staying right here till the day I pop."
She hadn't stopped working as we talked. She couldn't. The line was rolling, and it was either keep up or stop everything. We were standing on a wide conveyor belt as it rumbled past shelves piled with parts; above us, power tools and bins of screws dangled from a rack. Every six feet or so along the line was a pedestal holding a dashboard shell placed upside down so it was easy to work on. Audrey's job was to turn the shell into a finished instrument panel.
I spent the first half-hour figuring out how to stay out of her way. As far as I could see, Audrey had about 50 separate procedures to complete in a logic-defying sequence of three minutes. Each step had to be performed in perfect timing, so that the right parts and tools were at hand exactly when she needed them. To add to the pressure, this job was called a "show stopper."
Farther down the line, the completed instrument panel would be lowered into the "smile joint," a large lazy U going from one side of the car's frame to the other. If it didn't fit, the line stopped, and the whole plant would start running behind. "You can't go back and do it again," Audrey said. "You got to do it perfect the first time."
I knew I would never be able to do this job. Yet Audrey seemed convinced that I could. She talked me through each movement as she worked, and somehow persuaded me to do a bit here and there. Within an hour, I was beginning to get it down. Here is how it went:
Walk six stands down the line, past other team members at different stages of the job, and read the manifest hanging on the dashboard shell. Pick up different parts from the shelves alongside the line, depending on whether this is to be a sedan or a wagon, an automatic or a manual shift. Jam a leather sheath over a sharp metal edge at the side of the module. Ease the parts into place. Snap-connect electrical wires: gray to the right, blue to the middle, white to the left.
So far, so good. I was feeling quite proud of myself. The trouble was, this was only the very beginning.
The rest began to blur: snap-connect a black fastener, then a yellow one. Don't delay. If you go too slowly, the line will take you past the parts you need and you will have to start running back and forth for them. Pick up the steering shaft from a shelf and ease its 30-pound weight down through the center of the module. Arrange the wires to run over the top of the shaft. Slip on and snap a green fastener.
OR were those last two steps the other way around? "Here," Audrey said, redoing my work.
O.K., now pick up two bronze-colored bolts and screws, two black bolts, a circular piece and two silver bolts from those big bins alongside the line. Insert the silver bolts. Fine. Place the bronze-colored ones in one place, the black ones in another. Great. Pull down a power wrench from the overhead line.
I grabbed for it and missed. It began to recede. I stretched and yanked it down just in time to tighten the bolts. I had no idea what I was bolting to, or why. Neither, it turned out, did Audrey.
Right, I said to myself, you've got those bolts nice and tight. Now pick different bronze-colored bolts from another bin. No, not alongside the line -- right here, hanging overhead. Fine. Insert and tighten them by hand for now. What about the wrench? Not there yet, that comes soon. First, thread the electrical wires through the back of the module and out through this flap, then loop them over and under the shaft like so, and then. . . .
Then what? I couldn't remember. And I was only a third of the way through the job.
"Don't worry," Audrey said. "It takes most people four days to learn this job. You're doing real good."
That was sweet of her to say, but it didn't feel real good. My attention strayed, I lost a beat and suddenly the power tools and screw bins were bearing down on me way before I was ready. I worked as fast as I could, one eye on my hands, the other on the dangling wrench going past. I swore, lunged for it and yanked, thinking that if I pulled hard enough, I could pull back the whole line and slow things down to my pace. I remembered Charlie Chaplin's desperation in "Modern Times," and suddenly there was nothing remotely funny about that movie. I dropped a bolt, reached for the wrong wrench and watched pathetically as Audrey stepped in and put everything right. I hadn't felt quite this incompetent since I was a child trying to thread a sewing machine. I never mastered that.
The Saturn people were crazy to let me even try this job. I anticipated the news reports. "Saturn Cars Recalled," the headline would read. "Instrument-panel problems have led to the recall of 200 Saturn cars after customers complained that the windshield wipers activated the lights. In some cars, the headlight wand turned on the air-conditioning. In others, it came off in the drivers' hands. The problem became apparent when a steering-wheel shaft fell into a driver's lap. Fortunately, the car was not moving, since the ignition was incorrectly wired."
"Try not to get behind," Audrey said, "because that's when mistakes happen."
"Ummm," I said, giving a silent thanks to the person who was checking quality at the end of this section.
EVERY time I thought I had the hang of it, another two steps somehow reversed themselves in my mind, or one slipped out of existence altogether. My ears were ringing, my mind was reeling and my hands had never felt clumsier. I began to fumble with the screws, inserting them at an angle so that they wouldn't tighten properly and had to be taken out and inserted anew. Audrey was working as hard as I was by now; we stood shoulder to shoulder, me fouling things up, she fixing them.
And suddenly it was 10 o'clock. By now, I was squinting to stop from seeing double. I was convinced that if I could just work to the end of the shift at 3 A.M., I would get this job down. But as the line halted and everything stopped moving, a remote part of my brain signaled a weak but decipherable message that the pressure was getting to me. It was time to call it quits before I damaged a car, myself or worse, somebody else.
"Don't you want some lunch before you go?" Audrey asked. But I was too exhausted to even look at food. I needed fresh air. Solitude. Silence. I made some excuses, stuffed my yellow Kevlar gloves into my pocket as a memento and got lost twice trying to find the way out.
Never had a parking lot seemed so beautiful: quiet, peaceful, serene. Even the buzzing yellow sodium-vapor lights felt soothing. Behind me, the plant hummed gently, its skylights glowing in the night.
I found my truck, climbed in and was about to start it when I stopped, hand in midair. Something was wrong. It took a moment to figure it out: I had spent the last few hours working on upside-down instrument panels, and now I was seeing this one the right way up.
I reached out and examined its components, thinking of the man or woman who had assembled it. This thing that I usually took for granted, that I had never paid attention to, was now an astounding complexity of human skill and labor.
I started the truck and drove slowly out of the lot, wondering how long I could keep this awareness that cars are not merely machines, but things put together by real men and real women doing the kind of work that would drive a lot of people crazy. Not long enough, for sure.

HEADLINE: For All Those Towaways, The Trucks Stop Here

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

 BODY:
FOR motorists in Manhattan, the impound lot at Pier 76 off the West Side Highway is the most unhappy place in the world.
Nearly 65,000 people a year come here to reclaim their confiscated cars. They bring excuses, tears, fists and notes from priests confirming the burial of freshly departed loved ones. There you will find the morose motorist bringing in a live prop in the form of a brother-in-law in a wheelchair to validate his claim that he double-parked while wheeling his relative into the house, leaving his auto unattended for barely 30 seconds. 
 "What was I supposed to do, leave him out at the fireplug?"
"Yeah, I'm not no lawn chair, you know," the man in the wheelchair chimed in.
"You'll have to tell it to the judge" is invariably the response people get from the clerks, who work behind bulletproof glass.
It is not as if the towing officials don't care; your money is usually accepted with a smile. It is just that there are more than 2 million cars a day competing at any given time for the 1.5 million parking spaces in New York City. A result? As many cars are towed in New York -- 185,000 a year, or slightly more than 500 a day -- as are registered in Portland, Me.
City officials will tell you that impounding cars is a necessity. If cars were not towed in Manhattan and in the rest of the boroughs, clogged arteries would seize up completely. "Look, one car in the wrong place can snarl up the whole city," said Alfred Tumielewicz, the supervisor at Pier 76, an old steel-boned terminal at 38th Street next to the Hudson River. "We're not bad guys. But it's our job to keep traffic flowing."
But some skeptics say that the number of confiscated cars has a lot to do with the city's financial health. The heavy trading on Wall Street is why the number of tows to Pier 76 has plunged two-thirds over the last six years, they note.
"When the city was awash in red ink, as in '92, they looked in every corner for every nickel," said Sam Schwartz (Gridlock Sam), the transportation columnist for The Daily News and a former deputy transportation commissioner for the city.
"Although the city claims there is no quota system, ticketing and towing is a half-billion-dollar industry in New York," Mr. Schwartz added. "And if the stock market sours, the city will have to do something to make up for that lost tax revenue."
An extrapolation on Gridlock Sam's reasoning could be as follows: A coal-mine strike in Russia weakens its economy, causing the ruble to tank. This whips up fear among investors, who pull their money from developing economies, causing demand for American products to fall, which puts people here out of work. The American economy stumbles, Wall Street shudders, City Hall searches for new revenue and bingo, your car gets towed. All because a Siberian miner wants fresh bread.
Eugene Parker, the commander of towing operations, says: "A car is illegally parked, and we tow it. There is no quota system that I have heard of in my 25 years in traffic."
Whatever the precise cause, having your car towed is an urban nightmare, with images of angry confrontations, crumpled fenders, endless waiting in line and hundreds of dollars lost. There are some reasons for drivers to take heart, however. The quality of the experience has improved since the police took control of the pounds from the Transportation Department in August 1996.
To start, since the pounds are more secure, so are the contents of your car. And in July, they all began accepting credit cards, saving the carless "customer" a trip to the A.T.M. machine in the dead of night.
Mr. Parker also notes that assaults on tow-truck operators by motorists wielding everything from screwdrivers to soda bottles are down precipitously, as are motorists' claims of theft.
Besides Pier 76, there are three other public impound yards in the city: the Bruckner Boulevard yard in the Bronx; underneath the Kosciusko Street Bridge in Queens, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard. To retrieve your car from any of them, you must pay, in person, at the pound a $150 towing charge plus $15 storage for each day after 24 hours.
Be sure to call ahead. If your car has been towed for a violation and you have neglected to pay parking tickets in excess of $100, you cannot get your car back until you go to a Parking Violations Bureau, pay the fine and obtain a redemption receipt.
THEN again, your car might have been towed by the city marshal or by the sheriff, both of whom comb the streets for scofflaws by running random checks of license plates. It may be a dirty business, but it is a moneymaker. The sheriff's department stores cars in private lots; last year, it impounded 70,000 automobiles. Sheriffs also collect fines from tickets and charge the same as the police do for towing, plus a $45 administrative fee and a 5 percent surcharge.
A simple call to (212) 869-2929 is very likely to prevent headaches, large losses of money and repeat trips across town.
Mr. Tumielewicz, the Pier 76 supervisor, is a short man with a barrel-like physique. He seems like a decent sort, and says that the public is happy to see him. "They love us," he said in his shoe-box-size office. "They think their car is stolen, and when they find out we have it, they are actually happy."
But that good will is both artificial and fleeting. To people who had just paid their towing bills, after losing a day's wage and standing in line at three different municipal offices, the people behind the glass at the pound ranked somewhere between a politician and a person who skins harp seals for a living.
"The joy only lasts a minute," Barbara Taylor LaGoff said through tears, as she recounted her story of just burying her mother and losing her car in a no-parking zone while she stepped into a bank to deposit checks to pay for the casket.
MR. TUMIELEWICZ clucked in sympathy, offered condolences and laid out the steps that Ms. LaGoff needed to take to argue her case successfully in court. She seemed placated, blew her nose, paid her money and disappeared through the side door.
"The poor thing," Mr. Tumielewicz said as he arranged for someone to escort her to her car.
Pier 76 is open 24 hours, Monday through Saturday and a few hours early Sunday morning. People arrive in waves, wearing whiskers, Chanel No. 5, greasy baseball caps and turbans. Few come in their own car.
Despite the fact that Pier 76 earned $9 million in towing fees for the city in the last fiscal year, the redemption shack there is a rundown, gum-stained hot box, where there are no paper cups for the water cooler, no towelettes in the bathroom and the joke is that employees are encouraged to use both sides of the Charmin. There is no clock in the waiting room, just three pay phones, a wooden bench and a ventilation duct smothered in dust.
If you do not reclaim your car within 96 hours of its being towed, auction proceedings begin. After 30 days, it is gone.
At the twice-a-month auctions held at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, there are few Mercedeses or Lincoln Town Cars. Usually there are abandoned Skylarks and Cougars waiting to be chopped up and skinned by a small society of fringe capitalists like Fish Face Freddie, Maria Vargas and Al (Parts-R-Us) Kirschbaum.
One of the most miserable cash cows to lumber through the tow yards in some time was Halfred Shiroma, who ultimately had to pay $30,300 to get his yellow cab out of hock. Recently pulling out reams of documents from a paper valise at the redemption shack, Mr. Shiroma retraced his troubles, which began three months ago when his cab was towed. It seems that Mr. Shiroma owed $600 in parking tickets. That was just the start.
His cab was taken to Pier 76. Within a few days, Mr. Shiroma came to claim his car and was told to go to a marshal's office to pay his parking fines, which he says he did.
He returned to the lot, and the clerks there said he needed a release from the Taxi and Limousine Commission because he also owed fines to that agency.
The T.L.C. said it would not give him a release until he paid those fines, which totaled $6,000 in violations. He paid.
Then the T.L.C. said it could not give him a release form for his vehicle until the car was inspected, since safety inspections are required every four months. His had lapsed while the car was impounded.
But Mr. Shiroma could not get his vehicle inspected because the pound would not release it.
Finally, the police at Pier 76 agreed to release his car if the T.L.C. would relent, which the commission did but only after Mr. Shiroma agreed to purchase a new cab. Taxi regulations require an independent cab driver who is the owner and the sole operator of his cab to replace the vehicle every five years. And Mr. Shiroma's vehicle had exceeded that age limit. Mr. Shiroma said he shelled out $22,000 for a new cab.
He showed up last month to redeem his old cab, with its divider and meter, and was promptly relieved of $1,700 in tow, storage and administrative fees for the three months it sat at Pier 76.
Mr. Shiroma paid in cash, eager to retrieve his car.
Then he saw it. The cab was covered in soot and bird dung. The battery was dead, and to add insult to injury, there were two more parking tickets under the wiper.
Mr. Tumielewicz arranged for a jump, and within an hour, Mr. Shiroma's Caprice was spitting and sputtering toward freedom.
"You know why people in New York live in tall buildings?" he hollered as he drove toward the gate. "So they can jump." Then he disappeared in a cloud of blue smoke.

HEADLINE: Why America's Left Foot Has Less and Less to Do

BYLINE: By MARSHALL SCHUON 

 BODY:
BARBARA CROOK has been driving since she was 14, but she was afraid to get behind the wheel of my Honda Prelude. There was nothing wrong with the little black coupe -- indeed, Mrs. Crook had just bought it to use as her family's second car -- but she was just scared. She is one of a large and growing population of motorists who have never stirred a manual gearbox.
All the same, she told me (and herself) that she was ready to learn. 
 "Back about 1960, I was 14 and in Florida," she said. "It was the first year that ninth graders had to take driver's ed and get their licenses if they wanted to graduate from junior high school. The school intended to order stick shifts in all the cars but one. But the order was mixed up, and they got all automatics and one stick. So each student just got one test-drive in the stick, and my turn happened to be the day after Hurricane Donna roared through. There were trees everywhere in the road, and all of that starting and stopping was a nightmare. This is an excuse, of course, but that was the end of my experience with a stick."
Eventually, Mrs. Crook sailed away in my Prelude -- with her husband, Douglas, at the wheel -- to her home in Manasquan, N.J. But I thought about how many people are in the same boat. And I remembered my mother, 89 and still driving an automatic, recently riding with me, asking about the Prelude and wondering why anyone would buy a car that had to be shifted.
So, was the stick shift really dead?
"Well, Mom," I said. And tried to explain that a shift lever puts you in touch with the car, that it gives you more of a feel for the road and what the vehicle is doing. I looked into the rear-view mirror and saw her shaking her head as I went from second to third, so I don't think I succeeded.
But what I said was true, at least for me. When I was learning to drive in the early 50's, none of us crew-cut macho guys would have been caught dead with an automatic.
Clutchless cars have been around a long time, of course. Cars with semiautomatics were attempted by various manufacturers in the 30's, but Detroit's first successful automatic transmission appeared as a pricey $100 option on the 1940 Oldsmobile. In 1950, the Olds Hydramatic was grafted onto Chevrolets, and Packard introduced its Ultramatic that same year. The rest of the industry followed, but even when I passed my first driver's test in 1952, "restricted" licenses were still being issued to Pennsylvania applicants who had the bad judgment to show up with an automatic, limiting their driving to a wimpy car.
In those days, my crowd thought a real car was an old Ford V8 with a stalk growing from the floor, and the restricted licenses levied what we considered proper sanction against lazy learners. Now, though, most applicants don't know how to shift, and even Ford's sporty Mustang more often comes with an automatic. Scott Davis, a Ford spokesman, said that only one-third of these pony cars are ordered with stick shifts.
For Chevrolet owners, too, the trend is to drive in the "drive" gear. Manual gear boxes account for fewer than 5 percent of Chevy's cars and 20 percent of its trucks. The Corvette, like other flat-out sports cars, is a slightly different story, with about 35 percent of its buyers choosing the computer-controlled stick that decides whether the car is being driven sensibly or by a hotfoot. If it decides you are civil, it eliminates two gears and makes the shifting less difficult.
Detroit's other Big Three name, Chrysler, also offers a compromise with its Autostick, which has manual and automatic modes. But even with economy cars like the Neon in Chrysler's mix, only 8 to 10 percent of the company's products roll out of showrooms with purely manual transmissions.
It should be said, too, that automatics are better than ever, smoother and more economical. And the trend away from what used to be the "standard transmission" is a worldwide phenomenon.
Luxury cars have long been the exclusive province of the automatic, with only BMW bucking the trend. In the case of the 3-Series Bimmer coupes, 50 percent have sticks, and the ultrasporty M-Series cars are almost entirely manual. Even the ritzier 5-Series has more than its share of manual buyers. Rob Mitchell, a company spokesman, attributed that fact to the BMW's image as a "driving machine."
"There are things that make them comparable with other cars, equipment and quality of build," Mr. Mitchell said. "But I think what really separates them is the driving feel. It's not just the numbers -- the 0 to 60 numbers -- it's what you feel, and I think one thing that's integral to that is a manual transmission."
Traditionally, hand-shifting has also been integral to economy, but these days even makers like Honda see a move away from sticks, which means annual orders of only 150,000 of the nearly 1 million cars the company sold in the United States last year. Richard Norton, a Honda spokesman, said research had shown that "age and where you are in life" affect what kinds of transmissions people buy.
"A lot of Preludes have sticks, but most Accord sedans are ordered with automatic," Mr. Norton said. "Then when we came out with the redesigned Accord coupe last year, we saw an upsurge in orders for stick. The coupe has its own lines and became more of a sports car. But if you look at something like our new Odyssey minivan, there was no need even to offer a stick -- everybody wanted an automatic."
That group would include Mrs. Crook. But she has decided to be brave.
"My church recently asked me to be a soloist," she said, "and it terrified me when they asked. But I did it, and it's been so much fun. So then I thought maybe I'd confront another fear, thinking of new precipices to climb. I thought, Why not learn to shift for myself?"

HEADLINE: China Is Host to Human Rights Conference

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 20

 BODY:
China opened an international conference on human rights today, a sign of its growing confidence in a field where it has faced much criticism.
While not focused specifically on China, the two-day symposium reflected China's greater willingness to entertain discussions on rights issues. 
 More than 80 delegates from 27 countries attended the conference, sponsored by a group marking the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Chinese delegation included Government officials and academics, but no known dissidents.
It also offered China an opportunity to promote its view that cultural, historical and economic differences between countries are bound to create arguments over human rights.
"It is only natural that countries in the world do not have complete agreement on how to define, approach and realize human rights," the Deputy Prime Minister, Qian Qichen, said at the meeting. "No country's human rights situation is perfect."
In a statement, Qin Yongmin, a dissident from southern China, attacked the meeting as an effort to "cheat international opinion."
The symposium follows a decision by the United States and the European Union this year to drop efforts to censure China at the United Nations Human Rights Commission.

 BODY:
These are not the best of times for contract garment manufacturers in Manhattan. Rents are rising and the manufacturers are under other economic pressures as well, says Paul Lau, executive director of the Sportswear Apparel Association, a trade organization for the industry. About 25 have gone out of business in the last year alone, he said.
But for design concerns and other businesses ready to pay the higher rents, the loft spaces they are leaving in buildings south of East Houston Street and north of Canal Street, where many have clustered, have presented a leasing opportunity. Accordingly, some buildings are in the process of transition from manufacturing to office uses as leases turn over. 
 "We're getting computer companies, sound production and film studios, architects and photographers, moving east from SoHo and going south from the East Village," said Bill Lam, president of Longines Realty on Grand Street, a brokerage company that manages about 400,000 square feet of space in 10 buildings, mainly in and near Chinatown.
The adaptation of commercial space to new market conditions has been an aspect of New York City's real estate history for time out of memory.
Not out of Leo Malz's memory, however. Mr. Malz runs Aleda Plastics, an export business, from the ground floor of a five-story building at 425 Broadway, just north of Canal Street, that he has owned since 1950. "It was built in 1879 as the Uptown Hotel," he said. Since then, uptown has moved uptown, taking the hotel business with it. In the 1920's, Mr. Malz said, the building was converted to residential use, and in the 1940's, textile and vinyl plastics companies moved in.
Most of them moved out in the 1970's, and retailing has become more active on Broadway near Canal Street. Aleda Plastics is still in the ground-floor space, but the dress manufacturer on its upstairs floors closed a year ago, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy.
"We are the last of the plastics jobbers of the late 40's," Mr. Malz said. "Now, we're trying to decide how to remodel the upstairs floors. We could convert them to offices, or they could be for light manufacturing. We're not sure."
But next door, at 443 Broadway, a women's clothing designer has already moved in. Tracy Feith Inc., a three-year-old business, took half a floor in the building, owned by Empire Sporting Goods, a uniform manufacturer, which is bringing office tenants to space it does not need, said Hank Widmaier, a Helmsley-Spear broker. The company moved in six months ago and will soon open a retail outlet nearby, at 209 Mulberry Street.
"I looked for over a year," said Mr. Feith, who had been in a small space at Lafayette and Spring Streets. "This is perfect."
Garment manufacturing tenants usually cannot afford rents higher than about $11 a square foot a year, Mr. Lam of Longines Realty said. In the early 1990's, a period of depressed conditions in the real estate market, many came in on five-year leases at about $7 or $8 a square foot a year. Now, they often cannot afford renewal leases at current market rents, which even with minimal upgrading work are about $15 to $16 a square foot, Mr. Lam said. In the best locations, fully restored space in full-service buildings will cost about $25 a square foot, he said. At that price, a tenant in 2,500 square feet (half a floor in many five-story lofts) would be paying $5,200 a month.
One of the buildings with plans to make the transition as leases expire is 197-201 Grand Street, owned by the Lepore family, which also owns Ferraro's, the Little Italy patisserie, in a smaller building next door. Three garment tenants who remain in the 40,000-square-foot seven-story building are expected to move out by the time their leases expire at the end of this year, Mr. Lam said. Two floors have already been committed to new office tenants, he said.
The vibrant activity in the commercial leasing market in the Chinatown and Little Italy areas has promoted real estate careers for Chinese-Americans. Among them is Mr. Lam himself, who came to the Lower East Side in 1969 at the age of 11 when his family emigrated from Hong Kong. He helped his mother in a garment factory when he was young, and as a young adult, worked in the fashion business. Garment business owners he met then helped him when he founded Longines Realty in 1988. "Longines" is an Americanized rendering of "lon gin," Lam said, which means, roughly, "bright development."
One of his clients now is Danny C. K. Li, president of Great Canal Plaza Inc., a developer-owner that built the Holiday Inn Downtown at 138 Lafayette Street, at Howard Street. The 227-room hotel is a conversion of a vacant 11-story loft. It opened as Maria's Hotel in 1992 but soon became a Holiday Inn, a downtown novelty at the time. It struggled with cost overruns and 30 percent occupancy rates at first, Mr. Li said, but now the occupancy rate averages 92 percent and rates average $160 a night.
Mr. Li, 63, was touring the United States as a performer in a Hong Kong Cantonese-style opera company in 1970 when he decided to stay permanently. He worked 18-hour days in a garment factory on East Broadway in 1971, he said. Three years later, he opened his own garment business, with 50 workers. He sold the business in 1978 and invested in real estate.
His financial partner in various ventures was Maria Lee, franchiser of a bakery chain in Hong Kong and Taiwan, who also opened a Maria's at 148 Lafayette Street. With the economic downturn in Asia, Mr. Li has now bought out his partner in two properties, 185 Canal Street and 125 Canal Street, both six-story office buildings, totaling 60,000 square feet of space.
"We are turning them into Chinatown Class A office buildings," Mr. Lam said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Five agency acquisitions are all in a single day's work in these frenzied times for Madison Avenue.

BYLINE: By Courtney Kane 

 BODY:
THE pace of transactions involving agencies specializing in advertising, public relations and other marketing communications services has accelerated again, this time with the announcement of five acquisitions. Financial terms of the deals were not disclosed.
The frenzy reflects how the dynamics of traditional advertising and marketing keep changing as independent shops are rapidly snapped up by larger agencies. 
One deal involved the communications and marketing division of the MDC Communications Corporation in Toronto, which further expanded its presence in the United States by acquiring a majority interest in Source Marketing, a strategic promotion agency in Westport, Conn.
Source, founded in 1989, has 24 employees and billings estimated at $7 million from clients including the Campbell Soup Company, the Eastman Kodak Company, Home Box Office and Reckitt & Colman. Howard Steinberg, 40, president, will continue to head Source, owning a minority stake in the agency.
"We had been approached by a number of organizations looking to acquire us over the years," Mr. Steinberg said. "However, we agreed to partner with MDC because of their philosophy of independence and autonomy and their ability to bring additional resources to enhance the growth prospects for our business going forward."
The Source deal is the third this year in the United States for MDC, which owns three agencies in Canada including a sales promotion shop, Accumark Promotions in North York, Ontario. In August, MDC acquired a majority interest in Margeotes/Fertitta & Partners in New York and in May, the company bought 75 percent of Cyber Sight, an Internet marketing agency in Portland, Ore.
"Sales promotion is an $80 billion sector of marketing services that is growing 11 percent per year," said Miles S. Nadel, president and chief executive of MDC. "The acquisition of Source Marketing represents an important step for us to swiftly obtain a significant presence in this market in the United States."
MDC also said it had signed letters of intent to buy another American advertising agency, a public relations agency and a corporate design company, but did not identify them.
The second deal involved the acquisition of a Canadian agency.
Euro RSCG Worldwide in New York, part of Havas Advertising, bought Sharpe/Blackmore in Toronto, which has been renamed Sharpe/ Blackmore Euro RSCG. The agency, which was founded in 1996, has 25 employees and billings estimated at more than $20 million from clients including Absolut vodka, Dell Computer, RJR Nabisco and Xerox.
Bill Sharpe, 44, chairman and chief executive, and Tom Blackmore, 49, president, will head Sharpe/Blackmore Euro RSCG in those posts.
The third deal also involved a unit of Euro RSCG.
Healthview Euro RSCG, a division of Euro RSCG Healthcare Worldwide, acquired Nethod L.L.C., a strategic on-line communications agency in New York. Nethod has 10 employees and projected revenue of $3 million from clients like the American Cyanamid division of American Home Products, the Perkin-Elmer Corporation and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer. Gregg Trueman, 42, president of Nethod, will continue to head the agency.
"Nethod will provide on-line program development and management of on-line communications services to all of Healthview's divisions," said Ron Pantello, chief executive of Healthview and Lally McFarland & Pantello Euro RSCG.
The fourth deal involved Doremus & Company in New York, the business-to-business agency owned by Omnicom Group, which acquired Colligan Group, a corporate advertising and direct marketing agency in New York.
Colligan has five employees and billings estimated at $8 million to $10 million from clients like Dictaphone, First Union National Bank and the National Geographic Society.
Richard Colligan, 47, president, continues to head Colligan and becomes an executive vice president of Doremus.
Finally, Ogilvy Public Relations Worldwide in New York acquired Alexander Communications Inc., a technology public relations agency in San Francisco.
Alexander will operate as Alexander Ogilvy Public Relations Worldwide. Pam Alexander, 44, president and chief executive at Alexander, continues to head the agency, reporting to Bob Seltzer, president and chief executive at Ogilvy Public Relations.
Alexander has 158 employees at seven offices in cities including Atlanta, Boston, Dallas and Denver, handling accounts with billings estimated at $15 million from clients like Ascend Communications, Hewlett-Packard, Merrill Lynch & Company and Qwest Communications. Ogilvy Public Relations, part of WPP Group P.L.C., has 550 employees in 31 offices worldwide, handling accounts with billings estimated at $55 million; clients including Glaxo Wellcome, I.B.M., Pfizer and Quaker Oats.

HEADLINE: Chase Manhattan Earnings Beat Forecasts of Analysts

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Chase Manhattan Corporation, the nation's second-largest bank, reported better-than-expected earnings in the third quarter yesterday, even as trading revenue from emerging markets evaporated. Wells Fargo & Company, which concentrates on the domestic economy, also beat average estimates.
Chase said third-quarter profit from operations fell 32 percent, to $738 million, or 82 cents a diluted share, from $1.08 billion, or $1.19 a share, in the quarter a year earlier because of trading losses and declines in equity investments. The bank exceeded by 5 cents the average estimate of 77 cents a share forecast by analysts surveyed by the First Call Corporation, which tracks company earnings. 
 Chase's net income fell 15 percent, to $837 million, or 94 cents a share, from $982 million, or $1.08 a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, exceeded analysts' expectations of $3.93 a share by 6 cents. Net income for the bank, the nation's ninth largest, rose 20 percent, to $347 million, or $3.99 a share, from $290 million, or $3.23 a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
Shares of Chase jumped $1.8125, to $53.0625.
Chase was the second big bank this week after J. P. Morgan & Company to stir optimism that the worst may be over after last month's flurry of profit warnings stemming from trading losses in emerging markets, anemic capital markets and signs that domestic economic growth may be slowing.
J. P. Morgan, which reported earnings on Monday that were better than many analysts had expected, and Citigroup, which reports tomorrow, both led the Dow Jones industrial average higher. J. P. Morgan climbed $2.50, to $96.375. Citigroup rose $2.5625, to $45.3125.
Chase said it had $200 million of unsecured trading and lending business in Russia and a $2.7 billion hedge fund investment, of which only $300 million was unprotected.
The bank's noninterest revenue fell 6 percent, to $2.2 billion, because of lower trading revenue. Total trading-related revenue fell 60 percent, to $259 million, as the bank lost $146 million from trading in bonds. A year earlier, it made $264 million from trading in debt securities.
A strong domestic economy helped temper the loss of revenue from overseas markets, analysts said. Chase's consumer businesses gained, with revenue from card-member services rising 17 percent, to $979 million, and regional consumer banking increasing 5 percent, to $591 million.
Wells Fargo and other banks, which primarily focus on domestic activity, also experienced strong earnings growth while reducing expenses. Wells Fargo, which is expected to complete its $30.7 billion merger with the Norwest Corporation next month, said net interest income rose 1.8 percent, to $1.15 billion. Noninterest income rose 8.9 percent, to $737 million, bolstered by service charges on deposits and higher fees and commission income.
Shares of Wells Fargo rose $11.0625, to $378.5625.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Deutsche BankIs Reportedly Seeking U.S. Acquisition

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
Deutsche Bank, eager to buy a concern that will enhance its international investment banking business, has been scouting out prospects, including the Bankers Trust Corporation, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and J. P. Morgan & Company, bankers and analysts said yesterday.
Ronaldo H. Schmitz, a member of the board of the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank, recently visited with executives from some New York financial companies, including Bankers Trust, said a Deutsche Bank executive who insisted on anonymity. 
 Mr. Schmitz, 59, who oversees Deutsche Bank's investment banking strategy as well as its North American business, was traveling in the United States recently for the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Washington, Macy W. Egerton, a spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank confirmed yesterday. She refused to say what banks Mr. Schmitz had met with on his visit.
Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust declined to comment on reports published yesterday in The Financial Times of London that their banks were in "preliminary talks" about a possible merger.
Even so, the time may be ripe for Deutsche Bank to begin such discussions, whether with Bankers Trust or some other United States concern, analysts said yesterday.
The declines in the American stock markets in recent months have ravaged the stocks of several big banks and brokerage firms, making them cheaper potential acquisitions. While shares of Bankers Trust rose $4.1875 yesterday, to $58.9375, on the report of a possible deal, they are still well below their price of about $100 two months ago. Deutsche Bank's stock, however, has fallen less.
Deutsche Bank has signaled in recent months that buying an American investment bank is its preferred route onto Wall Street, after an expensive strategy of building by hiring bankers and traders proved unsuccessful.
"Deutsche has publicly stated they want to buy" a bank, said Evangelos Kavouriadis, European banking analyst at Sanford Bernstein & Associates, "and they have plenty of financial reserves," more than 44 billion marks ($27.14 billion).
"So the will and the money is there," he said. "The question is from the available candidates, who is the best fit?"
Deutsche Bank is looking for American investment banking expertise to counter growing international competition.
"It would appear that what Deutsche and the big European banks are worried about," said Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, "is that if they don't rapidly improve their capital markets capabilities, firms like Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Goldman, Sachs" will reap the rewards as capital markets in Europe shift to stocks and away from bank financing under economic and monetary union.
Some American banks may also be more eager now to draw closer to a powerful outside partner like Deutsche Bank. Russia's default on its debts, the gloomier international financial outlook and the sudden contraction of liquidity in many markets has unnerved many of those who manage big American financial companies that deal in the more speculative markets.
Bankers Trust, for example, has been the subject of negative rumors in recent weeks in part because of its big businesses in several markets that have recently done poorly, notably junk bonds, derivatives and growth companies. It also has had some rude shocks lately, having to put up $300 million as its part in the rescue of Long-Term Capital Management L.P., the hedge fund in Greenwich, Conn., that nearly collapsed. In early September, Bankers Trust said that it had trading losses totaling $350 million in its business with Russia. This Thursday, Bankers Trust is expected to report its results for the quarter ended Sept. 30, with analysts generally expecting layoffs and losses.
But some analysts yesterday were scathing about the wisdom of any such merger by Deutsche Bank in this uncertain and volatile climate.
"It is probably one of the worst investment banking decisions I could imagine," said Mark Hoge, bank analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in London. "It is the worst possible environment to be buying an investment bank at this time, given the market uncertainties, and that you don't know how many gremlins are hiding inside."

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
Recent surveys find airline fares are stabilizing -- somewhat -- as corporations trim travel budgets.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
BUSINESS travelers can take some comfort that the typical domestic business fare rose only 3 percent in the 10 months ended August, to $458, according to the latest American Express Business Airfare Index. By contrast, comparable fares increased 16 percent in all of 1997 compared with 1996. A typical business fare generally means the lowest fare available with the least restrictions. But business fares in August, the latest month for which data were available, were 9 percent higher than in August 1997, when the comparable fare was $421.
In its most recent survey, the Air Transport Association reported on Monday that the average fare, which includes economy and first-class fares, fell 1 percent in September, compared with September 1997, and rose only 1.8 percent from January through September 1998, to $138.74 
 But whether because of the rise in business fares the last few years, because of the recent economic downturn or both, corporate America has begun to rein in spending on business travel. A survey of 450 Fortune 1,000 companies by the National Business Travel Association found that 56 percent have cut back the number of employees who travel, 53 percent have replaced some travel with video conferencing and teleconferencing and 40 percent have altered corporate travel practices and policies to save money. On average, the corporations surveyed will reduce overall domestic and international travel by 17 percent.
 
Hotel Update
 With New York City hotels jammed practically every night, the 242-room Peninsula New York hotel at Fifth Avenue and 55th Street will reopen on Nov. 1, some 10 months after closing for a $45 million overhaul. Room rates are $535 a night, a junior suite is $800 and the Peninsula suite is $5,500.
Managed by the hotel and marketing arm of ultra-upscale Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels Ltd., the Peninsula, as those rates suggest, is hardly your ordinary hotel. Amenities include built-in remote-controlled televisions, which can be viewed from the tub; three telephones in the bathroom, including a hands-free unit at the tub, which automatically mutes the radio and television; double-glazed windows and a personal fax number.
There are other specialties of the house, including a control panel that displays up-to-the-minute temperature and humidity readings from the hotel's own rooftop weather station.
 
Conde Nast Winners
Singapore Airlines has done it again. The November issue of Conde Nast Traveler rates the airline the best international carrier for the 10th time in the 11 years the magazine has conducted its readers' choice awards. The best United States carrier was Midwest Express, the rare airline that actually leaves a few inches between passengers' knees and the seat in front. Other winners included the Windsor Court Hotel in New Orleans, voted the best hotel in the world; Crystal Cruises and Silversea, the best large cruise line and small cruise line, respectively; Sydney, Australia, the top foreign city, and San Francisco, the top United States city.
 
Airline News
Americans who buy the Europe Flight Pass can now add Paris, Prague, Venice, Vienna and 25 other European cities for $90 a flight. That is the result of three more airlines' joining the network: Cityjet, based in Dublin; Alpi Eagles, a regional carrier based in Venice, and Croatia Airlines of Zagreb. Other airlines include Icelandair, Virgin Express and Spanair, a Spanish carrier that for almost a year has been operating nonstop flights between Washington Dulles International Airport and Madrid. Flight coupons, sold in packets of three or more, are valid for 120 days. They are available from travel agents or by calling (888) 387-2479.
To celebrate a year of flying to the United States, Spanair has a $299 round-trip fare between Dulles and seven Spanish cities, including Madrid, Barcelona and Palma de Mallorca. The round-trip fare to the Canary Islands is $369. Travel must be completed by Dec. 14 and other restrictions apply.
Sabena Belgium World Airlines also has a bargain fare: $750 a couple to Brussels from New York, Newark, Boston, Chicago or Atlanta. The price includes round-trip fare, departure taxes and two nights at the Brussels Hilton International or a similar hotel. The package is good only over Thanksgiving weekend, Nov. 26-29, and restrictions apply. In a refreshing break with the airline tradition of never disclosing the number of seats available to frequent fliers or in fare sales, Sabena said it was limiting the number of seats for this promotion to 350, or 50 for each of the seven flights -- including two flights each from New York and Atlanta.

Treasuries Fall As Investors Turn Elsewhere

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices tumbled yesterday as investors moved some money into stocks and scouted for opportunities in corporate bonds. Many were emboldened by the Federal Reserve's reductions in interest rates, which have eased concern that the economy will enter recession.
"People have been scared to death in the past couple of months" and have sought the safety of Treasury debt, said Vic Thompson, who oversees $150 billion of bonds at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. "To the degree that they get their courage back, some of that money is going to make its way out of Treasuries and into riskier securities." 
 The Fed on Thursday lowered its target rate for overnight borrowing between banks by a quarter-point to 5 percent, its second quarter-point reduction in less than three weeks.
The 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 13/32 to 106 29/32. The decline in price pushed up the yield to 5.07 percent from 4.97 percent Monday.
The selling derailed a rally that had pushed bond yields to a series of 31-year lows earlier this month, as investors bought the world's safest securities because of economic turmoil overseas.
"We saw money flow into the safe haven of bonds, and we're seeing the reverse of that now," said Randy Bateman, who helps oversee $1 billion at Sun Trust Private Capital Group in Orlando, Fla.
The Fed's decision to lower rates before its planned Nov. 17 meeting -- the first time since April 1994 that policy was changed outside a scheduled meeting -- increased speculation that it was willing to cut further to forestall a slowdown.
In the corporate bond market, Saks Inc., the nation's sixth-largest department store operator, plans to sell debt to take advantage of low interest rates and improving demand.
The gap in yield, or spread, between investment-grade corporate bonds shrank by 2 to 3 basis points yesterday, traders said. The Ford Motor Company's three-year global bonds, sold Friday at a spread of 113 basis points over Treasuries, were quoted today at a spread of 108-111 basis points, according to traders.
Investors are starting to dabble in corporate bonds after a lull of more than two months, "another concern for Treasuries," said Tony Crescenzi, head of government trading at Miller Tabak Hirsch & Company in New York.

HEADLINE: Making Its Marque at the Top;
Toyota's Lexus Offers a Lesson in Brand Development

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Ellen Passe sat in the passenger seat of an RX 300, the new Lexus midsized sport utility vehicle, while her 2-year-old son, Alex, fiddled with the steering wheel. Outside the car, her husband, Michael, spoke with a salesman at a midtown Manhattan Lexus dealership.
"Where are my heated seats?" Ms. Passe asked good naturedly. The salesman quickly pointed to a small button near the CD player. Ms. Passe smiled. 
 For the Passes, it had come down to a choice between a Jeep Grand Cherokee and this Lexus, both priced at roughly $32,000. But based on their experience owning a Lexus sedan, Mr. Passe seemed fairly sure of what their final decision would be. And they did later buy the Lexus.
"We love the Lexus experience," Mr. Passe said. "And the service? Well, there isn't any comparison."
Since the Toyota Motor Corporation created the Lexus brand a decade ago, families like the Passes have gradually developed a fierce loyalty to it, transforming this upstart -- initially seen as an unlikely threat to BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Lincoln and Cadillac -- into a major automotive success story.
How did Lexus, even with designs that are often called bland, become one of the top-selling American luxury cars, behind only Lincoln, Cadillac and Mercedes?
Its quick ascent provides a vivid lesson in how a mass marketer can carve out new territory. For one thing, Toyota created a distinct identity for Lexus by making it one of the first brands to focus on more than just the car, providing owners a level of service that had not been seen in the industry but that is now emulated by competitors.
Toyota kept Lexus dealerships separate and did not dilute the brand with low-priced, less luxurious vehicles to attract buyers. And thanks to Toyota's deep pockets, Lexus could respond quickly to changing tastes by offering new models.
A look at the Lexus strategy, in fact, points up the missteps made by the Honda Motor Company and the Nissan Motor Company, which brought out their own upscale brands, Acura and Infiniti, in the United States at about the same time. From the start, Lexus took aim at the status-conscious Mercedes driver, while its Japanese rivals offered a broader lineup, making it harder for them to crack the top end of the market later.
Infiniti and Acura are still recovering. In the first nine months of 1998, Lexus sold about 112,000 cars and light trucks in the United States, a 59 percent increase over the corresponding period a year earlier -- and more than BMW, which sold about 98,000, up 4 percent. Mercedes has sold 124,000 vehicles this year, up 56 percent. But Infiniti sales fell 11 percent, to 44,000, and Acura's sagged 7 percent, to 82,000, even as they both offered hefty discounts to increase sales.
Of course, if the long economic boom does falter, sales of all luxury cars will surely suffer. But for now, Lexus is thriving. "Of all the Japanese luxury brands, Lexus is the only one that could be called a success," said Eric Noble, an analyst with AutoPacific, an automobile marketing and product consulting company in Santa Ana, Calif.
"Infiniti, Lexus and Acura all do a pretty good job of handling the consumer," he said. But, he noted, "Lexus has products that are what the consumer wants."
By striving from the outset to match Mercedes's prestige, Lexus took hold more quickly in this country, said Susan Jacobs, president of Jacobs & Associates, a consulting company in Rutherford, N.J.
On top of that, Lexus's focus on service earned it loyal customers. Lexus was one of the first to offer a replacement car while a customer's car was being repaired, showroom breakfast buffets and free lifetime car washes. The company also sponsored opera and jazz events.
Because of its connection to Toyota, Lexus inherited a reputation for value and reliability, said Scott F. Merlis, president of Merlis Automotive International Inc., a Westport, Conn., investment bank.
"They were able to tap into Toyota's product development system and broaden the line quickly," he said. Lexus, which began with two sedans, now has eight models.
The element of surprise also worked to Lexus's advantage, according to Ms. Jacobs. When the first Lexus models hit showrooms in 1989, existing luxury-car makers, especially the Europeans, took little notice. "They didn't believe that a start-up luxury brand could threaten their 100-year heritage," she said.
To be sure, all the Japanese auto makers -- Lexus included -- made missteps in the mid-1990's that hurt sales. Lexus mistakenly increased prices just as the Europeans slashed theirs by as much as 15 percent. Lexus also relied on its reputation too heavily for too long and was slow to make noticeable design changes, said John Casesa, an analyst at Schroder & Company.
"The Europeans so effectively responded to the initial Japanese attack," he said, "that it's taken Lexus nine years of slugging away with the same message and the same product positioning" to gain sales from those who previously owned European luxury cars.
In the past, some critics said, Lexus also updated cars by copying style changes from other makers. A Lexus sport model brought out in the fall of 1997, for instance, offered oval headlights similar to those introduced by Mercedes two years earlier.
At the same time, Acura, initially somewhere between a Honda and a full-scale luxury line, tried to revamp its image as a true luxury-car maker. But it merely confused customers by altering its model names in 1995, switching from brand names to a European-style mix of letters and numbers.
In addition, its plan to retire the name Integra, just when the car was the best-selling and most widely known Acura model, was quickly abandoned. Yet the very existence of the Integra, starting at a humble $16,000, and the lack of a powerful V-8 flagship model has made it difficult for Acura to gain true luxury status.
"By having a vehicle like Integra, it isn't clear it's a luxury car," said Lincoln Merrihew, an analyst for J. D. Power & Associates, a marketing information company. "It's about image."
Infiniti has tried to stake out its own territory in a crowded field, mimicking BMW by focusing on unique design and superior handling and performance. But because of financial problems at Nissan, the company, whose exterior designs differed the most from then-current luxury models, was least able to update models and expand its product line to respond to competitors' lower prices. Infiniti's early advertising campaign, widely considered bizarre because it did not show any cars, also hurt its introducation.
Each auto maker has had some success revamping its lines and introducing new models. Acura's redesigned TL sedan, for example, nudged ahead of a comparable Lexus in sales in September. Backed by Honda's strong reputation as an engine maker, Acura now plans to focus on building high-performance cars aimed at enthusiast drivers, said Jeff Conrad, Acura's national vice president for marketing.
Infiniti, taking a similar tack, plans to introduce a high-performance car aimed at empty-nest baby boomers. The company will also introduce one new car each year for the next four years, said Steve Kight, Infiniti's marketing director.
Lexus, which had initially sold itself as a lower-cost answer to Mercedes but then let prices balloon, charged back by refocusing on value, introducing new models like the GS 400 sport sedan. It also redesigned several models, like its entry-level ES 300 and top-of-the-line sedan, the LS 400, adding features while maintaining or cutting prices.
And Lexus is only now beginning to redesign some models in response to criticism that its cars are dependable but unexciting, Mr. Casesa and Mr. Noble said.
Now, with the introduction of the RX 300 -- which even Cadillac's general manager, John F. Smith, calls the best blending of car and truck attributes -- Lexus is seeking to establish a name as a trend setter as well.
Lexus's midsized model follows closely on the heels of Mercedes's new small sport utility vehicle, the ML 320, which has sold extremely well. Both appeal to drivers who want the comforts of a luxury car along with the best attributes of sport utilities. But the Mercedes is more rugged than the Lexus, and thus closer in feel to larger American sport utilities.
The smaller Lexus sport utility vehicle, available only since March, and the LX 470, an upgraded version of the Toyota Land Cruiser, now account for about 30 percent of Lexus sales in the United States and makes Lexus the only luxury brand offering two models in one of the fastest growing and most profitable corners of the market. In July, it also helped make Lexus briefly the best-selling luxury brand in this country. Lexus sold 14,673 vehicles that month.
The appeal of the RX 300 seems to be that it offers the high perch and four-wheel drive of a sport utility vehicle without some of the drawbacks, like poor ride and truck-like handling. It is also lower to the ground than most larger sport utilities and thus easier to climb into.
"It's an example of their willingness to push the envelope," Mr. Merrihew said. "It's luxury applied to a part of the market that hasn't seen it before."
And in luxury cars, a stable of fresh, exciting products is key.
"Product is about 90 percent of the game," said Mr. Smith of Cadillac, which pushed out its large sport utility model, the Escalade, in 10 months. The Escalade, a version of GMC's Yukon Denali, will appear in showrooms this fall.
Right now new models, like sport utility vehicles, "drive a lot of showroom traffic," bringing in customers who may end up buying cars instead.
Cadillac plans to introduce one new car model each year as it works to develop its own hybrid sport utility, which will be available in a few years. BMW is about two years away as well.
Lexus's efforts to rev up its image, moving from dependable stalwart to maker of vehicles offering a more exciting driving experience, is a tack other luxury-car makers are taking to appeal to younger buyers.
BMW, whose cars have always had a reputation for high performance and driving excitement, already has an edge here.
"We want to be a moving target," says Bryan Bergsteinsson, the Lexus group vice president and general manager. Speaking of the company's competition, he said, "If they can follow us, when they get there, we'll be gone."
But this time around, it will not be as easy, Ms. Jacobs and other analysts forecast.
"They're finding the right ideas to make themselves stand out," she said. But "Lexus now is playing on a much more level playing field than in the early 1990's. The Europeans are more aware of the threat Lexus can pose."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Home builders begin to see the advantages of consolidation.

BYLINE: By Andrew Pollack 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
IS a consolidation coming in the home-building business? That could be one message drawn from the announcement yesterday that the Kaufman & Broad Home Corporation will buy the privately owned Lewis Homes, a leading builder in California and Nevada. The price is $409 million in cash and stock, plus the assumption of $135 million in debt.
Already the largest home builder in California and the West, Kaufman & Broad said the transaction would make it the largest in the country, based on its plans to deliver 21,000 homes in 1999. The current leader, the Pulte Corporation, is now building about 15,000 homes a year. 
 The deal was not officially announced until after the close of trading, but Kaufman & Broad's stock surged $1.0625, or 4.7 percent, to close at $23.625.
For 1998, Kaufman expects revenue of $2.4 billion based on delivery of 15,000 homes. Lewis, based in Upland, Calif., expects to deliver 3,500 homes in 1998 and to show revenue of about $685 million. It is the largest builder in fast-growing Las Vegas, and is strong in northern Nevada, Southern California and Sacramento.
With low interest rates and a strong economy, home builders have been flourishing. But fears that a recession is coming have dampened share prices until the most recent week, when they have rallied somewhat. Kaufman & Broad has been expanding in the last few years outside California into other Western states. But the latest acquisition will strengthen it on its home territory, where it is being challenged by the Lennar Corporation, a Miami-based builder that is expanding aggressively in California through acquisitions.
Kaufman & Broad and some other builders "are trying to focus less on how many markets they can enter and concentrate on building bigger share in the markets they are in," said John Stanley, an analyst at Warburg Dillon Read, which represented Kaufman & Broad in the Lewis acquisition. Having a big market share gives a company an edge in procuring land and subcontractors and provides economies of scale in purchasing and advertising.
Bruce E. Karatz, the president of Kaufman & Broad, said that the push for size and market share meant that more deals would be in the offing, both for his company and for others in home building, traditionally an industry run by small, locally focused entrepreneurs. "People have figured out that you can successfully combine builders," Mr. Karatz said in an interview. "It was the unwritten rule that you couldn't, because they were entrepreneurs and everyone had their own way of doing things." Randall Lewis said he and his three brothers, who run Lewis Homes, decided to sell when they saw the benefits of size. "The bigger companies were getting benefits in terms of purchasing, borrowing on Wall Street and buying land," he said.
Still, a consolidation might not offer much opportunity for investors. So far, most acquisitions have been of small, privately held companies. One exception was the purchase earlier this year of the Continental Homes Holding Corporation of Scottsdale, Ariz., by D.R. Horton Inc. of Arlington, Tex., a transaction valued at $467 million on the day it was announced.
Growth through acquisition is only part of Mr. Karatz's strategy. He has started a program called KB2000 that aims to make home building more of a disciplined business. Instead of building houses and hoping to sell them, as many builders do, Kaufman & Broad is trying to build to order, much like Dell Computer does. It does not offer completely customized homes, but does extensive consumer surveys and has built big showrooms to allow buyers to pick out the fixtures and designs they like.
Mr. Karatz said that KB2000 is improving the company's sales and margins. But he concedes it is hard to isolate the effects of KB2000 on the company's results from the effects of the generally strong market in California and the West.
The real test of KB2000 is likely to be when there is a downturn. That could also be when more mergers occur. "A downturn in the housing market will force a greater amount of consolidation," said Steve Percoco, an analyst with Lark Research in Rahway, N.J.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Back in Redmond, Microsoft's Profit Machine Keeps Humming

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
Demonstrating yet again the power of its franchise, the Microsoft Corporation reported yesterday that its quarterly earnings had risen 58 percent over their level a year earlier, far exceeding Wall Street estimates.
Microsoft, the world's leading maker of computer software, said demand for the Windows 98 operating system exceeded its projections, particularly in Japan and Europe. 
 Microsoft's improved performance coincided with the beginning stages of a landmark antitrust trial in Washington that could threaten its dominance in computer software. The company, which the Department of Justice has portrayed as a ruthless and unfair competitor, said its strength in the latest quarter was derived mostly from Windows 98, which was released just last June, and the Windows NT corporate operating system.
The results for Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., were released after the stock market had closed. In Nasdaq trading, Microsoft shares closed at $100.25, down $2.69, which may have reflected the opening of the antitrust trial on Monday. But in after-hours trading, the shares traded as high as $103.75.
"Business is good, so the doom-and-gloom scenario of some economic prognosticators certainly hasn't come to pass," Greg Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview. "This is not just for Microsoft, but the whole PC industry."
Despite the widespread economic problems in much of the world, Mr. Maffei noted, the six largest software companies and eight largest computer and chip companies that have reported earnings have all beaten estimates.
While continuing to urge caution about the outlook, as Microsoft executives do each quarter, Mr. Maffei said the company was likely to do better than expected in the second fiscal quarter as well. He said he would advise securities analysts to adjust their estimates upward.
For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Microsoft earned $1.68 billion, or 62 cents a diluted share, more than twice the $663 million, or 25 cents a share, reported in the period a year ago. Revenues rose 26 percent, to $3.95 billion from $3.13 billion.
The latest results included a $160 million one-time gain on the sale of Softimage, while in the quarter last year the company took a previously announced $296 million write-off related to the purchase of WebTV Networks Inc. Without these one-time items, Microsoft's earnings rose to $1.52 billion, or 56 cents a share, compared with the previous year's $959 million, or 36 cents a share, to record the 58 percent gain.
Analysts surveyed by First Call Corporation, which tracks earnings results, had expected Microsoft to earn 49 cents a share.
"It was a terrific quarter, a real blowout, a very pleasant surprise for Microsoft shareholders," said Rick Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman Sachs. Microsoft's results "benefited from much higher margins," he said. "We had a combination of better- than-expected revenues and lower- than-expected expenses in the quarter," he said.
Mr. Maffei said the improved profit margins were partly a seasonal phenomenon because the company does less hiring during the summer and the marketing costs associated with the start of Windows 98 were largely in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 1998. Also, service costs are lower for Windows 98 than for Windows 95. "We had better-than- expected revenues, and we were at the low end of our spending," he said.
Although the antitrust suit brought against Microsoft by the United States Department of Justice did not affect earnings, Mr. Maffei said, it does have a direct cost in increased legal spending.
"That's a large cost, but not a material cost," he said. "We do worry about the continued cost of the D.O.J.'s image blasting."
Unearned revenue, the portion of sales Microsoft sets aside to reflect the long-term deployment of many of its products, grew to $3.13 billion in the quarter, up $245 million from a year ago. Cash and short-term investments totaled $17.24 billion, compared with $13.93 billion a year ago.
On a cautionary note, Mr. Maffei said fallout from the Asian economic crisis remains a concern and the company is uncertain about future performance in Latin American countries. Corporate spending for computer issues related to the year 2000 may divert revenues away from some Microsoft products but could benefit others, he said.

HEADLINE: Profit Rises 10% At Phillip Morris

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Philip Morris Companies, the world's largest tobacco concern, said yesterday that its third-quarter profit rose 10 percent as higher cigarette prices in the United States offset a worldwide drop in demand for Marlboros, Virginia Slims and other brands.
Profit from operations rose to $2.05 billion, or 84 cents a diluted share, from $1.87 billion, or 76 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts expected the company to earn 83 cents a share, according to the First Call Corporation, which tracks estimates. 
 Unit sales, or the number of cigarettes sold, fell for the first time since 1993, in both the United States and international divisions. Philip Morris has seen slower demand as a result of economic slumps in Asia and in Russia.
The company's Kraft North America unit, the nation's largest food company, said operating profit rose 5.1 percent, helped by increased unit sales and cost savings.
The Miller Brewing unit, the nation's No. 2 beer company, said operating profit rose 1.7 percent, to $118 million, mainly because of lower brewing costs. Unit sales fell 4.2 percent, the company said.
Shares of Philip Morris rose $2 yesterday, to $49.875.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Brazil's Plan On Deficits Is Still Under Construction

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Brazilian officials ended four days of meetings with representatives of the International Monetary Fund today without living up to their public pledge to announce concrete measures to reduce Government deficits.
In Washington, Pedro Parente, executive secretary of the Brazilian Finance Ministry, offered only details on Brazil's plans for raising a primary account surplus over the next three years. 
 With only five days to go before gubernatorial runoffs on Sunday, neither he nor President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, in Brasilia, said how the Government planned to achieve the savings. Important allies of Mr. Cardoso are lagging behind in three key states, and despite the Government promises, market analysts did not expect an announcement until after the elections.
Instead, the strategy in Brasilia and Washington appeared to focus on reassuring the markets that work on cutting the deficit was going forward, without providing fodder for opponents in domestic elections.
"The discussions continue with the objective of reaching agreement soon on the detailed program," said a joint statement by the I.M.F. and the Brazilian Finance Ministry.
Because of Brazil's enormous deficits, the collapse of emerging markets has hit the nation particularly hard, draining foreign currency reserves and pushing the economy toward recession. Finance officials in Washington and around the world fear that a collapse of Brazil, because of its size and links to other economies, would worsen financial instability throughout the hemisphere. With 160 million people, Brazil represents the world's ninth-largest economy and is the financial engine of Latin America.
Throughout the day, Government officials met with President Cardoso in Brasilia and were expected to fine-tune a three-year austerity package that Mr. Cardoso was to discuss with Congressional party leaders on Wednesday morning.
In Brasilia, officials said that among the measures being considered were a tax increase on financial transactions, to three-tenths of a percent from two-tenths of a percent, and extending the Fiscal Stabilization Fund, which sets aside 20 percent of all taxes collected for presidential discretionary spending. The fund was to have expired by 1999.
Speaking in Washington, Mr. Parente said that Brazil would aim toward a surplus of 2.6 percent in 1999, 2.8 percent in 2000 and 3 percent in 2001. It had already been announced, at the end of the I.M.F.'s annual meeting in Washington two weeks ago, that Brazil would have to reach a primary account surplus of 2.5 percent to 3 percent to qualify for I.M.F. aid. The primary account covers Government expenses, without interest payments on debt.
Ernest Brown, senior economist for Latin America at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said that signs that the Brazilian Government and the I.M.F. were moving closer to an aid package were reassuring, and that he did not expect much more than reassurance until next week.
"I call this the 'We have a pope' scenario," Mr. Brown said.
"You're just going to hear that we have a pope, maybe see the white smoke rising," he said, "and not figure out who the pope is until after the elections."

HEADLINE: Soaring Endowments and Big Spending

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
If there is a commonly followed barometer of the wealth of universities, it is surely Harvard's endowment, which, thanks to generous donors and the long stock market boom of the 1990's, stood close to $13 billion at the end of June, more than the gross national product of most developing countries.
No other college or university comes close. Still, the University of Texas system (the second richest, with $7.6 billion) and other wealthy colleges and universities like Princeton and the University of California have seen their endowments soar. A dozen now have $3 billion or more, up from six just two years ago. 
 Despite the recent market slump -- including losses taken on some hedge funds and other investments -- many of these institutions are beginning to loosen their purse strings and spend some of their newly acquired bounty. Tuition increases are being moderated. Financial aid packages are being sweetened. Faculty members are getting more money for research. Academic initiatives are bursting forth, frequently with new laboratories or classrooms.
Harvard recently said it would give larger scholarships and reduce the size of its nonlecture classes. Yale is adding faculty slots for the first time in years. Washington University in St. Louis is creating a department of biomedical engineering. Rice University in Houston is adding majors in biophysics and bioengineering. The University of Chicago will spend about half a billion dollars on an athletic center, two dormitories and a center for the biological and physical sciences.
Hugo F. Sonnenschein, president of the University of Chicago, sums it up succinctly: "The world is much better for us now, as it is for colleges and universities everywhere."
For universities like Stanford, the new era is particularly welcome. "In the early 90's we had cost cutting," said John Ford, Stanford's vice president for development. "Now we have come around that corner and are making strategic investments."
Mindful of the public outcry over tuition costs, many private colleges and universities are using some of their extra revenue to moderate the growth in tuition -- which is still rising faster than inflation -- and to raise financial aid.
But wholesale tuition cuts are unlikely. For one thing, relatively few colleges and universities have any significant endowment, and most have established policies that restrict them to spending only a small part of their wealth each year.
"You don't want to pay out so much that you beggar future generations, or so little that you beggar the current one," said Dean Currie, vice president for finance and administration at Rice, which saw its endowment grow 51 percent to $2.8 billion as of June, and is adding new buildings for the humanities and the biosciences as part of a strategic plan.
Typically, universities try to even out the impact of booms and busts. They usually spend no more than about 4 or 5 percent of their assets a year -- even if investment gains for the year equal 20 or 25 percent of their assets -- and they base their calculation of average assets over three, four or five years.
This caution means that the market run-up of the last few years has translated into higher spending only very slowly, and in many places that spending is just becoming visible.
"We tend to be very careful," said Rebecca S. Chopp, the provost at Emory University in Atlanta, which has seen its endowment increase to $5 billion in June from $3 billion two years ago. "We want to be here for a long time."
Most universities are embracing a number of priorities, including old themes, like financial aid and salaries, and some newer ones, like bioengineering departments and international studies.
Mindful of the public outcry over tuition costs, many private colleges and universities are using some of their extra revenue to moderate the growth in tuition and to raise financial aid.
Williams College, which raised its tuition by 4.6 percent last year, held its increase to 3.5 percent this year, its lowest increase in about 25 years. Like many other colleges, Williams decided to allow students to keep all of the outside scholarships they won, rather than partly reducing its own scholarship aid for each dollar they bring in from the outside.
"What the extra money has done is enabled us to respond to some pressures," said Stuart Crampton, the college's provost.
Building and maintenance, an area that colleges and universities often skimp on in tight years, is also getting new emphasis. Even universities like Columbia that are already in the middle of major building programs are beginning to dream about further building.
"The remarkable endowment returns of the past few years will allow us to continue projecting further investments in facilities," said George Rupp, Columbia's president. Columbia is expanding undergraduate housing, rehabilitating its library and building a new student center.
Emory has found that the added dollars from the market are helping it move faster on its strategic plan. Besides creating new scholarships, it has put $1 million a year into improving teaching, and an additional $250,000 a year into sending faculty members and graduate students overseas and to bring foreign visitors to its campus.
A few universities are liberalizing their spending formulas. At Cornell University, this resulted in a 30 percent increase of the amount paid out this year, said Henrik Dullea, vice president for university relations. "That really affected so many departments," he added.
Washington University, which saw its endowment increase 52 percent in the last two years, to $3.5 billion, is permitting the spending of an extra $7 million in its $850 million budget.
The university is adding new buildings for psychology and executive education and has increased financial aid. "Perhaps we would have done the same things without this growth," said Mark S. Wrighton, Washington's chancellor, "but not as quickly."
Moreover, when financial crises shook Asia last year, the university was able to tell students it could help them if needed. About 600 of its 10,000 students are from Asia.
Although the recent market turmoil has cut into the gains of the past year, many colleges and universities in September were still ahead of where they were a year ago.
Williams, for example, whose endowment had by the end of June risen 25 percent from a year earlier, to $769 million, saw the total shrink by $75 million by the end of August. "That put us just about where we would have expected to be if we had a normal year," said Mr. Crampton, the provost. "We're keeping a kind of wary eye on the stock market."
Still, university officials caution that some of the changes may loom larger symbolically than in reality. At Yale, for example, the decision to add new faculty positions for the first time since 1992 seemed to represent a major policy shift. But Charles H. Long, the deputy provost, said the university made the decision because it saw a particular "opportunity to make a difference" by giving the political science department six new openings.
"There was a series of retirements over the last decade that had taken some of the luster off the department, and relative to student interest, it was very understaffed," Mr. Long said.
He also said the six represent an addition of less than 1 percent to a faculty of 1,000 members.
Even with larger endowments, not all universities feel richer.
At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the extra income from the higher endowment is helping to offset reductions in Federal research money, said Glenn P. Strehle, the university's treasurer and vice president for finance.
"That's impacting everybody," he said, "but it is impacting us more, since a larger portion of our budget comes from sponsored research."
Mr. Strehle said M.I.T. had to replace about $55 million a year in revenue. "For us," he said, "the question is not how flush we are, but how tight the belt is."

HEADLINE: Shoney's Will Sell or Close 84 Restaurants

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Shoney's Inc. said today that it would sell 34 restaurants to Elias Brothers by early next year and close 50 locations by the end of January to focus on its restaurants in the Southeast.
Terms of the sale to Elias Brothers, which operates Big Boy restaurants and is based in Warren, Mich., were not disclosed. Shoney's said it would take a $5 million charge in the fourth quarter ending this month to cover lease obligations on restaurants set to close, Those outlets are in Missouri, Kansas, Michigan, Illinois and Ohio. 
 The moves are part of Shoney's effort to turn around its struggling business by shedding unprofitable restaurants in weaker markets.
Shoney's said employees at 31 restaurants sold to Elias would be offered jobs at Big Boy Restaurants. The remaining restaurants were already closed and therefore had no employees, the company said. Shoney's shares rose 18.75 cents, to $2.

If You Don't Build It, They Will Go

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO

 BODY:
The World Series moved across the country last night, but the owners of the teams playing in it acted as if they were back on Broadway. Whether by design or coincidence, George Steinbrenner and John Moores appeared to be performing a play within a play.
Using dialogue that was scripted or spontaneous, each insulted the other's ball park, which ordinarily would offend the other. In this comedy, however, they were actually trying to help each other get a new park. Getting a new park is in vogue today. 
 Until Moores spoke out about Yankee Stadium, Mayor Rudy Giuliani had been the only outspoken booster of a new home for the Yankees. But Moores joined Giuliani yesterday.
"For once, George Steinbrenner may have badly understated the problems," Moores said in response to a question about Yankee Stadium at a news conference.
Moores had joined Larry Lucchino, the Padres' president, and Mayor Susan Golding of San Diego at the news conference to talk about the referendum that will be on the city ballot in two weeks to provide money for a new park for the Padres.
Moores might never have offered his comments on Yankee Stadium had the question not been asked, but it was inevitable that the matter would be raised because he had trashed the Stadium in comments that appeared in The San Diego Union-Tribune.
About an hour after Moores expressed his views, Steinbrenner, who never appears on the field before a World Series game, suddenly burst into the Yankees' dugout and instantly made his pitch for a new park for the Padres. Electioneering two weeks before the vote can't hurt.
"What's going on with this field?" he said. "It looks terrible. They've got to give these people a new stadium. Or they ought to move their team. They've done a magnificent job. The city is behind it. That thing is like a cow pasture."
Steinbrenner was referring to the football game that was played at Qualcomm Stadium on Sunday, the ninth professional and college football game that has been played on the Padres' field this season.
"Give these people a new stadium like they deserve," the owner said. "John has done everything he could. I know football and I know bad fields. That field is pretty well chewed up. If they don't give him a new stadium, they're crazy."
Steinbrenner was told that Moores had said New York City should give the Yankees a new stadium.
"That's nice of him; I appreciate it," he said. "John has done a magnificent job with this team, he and Lucchino, and they deserve a new stadium."
The Padres and the city want voters to authorize the expenditure of $411 million on a downtown redevelopment project that would include a $267.5 million ball park. A referendum on a new park for the Yankees has been in the courts and may never reach the voters.
Unlike Giuliani, Moores felt certain that if given the chance, New York voters would agree to spend taxpayer money.
"I suspect anybody who's been to Camden Yards and then goes back to Yankee Stadium would vote for something like Camden Yards," Moores said after the news conference.
But what about the cost? In San Diego, it's $267.5 million. In New York, specifically Manhattan, which is where Giuliani and Steinbrenner want it, a new park would cost more than $1 billion.
"If you look at the gross domestic product of San Diego and compare that to New York's, I don't care what they have to spend on a ball park there," he said. "They can afford it, one way or another. My feeling is that most citizens pay their taxes and don't really expect that much back for it. They're passionate about their sports teams."
A minute later Moores said: "It's hard for me to imagine that the only superpower in the world cannot sustain the greatest franchise on the planet in an appropriate way. That just doesn't make a lot of sense. Dirt is expensive in New York. That's part of the charm. If it weren't so expensive you probably wouldn't want to build a ball park there."
Moores visited Yankee Stadium for the first time last week during the first two games of the World Series.
He talked of the moist eyes and goose pimples that a tour of the Yankee Stadium monuments evoked. "Yankee Stadium is like a cathedral," he said. But he added: "Once the eyes clear and the brain starts to work, you look around. Yankee Stadium is not very adequate."
He said he was shocked and amazed at the myriad problems he found, including aisles that are too small, an "awful" concessions situation, "real tough" parking and too many seats upstairs and too few good seats downstairs.
"The South Bronx is a tough location," Moores said. "I suspect what ultimately will happen is there will have to be a lot of redevelopment of the South Bronx to make it a better location or they're going to have to figure out how to pay the tariff on Manhattan or watch the thing go to New Jersey. The fans of baseball are not being well served at Yankee Stadium."
Included in Moores's remarks as a subplot was a pitch for himself and other owners of low-revenue clubs.
"In an era of revenue sharing, I sincerely hope George gets something done sooner rather than later," he said.
And in a subsequent similar reference, he said: "My guess is New York City will get it done. They'll have the kind of ball park that the city deserves and they'll carry on the Yankee tradition and I hope there's a lot more Yankee money for revenue sharing."

BYLINE: By LAWRIE MIFFLIN 

 BODY:
To most Americans, market news once meant hikes in hamburger prices. Now, the market means first and foremost the stock market, and viewers are following it more closely than ever.
Evidence? On Monday, CNN will more than double the number of stock market updates that it carries from its financial-news sister channel, CNNfn, to 19 a day from 9. The two-minute updates will run twice an hour on CNN from 8:15 A.M. until 4:15 P.M., as well as a report at 7:30 A.M. and a wrap-up at 6:15 P.M. 
 Also, CNN has begun carrying a corner-of-the-screen graphic updating Dow Jones and NASDAQ stock market averages all day. The Fox News Channel carries those two and the Standard & Poor Index. MSNBC carries the Dow only.
Since CNN's "Moneyline News Hour," with Lou Dobbs as anchor, expanded to a full hour from a half-hour last June, its Nielsen ratings have increased 20 percent, to an average of 420,000 households daily.
And CNBC, the business-news cable channel owned by NBC and operated with Dow Jones, has seen its average Nielsen ratings swell to 80 percent higher this fall than at the same time last year.
CNBC has been adding layman-friendly features like a "ticker guide" explaining how to read the stock-market ticker and primers on understanding mutual funds; the network is also preparing a glossary of financial terms for its Web site.
"The simple reason is that people are now managing their retirement funds through what's called a 401(k) plan," said Bill Bolster, president of CNBC. "So people at the $75,000 income or asset level get involved, and are interested in various company's profits."
Mr. Dobbs of "Moneyline" also points out that the most important news stories today are often about economics. "Most engagements globally now are economic rather than political or military," he said. "Economics is not just a market story; it's a social story."
As the market falls, business-news viewership rises: CNBC hit its highest level ever on Aug. 31, the day the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 512 points. That day one million households tuned in to CNBC's "Market Wrap," a number that does not include out-of-home viewing in offices, and an average of 440,000 homes tuned in between 5 A.M. and 7:30 P.M.
During market hours, 9:30 A.M. to 4 P.M., CNBC's average in September was 382,000 households, an increase of almost 100 percent from September 1997. For CNNfn, the going is tougher because it reaches only 10 million homes, while CNN is in more than 75 million homes and CNBC in more than 65 million.
"Once, we could neatly define stories as consumer or business, finance or market," said Mr. Dobbs, who is also president of CNNfn. "They are inextricably entwined now -- in reality and also in the understanding of most viewers or readers." LAWRIE MIFFLIN

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Deficit Feels Effect Of Global Financial Turmoil

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
The Commerce Department provided a concrete measure today of the effects of the global downturn on the American economy, reporting that the nation's trade deficit widened by $2.2 billion in August to $16.77 billion.
That is the widest gap since the Government recalculated the way it measures trade flows in 1992. It resulted from a decline in American exports and a sharp increase in what this country buys from abroad. 
 So far in 1998, the trade deficit is running at an annual rate roughly 50 percent above last year's level of $109.9 billion, and is projected to reach $170 billion for the year. That gap is expected to widen further next year. One senior Administration official who deals in economic issues, speaking on condition of anonymity, said today that internal projections suggest the trade deficit in 1999 could reach $300 billion, a figure that he said "will certainly cut into growth, and could well become a major political problem."
Trade deficits carry with them both good and troubling signals about the economy. The current flood of imports is helping contain inflation to some of the lowest levels seen in decades. And while sales of American aircraft, computer chips and other goods are suffering, the weakening of the dollar on world markets in recent weeks may provide an end-of-year lift for American exporters.
But at this moment of global upheaval, the biggest problem facing American companies is the inability of many nations and some large companies in Asia and Latin America simply to borrow money to make ordinary purchases. The result is such a freeze on economic activity that empty shipping containers are stacking up on American piers. And the effects are hurting everyone from Midwestern farmers who can no longer send wheat to an impoverished Russia, to East Coast fishermen who are finding that Japan's appetite for salmon and lobster has been ruined by the banking crisis.
Among the most surprising elements of today's report is that more than a third of August's deficit was with one country that so far has managed to ward off the worst effects of the global troubles: China.
Despite continued growth of the Chinese economy, exports to China have sharply slowed and imports of Chinese-made goods have exploded, as the country desperately seeks to sell here goods that would ordinarily be sold elsewhere in Asia. That increased the monthly deficit with Beijing to $5.9 billion, levels previously only seen in trade with Japan.
In recent weeks the Chinese have signaled that -- besieged by floods, deeply troubled state-owned industries and an incipient banking crisis -- they have little interest in any swift moves to open their markets further in return for entry into the World Trade Organization.
That amounts to a major setback for President Clinton, who for three years has been using the negotiations over China's entry to the world body as the centerpiece of his effort to open China both economically and politically. Ostensible progress in this area has been cited by the Administration until recently as one of the successes of its China policy, but now officials say privately that the progress is evaporating.
The decline in exports will trim the growth of the American economy, and it was one factor in the Federal Reserve's decision to lower short-term interest rates twice in recent weeks. So Administration officials were going out of their way today to portray the numbers as another warning sign, but not a crisis.
"While the United States remains strong and sound, the troubled condition of the global marketplace continue to strongly influence the U.S. trade balance," William Daley, the Commerce Secretary, said in a statement today.
After the troubles with Beijing, the biggest deterioration in the American trade balance in August came in Mexico, where the peso has weakened markedly as the economic contagion has spread through Latin America. Exports to Mexico have remained unchanged. But imports from Mexico have increased markedly -- chiefly automobiles and automotive parts and telecommunications equipment -- as American manufacturers have taken advantage of the weakening currency.
In contrast, America's trade surplus with Brazil, the latest focus of concern by the Administration and the International Monetary Fund, barely budged from the same period a year ago. Normally, that would be cited as a sign of continued demand for American products in Latin America's largest economy, but there is fear it might be imperiled.
The news comes as the United States and the I.M.F. complete a bailout package of $30 billion or more for Brazil, intended to help it stave off the kind of economic troubles that have swept through Asia, Russia and several other nations. Today the I.M.F. and Brazil reached agreement on the country's fiscal targets for this year and next, a sign that the aid will probably be announced after elections in Brazil this weekend.
For all these potential problems, the rising trade deficit has barely caused a ripple on Capitol Hill. Because the rising level of imports does not appear to be setting off any unemployment here, the subject has barely come up in Congressional races around the country.
The only exceptions have been in regions where the steel industry is strong. Steel companies have charged in recent weeks that Asian nations are dumping products on the American market at prices well below their costs. The Commerce Department has begun an inquiry.
The Commerce Department's numbers showed that the deficit rose 15.3 percent, to $16.77 billion in August, up from a revised figure of $14.55 billion in July. The department said that the resumption of production at the General Motors Corporation after last summer's strike may have increased the size of the deficit's rise in August, as G.M. brought in parts from abroad.
The Commerce Department said that exports fell three tenths of 1 percent, to about $74.8 billion. Imports rose 2.2 percent, to $91.6 billion.

HEADLINE: Killing Shakes Complacency Of the Gay Rights Movement

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
For some of the younger marchers, the demonstration Monday night that paralyzed parts of midtown Manhattan was their first political rally. For some older protesters, though, the march -- to express outrage over the killing of a gay college student in Wyoming -- was a return to the angry street protests that had so often symbolized the militancy of the gay rights movement.
As the chaotic denouement of the march and the police response was debated yesterday, one thing seemed clear: the size of the loosely organized protest showed how the killing of Matthew Shepard has galvanized gay men and lesbians in New York and around the country as has no other single event in recent years. 
 The demonstration began at 6 P.M. as a rally in front of the Plaza on 59th Street near Central Park, then swelled to 5,000 people on Fifth Avenue, blocking traffic. Confrontations with police officers resulted in about 110 arrests. Page B5.
While the size of the protest in midtown surprised even its organizers, the evocation of anger and sadness on the streets of New York was not unique. Candlelight vigils have been held across the country, from Washington to Grand Junction, Colo., Raleigh, N.C., and Lubbock, Tex. In San Francisco, the giant rainbow flag in the Castro district that symbolizes the gay rights movement was lowered to half staff. The Internet has been filled with discussion of the crime. Last night, 1,000 people attended an hourlong prayer service for Mr. Shepard at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan.
The cause of the passion, participants say, is a sense that even as gay people have become more accepted than ever, there are reminders of the hatred and violence of the not-so-distant past. Well before Mr. Shepard's killing, an increase in police reports of anti-gay crimes in New York City had unsettled gay people, shaking them out of complacency in the years since the height of AIDS activism.
Recent protests over issues like benefits for domestic partners and the right to march in the St. Patrick's Day Parade have lacked the drama of the guerrilla street tactics of AIDS activists. Some gay men and lesbians contend that their success in drawing attention to AIDS gave some a false feeling of acceptance, especially in the city with the largest gay population in the country.
"There was a sense, I think, in the gay community, particularly living in a certain segment of it in New York City, that we can live in a kind of bubble and feel relatively safe and feel as if we've arrived," said Tim Allis, 37, a magazine editor. "A sense that gay rights are there, that we are so much a part of the mainstream in so many ways, so visible, with so many role models on television. It's a bit of an illusion."
Thomas Ruble, 45, had been to two gay pride rallies and parades, but never to a large protest march until Monday night. "Sometimes, in our little gay lives in the middle of America, I think we have forgotten that they kill us," he said. "They hate us."
In more than 20 interviews with gay men and lesbians in the past week, many people said that the killing of Matthew Shepard had struck a strong emotional chord. Some cited his clean-cut image. Others spoke of the brutality of the crime, in which he was left, severely beaten, lashed to a fence in near-freezing temperatures to die.
Jay Blotcher, who was a spokesman for Queer Nation, a street protest group, in the early 1990's, said that in recent years, his group and other militant organizations had run out of steam and were failing to attract young members.
"We were looking to younger people to pick up the mantle and it wasn't really happening," he said. "I attributed that to that fact that a new generation came of age and said: 'I don't have to be a gay activist, I'm just a gay person. It doesn't have to be an issue.' "
"I think something like this reminds us that it still is an issue," he added. "There were lots of young people at the rally on Fifth Avenue. And there were people I know there who had hung up their activist mantles and gone into semiretirements."
In New York City, there were 82 anti-gay bias crimes reported this year through Oct. 4, compared with 46 during the same period last year, representing a 78 percent jump, said Deputy Inspector Barbara A. Sicilia, the commander of the Bias Unit. Overall bias crimes rose by 2 percent, to 384 from 374.
Although the most incidents were reported in lower Manhattan, where they usually occur, more incidents were also reported in Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island.
In the latest attack, two men shouted anti-gay remarks at a 31-year-old man on the streets of the Dyker Heights section of Brooklyn yesterday evening, then hit him in the head with an unspecified object, the police said. The man was not seriously injured.
Carl Locke, the director of client services at the Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project, a nonprofit organization that helps victims of bias crimes, said the spread of bias crimes across the city shows the extent to which gay people are becoming more visible outside their usual neighborhoods, Greenwich Village and Chelsea in Manhattan and Park Slope in Brooklyn.
"Most gay-related crimes have people come to your neighborhood and seek you out to hurt you," he said. "Now people don't have to come downtown. As we are more visible outside of Manhattan, we have also seen an increase in crimes in those neighborhoods."
While many activists believe that anti-gay crimes are on the rise across the country, statistics are difficult to come by. The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Projects, which collects data from 14 organizations across the country, reported that violent crimes against gay people rose 2 percent, to 2,445 incidents, in 1997, the last year for which statistics are available. In 1996, the report said, anti-gay crimes rose by 6 percent.
But those figures reflect incidents labeled bias crimes by local organizations, which often use different standards than the police when determining motivation.
Jack Levin, a professor of sociology and criminology at Northeastern University and an author of "Hate Crimes: The Rising Tide of Bigotry and Bloodshed" (Plenum Press, 1993), said it was not unusual for anti-gay crimes to buck the trends of other bias crimes.
"Most hate crimes respond to economic factors like the unemployment rate, but not gay-bashing," he said. "Gay-bashing has nothing to do with money, with economic survival. That's why so many perpetrators are teen-agers and come from every point among the economic continuum. It is typically done by young people, with their hormones raging, feeling confusion about sexual identity. Young guys in denial about their own homosexual feelings who see the very presence of a gay person as a threat."
Nineteen states, including New York, do not have legislation that specifically prohibits anti-gay hate crimes. In these states, someone who assaults a gay man or a lesbian can be convicted of assault, but not a bias-related assault. New York does have a law, aggravated harassment in the first degree, that outlaws harassing people because of "the race, color, religion or national origin of such person," but it makes no reference to sexual orientation.
The Democratic-controlled State Assembly has repeatedly passed bills that would outlaw anti-gay crimes, but the Republican-controlled State Senate has failed to act on them. This year, Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, renewed his call to pass the bill, saying that "passing the bias-crime legislation, including a provision protecting those who would be discriminated against based on sexual orientation, is very important."
Mr. Allis, the magazine editor, said that Mr. Shepard's killing put recent history into a new light.
"There was that sense of connecting the dots," he said. "Between the well-publicized murders, the less-publicized hate crimes that we hear about across the country, Trent Lott's words calling homosexuality a disease, and small acts of intolerance, there were all sorts of indications. But the murder of Matthew Shepard brought the picture into relief."

HEADLINE: Microsoft Says Antitrust Case Is 'Fantastical'

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR and JOEL BRINKLEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Stinging from the Government's opening statement, a defiant Microsoft Corporation forcefully defended its chairman, William H. Gates, in Federal court today, asserting that the no-holds-barred tactics of his company are not only common in the computer industry but also good for the economy.
Microsoft's opening salvo in the sweeping antitrust suit seemed to be devised as much for public opinion as for the court. The company faces weeks of being portrayed as a predator in a highly publicized trial, which could badly tarnish Microsoft's reputation even if it wins. 
 The Government's case, which opened on Monday in Federal District Court here, amounts to a litany of episodes of Microsoft's having used its market power to bully and bend competitors, business partners and corporate customers to its will.
Today, Microsoft's legal team sought to frame these episodes as part of rough-and-tumble capitalism. While the way Microsoft does business may not be to everyone's liking, they suggested, it is not illegal. "The antitrust laws are not a code of civility in business," said John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer.
The second day of the trial came as Microsoft reported a 58 percent gain in quarterly earnings, demonstrating once again its power in the personal computer software industry. Page C1.
In his two-hour opening statement, Mr. Warden angrily accused the Government of trying to "demonize Bill Gates," whom he described as "a man whose vision and innovation have been at the core of the benefits that society is reaping from the information age."
The Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft, Mr. Warden said, are misinterpretting routine business meetings in the computer industry as anti-competitive conspiracies. The Government's case focuses largely on the Internet software market and the business practices Microsoft used in its fight against the Netscape Communciations Corporation, the early leader in the browser software used to navigate the World Wide Web.
A key charge in the suit, for example, is that Microsoft prodded Netscape to illegally divvy up the browser market in a June 1995 meeting -- a charge based mainly on the accounts of Netscape executives.
"Netscape's account of this meeting was fantastical," Mr. Warden said. "None of the histrionics, shouting and table pounding occurred. It's fantasy."
In Microsoft's view, the Government's case is wrongheaded because it does not understand the computer industry, especially the necessity of cooperation among companies so that sophisticated technology products work with each other. Just as the line between one software product and another is often blurred, the company argues, so is the line between competition and cooperation; rivals in one area routinely cooperate in another.
Microsoft will try to cast doubt on several of the Government's accusations by characterizing meetings as efforts at cooperation by companies that, understandably, do not always agree.
The Government, for example, has accused Microsoft of trying to put pressure on both the Intel Corporation and Apple Computer Inc. to back off Internet software efforts that conflicted with Microsoft's plans -- and to support Microsoft in the browser war.
"Those proposals and threats claimed by the Government," Mr. Warden said, "will be shown by evidence to have been garden-variety commercial discussions between companies developing complementary products. They are of no antitrust consequence."
As the defendant, Microsoft does not have to prove that it behaved innocently or even ethically. Instead, the role of Microsoft's legal team is to cast considerable doubt on the Government's case -- both its specific accusations of bullying tactics and its broad theme that the economy and consumers are ultimately harmed by Microsoft's behavior.
In the afternoon court session, the Microsoft defense moved to the cross-examination of the Government's lead-off witness, James Barksdale, the president and chief executive of Netscape. To speed up the trial, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has ordered that direct testimony from witnesses for both sides must be submitted in writing beforehand. So all the courtroom questioning of witnesses begins with cross-examination.
With Mr. Barksdale on the stand, Microsoft's legal tactics soon became apparent. Mr. Warden, 57, a heavyset man and a detailed, methodical interrogator, sought to portray Netscape as a Microsoft rival that went running to the Justice Department as a business tactic.
His questions also tried to lead Mr. Barksdale into acknowledging that all software makers are constantly adding features to their products and that many companies enjoy large shares of their markets without being branded as monopolists. Both are central themes of Microsoft's defense.
A lean, craggy 55-year-old who speaks with the accent of his native Louisiana, Mr. Barksdale proved an elusive and often entertaining witness. Mr. Warden asked him about the early years of his career when he was a salesman for the International Business Machines Corporation from 1965 to 1972 -- years when I.B.M. faced the kind of antitrust scrutiny Microsoft faces today.
Mr. Warden asked Mr. Barksdale if he had believed at the time that the then-dominant I.B.M. was a monopolist.
"I don't know if I believed it," Mr. Barksdale replied, "but we were trained to behave as if we were a monopoly because we were operating under a consent decree," as Microsoft is today.
Mr. Warden then asked Mr. Barksdale if he did not believe that the dominant computer product of that day -- the I.B.M. mainframe -- was not a so-called bundled product as hardware and software that customers had to buy together.
The question relates to the current case because the Government contends that Microsoft's Windows operating system and its Internet Explorer browser are in fact two products bundled together for the purpose of forcing customers who want its industry-standard operating system to also take its browser. Microsoft says the browser is a feature of Windows, and thus that browser and operating system are a single product.
To the mainframe question, Mr. Barksdale replied that I.B.M. mainframe hardware and software had once been sold as a bundle but that a 1968 consent decree forced I.B.M. to sell them separately -- a solution very similar to the unbundling remedy the Government is seeking in the current case.
"That forced unbundling gave rise to a whole new industry of hardware companies like Amdahl that made mainframe machines that run I.B.M. mainframe software," Mr. Barksdale said.
To try to show that Netscape viewed a Government suit as a competitive tactic, Mr. Warden repeatedly questioned Mr. Barksdale about his meetings with Justice Department officials.
Mr. Warden produced a document for presentation at a Netscape strategy meeting, titled "Project Rocket Launch Plan." At the meeting, held early this year, one of four items under the heading "The Situation" was "DOJ and court actions create opportunity for Netscape." Mr. Warden then asked Mr. Barksdale whether he viewed a Justice Department suit as a "key" opportunity for his company. Not a key one perhaps, Mr. Barksdale replied, but he did view a Government antitrust suit against Microsoft as "a way of protecting an opportunity to keep the playing field open for Internet software."

HEADLINE: It's a Car-Eat-Car Would Out There

BYLINE: By JAMES G. COBB

 BODY:
CONSOLIDATION and globalization have made giant auto companies even bigger, putting small car makers like Saab, Mazda and Jaguar under the wing of Detroit's Big Three. And the Big Three will soon be the Big Two, as Daimler-Benz of Germany wraps up its merger with - essentially a takeover of - the Chrysler Corporation. The resulting company, DaimlerChrysler, will be in Stuttgart, Germany, and Auburn Hills, Mich. An American, Robert J. Eaton, will remain co-chairman for three years, but it will hardly be an American enterprise any more.
 
 There will be more of these combinations because of theindustry's vast inefficiencies. The world's auto makers are working at only two-thirds of their production capacity and most are unprofitable. Yet many continue to build plants around the world as they try to gain a competitive edge in one market or another.
Consolidation has erased national boundaries and wounded national pride. Britain, which left an indelible mark on the science of car design and the art of stylish motoring, has pretty much given up its industry, with only tiny specialty shops like Caterham, Morgan and TVR remaining under British ownership. Foreigners now control Rover, Jaguar, Aston Martin - even Rolls-Royce and Bentley, the ultimate upper-crust status symbols. Still, the look and feel of these renowned automobiles remains quintessentially English, down to their supple leather seats and polished wooden dashboards, and they are still built by British workers, although to higher quality standards than in the past.
 Envious of Japan's success, other Asian countries like Malaysia and South Korea set out to build up their auto industries. The money they borrowed and the resources they expended contributed to the region's deep financial crisis. The third-largest Korean car maker, Kia, is bankrup tand so far in debt that other companies have been reluctant to bid for it. A domestic recession has several Japanese tuto companies reeling, including No. 2 Nissan, which is rumored to be fair game for a takeover, perhaps even by Daimler Chrysler.
 Even as they feel new pressure from the giants, a few independents soldier on. In Sweden, Volvo, which backed our of a merger with Renault in 1994, has indicated that it would entertain offers. But BMW of Germany is intent on going it alone, and has gone on a buying spree, picking up Rover's various brands and future rights to Rolls-Royce. Volkswagen has transformed itself into a smaller-scale General Motors, building a portfolio of a half-dozen companies across Europe, including storied names like Bugatti and Lamborhini. Fiat controls Afla Romeo, Ferrari and Maserati, three lengendary sports car brands.
 Here are a few of the big players among the world's three dozen mass-production auto companies, the names under which they sell cars and the other auto makers in which they hold ownership stakes. Figures are for worldwide sales in 1997.

HEADLINE: McCarthy and the Left

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In an attempt to justify his support for a positive reassessment of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, Ronald Radosh, a senior research associate at George Washington University, says: "I deal with issues of historical truth. The left's inability to accept the truth is what discredits the left" (Week in Review, Oct. 20). 
 Mr. Radosh's assertion that the debacle of the American Communist Party has discredited the entire Socialist movement is indefensible.
The false premise that underlies this claim is that there existed no left-wing Socialist opposition to Stalinism. In fact, before the cold war, anti-Stalinism was associated principally with the Socialist left -- above all with Trotskyists. Long before anti-Stalinism became fashionable among liberals, who had previously embraced "popular front" alliances with the Communist Party, left-wing anti-Stalinists had insisted that the Kremlin's policies had nothing in common with Marxism or with the Socialist program. In the present climate of deepening economic crisis, it is the political heritage of these left-wing anti-Stalinists, not Senator McCarthy, that deserves the most thoughtful reconsideration.
