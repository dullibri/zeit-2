HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
In the 'I Love New York' campaign, a new kind of Broadway revival.

BYLINE: By Glenn Collins 

 BODY:
NEW YORK STATE [loves] Broadway. Again.
For the first time in more than a decade, the state's tourism promotion, "I Love New York," with its high-recognition "I[love]NY" icon, will focus on Broadway theater as a tourist asset in a $1 million television and radio campaign that begins tomorrow. 
 Today, at a promotional extravaganza in Manhattan's Shubert Theater to be attended by Gov. George E. Pataki and his wife, Libby, the state will introduce the commercial, which depicts the bustle and anticipation at curtain time from the standpoint of a theatergoer.
The original campaign, started in 1977 by what is now Wells Rich Greene BDDP in New York, made heavy use of Broadway stars and shows, including the chorus kids from "A Chorus Line" and Broadway's Dracula, Frank Langella, who purred that he loved New York "especially in the evening."
" 'I Love New York' invented state tourism advertising, and was tremendously influential," said John Farr, a partner at Ogilvy & Mather New York, the unit of the WPP Group that won the account in February. Wells Rich, now a unit of BDDP Worldwide, handled "I Love New York" until 1991; then it went to McCann-Erickson New York, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, until 1994.
The four-note 'I Love New York' musical refrain is back, but no stars appear in the new commercial, though Matthew Broderick narrates. The marquees of a few shows are visible in atmospheric shots of the Great White Way.
The Broadway component of "I Love New York" was de-emphasized in the 1980's because of budget constraints and complaints by upstaters that New York's other tourist attractions were being slighted.
But New York City tourism officials countered that the campaign had taken on too much of an upstate emphasis. According to the New York City Convention and Visitors Bureau, the city generates $14 billion of the state's annual $25.6 billion in tourism revenue.
A study last year by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey found that Broadway theater contributed $2.3 billion a year to the economy of New York, and generated $142 million annually in taxes.
The new commercial, which cost $400,000 to produce, is the sixth in a series of "I Love New York" ads since June; others were set in locales like Lake George, Cooperstown and West Point, as well as New York City. "We wanted to relaunch 'I Love New York' in a personal way that would speak directly to vacationers," Mr. Farr said.
He said the advertising buy for the summer campaign, which ran from June to July 23, was $3.2 million for television and radio, in local markets as well as in Philadelphia, Washington, Pittsburgh and Cleveland. The new four-week buy for the Broadway campaign will cost $1 million in the same markets, he said.
"There is no state in America that doesn't have a lake or a mountain or a museum, but no other state has Broadway," said Nancy Coyne, chief executive of Serino Coyne Inc., the advertising agency that represents more than a dozen Broadway shows. She worked on the new commercial as a liaison between Ogilvy & Mather New York and Broadway theater executives.
"Rule 1 of advertising is to sell what is unique about your product, and what is unique about New York is Broadway," she added.
Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, said that according to the State Department of Commerce, "the original 'I Love New York' commercials featuring the Broadway theater earned $22 for every dollar invested."
"We certainly hope that the new investment will be at least as profitable for the state, the city and the theater as the first one was," he added.
The new Broadway campaign "represents a huge commitment on the part of the state," said Charles A. Gargano, Commissioner of the New York State Department of Economic Development, adding that state officials "felt it was a good investment to showcase Broadway again."
Jed Bernstein, the new executive director of the League of American Theaters and Producers, the Broadway trade organization, said the league, with the Theater Development Fund, which operates the TKTS booths for discount-priced theater tickets, had contributed $280,000 toward the making of the commercial. The other $120,000 came from Mr. Gargano's department. " 'I Love New York' has come back to Broadway and we couldn't be more thrilled," Mr. Bernstein said.
As an advertising executive at Wells Rich, Mr. Bernstein pitched its "I Love New York" presentation to New York State last winter. He lost to Ogilvy.
"I think we can work pretty effectively, though," Mr. Bernstein said with a laugh, "since I worked for O & M for 10 years," from 1979 to 1989.
The new commercial offers a toll-free telephone number (800 I-LOVE-NY, what else?) as a tie-in with the theater league's "Destination Broadway" tourism-cum-marketing initiative with Delta Air Lines. It offers trips to Manhattan, including guaranteed premium tickets to Broadway shows.
Because two-thirds of the tourism dollars spent in New York come from within the state and from visitors from New Jersey and Connecticut, the new commercial will also be aimed at the metropolitan market.
"That's all right, we get lots of tourists from New York," said Linda Mysliwy Conlin, director of the New Jersey Division of Travel and Tourism. "Broadway is special, but they don't have our Paper Mill Playhouse."

Long-Term Treasuries Rise Despite Gains in Housing

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities gained for the first time in three sessions yesterday, despite an increase in housing starts. Talk of a Japanese economic-stimulus package helped the dollar overnight and, in turn, lifted bonds at the opening.
Investor demand for corporate and global issues also worked favorably for bonds. Also helping the market was the expectation among some participants of more foreign buyers. 
 August housing starts rose six-tenths of 1 percent, to a rate of 1.398 million units annually. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg Business News had expected starts to slip 1.4 percent, to an annual rate of 1.36 million units after surging by 7.1 percent in July, revised upward from 6.7 percent.
The 30-year bond rose 21/32, to a price of 105 5/32 to yield 6.48 percent, down from 6.53 percent on Monday.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, said the bond market improved yesterday on the heels of Monday's losses, virtually ignoring the slight increase in August housing starts.
"Housing will most certainly contribute to an improved rate of gross domestic product growth in the third quarter," he said, "as compared to the second quarter, but at the same time it should also be noted that the August level of starts is still nearly 4.5 percent below a year ago."
Mr. Fine added that "Although bond yields for nearly three weeks have gyrated upon the release of virtually every important economic statistic," movements in the Treasury's current 30-year issue have revolved "around a yield of 6.50 percent for this entire period."
Many traders said the market's focus was mainly on the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, who is scheduled to testify on Friday before the Senate Banking Committee. The central bank's monetary policy arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, will meet on Tuesday.
"If Mr. Greenspan follows form, he will cleverly veil F.O.M.C. thinking and intentions in a barrage of econo-babble," Mr. Fine said. "My own thinking, of course, is that the F.O.M.C. will choose to leave policy unchanged at its Sept. 26 meeting, and very likely ease by a quarter of a point at the Nov. 15 meeting once data are available for at least part of the fourth quarter showing continued benign inflation with only moderate economic growth."
Another factor in yesterday's rise in prices, James Hale, a fixed- income analyst with MMS International in San Francisco, said, was the Japanese economic-stimulus plan.
"The fiscal-stimulus package of over 14 trillion yen bode well for U.S. fixed-income markets, at least in the short and intermediate term," Mr. Hale said. "The aggressive package should temper some anxiety about Japan's banking system woes, and more importantly for Treasuries, it will help sustain the recently favorable capital flows out of Japan."
Until recently, Mr. Hale said, "Japanese institutions were handcuffed by massive losses in domestic assets, even forced to repatriate overseas investments like U.S. Treasury securities to cover these losses."
"But with the Nikkei and dollar both rebounding now and the threat of a banking crisis easing a bit," he added, "Japanese investors should be able to sustain the pace of recent Treasury purchases."
In the corporate bond market, where people are yield-hungry, investors snapped up bonds issued by Dresdner Bank New York, a subsidiary of the big German bank Dresdner Bank A.G. The offering, through underwriters led by J. P. Morgan Securities, was increased by 25 percent, to $1 billion.
Investors are eager for dollar-denominated bonds of Dresdner and other foreign issuers because they typically offer higher yields than United States corporate issuers with similarly rated debt. This compensates buyers for a number of risk factors, from political instability or currency risks to solvency of the issuer or just lack of familiarity with the issuer.
Dresdner sold $500 million of 10-year notes at 53 basis points more than a similar-maturity Treasury issue, or about 10 basis points more than investors can get from the same double-A rated bonds from American companies, according to Bloomberg Analytics. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
For $500 million of 20-year notes, the German bank offered a yield of 64 basis points more than comparable Treasury securities.

Helpless Cuban Wives, Marooned by U.S. Policy

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: REGLA, Cuba

 BODY:
In a dark, Spartan room that resembles more a jail cell than a living room, Sonia Fonseca brought out a stack of 53 letters from a husband in a prison of his own.
"You suffer but I suffer twice as much because my hands are tied," he wrote. "We must continue resisting so that we can fulfill our dreams." 
 Her husband, Tomas Espiau, 45, is among the 10,000 or so Cuban detainees who remain at the United States naval base at Guantanamo Bay, 500 miles away on the eastern end of the island, more than a year after they set out in boats and rafts for Florida.
Held in refugee camps after more than 30,000 Cubans sought entry into the United States last summer by taking to the seas, the detainees are being released gradually. Mr. Espiau is scheduled to reach American soil before March, when the camps are expected to close.
But if the wait has been difficult for Mr. Espiau, it is hardly bearable for his wife, one of scores of Cuban women who counted on the financial help of husbands and boyfriends who were expected to reach the United States but who ended up in worse misery because of the men's long detention at Guantanamo. Many said they encouraged the men to leave for the benefit of their families, only to be left to fend for themselves in times of increasing hardship.
Mr. Espiau, who like many of the detainees was searching for a job and the ability to send money, left a 6-year-old daughter, who started school in September short of underwear, and a 14-year-old stepson with one pair of socks. His wife, 43, spends her days cooking for neighbors, selling homemade sweets, washing the family's meager supply of clothes almost daily for wear the next day and exchanging frustrations with her husband by mail.
"He knows it's not easy," she said, in a phrase echoed everywhere these days during Cuba's "special period," the years of economic crisis brought on by the collapse of trade and aid from the Soviet bloc.
Similar stories are heard everywhere in Regla, a town by Havana Bay where neighbors vividly remember the frenzy at the height of the exodus in August and September 1994, when crowds hoisted rafts, Regla ferries were hijacked and relatives swamped the Nuestra Senora de Regla Church, checking the migrants' fate on posted lists.
When it was over, neighbors said, the town seemed robbed of its youth.
From Ms. Fonseca's block, 15 left. Many women had to seek jobs for the first time, including Sara Lemus, whose husband, an electrician, is still on the base. Left with a son, 7, she recently found work as a receptionist. But like most Cubans, she complained about being paid in pesos while increasingly only dollars buy clothes, meat and other essentials.
Like many other women, she had counted on dollar remittances from the United States. Although banned by American restrictions on aid to Cuba, millions of dollars get to the island from relatives through third countries, American and Cuban officials say.
Her sister next door, Rosa, 32, was luckier. Her husband was allowed to leave Guantanamo for the United States three months ago and has already sent $50 after finding work in a Tampa bodega. Rosa Lemus, who has a son, 11, and a daughter, 7, said she bought shoes for her children, soap, cooking oil, rice and meat.
The sisters say they live for the day their when husbands pluck them out of Cuba after they gain their own legal residency, a sponsorship process that can take four to five years. "The situation has gotten worse and worse," Sara said.
Not all the women wait. Limay Galvez, 20, said she resented that her husband, 22, left abruptly, not promising a future together. But he had a change of heart in Guantanamo, she said, and the love letters began.
"He said he missed me, that he was going to send for me," she said.
Unmoved, Ms. Galvez told her father-in-law that she was breaking off the year-old marriage and moved back with her family. She is now dating her neighbor, who was her first boyfriend.
More than 32,000 Cubans were held in refugee camps in Guantanamo and Panama before the Clinton Administration selectively began allowing them into the country, starting with the old, the sick and families with children. In May, officials announced that all who remained in Guantanamo would be released but that for the first time Cubans picked up at sea would be turned back.
More than 100 boat people have since been returned, Coast Guard officials said.
Under migration accords reached by Cuban and American officials last year, Cubans must now apply to the United States Interests Section in Havana for one of 20,000 visas given annually. The agreements for the first time allowed those with no sponsoring relatives or political reasons a chance to gain entry.
Sonia Fonseca's hope is her husband of eight years, who she said had spent three years in prison for previous escape attempts.
From Guantanamo, Mr. Espiau sends pictures of the tent he shares with other refugees and of his more robust self. In the first two months at the camp, he gained 25 pounds.
In Regla, Ms. Fonseca waits in a shack in a narrow alley, with bare floors and one window. Already thin, she sometimes goes to bed hungry.
Her husband has told her he will be out in November. "If I've resisted one year," she said, "a few more months are nothing."

HEADLINE: Giuliani, at U.N. Opening Ceremony, Assails New Isolationist Mood in Congress

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Sept. 19

 BODY:
In a strongly-worded attack on the isolationist mood swelling in a Congress dominated by his fellow Republicans, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani helped kick off the 50th session of the United Nations General Assembly today, criticizing the "potent strain of isolationism that once again is infecting our political discourse."
The Mayor did not mention the Republican Party by name and said in an interview later that he was not singling out his party or fellow politicians. Still, his defense of the United Nations' achievements and of immigrants' contribution to the nation marked the latest in a series of attempts by Mr. Giuliani to set himself apart from the newly dominant conservative wing of the Republican majority. Many of those Republicans want to end or cut back financing to the U.N. and favor severe immigration restrictions. 
 "Sometimes, leadership means taking unpopular positions, rejecting harmful political fads," Mr. Giuliani said today. "Sometimes, leadership requires challenging myths. That's the kind of leadership we need in defining our relationship with the U.N. and also on the issue of immigration."
Mayor Giuliani's speech echoed his criticism last month of immigration restrictions proposed by a panel named by the Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, which recommended cracking down on benefits for illegal aliens. At the time, Mr. Giuliani said such restrictions not only violated basic decency but could also have "catastrophic social effects" on New York and other large cities.
Today's speech marked the first such appearance by a mayor of New York City in nearly half a century. The last mayor to address the General Assembly was William O'Dwyer, who welcomed the delegates at their temporary quarters in Flushing Meadows Park in 1947.
Mr. Giuliani spoke to delegates from 185 member states who convened in the General Assembly chamber for the opening of three months of speeches and debate.
While the United Nations invited Mr. Giuliani to attend the Assembly's opening session, the United States representative, Madeleine K. Albright, gave her spot on the list of speakers to the Mayor.
The Mayor's kind words about the United Nations came at a time when it is beset by an array of problems, ranging from a rocky peacekeeping mission in the Balkans to a financial crisis caused by the failure of member states like the United States to pay their full assessments.
"The U.N. provides a crucial forum for international debate and cooperation," the Mayor said.
Mayor Giuliani described the drive on Capitol Hill to cut back support and funds for the United Nations as "an ill-conceived proposition that would achieve only symbolic savings in the Federal budget, while greatly impeding the operations of the United Nations and hurting the economy of the United Nations' host country, the United States," as well as that of New York City.
The case he made for immigration was even more spirited. "You can't be a New Yorker -- you can't be part of this city -- and deny the contributions of immigrants," said Mr. Giuliani, whose grandparents immigrated from Italy.
"Our nation owes its existence to the hard work, determination and vision of immigrants," he said, "and in the end I am confident that support for immigration will prevail over this latest advent of suspicion."
The Mayor hailed New York as "not only the world's most diverse city but also the world's most cosmopolitan and tolerant city."
The Mayor also has an economic incentive to be supportive of the U.N. A recent study for the city's Commission for the United Nations, Consular Corps and International Business found that the United Nations, its agencies and accredited diplomatic missions spend $3.3 billion a year in New York City and create 30,000 local jobs, according to Jane R. Steiner, a deputy commissioner. She said this includes $10 million for parking tickets.
Mr. Giuliani joked that he wanted the delegates to visit every part of the city "and spend money." But he also stressed that New Yorkers welcomed their presence.
"We want to say to all of you that wherever you come from and however long you are here, you are New Yorkers," Mr. Giuliani said.
The General Assembly will open its general debate next Monday and wind up in mid-December. More than 150 foreign leaders are expected to attend a special session commemorating the U.N.'s 50th anniversary, which will take place from Oct. 22 to 24.

HEADLINE: Senator Proposes to Charge Colleges for Student Loans

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 19

 BODY:
Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, chairwoman of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, today called for cutting spending on Federal student loans by $10.1 billion, in large part by adding a 2 percent charge to colleges and universities on all Federal loans their students receive.
Thus New York University, for example, whose students received about $150 million in new student loans in the 1994-95 academic year, would have to pay a charge of about $3 million. 
 The new charge, which angry Democrats labeled a "tax," would raise $4.4 billion of the $10.1 billion the Kansas Republican's committee is required to save over seven years as part of the effort to balance the budget.
The proposal is almost certain to be approved by the committee on Wednesday. But it will be challenged on the Senate floor when it comes up as part of the budget reconciliation bill. Last spring the Senate voted to limit cuts in the loan program to $4.4 billion, but after negotiations with the House, the cut on the program of $25 billion a year was raised to $10.1 billion.
Ed Elmendorf, vice president for government relations of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, described the proposal as "stupid," and likely to be favored only by the student loan industry as a way of avoiding higher charges to banks and other lenders.
Senator Kassebaum said she had received complaints from colleges and universities in her state, but insisted that she had no alternative way to raise the money required by the budget resolution.
Her bill would forbid colleges and universities to raise tuition or fees to pay for the new charge. But Terry Hartle, vice president of governmental relations of the American Council on Education, said the requirement was an effort to "repeal the laws of economics." He said students would pay directly or indirectly, or else colleges would reduce other forms of financial aid.
The other plans to save on loans in Senator Kassebaum's proposal are these:
*Decreasing to four months from six months in the interest-free grace period students enjoy after graduation, saving $850 million.
*Increasing the interest rate on loans taken out by parents by nine-tenths of 1 percent, saving $1.4 billion.
*Reducing Federal payments to lenders and guarantee agencies, saving $2.3 billion, or about 7 percent of the $30 billion in projected Federal spending for the industry's expenses and profits.
*Reducing Federal spending to supervise student loans, saving $700 million.
*Halting the growth of the direct loan program, under which money is lent directly to students by the Federal Government, a new program enacted in 1993 to compete with and perhaps replace the old program under which the Government guaranteed loans made by banks. That change, according to new accounting rules established by Republicans this year, would save $450 million.
The House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities will not meet on this issue until next week. That committee wants to abolish the direct loans outright.
The opportunities for the committees are rather limited. An earlier scheme of reducing or eliminating the interest subsidies and raising other direct charges to students stirred complaints over the summer. This proposal from Senator Kassebaum has come forward with much less time for debate.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the senior Democrat on the committee, denounced the Kassebaum plan. He called the 2 percent charge a tax, and, alluding to Republican plans to cut taxes as part of this year's budget, said, "The Republican Congress has no business picking the pockets of students and working families to pay for tax cuts for the rich."
Opponents plan to propose an amendment on the Senate floor, calling for a much smaller cut and identifying some business tax benefit that could be eliminated to save the same amount of money. That was the approach the Senate adopted, 67 to 32, when it passed a proposal by Senators Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, and Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, on May 25.
But it may be more difficult to get time to debate the proposal when the reconciliation bills comes to the floor, and so the May vote is not a comfortable predictor of Senate action this time.
Still, the higher education community is cranking up opposition to the proposal.
Robert H. Atwell, president of the American Council on Education, wrote Senator Kassebaum to remind her that the University of Kansas would face a $700,000 charge. And he wrote that it was wrong to penalize colleges for admitting needy students:
"It's hard to imagine the Department of Agriculture imposing a tax on grocery stores based on the number of food stamps the store accepts. That, however, is exactly what your plan would do to colleges."

HEADLINE: Cab Fleet Coalition Seeks Increase of 27% in Fares

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
A coalition of yellow cab fleets petitioned City Hall yesterday for an average 27 percent increase in taxi fares, the first increase in almost six years, and the group's leader said the city should require that some of the increase go to drivers.
Officials in the industry and at the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission, whose approval is needed for any increase, suggested that the success of the proposal could turn on drivers' income, which the commission says has remained almost unchanged for a decade. 
 Last year, the commission rejected a proposed fare increase, concluding that owners were exploiting drivers and would hoard the profits from any increase. The new commission chairman, Christopher Lynn, has set a goal of increasing drivers' income by $20 a day.
Mr. Lynn declined to comment on the proposal directly. But he said, "I would like to see the profession of taxi driver be the serious, esteemed job it used to be, and that's not going to happen on minimum wage."
Under the new proposal, the charge for the first fifth of a mile would rise from $1.50, to $2. For each additional fifth of a mile in free-flowing traffic, the fare would increase from 25 cents, to 30 cents, and for time spent stuck in traffic, the charge would go from 20 cents per minute to 25 cents. Over all, for a typical cab ride of 2.47 miles, the fare would climb from $5.70, to $7.10, a 25 percent increase.
The rise was proposed by the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, a coalition of 22 fleets that accounts for 19 percent of the city's nearly 12,000 medallion cabs. Its latest contract with the Taxi Drivers and Allied Workers Union requires that half the money from a fare increase go to drivers. "The city should require a similar arrangement from the other owners," said the group's president, Ronald Stoppelmann.
Most of the city's cabbies lease taxis from their owners, either for a 12-hour shift or a week. Fares have not risen since January 1990, but industry officials and drivers say cab lease rates have increased to about $85 a shift. Drivers keep all the fares and tips they collect, but because they must pay the lease cost and buy gasoline, they must make more than $100 a day to break even.
Several drivers said the taxi commission should cap lease rates to prevent owners from using an increase in the lease rate to get some of the profits from a fare increase.
Mr. Lynn said he shared that concern and noted that in recent years the mere rumor of a fare increase would push up lease rates.
The taxi commission will hold public hearings and then vote on the proposal, which could go into effect in December at the earliest.
The idea of a fare increase with some protections for drivers was quickly hailed by drivers as a needed boost for an industry that has never regained much of the business it lost as the region's economy slumped in the late 1980's and early 1990's. "We need it, and even with this deal, we still would not get paid adequately for what we have to go through," said Herbert Vartabedian, 54, who has been a cabdriver for 19 years.
Riders were less enthusiastic about the plan, though some said they agreed an increase was called for. "The subway fare's going up and everything else is going up, and it's been a long time since this went up, so I guess it's time," said Anne-Marie Smith, 43, a secretary who stood yesterday on 57th Street in Manhattan, trying to hail a cab.
Jack Carr, 36, an office manager who rode a cab from Wall Street to Times Square, called it "crazy" to increase fares. "It's already way too much," he said.
Yellow cabs are an essential part of the city's transportation network, carrying more than 500,000 people a day, mostly in the lower half of Manhattan and to and from the airports. They are licensed by the city, which has limited their numbers to 11,787 since 1937, though the city plans to sell the rights to 400 more medallions over the next three years.
Without an increase, the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade fleets will not be able to turn a profit next year, Mr. Stoppelmann said. "Since 1990, the single biggest cost, the cost of the vehicle, went out of control," he said. "The most common cab, the Chevy Caprice, went from $12,000, to $18,860, this year."

HEADLINE: Kerkorian's Point Man Has Chrysler Guessing

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 19

 BODY:
Jerome B. York, the new point man in Kirk Kerkorian's effort to coax the Chrysler Corporation's shares higher, met with three Chrysler executives for two hours today. But the meeting, somewhere in Westchester County outside New York, amounted to little more than a ritual, polite dance performed against a backdrop of rising tension between the two skirmishing sides.
"We didn't tell Tracinda anything we didn't tell any of our other large investors," said Arthur C. Liebler, Chrysler's vice president for marketing and communications, referring to Mr. Kerkorian's investment company. "We listened to whatever Mr. York and Tracinda had to say, and didn't hear anything new there either." 
 In fact, what is most interesting about Mr. Kerkorian's new strategy is how little he is publicly proposing, so far. That approach is shaping up to be far more vexing to Chrysler than the failed buyout bid by Mr. Kerkorian last spring.
Mr. York says that increasing the stock price, not running Chrysler, is his goal. He praises Chrysler's products and managers. But Chrysler should be passing more of its cash on to shareholders, he says. His record suggests he would favor a big stock buyback over higher dividends.
But Chrysler insiders believe that Mr. Kerkorian just wants to save face. "This has nothing to do with boosting shareholder value any more," said one Chrysler executive who insisted on anonymity. "It's become an ego thing."
That dismissive attitude aside, Chrysler has seemed off balance since Mr. York's hiring two weeks ago, in a way it never was during the spring and summer.
Wall Street is buzzing with rumors of uncertain origin about Mr. York's real plans -- some of which have grown so pervasive that Chrysler has felt it necessary to respond to them.
One such rumor holds that Mr. York hopes to take the place of Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's chairman and chief executive, while retaining Robert A. Lutz, Chrysler's president, past his mandatory retirement at age 65 in 1997. Chrysler's board is already considering a way to retain Mr. Lutz, who is popular within the company and on Wall Street, Chrysler executives said.
In an interview today, Mr. Lutz anticipated a question and declared: "There is a greater degree of harmony in top management here, including between Bob Eaton and myself -- you know, just to pre-empt the next question -- than I've ever experienced in any company I've ever served in." Asked if he would remain past retirement age, if so requested by the board, Mr. Lutz said today, "sure I would."
Other rumors, seemingly unrelated to Tracinda, have gained credence simply because of the threat from Mr. Kerkorian. Today, Volvo shares climbed in Stockholm and New York on speculation in Europe and the United States that Chrysler was seeking to buy the company, a possibility dismissed by Chrysler executives. Stock analysts said that Volvo would make sense as a purchase only if Chrysler was seeking to use up excess cash to fend off Mr. Kerkorian.
In fact, Mr. Lutz suggested that Chrysler might not keep so much cash on the books, despite its stated goal of setting aside $7.5 billion to tide it over the next sales recession. "It's not like it's excessive," Mr. Lutz said of the automotive cash reserve, which was $6.9 billion at the end of the second quarter. "But will it always be exactly seven? I can't guarantee that."
He said, "It might be possible at some point to find a different mix of elements that gives us the same degree of financial stability."
Mr. Eaton is scheduled to address the Council of Institutional Investors at a meeting in New York in early October. The speech may provide an opportunity for Mr. Eaton to solidify his support among leading investors, but a spokesman said his speech had not been written yet.
In tightly controlled interviews with journalists, Mr. York has so far issued none of the slipshod pronouncements that leaped like popping corn out of Mr. Kerkorian's camp last fall, scaring some institutional investors: there has been no talk of slashing Chrysler's cash reserve by more than 70 percent; of an immediate, sharp rise in the dividend; of an alliance with a foreign auto maker; of the poor quality of Chrysler vehicles.
Gone, too, at least from the public eye, is Lee A. Iacocca, the source of the comments on quality, which irritated many investors and enraged Chrysler executives who recalled major quality problems when Mr. Iacocca was in charge. Mr. York said Mr. Iacocca remained a consultant to Mr. Kerkorian's company, Tracinda, and that Mr. York talks to him by telephone "a couple of times a week," particularly about sales and marketing issues.
Friends of Mr. York have said that he would have signed on with Tracinda only if he believed he would wind up running Chrysler. Passed over in favor of Mr. Eaton in 1992, Mr. York was Chrysler's chief financial officer and a member of its board until spring 1993, when he left to become chief financial officer at the International Business Machines Corporation
But in an interview, Mr. York said that when he wrote down the pros and cons of joining Tracinda as he started seriously considering the offer in mid-August, "The possibility of become C.E.O. of Chrysler was not on the list."
"The thing I like in life is working on sizable projects where I'm sufficiently influential to where I can affect the outcome," he said. "Helping Tracinda manage its investments to maximize their value was of high interest to me."
Rather than another buyout bid, Tracinda appears to be gearing up for some form of proxy fight to maximize that investment. But Mr. York declined to discuss what actions Tracinda might take. He is urging Chrysler to sell off some nonautomotive assets, as Chrysler has said it plans to do. And he has zeroed in on Chrysler's cash hoard.
Mr. York said that while Eaton's stated target of $7.5 billion was too high, he had not determined how much cash Chrysler needed to see it through the next downturn. He said he believes that while Chrysler might be larger now than during the last recession -- when it burned through more than $4 billion to survive -- it is also more efficient. He pointed out that it now had better credit ratings and a stronger balance sheet, sells more popular cars and trucks and has fully financed its pension fund. "It's a whole different ballgame there now," he said.
Further, he said, if Chrysler expects the economy to remain strong in coming quarters, there is no reason it needs to keep so much cash sitting around now.
Mr. York appears to favor stock buybacks over dividend increases. He said institutional investors tended to prefer buybacks, which enhance the value of their shares, rather than increases in dividends, which are taxable. In trading today on the New York Stock Exchange, Chrysler shares closed at $56.625 a share, up 62.5 cents.
During Mr. York's tenure at I.B.M., the company announced no dividend increases but two buybacks of $2.5 billion apiece.

HEADLINE: Goldman Reworks Rockefeller Center Bid

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
Goldman, Sachs & Company offered yesterday to return a $33 million loan payment to Rockefeller Center Properties Inc., the real estate investment trust that is poised to take control of Rockefeller Center.
The offer appeared to be an effort to sweeten Goldman's bid to buy a controlling interest in the property. But Sam Zell, the Chicago financier who is leading an investor group competing for control of the center, called Goldman's offer an attempt to paper over a loophole in loans it made to the real estate investment trust, or REIT, last December -- loans that could weaken the investment bank's hand in the fight over Rockefeller Center. 
 A spokesman for Goldman and its Whitehall Street Real Estate L.P., an investment fund acting on behalf of Goldman, denied there were loopholes in the loans.
In documents filed yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Whitehall answered questions from the REIT's board about its bid. The board may vote at a meeting on Friday on whether to accept Whitehall's offer to invest up to $200 million in the REIT in exchange for almost doubling its stake in the company.
The REIT's board has already signed a deal with a group led by Mr. Zell that includes the Walt Disney Company, the General Electric Company and Merrill Lynch & Company That group plans to invest $250 million for a 50 percent stake.
The Goldman proposal, which is largely an attempt to undo the Zell deal, was made after the board had signed the Zell agreement, but the board has a fiduciary responsibility to consider any bids that might give the REIT's shareholders a better return. Whitehall contends that its proposal would dilute the existing shareholders' stake in the REIT less than the Zell deal would, and that Whitehall would pay more for its stake. But it would leave the REIT with more debt.
Whitehall said it would consider adjusting the terms attached to $75 million of $225 million in loans that it and the Goldman, Sachs Mortgage Company extended to the REIT in December. Those loans, which carry unusually high interest rates, and the attached warrants and shareholder appreciation rights give Whitehall tremendous influence over the REIT.
The investment fund also assured the REIT that it had no plans to sell the buildings of Rockefeller Center, though it had previously suggested to those involved in negotiations for the property that greater value could be realized by selling the individual buildings.
Mr. Zell contended that the offer to return the $33 million was really an attempt by Goldman to close a loophole in the loan documents that allows the REIT to prepay the loans, even though the $75 million Whitehall loan specifically prohibits prepayment.
The $33 million payment the REIT made to Goldman on Sept. 1 resulted from a provision in the loan documents called a "cash flow sweep." It requires the REIT, which holds a $1.3 billion mortgage on Rockefeller Center, to hand over to Goldman all its cash flow not needed to cover operating and interest expenses if the center's owners default on their mortgage payments.
The owners, two partnerships controlled by the Mitsubishi Estate Company, filed for bankruptcy protection in May and stopped making mortgage payments. The REIT had expected Whitehall to waive the sweep, but it did not. Mr. Zell stepped in last month with $10 million that gave the REIT money to operate after it paid Goldman, and on Aug. 28 -- two days before the REIT faced a severe financial squeeze -- Goldman offered to waive the requirement.
The Zell group's plans for buying a 50 percent stake in the REIT require the use of the cash flow sweep to pay all of Goldman's debt, thus eliminating Goldman's influence.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Caterpillar disappoints, and everyone nearby is punished.

BYLINE: By Barnaby J. Feder 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
CATERPILLAR INC.'S brief warning Monday evening that it had cut production and that third-quarter earnings would be down from a year ago could be a harbinger of a coming recession. On the other hand, sales are continuing to set records and the earnings decline may be largely a result of an accounting hiccup based on swings in the tax rates paid by the giant manufacturer of heavy equipment.
With scant guidance from Caterpillar, which is based in Peoria, Ill., Wall Street pondered a variety of possible explanations for the earnings disappointment yesterday while handing out the usual punishment for unwelcomed mysteries. Caterpillar's shares plunged more than $6 in heavy early trading on the Big Board and finished with a loss of $6.50 at $58.875. 
 Investor interest in Caterpillar is understandable. Not only is it one of the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones industrial average, but as the world's largest construction equipment company and one of the United States' largest exporters, Caterpillar is viewed as a barometer of both the domestic and global economy.
Caterpillar's plunge dragged down the Dow but the biggest impact was on other makers of capital equipment. Major competitors like Deere and Case, component suppliers like Parker-Hannifin and Trinova, and companies whose equipment is often used alongside Caterpillar's, like Ingersoll- Rand, all declined. Even Agco, a highflying maker of farm equipment that competes with Deere and Case but not Caterpillar, was caught in the downdraft, falling $2.125 to $50.875.
"We all seem to be dragged into this," said Bryan Kneeland, head of investor relations for Case, which is based in Racine, Wis. Case and others said they had seen no change in the general economic outlook that would justify the declines. If anything, the domestic construction market shows signs of a modest rebound after a brief slowdown and most overseas markets are growing as projected at double-digit rates.
Analysts were uncertain what to make of the announcement in part because it provided less "Cat speak" than usual. Typically, the company uses adverbs, like "slightly," by which it means zero to 5 percent, or "very significantly," which stands for 20 to 30 percent, to indicate how far up or down earnings are headed.
All that analysts were told about Monday's news -- and even that was expressed privately -- was that the decline would not be catastrophic, meaning 50 percent or more. As a result, most now expect per-share earnings in the range of 80 cents to $1, compared with $1.20 a year ago. But the prevailing long-term view is hardly gloomy.
"I reduced it to a hold this morning but after talking to them put it back on our 'buy' list," said Thomas Burns, who follows heavy equipment for the NatWest Securities Corporation. "They told me they could restore production in the fourth quarter if sales projections hold up."
Only one of Caterpillar's markets is clearly headed for trouble. August was the first month in three years in which new orders were lower than actual output for the diesel engines that several manufacturers, including Caterpillar, supply to truck makers. But that decline is not expected to affect the current quarter's performance.
Another factor is that earnings are likely to drop about 15 cents a share because the company tax rate is projected to be as high as 35 percent instead of 24 percent.
Alexander Blanton, who follows the company for Ingalls & Snyder in New York, speculated that part of the decline could also come from special charges related to eventual settlement of the company's 14-month labor dispute with the United Automobile Workers or be related to a spreading of profit-based incentive payments over the year's last two quarters instead of putting them all in the fourth quarter.
Most analysts say earnings are tumbling because of a decision to cut output to reduce dealer inventories of construction equipment.
"Caterpillar wants to get its hands around the problem now before it escalates," said Tobias Levkovich, an analyst with Smith Barney, who noted that part of the pay package for Caterpillar managers is based on their avoiding a buildup of unsold products.

HEADLINE: The Stampede to Harsh Welfare

 BODY:
Overwhelming bipartisan support for historic reform is ordinarily cause for celebration. But not in the case of the welfare "reform" approved by the Senate yesterday. With 35 Democrats joining 52 Republicans, the Senate passed an extreme welfare bill that will inevitably harm poor children. The bipartisan vote reflects the G.O.P.'s ideological blinders and the Democrats' weakness. The Democrats, including the President, preferred to swallow a bill they know is wrong rather than lose on principle.
Last year, before the Republicans took control, the President proposed a serious reform designed to put welfare enrollees to work within two years. But he, unlike the Republicans who made similar pledges, acknowledged the cost -- about $9 billion over five years for training, administration, child care and cash assistance. In contrast, the Republican bill just approved by the Senate pretends that the states can supervise a massive flight from welfare to work -- for a group that is uneducated, unskilled and saddled with miserable employment records -- for $8 billion less than the Government now spends on the welfare programs. 
 The Senate bill, like an even harsher version passed by the House, would tear up the 60-year-old Federal guarantee that turns over as much money as needed to the states to provide poor families cash and other temporary assistance. Instead, Washington will turn over fixed amounts of money, called block grants, to states to use as they please.
The plan provides states almost no additional money when recession hits and welfare rolls soar -- forcing states either to raise taxes at the worst possible time or cut benefits, their more likely course. The Republican plan also promises to employ half the able-bodied enrollees but provides no additional money to accomplish this expensive task. It typically costs about $6,000 more to move enrollees into jobs rather than keep them on welfare.
True, the Senate bill promises to punish states that fall short of its employment goal. But the financial penalty is so low it invites massive non-compliance. The bill also cuts food stamp programs sharply and removes the ironclad guarantees that protect nearly everyone from starvation. The bill would also make some naturalized citizens ineligible for welfare.
The House bill is even worse because it would allow states to eliminate completely their spending on the poor. It would also require states to withdraw cash assistance from unwed teen-age mothers and deny more aid to mothers who have additional children while on welfare. That makes the less punitive Senate plan look better. But it is neither humane nor reasonable.

HEADLINE: IN THE STUDIO WITH: Tony Brown;
Empowerment On the Air

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT 

 BODY:
FORTY-ONE stories above midtown Manhattan, bathed in a radio studio's low-lighted, high-tech glow, an elegantly dressed man with a strong chin and weak eyes bellies up to a microphone. After a moment of concentration, he clears his throat, watches for a cue from his engineer and hurls himself like a cliff diver into the foamy churn of public opinion below.
"This is Tony Brown on W-L-I-B," he proclaims, his practiced, trademark baritone becoming charged with 10,000 watts and reverberating from the studio monitors overhead. He teases out the day's topic. His switchboard flickers with callers eager to wade in. And aided by a legal pad, a few newspaper clippings and a head bubbling with hard-boiled ideas, Mr. Brown goes to work. 
 For hundreds of thousands of regular listeners of WLIB-AM, one of New York's black talk radio stations, Mr. Brown's name alone has become a mantra for meditations on self-help, economic empowerment, computer literacy -- and controversy. And no matter whether his words draw callers' praise or ire (he's been called an Uncle Tom and worse), Mr. Brown, always the stone-faced professional, ends each exchange with "I thank you so much for calling."
Since April, when Mr. Brown, a television broadcaster for 25 years, started as host of the program, he has become one of WLIB's brightest stars. The show, named for him, is broadcast Monday through Thursday from 2 to 5 P.M. Recent Arbitron figures showed him tied for first place with Bob Grant, the caustic ratings champ at WABC, among those who listen most to New York radio during afternoon drive time.
Part of Mr. Brown's charm is his on-air passion for his assignment. His enthusiasm is so great that his words often spill out in splashy streams of consciousness. Last week, when the topic of whether a President Colin Powell would be good for black America was raised, Mr. Brown, in typical fashion, fired from the hip.
"Colin Powell would do as much or more for us, given the limitations of what he could do, as anybody else in this country who is seriously being considered for President," he said. Then still in classic form, Mr. Brown added a cautionary caveat: "You can get only so much out of the political process. We are not going to get anybody in office -- black, white or otherwise -- who is going to solve all of our problems." In short, he warned, "Powell is not going to save us."
The do-for-yourself, take-charge theme is a central principle of Mr. Brown's philosophy, and of much of his work. It is liberally disseminated not only on his radio program these days, but also in his syndicated newspaper column, on the lecture circuit and on his long-running PBS television program, "Tony Brown's Journal." An average of five million viewers, many of them white, tune in each week to the nationally syndicated public affairs program.
"Tony is predictably unpredictable," said Maurice Cox, the vice president for corporate development and diversity for the Pepsi-Cola Company, for 19 years a prime sponsor of Mr. Brown's television show. "You know he is always going to have some interesting guests."
Last week, the television program explored the claims of melatonin, the media drug du jour that Mr. Brown takes and that is said to aid the immune system and to retard aging. The week before, he posed the question "Can you make money on the Internet?" Mr. Cox said the television program's themes appeal to black and white audiences. But, he added, "I don't think Tony does that for some political reason."
Mr. Brown, who refused to give his age (but is 62), plans to extend his reach in November with publication of "Black Lies, White Lies: The Truth According to Tony Brown" (William Morrow & Company), his first book, a 361-page recipe to rebuild America -- all of America. In the same month, Mr. Brown is scheduled to enter cyberspace with "Tony Brown Online," a black-oriented subscription computer service.
Mr. Brown, a former Detroit psychiatric social worker and the founding dean of Howard University's School of Communication, is manic for results. Long before Nike, Mr. Brown was preaching "Just do it." Along the way, though, he lost his tolerance for excuses. Karen Smith, his assistant for the last 12 years, says Mr. Brown demands from everyone what he demands most from himself: excellence. And he does not hesitate to kick a sacred cow or two if they block his way to imploring black Americans to turn to their own imaginations and energies to achieve.
"A mentality of affirmative action and civil rights is not going to get you anywhere in the 21st century," he said in a recent interview, minutes after finishing his radio show. "If you only believe that you're going to be a leader in the world if white people are going to have a preference program for you, brother, you just get out your cotton-picking clothes, because that's what you're going to be doing."
But in Tony Brown's world, if blacks had to pick cotton it would be in fields they owned and controlled. Blacks would also design, produce and market their own high-quality cotton wares. And whites would be happy to do business with them because they would realize that their welfare was "inextricably tied to whatever happens to the least among us," he said.
Mr. Brown's prescriptions for advancement are so firmly tied to the free enterprise system that he often sounds like a capitalist activist. And that's fine with him as the very self-employed president of Tony Brown Productions, the umbrella organization for all his projects.
But for blacks, he says, solutions will come only from independence. "I don't want to be in a community where our fate is in the hands of another community," he said.
A "dependent mentality," he said, has left much of black America "staging areas for permanently poor people who, generation after generation, reproduce their poverty."
It is precisely that sort of blunt (he prefers "honest") and heartfelt candor that has earned him legions of fans -- including the Rev. Al Sharpton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich -- and critics. In fact, when it was announced last spring that Mr. Brown, a black centrist Republican, was joining WLIB, an Afrocentric left-of-center station, a roar of protest greeted the news.
At the time, Sonny Carson, one of New York City's perennial protesters, considered setting up picket lines in front of the station's offices at 34th Street and Park Avenue to denounce Mr. Brown's appointment. Mr. Carson told The New York Amsterdam News in April that "Brown is counterproductive to what we want our community to move toward."
But Mr. Brown, a small-framed man with a bigger-than-life persona, brushes aside his critics. "Let me tell you something," he said, leaning in close as if about to reveal a family secret. "It hurts when I read or hear that someone said something about me. But God bless them. There's nothing I can do about it."
Yet, privately, he encourages the notion that work -- and lots of it -- is the best revenge. "I've got to write a column," he said. "I've got to go on the air from 2 to 5. I owe those people intelligence. I owe them preparation. I owe them respect." He noted, however, that his 5 A.M. to 11 P.M. workdays have not come without costs. He blames his schedule for the recent losses of a girlfriend and a housekeeper fed up with his paper-cluttered Central Park West apartment.
Sonja Gyimah, a listener, is not surprised by Mr. Brown's radio success. "I wasn't an avid listener of WLIB until I heard Tony Brown had a show," she said. She added that she was particularly drawn to "Tony Brown's Cyberspace Club," his Thursday program devoted to computing. While some have characterized the program as little more than an infomercial for Mr. Brown's forthcoming computer service, it is wildly popular with listeners, judging from the phone calls.
Last week, a caller trying to get her 11-year-old son's computer up to speed for the Internet called Mr. Brown's show. Almost instantly, he linked the woman -- over the air -- with computer experts he likes to call "cyberleaders." In minutes, the caller, her son and the listeners got the answers.
The information superhighway is a long way from the muddy back roads of Charleston, W.Va., where William Anthony Brown grew up in the 1930's and 40's. He does not usually talk about his private life, but he said that before he was born, his father had run away and that when he was an infant, poverty had conspired to remove him from his mother. But he was lucky, he continued: two women, domestic workers, came to his mother's door one day and announced, "We are here for the boy." Mr. Brown, who is a divorced father of a grown son, added that they raised him with love until both had died by the time he was 12.
He returned to his biological mother, but he never forgot them. Recently, after work, over a dinner of veal and pasta at Patsy's Italian Restaurant in midtown Manhattan, Mr. Brown, his voice breaking with emotion, recited his book's dedication: "To the two angels, Elizabeth 'Mamma' Sanford, and her daughter, Mabel Holmes, who gave me life when I was 2 months old."
A moment later, the public Tony Brown was back, talking up a storm about race, work, dollars and common sense to save America.

HEADLINE: THE 104TH CONGRESS: SHIRINKING BUREAUCRACY;
G.O.P. Finds Commerce Dept. Is Hard to Uproot

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 19

 BODY:
Just a few months ago the Commerce Department was in danger of becoming road kill along Pennsylvania Avenue in the Republican drive to dismantle, consolidate and privatize a bloated Washington bureaucracy.
The Senate majority leader and other Republican Presidential aspirants declared that Commerce was an example of everything wrong with Washington: a bottomless barrel of pork for cities seeking economic development money; a shameless source of corporate welfare for companies looking for Federal money to pursue risky technologies, and a redundant morass of 100 separate trade programs. 
 Now, Republicans are suddenly discovering that the agency, which has been a mainstay of the Federal Government since it was created by Theodore Roosevelt, is not as easy to rip down as it first appeared.
Over the past week, as more than a dozen committees responsible for overseeing parts of the department's vast domain have sent their "dismantlement" proposals to the Republican leaders, it has become clear that the only parts of the department at greatest risk of extinction are the sign outside the giant Commerce building and about $400 million in initiatives to promote risky but promising technology.
Though the initial Republican instinct was to wipe the department off the map, creating savings optimistically estimated at $7.76 billion over five years, what has emerged from the committees are recommendations for a raft of new independent agencies plucked from the Commerce carcass. Among them would be a United States Science and Technology Administration, a United States Trade Administration, a National Marine Resources Administration and an Economic Development Regional Commission.
And that is before anyone has figured out what to do with the Weather Service, the Patent and Trademark Office and the Census Bureau, though there is talk of a new Federal Statistical Agency, which would tally things like the gross domestic product and unemployment.
"When you look at it, the buildings don't change, the offices don't change, the people don't change," said Vice President Al Gore, who has led the Administration's effort to streamline the Government. Mr. Gore, in an interview on Friday, clearly relished listing new agencies that would be created under the Republican proposals. "In the end, you get a different name plate on the door and some extra expense for changing the stationery," he said.
Republicans say the process is not over, and starting this week the Congressional leaders will sort through the proposals voted out of committee, each of which, naturally, seeks to save the part of the department it oversees.
"I think that the Department of Commerce is gone," said Representative Robert S. Walker, a Republican from Pennsylvania who heads the House committee on science and is the leading proponent of Science and Technology Administration. "But clearly many of its functions must remain."
Other Republicans say the early enthusiasm for mass destruction is clearly waning. Proposals to wipe out the International Trade Administration, which has expertise on virtually every facet of industry and serves as the war room that seeks to track American efforts to get big foreign contracts, have disappeared. Representatives and senators from coastal states rallied to protect the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which accounts for a bit less than half of the Commerce Department's budget -- though they have vowed to wipe out its tiny navy.
"This talk of wholesale dismantlement has become a joke," said Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, who has spent the past three months denouncing the effort to dismember his department as a "trophy hunt" long on symbolism and short on any real cost savings. "We're headed toward creating even more agencies -- each with its own Inspector General, each with its own public affairs office, each with its own personnel office. Where's the savings in that?"
In the Senate, there is already a proposal afoot to set the fate of the Commerce Department aside and to create a commission that would draw up a list of departments and agencies throughout the Government to be wiped out. President Clinton has vowed to veto any bill that eliminates the Commerce Department.
Eager to zero out something, the Republicans in the House have focused on President Clinton's biggest foray into Japanese-style industrial policy: the Advanced Technology Program, which provides grants to companies and consortia of firms to develop high-risk technologies that seem too risky for venture-capitalists to underwrite.
The whole idea of Government involvement in civilian technology -- as opposed to military technologies -- has never sat well in the Republican Party, however, and on Capitol Hill such programs are regularly denounced as "industrial policy." Last week former Commerce Secretary Barbara H. Franklin, who served in the last year of the Bush Administration, testified that the $400 million Advanced Technology Program was "a large pork barrel." When it was pointed out that she had sought an increase in money for the program when she served in office, she replied, "Times change."
What has changed is the perception of the short-term competitive threat to American industry, which has grown stronger recently. But the debate over the Government's proper role in commercial technological research has made virtually no intellectual progress in Congress since the mid-1980's, despite a vast body of studies over what kind of programs have worked here and in Japan and what kind have failed.
"Obviously, in high-risk research a lot of projects do not work out," Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary said recently. "But you can't go up to the Hill and defend a program with a 20 or 30 percent success rate."
Mr. Brown argued in an interview earlier this week that "the confluence of trade and technology policy was a big part of making us competitive" and that Congressional efforts to separate them would undermine the country's attempts to increase its strength in global markets. "It is unilateral disarmament," he said. Mr. Brown has declined to counter the Republican effort, though, with his own proposal for reorganizing trade and commerce functions.
Others point out the the United States Trade Representative's office, now part of the President's office, works precisely because it is small. Combining it with thousands of trade officials in Commerce may consolidate resources, but it may not make it any more lithe.
But the Republicans are also in a box: they have vowed to wipe out a Cabinet department, and Commerce is their only hope for this budget year. If it fails, or results in a plethora of new departments, they will be perceived as having failed in a primary mission to rein in Washington.
 
PROPOSED REPLACEMENTS
 
U.S. Science and Technology Administration would incorporate technology areas of commerce and parts of other agencies like the Energy Department.
 
National Marine Resources Administration would be drawn from parts of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that deal with fisheries and other marine operations.
 
Federal Statistical Agency would combine the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis with the Census Bureau and statistics areas of the Labor Department.
 
U.S. Trade Administration would consolidate Commerce's trade functions with other trade-related agencies, but would leave the U.S Trade Representative as a separate cabinet-level post

The Scoop
 With only a proposal in hand, publishers were crawling all over each other last week, hoping to snatch up what is expected to be an unusually scrappy behind-the-scenes political book by Ed Rollins, the outspoken Republican campaign consultant.
Seven publishing houses, including Simon & Schuster, St. Martin's Press and Avon Books, entered the auction on Thursday to bid for "Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms." And by the end of the day, Broadway Books, a new division of Bantam Doubleday Dell, had agreed to pay more than $1 million for the book, which will be published in the fall of 1996. 
 Mr. Rollins, who retired from politics last year, spent 30 years managing or consulting for high-level political campaigns, including Ronald Reagan's first run for the White House in 1980, Ross Perot's 1992 bid, Christine Todd Whitman's New Jersey gubernatorial campaign in 1992 and Michael Huffington's failure to become a Senator last year.
The book, whose coauthor is Tom DeFrank, a White House correspondent for Newsweek, is "quite candid," said Thomas L. Dunne, an editor at St. Martin's who read the proposal.
"What I found remarkable is that Rollins doesn't just pass out bouquets to Republicans and brickbats to Democrats. He has plenty of tasty stories about fellow Republicans, too, including a much darker view than you'd expect of Baker, Bush, Dan Quayle, even the Huffingtons."
At one point in the tart proposal, Mr. Rollins, who had a take-no-prisoners style in politics, too, said he was glad Mr. Perot and Mr. Huffington lost. "The country is better off without them in office," he wrote.
In an interview yesterday from his cabin in Front Royal, Va., Mr. Rollins, 52, elaborated. On Mr. Perot: "Any kook could come up to him and tell him something and he would give it the same credibility as a high-level Government source."
On Ms. Whitman: "I took a lot of abuse in that campaign from her husband and her brother."
On James Baker: "Baker was a guy who obviously was the master spinner with the press and to a certain extent did an awful lot to undercut a lot of the Reagan people. That's a story that's never been told. He wiped out Ed Meese and Bill Clark."
On George Bush: "George Bush and Jim Baker were good people but they did more to damage the Reagan revolution than anyone."
On Michael Huffington: "He disappeared for six weeks in the middle of the campaign, and nobody really missed him. He could have been elected Senator if he had been honest about his nanny situation."
On Ronald Reagan: "He was the nicest man you ever wanted to meet."
 
Undoing Melville
 In January 1852, Herman Melville delivered his newest novel, "Pierre, or the Ambiguities" to his publisher, Harper & Brothers. His timing could not have been worse.
Reviews of "Moby-Dick" were just coming out and many were devastating. ("The Judgment Day will hold him liable for not turning his talents to better account," said the Independent, a New York weekly. And it was selling slowly.
The publisher thought the new book even odder than "Moby-Dick" and offered Melville less than half his usual royalties, only 20 percent of the sales revenue after costs. Already $695 in debt to his publishers, Melville accepted, but took revenge.
According to Hershel Parker, a noted Melville scholar who has edited a new edition of "Pierre" to be published by HarperCollins in November, Melville held onto his manuscript and began adding to it.
The original story, Mr. Parker believes, was simply a psychological novel that dealt with incestuous ties between Pierre, a young man of leisure, and his half-sister, Isabel.
But what Melville ultimately turned in was a much longer book, about 130 pages more than Harper expected. Though no copies of the original exist, Mr. Parker suggests that Melville added two chapters and other inserts.
"This was really a suicidal, autobiographical account of his own career, his own aspirations," Mr. Parker said in an interview. "He knew his career was over."
While the original plot remained, Mr. Parker said, the author now painted a dark portrait of American literary life and publishing.
In the two new chapters he abruptly tells the reader that Pierre had once been an author and then heaps scorn on critics who praised the young Pierre, depicting them as low-lifes.
In HarperCollins' new edition, which has been illustrated by Maurice Sendak, Mr. Parker removes all text that deals with Pierre's life as a writer.
Michael di Capua, who oversaw publication of the book for HarperCollins, said the added sections "are so beside the point that when you take them out, they simply are not missed." After "Pierre," Melville saw his career disintegrate.
He wrote another book, "The Isle of the Cross," but Harpers rejected it in June 1853. "Billy Budd," published in the 1920's, was found in an old suitcase.
Melville published one last major work, "Clarel," an 18,000-line poem, in 1876. But he spent the last 40 years of his life unemployed or as a customs inspector in Manhattan.
 
Season for Prizes
 Ten writers have been given $50,000 Lannan Literary Awards for 1995. They are Hayden Carruth (poetry), Carol Ann Duffy (poetry) Li-Young Lee (poetry), Arthur Sze (poetry), Louis de Bernieres (fiction), Mary Morrissy (fiction), Alice Munro (fiction) Thomas Berry (nonfiction), Richard K. Nelson (nonfiction) and Scott Russell Sanders (nonfiction).
James Tate has been awarded the Tanning Prize, the largest annual literary prize in this country. The $100,000 award is to recognize outstanding and proven mastery in the art of poetry.
And Francisco Rebolledo of Mexico has won the Pegasus Prize for Literature, which is given to fiction authors from abroad. Mr. Rebolledo won the $7,000 for "Rasero," a book that will be published by Louisiana State University Press this fall.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 21, 1995, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Book Notes column yesterday about publishers' vying for a political memoir by Ed Rollins, the Republican campaign consultant, misstated the year of Christine Todd Whitman's campaign for the governorship in New Jersey. It was 1993, not 1992.

HEADLINE: WELFARE IN TRANSITION;
Pinch of Tax Bill To Be Felt by Many, Not Just Businesses

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 20

 BODY:
The $52 billion tax bill that the House Ways and Means Committee approved late Tuesday was largely advertised as an effort to shut down unwarranted corporate tax breaks and, as the panel's chairman said, "end business as usual" in the Capitol. And it would, in fact, knot many loopholes.
But like tax measures passed by the Democratic regime before it, the Republican bill turns out to do a lot of other things, too. 
 The provisions will be incorporated in a larger spending bill, a reconciliation package, whose own future is uncertain. Nor is it clear whether many of the proposals will survive in a conference with the Senate to resolve differences with its reconciliation bill.
Well over half of the billions of dollars that the measure would raise, for deficit reduction and other purposes, come not from closing business loopholes but from elsewhere. About $19 billion comes from trimming the earned-income tax credit for poor working households. About $10 billion stems from a change in pension law that critics say would actually give corporations a windfall of $20 billion or more.
Many of the remaining changes would end tax breaks that affect uniquely Democratic constituencies. They include trial lawyers, Hollywood movie makers and even a onetime political supporter of President Clinton, Tyson Foods, an Arkansas-based chicken empire.
And while a handful of other provisions would eliminate tax breaks for certain businesses, they have the practical effect of benefiting those businesses' competitors. In particular, the legislation would wipe out tax breaks for several competitors of the petroleum industry.
The artful craftsmanship of the tax measure, which was debated and approved mostly in evening sessions, left Democrats sputtering in anger. Representatives Sam M. Gibbons of Florida and Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, the panel's two most senior Democrats, charged that the real targets of the bill were middle- and lower-income working Americans, not businesses. And President Clinton said the measure was "inconsistent with those basic, bedrock values this country should be standing for."
But Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who heads the committee, dismissed those accusations during and after hearings on the bill this week. His spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said today that Mr. Archer had drafted the tax provisions with an eye to "updating and modernizing the code," not to political loss or gain. "I'll tell you this," he said. "None of those changes were the result of lobbying. Mr. Archer sprang those by surprise."
He did indeed. When Republicans began writing the legislation earlier this summer, its biggest provision would have pared about $14 billion from the earned-income tax credit for the working poor. When Mr. Archer, a solid defender of corporate tax preferences, announced last week that he had also included 27 tax changes that would raise $30 billion from corporations by the year 2002, it created a minor sensation.
But along the way, the reduction in the earned-income credit grew by $5 billion, to $19 billion, mostly by phasing out the credit more quickly as poor families' incomes grow.
Democrats have focused their attacks on that rise. But Mr. Fleischer said today that Republicans chose to reduce the credit by a greater amount rather than raise money in two other unpleasant ways: requiring spouses to help pay the cost of tracking down fathers who do not pay child support, or reducing unemployment compensation.
In truth, he said, the reduction in the tax credit is not a change in the tax code, but a spending cut, because almost all the credit goes to families in the form of checks, not as breaks on their taxes. The bill's greatest effect on taxes, he said, is in those changes that apply to corporations.
The bill approved by the Ways and Means Committee does attack some breaks that have enjoyed bipartisan support in the past. For instance, it would raise $3.1 billion over seven years by gradually eliminating a credit that benefited pharmaceutical and electronics companies that established plants in Puerto Rico. And it would raise another $7 billion by ending a fiercely defended tax deduction for loans on corporate-owned life-insurance policies.
But Democrats see another method in the committee's actions. Today they noted that the bill would eliminate several tax credits and breaks for ethanol, wind energy, biomass and energy conservation, while leaving untouched the volumes of tax preferences enjoyed by the oil and gas business that is centered in Mr. Archer's home state.
Mr. Fleischer rejected any implication that Mr. Archer had played favorites, arguing that petroleum companies enjoyed no tax credits like the ones Mr. Archer targeted.
Democrats also argued that the measure unduly affected their political allies. The bill would raise some $390 million over seven years by taxing all punitive damages and emotional distress awards in lawsuits, a provision that the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, a bedrock supporter of Democratic causes, labeled an attack on ordinary Americans' legal rights.
It would eliminate the tax credit for construction of low-income housing, a Democratic cause, saving $3.5 billion. It would raise another $204 million by tightening the rules by which some businesses -- many of them entertainment companies -- calculate their depreciation of the costs of products like movies whose profits must be estimated.
And it would gradually eliminate a tax break for "certain large farm corporations," including major poultry producers like Tyson.
The single largest money-raiser, however, does not close a corporate tax break. It would relax rules that allowed corporations to withdraw excess money from employee pension accounts only for specific purposes, and often after paying a 34 percent corporate tax and a penalty of up to 50 percent.

HEADLINE: THE SECOND BREAKUP OF AT&T: THE NEW STRATEGY;
Going Against the Grain

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
By splitting itself into three companies and dropping out of the personal computer business, AT&T abandoned yesterday its once-grand vision of combining communications and computers into a single corporate empire.
In the end, that vision proved to be a costly illusion. So much for "synergy" -- the ungainly term used for decades to justify all manner of mergers, and most recently to explain the wave of big media-industry deals. AT&T's retreat, analysts warn, may hold lessons for companies pursuing such visions of synergy. 
 The AT&T Corporation feels forced to make sweeping changes now partly because of Washington. Congress is expected to enact legislation soon that will radically rewrite the nation's communications laws, with the intention of increasing competition.
The new regulatory environment will change the ground rules of competition and the structure of the industry. In its lucrative businesses, like long-distance phone service, AT&T will suddenly face new competition from regional phone companies, like Bell Atlantic and Pacific Bell. Some of the seven regional Bell companies, industry analysts say, could even link up through alliances or mergers, becoming even more formidable rivals to AT&T.
To compete in the new setting, AT&T needs to become nimbler and less bureaucratic. And, analysts say, it will also need its cash, so it can no longer afford to support money-sapping operations like the personal computer business.
The stand-alone status of businesses like long-distance service and communications equipment manufacturing, analysts say, should help. The smaller, more focused companies will also have freer hands to seek business elsewhere in the industry. A regional phone company, analysts note, would be more likely to buy equipment from the AT&T manufacturing company if it knows that company is not a rival for long-distance or local phone service.
"AT&T is about to enter its most competitive fight ever, especially in the long-distance market," said George F. Colony, president of Forrester Research Inc., a consulting firm. "It will need speed, capital and fewer conflicts in the industry."
Besides preparing for future challenges, the AT&T move represents a striking retreat from its strategy of the last decade.
After AT&T settled a Federal antitrust suit in 1982 by breaking up its Bell System and pulling out of the local telephone business, the company went scouting for new ways to grow. As its guide, AT&T settled on a concept known in industry circles as "convergence," combining elements of information technology, from production to distribution.
The worlds of communications and computers were converging, the theory went, and a huge corporation housing both technologies would be ideally suited to cash in on the information age.
No American company chased the vision of convergence more aggressively or more expensively than AT[T] its investments included spending $7.5 billion in 1991 for the NCR Corporation, a computer maker.
With its announcement yesterday, AT&T tacitly conceded that its strategy had been an expensive failure.
"Computing and telecommunications are closely related technologically, but that doesn't mean you have to do it under one roof," said Eli Noam, a professor at Columbia University's graduate school of business. "AT&T has learned that lesson the hard way."
The flavor of synergy of which AT&T was so enamored mainly meant combining computers and phone networks. I.B.M. went in the same direction for a while during the 1980's, buying both a telephone switching company and a producer of telecommunication satellites, both of which were sold off later.
The big Japanese consumer-electronics companies, notably Matsushita and Sony, chased a model of convergence in which their consumer-electronics "hardware" would be combined with the "software" of American movie studios. That synergy, of course, has also proved elusive; the Japanese companies have lost billions in their Hollywood adventures.
Industry analysts and consultants said yesterday that AT&T's split-up announcement should prompt questions about the wisdom of some of the recent media deals based on the notion that "two plus two equals five." In the Walt Disney Company's planned $19 billion purchase of Capital Cities/ABC, announced last July, for example, the synergistic theory is that combining movie and television programming with the distribution channel of a television network will be a winner.
"There may be some successes, but I think the media executives are eventually going to come to the same conclusion that AT&T" did, said Howard Anderson, managing director of the Yankee Group, a research firm in Boston. "But it's probably going to take them years and billions of dollars to learn the same thing."
In fact, AT&T's decision to dismantle its empire points to evidence of what some analysts call "negative synergies." In fast-moving markets, size alone can be an impediment, especially for a company like AT&T, whose corporate culture is rooted in a long tradition of monopoly. Those disadvantages are compounded if the company has made a strategic mistake.
"AT&T didn't belong in the personal computer business," said Mark Stahlman, president of New Media Associates, a research firm. "Once the company recognized that, the next logical step is to get rid of that business."
Another disadvantage of size, analysts say, will result from the reordering of the telecommunications industry after deregulation. The new order, they note, should create new customers for AT&T's manufactured products like sophisticated switches and transmission systems. But other long-distance or regional companies would be reluctant to buy from AT&T as long as it was also a rival in the phone-service business, hobbling AT&T's manufacturing business.
"The synergies proved to illusory, and the drawbacks of being a huge integrated company became more and more apparent," said Mr. Anderson of the Yankee Group. "So the idea of convergence has given way to divergence for AT&T."

HEADLINE: Agency Missteps Put Illegal Aliens at Mercy of Sweatshops

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 20

 BODY:
With the raids on garment sweatshops here last month producing the spectacle of scores of illegal Thai immigrants being kept as virtual slaves, state and Federal investigators have begun pointing fingers at one another while issuing assurances that they are taking action to flush out such operations.
But an examination of past investigations in Southern California, home to the country's largest garment industry, shows that a series of missteps dating at least to 1988 have left the workers at the mercy of groups tied to Asian organized crime rings, with little chance of being rescued. 
 The local office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service appears to have had several chances to address the problem uncovered in the sweatshop raids last month at El Monte, in eastern Los Angeles County. But no action was taken because of a lack of cooperation among Federal, state and local agencies and because of what one agent described as a personality conflict within the immigration office.
In some ways, critics say, the Government's failure to take action illustrates deep shortcomings in the immigration service's effort to protect immigrants. It also demonstrates how competing economic interests discourage local and state governments from cracking down on a problem that has become pervasive in garment districts from Manhattan to Los Angeles.
"Enforcement has always been a stepchild" of the immigration service, said Demetrios G. Papademetriou, an authority on immigration policy at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace. "Businesses complain about the disruptions" caused by strict enforcement, and enforcement costs are very high, he added.
Politics also plays a role. Gov. Pete Wilson has twice vetoed bills that would have held big manufacturers responsible for monitoring their subcontractors' compliance with labor and immigration laws.
Proponents of such laws say they would make it more difficult to exploit illegal aliens. But Mr. Wilson, a Republican, has said such regulations would place too great a burden on manufacturers and would drive them out of the state.
There is little doubt that the problem of worker abuse at garment factories is huge and growing. Last Friday, Federal labor investigators said routine inspections of 50 garment contractors here had turned up wage and overtime violations at 46 sites, shortchanging some 600 workers by more than $500,000. And those were all legally registered factories.
Early last month, in the first of the recent series of raids, 72 illegal aliens were found in peonage at one site in El Monte. They had been smuggled here by an organized crime gang that confiscated their passports and told them part of their earnings would be kept to repay the costs of bringing them here, Federal and state officials said. The immigration agency acknowledged that the El Monte factory had come under suspicion once before, in 1992.
In that instance, the agency investigated for three months, secretly observing the site, but it dropped the case after a request for a criminal warrant was denied. Federal prosecutors have said the request was rejected because the initial tip came from an anonymous source, which is considered inadequate support for a Federal warrant, and because the information was too old.
The immigration agency now says that instead of seeking a civil warrant to gain entry into the site, it passed along the information to state and local officials and left it at that.
But people familiar with the investigation, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the same Thai sweatshop owners had been investigated even earlier, in 1988. These people said an immigration agent found evidence that illegal immigrants were being held there. He delivered a letter informing the owners that an inspection would take place in a few days. But by the time the inspector returned, the workers had been whisked away.
Three years later, the immigration agency had another opportunity to attack the problem of illegal Thai immigrants being held in such conditions. In mid-May 1991, Phil L. Bonner Jr., a special agent with the immigration agency here, wrote several memorandums proposing raids on five garment sweatshops because he had information that perhaps 200 illegal immigrants were being held there.
Another shop owner had informed him, Mr. Bonner wrote, that the Thais had been smuggled here by an organized crime ring. He also said he had been told that a Los Angeles police officer was involved in smuggling and guarding the workers.
Mr. Bonner proposed placing Thai workers in those factories to gather evidence, and suggested raiding the sweatshops.
No action was taken. Mr. Bonner says he was disciplined, apparently because of a personality clash with supervisors, according to a pending discrimination suit he filed against the agency in July 1992. The suit also says he was not allowed to speak Thai in the office or to pursue any cases related to Thais.
Mr. Bonner says in his suit that he was discriminated against because he married a Thai woman and speaks Thai, and that the ill will toward him caused the agency to mishandle the inquiry.
William S. Slattery, the immigration agency's executive associate commissioner for operations, said the agency would not comment on a pending lawsuit but added that no valid investigation had been run improperly.
The agency began this year's investigation after it got a tip from someone who had escaped from the El Monte factory. When the raid on the El Monte sweatshops took place on Aug. 2, state officials, not the immigration agency, led the raid, even though the Federal agents had spearheaded the investigation.
The escapee, a Thai woman, had told a lawyer, William Livingston, about sweatshop conditions at the factory. Mr. Livingston passed along the information in May, and the agency began an inquiry. This time Mr. Bonner, who had been transferred to another immigration service office in the Los Angeles area because of his lawsuit, was involved.
He observed the shop, a group of apartments surrounded by a fence and razor wire, from an adjacent trailer park. He discovered that materials and finished goods were going in and out of the shop, but workers neither entered nor left.
The immigration agency brought state Labor Department officials into the inquiry. The agency was still trying to get enough information for a Federal warrant when state officials moved on their own. Soon after the predawn raid began, the immigration agency was called in and the Thai shop owners were arrested.
Late last month the immigration service raided a different group of sweatshops in Los Angeles County. In these raids, 56 illegal immigrants, most of them Thais, were found to be working in appalling conditions, the Government said, even though they were not being held as slaves.
But that assertion is now being questioned. Julie Su, a lawyer representing many of the workers in a lawsuit against the owners, said they had, in fact, been held in servitude but had been intimidated by their captors into denying it. She said the shop owners had initially been detained with the workers, which allowed them to continue threatening the workers with reprisals.
Asked about the El Monte case, the immigration agency acknowledged the 1988 investigation. But Mr. Slattery, the agency official, insisted that all cases involving the Thais had been handled properly.
"I don't think there's anything I would have done differently in 1995," he said in an interview. "In 1992, I'm not sure I would have done anything differently."
Many experts say the enforcement agencies will never have enough agents to police an industry that is so large and growing so fast, and whose underground elements can so easily close shops and move on. The alternative being pushed by Federal labor officials is to make the big manufacturers and retailers responsible for insuring that labor laws are followed by subcontractors.
"The goal is to get the major retailers to take a strong stand and use their leverage," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said in a recent interview. On Sept. 12, he met with a number of large retailers and manufacturers in New York who said they might consider voluntary compliance programs.
Here in California, Governor Wilson has fought making such programs mandatory. Last year, when he vetoed the latest bill, Mr. Wilson said such mandates "would drive the garment industry out of state."
But the experience of some companies contradicts Mr. Wilson's assertion. One garment manufacturer here, Guess, has adopted what some praise as a model compliance program. The company trains subcontractors to screen for illegal aliens and to comply with labor laws.
Stan Levy, the general counsel at Guess, said, "We give them the ultimate economic incentive: if you don't want to comply, you don't have to work for us." When the company began the program three years ago, he added, it lost almost a quarter of its contractors.

HEADLINE: WELFARE IN TRANSITION: THE BACKGROUND;
Clinton in Awkward Role In the Debate on Welfare

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 20

 BODY:
President Clinton's campaign promise to "end welfare as we know it" was the signature element of his contention that he was a "new Democrat." It allowed him as he ran for election to advocate a "third way" that was neither conventional Democratic liberalism nor the conservatism that had been practiced by the Reagan and Bush Administrations.
In what was often his best applause line, Mr. Clinton declared that all able-bodied welfare recipients should have to get off relief and go to work after two years. He also promised additional education, job-training and child-care assistance to make work possible for uneducated, unskilled adults with young children. 
 But in retrospect, many scholars and politicians agree, the pledge to end welfare was what opened the floodgates. Republicans have now gone much further than Mr. Clinton could ever have imagined in dismantling the welfare state. They took the Clinton plan to force people off of welfare and transmuted it into legislation that would end the 60-year-old Democratic precept of guaranteeing all poor children and their families at least a modicum of Federal financial assistance.
Now, this line of thinking goes, Mr. Clinton has no alternative but to join the Republicans.
"He put the ball into play," said Henry J. Aaron, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution. "He put himself in a position that deprived him of any debating leverage against anything Republicans might propose. He can't have people saying, 'Hey, you're the one who promised to end welfare as we know it, and now you're preventing the Republicans from doing that.' "
Isabel V. Sawhill, who was the top welfare policy specialist at the Office of Management and Budget in the first two years of the Clinton Administration and who is now a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, does not disagree with Mr. Aaron's analysis. But she said: "It could not have been foreseen. The President and his advisers could not have foreseen that proposing time limits on welfare would lead to the Republican revolution."
Whatever the case, the President finds himself now in the position of advocating legislation, approved Tuesday by the Senate, that basically turns welfare policy-making over to the states, reduces Federal antipoverty spending by $70 billion over the next seven years and makes no effort to expand education, employment training or Federally subsidized jobs.
In Florida on Tuesday, the President said that if the Senate bill becomes law, "we will have welfare reform this year, and it will be a very great thing."
In an interview at the White House today, a top adviser on welfare policy argued that whatever the flaws in the Senate bill, it offered a system much better than the current one.
"We have our concerns," said Bruce Reed, the President's deputy assistant for domestic policy. But he added: "The current system does nothing to require work and little to encourage work. It does little to provide child care. And it does little or nothing to expect responsibility from teen parents."
Mr. Reed conceded that the Senate bill was probably the high-water mark from the point of view of the White House and that more elements opposed by the President might get added when the Senate measure is compromised with a harsher one passed by the House last March.
But he said he was confident that a bill much more like the House's version could not become law. "They can't pass a mean bill in the Senate," he said.
The Senate approved the welfare measure by a vote of 87 to 12, and 35 Democrats voted for it.
Most of the solidly liberal Democrats who voted for the bill said that they were holding their noses while voting "yes" but that this was the best bill they could possibly get out of this Congress.
"It is not perfect," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader. "It is not the bill I would have drafted alone. It is not the bill that would have passed five years ago or perhaps even last year. It does reflect, in my view, the political reality of today. It is the best bill that we are going to get under the circumstances that exist."
Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, the general chairman of the Democratic Party, took a similar stand. "This is a far better bill than what the other body has passed," he said, "a far better bill than was initially proposed and offered here in the Senate."
Public opinion polls show that most people believe the current welfare system is a disaster that rewards sloth and allows families to stay on relief for generation after generation. That view was reflected in the Senate. Democratic senators implied that they did not want to be accused of voting against something called "welfare reform."
Explaining his vote in favor of the measure, Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, said, "I have an abiding, underlying interest in achieving genuine welfare reform, because I know the current system does not work."
Unlike the House bill, the Senate measure would require the states, each year for the next five years, themselves to spend on welfare at least 80 percent of what they spent this year. The senators also voted to spend an additional $3 billion on child care, and they rejected House provisions that would deny welfare assistance to children born to unmarried women younger than 18 or to mothers already on welfare.
Mr. Clinton supports the Senate on those matters. He also favors Senate provisions that would require parents younger than 18 to live with adults and stay in school as a condition of receiving benefits and give states bonuses based on the number of welfare recipients placed in jobs.
Still, Mr. Clinton has come a long way on welfare since he took office. Despite his emphasis on the matter during the election campaign, he put welfare on the sidetrack at the outset of his Presidency and concentrated on health care. The main reason, assistants say, is that changing the health system promised big budgetary savings.
When he finally got around to offering a welfare proposal last year, he recommended spending an additional $9.3 billion over five years for such things as child care; education, training and job placement assistance, and Federally subsidized jobs for those who could not find private employment.
Mrs. Sawhill, the former Administration budget official, said, "It's a fairy tale that you can buy welfare reform with less money."
In his statements in recent days, Mr. Clinton has not mentioned the sharp spending cutbacks proscribed by the Senate and House welfare bills.
But his advisers challenged the view of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, that the new welfare legislation could lead to children sleeping on grates.
"The President would never for a moment support a bill that he thought would do that," said Rahm Emanuel, the President's assistant for strategic planning and communications.

HEADLINE: AT&T Dominates as Dow Climbs 25.65

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
AT&T, the nation's most widely held corporation, dominated the stock market yesterday after announcing that it would split into three separate companies.
The giant communications concern soared 6 1/8, or 10.6 percent, to 63 3/4, and accounted for more than 18 points of the gain in the Dow Jones industrial average. It was the most active stock on the New York Stock Exchange, with a huge 27.98 million shares traded. 
 Over all, the Dow gained 25.65 points to close at 4,792.69.
"The day had two potential negatives: the lack of follow-through by the dollar to the new Japanese economic package and the rise in the trade deficit," said Peter Grennan, senior vice president of Smith Barney. "But the AT&T news created a mystique over the whole list and produced a bullish atmosphere."
The broader market averages also rose. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index hit a record for the second consecutive day, climbing 2.57 points, to 586.77, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 4.77 points, to 1,065.09.
Advances exceeded declines on the New York Stock Exchange by 1,219 to 1,048. Big Board trading jumped to 400.1 million shares, from 371.2 million shares Tuesday and from the three-month daily average of 340 million shares.
Stocks once again also gained support from a rise in the bond market. The 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/32 , while its yield fell to 6.46 percent from 6.48 percent.
Brokerage stocks were one of the session's stronger groups, with analysts citing their belief that volume growth is sustainable and merger activity will continue. Merrill Lynch rose 1 5/8, to 63 1/2; Paine Webber, 1/4, to 19 3/8; Morgan Stanley, 1, to 99, and Lehman Brothers, 3/4, to 23 3/4.
Traders moved into the automotive group during the day. As a result, Chrysler increased 5/8, to 57 1/4, Ford Motor, 7/8, to 32 1/4, and General Motors, 1/2, to 47 3/4.
Some of the beverage issues moved into higher ground, led by Coca-Cola, which advanced 1 5/8, to a record 69 1/8, after saying that its drink shipments are expected to increase 7 percent in the third quarter. Anheuser-Busch closed at 60 7/8, up 1/2, and Coors closed at 18 1/4, up 5/16 .
American Airlines announced on Tuesday a new round of fare cuts and the Big Three airline companies all declined. AMR, the holding company for American, dropped 1 3/8, to 71, UAL, the holding company for United Airlines, 3 5/8, to 165, and Delta Air Lines, 2 1/8, to 69 1/4.
Chemical stocks also finished on the downside, as institutional money managers turned away from such cyclical issues. Dow fell 7/8, to 75 1/2; Du Pont, 7/8, to 70; Monsanto, 7/8, to 101 3/8, and Union Carbide, 5/8, to 40.
Food was another sector in which some big names wound up lower. Kellogg closed at 70, down 1 1/8; Quaker Oats closed at 33 3/8, down 1/4, and Sara Lee closed at 29 3/4, down 1/8.
Colgate-Palmolive, which announced that it would cut 8.5 percent of its work force, was one of the day's major laggards, sinking 4 5/8, to 67 1/8. Polaroid, which said that third-quarter earnings may be below analysts' expectations, declined 2, to 39 1/8. And Electromagnetic Sciences, which expects to report a third-quarter loss, tumbled 4, to 11 3/4.
After Carl C. Icahn asked for Federal Trade Commission approval to purchase at least $15 million worth of stock in RJR Nabisco, the shares increased 2 1/8, to 33. Merck gained 1 1/8, to 55, on an upgrading by Merrill Lynch. And Conner Peripherals, which is in discussions to be acquired by Seagate Technology, rallied 2 1/8, to 19.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Attack on Low-Income Housing

 BODY:
The Republican leadership has found a new way to pummel the poor: Cut programs that benefit them in the name of eliminating "corporate welfare." Embarrassed by accusations that the party's budget victimized the disadvantaged, Representative Bill Archer, chairman of the House tax-writing committee, pledged to go after corporations as well. So his committee passed a closing of tax loopholes that, he says, subsidize rich corporations.
His list of loopholes does include needless handouts to poultry farms and Hollywood studios. But it also includes a subsidy that has created most of the country's low-cost housing in recent years. Mr. Archer would eliminate the low-income-housing tax credit, a provision first passed in 1986. The credit goes to investors -- mostly corporations -- that provide money to nonprofit groups for construction or rehabilitation of low-income housing. 
 The credit, which would cost the Treasury about $3 billion a year at its peak, has led to construction of more than 100,000 housing units a year, or more than 90 percent of all low-income housing built in the country. The credit has financed about 4,000 housing units in New York State a year, 1,000 of them in New York City. Entire blocks of the South Bronx and other blighted neighborhoods have been taken back from addicts and gangs with money provided through the tax credit.
For a Congress that refuses to help urban ghettos directly, the tax credit is the only urban policy around. Yet Mr. Archer gallingly says the credit is a needless giveaway to corporations.

An Unexpected Treasure

BYLINE: By RICHARD E. MOONEY 

 BODY:
Patrick Egan, an Irish laborer from County Galway, opened an account at the Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank in lower Manhattan on the night of Sept. 30, 1850, when the bank first opened for business.
That nugget of information comes from a newly uncovered trove of data in the bank's records, shedding new light on the first mass migration to America -- the flood of refugees from Ireland's devastating potato famine in the middle years of the 19th century. It illuminates that dramatic era and the following decades with fresh human and economic detail. More broadly, it illustrates how the interpretation of history is constantly enriched by the discovery of something in someone's attic or, in this case, a bank's basement. 
 Emigrant was founded in 1850 at the instigation of the domineering Archbishop John Hughes -- "Dagger John" -- to help the hundreds of thousands of famine victims pouring into the city's slums, easy prey for gougers and exploiters of cheap labor. The bank offered a safe place to keep the newcomers' money and a way to send money home to destitute relatives.
Thousands had accounts. The records of those accounts and other bank business have been given to the New York Public Library, but they sat unexplored in the bank's basement until an archivist, Marion Casey, was asked to look at them last year. She found personal documentation "in incredible detail" and grist for "some ground-breaking scholarship."
For example, Patrick Egan. When he opened his account he told the teller he was single, a laborer at the Marine Quarantine Hospital on Staten Island, a native of Cormack in Galway, and came to New York aboard the "Howard" on May 28, 1841. His parents, Owen and Mary Quinn, were dead. His sister Margaret lived in New York and their sister Bridget remained in Ireland.
All of this appears in meticulous script on pages of heavy stock in 11 volumes with similar detail about other depositors. More than 40 other volumes record decades of mortgages and minutes of meetings where bank directors worked out problems in the Irish community.
When the ledgers are available for public inspection, in a few months, their contents will obviously fascinate genealogists and legions of Irish-Americans curious about their roots. But the curator of the library's huge manuscript collection, Mimi Bolling, points out that they also offer extraordinary insight for social and urban historians, enabling them to know who these people were, their occupations, employers and home addresses, and where they hailed from.
As a descendant of a young mechanic named Nicholas Mooney, who fled the famine in 1848, I am curious, too. RICHARD E. MOONEY

Testiness Up Top

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Why am I always the skunk at the garden party? It seems I have offended the most popular person in the world.
In a New Yorker interview with Harvard's Prof. Henry Louis Gates Jr., Gen. Colin Powell says about Bosnia: "William Safire and Tony Lewis say this will only take a little bit of bombing and it will work. No historical precedent exists for such a position." 
 Warming to his misleading diatribe (I have long suggested a whole lot of NATO bombing to protect the Bosnians, not a little), Powell went on to say: "And Safire drives me to distraction. Sometimes, because he starts down this logic trail, and every times he gets trapped he just says, 'Air power can do it.' Forget it. The technology isn't that good."
That's the straw man trick: Take your opponent's argument to a ridiculous extreme and then attack the extreme. My actual position was that we should arm the victims of aggression and support their defense of their homeland from the air. Of course ground troops are vital, but Muslim defenders, who greatly outnumber Serbs in Bosnia, lacked only weapons.
Powell paraphrased my criticism of defeatist diplomats as " 'There's no doubt in anybody's mind that if we'd done this three years ago' " and responded: "[Barnyard epithet deleted, though not in The New Yorker], Bill. But he does that" -- the "he" meaning me -- "He's getting increasingly arrogant in his old age."
Wow. That's some excoriation. Though my colleague chose to kiss the rod, it is my nature, when raked by suppressing fire, to welcome the engagement.
At 65, I am entitled to take on the geezer lobby about controlling Medicare costs, but do not feel the onset of decrepitude imputed by "in his old age." Do I charge America's best-selling author with making an ageist slur? On the contrary, I take it as an innocent idiom.
"Increasingly arrogant?" Moi? It's true I tend not to salute public figures, in or out of uniform, and I have been needling our candidate-to-be about his foreign policy mistakes. Evidently my failure to join in the mass adulation has made the general testy; that same snappish force-divider used to afflict Bob Dole.
Let us set aside the hoo-ha about abortion and school prayer amendments, where libertarian Republicans like me welcome Powell's positions. In that, a President can only exhort. Instead, consider foreign policy, where a President must act.
On stopping Saddam Hussein, author Powell asserts he was the lone voice around President Bush asking "if it was worth going to war to liberate Kuwait." That misconstrued the crisis, which was about leading the world to stop aggression; moreover, Powell's reported but unadmitted preference for continued economic sanctions would have led to disaster. We now know how close Saddam was to developing nuclear and germ-warfare weapons, which would have threatened U.S. troops if the counsels of delay had prevailed.
On allowing Saddam's Republican Guard to escape because killing them did not look good on television, Powell remains in denial: Incredibly, he insists that destruction of the Guard "would not have made a bit of difference in Saddam's future conduct." No reviewer has dealt with this strategic absurdity.
On Bosnia, see the top of this column about this Army man's contempt for NATO air power in supporting indigenous troops. The Weinbergerized Powell, again failing to see the principle of collective defense, recoiled at any less-than-popular action that might last longer than 100 hours. He considered the Serbs invincible without the commitment of hundreds of thousands of outside troops.
But look what happened when limited NATO air strikes -- not even rising to Level III of attacking tanks, barracks and major bridges -- destroyed Serbian command nodes, communications lines and prepositioned ammo dumps. Combined with well-armed Croatian advances ("lift and strike" at last) and the attacks of Bosnian Government troops, this air dominance demoralized and helped rout undisciplined Serbian troops that military experts long ago declared victors.
On the three big politico-military judgments of his career, ultra-cautious Colin Powell was wrong, wrong and wrong. No wonder he gets testy at such a reminder; chalk it up to the hubris of youth.

HEADLINE: THE SECOND BREAKUP OF AT&T: THE COMPUTER BUSINESS;
The Costly Marriage to NCR Becomes a Vision That Failed

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
When AT&T finally overcame the resistance of the NCR Corporation in 1991 and paid $7.4 billion for what was the nation's fifth-largest computer company, AT&T's chairman, Robert E. Allen, proclaimed a new era in which AT&T would make "global computer networks as easy to use and accessible as the telephone network is today."
That vision of a convergence of computers and telecommunications is held even more widely today, as businesses and consumers move to the Internet in search of the next generation of business technology. 
 But AT&T's stewardship of NCR, which it renamed AT&T Global Information Solutions, had done little, if anything, to advance that revolution, and AT&T is now quitting that particular struggle.
After years of losses, the new management of the division has decided its only hope of survival is to abandon the personal computer business, narrow its focus and return to its roots, providing hardware and software to retailers, financial services and communications companies.
Yesterday, AT&T said the troubled unit would again become an independent entity, one of three to be formed by the breakup of AT&T. And to begin realigning the company, AT&T said 8,500 of its 304,500 workers would be terminated, including 1,000 at its Dayton, Ohio, headquarters.
"AT&T thought they could throw their muscle around to make NCR what it wasn't," said Jon Oltsik, an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "They tried to diversify into everything, but they didn't have a plan."
AT&T will take a $1.5 billion charge against earnings in the current quarter to account for the revamping. Not including NCR's $7.4 billion purchase price, the write-down makes a total of more than $2 billion in NCR-related charges since 1991. The division lost $332 million in the first half of this year.
Lars Nyberg, the executive who arrived in June to turn around the troubled computer unit, said the cuts would allow the division to break even in 1996, just before it is expected to be spun off in early 1997.
"This company has not done what other companies have done in this industry," he said yesterday. "It has not reduced expenses as gross margins have declined."
Strong medicine is not new to NCR, which began life in 1882 as the National Cash Register Company in Dayton, Ohio, where it is still based. In the early 1970's, the company almost went under when its managers failed to recognize the growing importance of computers. After three-quarters of its workers were laid off, the company fought its way back to profitability and became a leader in automatic teller machines and high-end computers.
After cutting expenses, Mr. Nyberg said, he plans to increase revenue by focusing on the unit's strengths, rather than making PC's, where the competition from lower-cost manufacturers was too formidable.
He pointed to opportunities in the banking industry, where the pace of technical change is gathering momentum. He said that he also planned to exploit the company's lead in the area called data warehousing, in which retailers and other companies plumb huge data bases containing information about their customers to tailor marketing campaigns.
Because of the expense of the powerful systems needed for such jobs, data warehousing has been available only to large players like Wal-Mart. But next week, Mr. Nyberg said, he would introduce a line of machines to make the practice affordable for medium-sized and even small companies.
"It was a niche business, but it won't be a niche business anymore," he said.
The computer operation would enter the world as the smallest and weakest of the three new AT&T companies. It had $8.4 billion in revenue last year, and after the revamping it would be smaller, Mr. Nyberg acknowledged.
Most analysts believe that it will face an uphill fight. "Outside of their traditional banking and retail areas, they have lots of things going but none of them are leaders in their areas," said David Moschella, an analyst at International Data Group in Boston. "They still can't make up their mind whether they are a product company or a service company. That's a tough position to be in."

HEADLINE: Colgate Sees Job Cuts And Lower Earnings

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
The Colgate-Palmolive Company took Wall Street by surprise yesterday when it announced that dismal results in Mexico would lower its operating earnings by more than 30 cents a share this year and that it would cut 8.5 percent of its work force in a sweeping reorganization.
The company, whose products include Colgate toothpaste, Ajax cleanser and Fab detergent, said the revamping was not related to its problems in Mexico. The long-planned reorganization of manufacturing and administrative operations will eliminate 3,000 of the company's 36,000 jobs and close or consolidate 24 factories in the United States and Europe. The work force reduction is part of Colgate's third reorganization since 1987. 
 A restructuring charge of $369 million, or $2.54 a share, will result in a third-quarter loss, said Reuben Mark, the company's chairman and chief executive.
The effect on earnings caught the attention of Wall Street analysts. "This is a big jump downwards in earnings for any consumer products company, which as a group usually have small variances in earnings forecasts," said Terry Bivens, a consumer products analyst for Donald & Company. "That's why people buy the stocks, and it may take the Street a while to warm up to Colgate again. I remember once Sara Lee missed its earnings by a penny and got punished for it."
Shares of Colgate-Palmolive dropped $4.625, to $67.125, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
"The negative response in the stock price is primarily due to the announcement of the reduction in earnings," said Heather Hay, a household-products analyst with J. P. Morgan Securities. "This is a surprise. Everyone knew Mexico was weak, but the magnitude of this was not expected."
When asked why the company's projections were wrong, Mr. Mark said in an interview that "the Mexican Government projected a certain rate of recovery and that is not happening."
"The recession has deepened more than was anticipated," he added. As a result, he said, "the reduction in real wages forced contraction in the size of our markets" and led to a decline in inventories among retailers. It also prevented Colgate from raising prices to counter the effects of the devaluation of the peso last year, he said.
"It is probable that we would not want to raise prices aggressively in the immediate future," he added.
In an unusually long conference call with investment analysts, company executives said Colgate's earnings were expected to be between $3.57 and $3.60 a share for 1995, compared with consensus estimates of $3.95. The company said it was expecting earnings of $4.35 to $4.45 a share in 1996, compared with a consensus expectation of $4.68.
Although some competitors of the company, like Procter & Gamble, have also had problems in Mexico, the country represents "a much larger percentage of Colgate-Palmolive's business than Procter's," Ms. Hay said. "For Colgate it's about 20 percent. For Procter it's only 2 percent of their business."
Mr. Mark said Mexico accounted for 11 percent of Colgate's revenue and "a slightly higher" percentage of profit.
Mr. Bivens, the Donald & Company analyst, said investors were buying Colgate stock because of "the rapid growth in developing markets in Latin America and Asia."
"That's the real sizzle," he said. "Now, to a certain extent, that's tarnished."
Colgate-Palmolive executives said the company's Mexican business generated about $800 million in sales in 1994, and $170 million in earnings before interest and taxes. But in 1995, they predicted, the sales would be much lower, about $550 million, while earnings before interest and taxes could be as low as $90 million.
As for the restructuring, three-quarters of it will occur in North America and Europe, Mr. Mark said. He added that over the next two years, 24 of the company's 112 factories would be closed or "significantly reconfigured."
In its 1987 restructuring, Colgate took a $145 million charge and closed or consolidated 30 of its factories and offices. In 1991, the company took a $243 million charge and closed or consolidated 25 factories. The company now has operations in more than 70 countries and sells its products in 194.
"In the long run the restructuring charge will probably help the stock," Ms. Hay said.
Mr. Mark said savings from the restructuring would reach $100 million a year, after tax, in 1998.
Colgate provided sketchy details on the cutbacks because "we're trying to communicate with our own employees," said a spokeswoman, Anne Crawford.
However, a company executive said that some of the 1,000 workers in its headquarters at 300 Park Avenue in Manhattan would be let go. There was no announcement about any reductions among the 700 employees in Colgate's worldwide technology center in Piscataway, N.J.
In the United States, Colgate's detergent manufacturing operations in Jeffersonville, Ind., will be moved to unspecified sites, focusing operations there on toothpaste production. The company also said its factory in Hamburg, Germany, with 500 workers, would undergo "consolidation" with Colgate's factories in Salford, England; Anzio, Italy, and Compiegne, France.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Deficit Widens, But It Narrows With Japan

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 20

 BODY:
The nation's trade gap widened further in July, to $11.5 billion, even as the deficit with Japan narrowed for the fourth straight month, the Commerce Department reported today.
The report, which disappointed analysts, implied a drag on economic growth in early summer and aroused fresh criticism of the Clinton Administration's coordinated effort last month to raise the value of the dollar in world currency markets. 
 "Pushing up the dollar looks like a particularly perverse policy," said C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics who was an economic policy maker in the Carter Administration.
A strong dollar would tend eventually to widen the deficit by making American products more expensive to foreigners and imports more affordable here. But some analysts currently consider American companies to be highly competitive, with the trade gap resulting mainly from weak growth of Japan and other trading partners and from various foreign markets being less open to foreign goods than is the United States.
"We're competitive -- that's not the issue," said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities in New York. But he said that the big problem was that the United States "is still the market everybody can export to."
In the long run, according to textbook economics, the huge American trade gap is an inevitable result of the nation's saving too little to finance a high level of consumption. Foreigners essentially lend the United States the difference, obtaining the wherewithal by selling more goods and services here than they buy.
Indeed, the Clinton Administration traces the roots of today's large and growing deficits -- the seven-month total so far this year is 21 percent higher than in 1994 -- to the 1980's when the American savings rate slumped.
The modest $200 million widening of the July trade gap reflected a $1.5 billion decline in exports that exceeded a $1.3 billion decline in imports, today's report showed.
Although some analysts were concerned about a second straight month of lower exports, others pointed to common summertime factors like model changeovers in the auto industry that they suggested were not adequately captured by the Department's seasonal adjustment process.
"The manufacturing sector of the economy was on vacation in July," said Carol A. Stone, senior economist at Nomura Securities in New York. Analysts also noted a $550 million drop in exports of airplanes and parts, a category subject to wild swings.
Exports of motor vehicles and parts moved down $200 million but exports for April and May were both revised $400 million higher to reflect tires, electronic equipment and other items used to assemble cars in Mexico. The department said it had not gotten documentation for these shipments for January through June.
As for imports, the biggest category of decline was in motor vehicles and parts where Americans bought $400 million less over all despite a surge in purchases from Germany. The cost of imported oil fell $225 million as a price decline of $1.21 a barrel more than offset a small rise in volume.
The trade deficit with Japan narrowed $200 million, to $5.1 billion, with imports of new cars down $50 million. But the deficit with Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong soared to $1.1 billion from $200 million, perhaps reflecting a shift as some Japanese production has moved elsewhere in Asia.
The long rise of the yen, until this summer's reversal, squeezed Japanese exporters and prompted them to look for cheaper places in the Far East to produce their goods. The American deficit with China climbed $300 million, to $3.3 billion, in July.
The deficit with Western Europe nearly doubled, to $3.1 billion, while the deficits with Mexico and Canada, the biggest United States trading partners, each contracted by about $200 million.
At $11.5 billion, the July deficit was the biggest since the department began in 1993, retroactive to January 1992, to publish combined monthly figures for merchandise and services. But there were several quarters in the mid-1980's, according to Larry Moran, a spokesman, when the goods and services deficit was higher.
In trade involving advanced technology products, the July surplus shriveled to $250 million from $1.4 billion as exports fell five times as much as imports.

HEADLINE: Congress Moves Closer to Merging Banks and S.& L.'s

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 20

 BODY:
The Senate Banking Committee passed budget legislation today that moves Congress closer to eliminating the last differences separating the nation's savings institutions and banks.
The Senate committee's action follows a similar vote by the House Banking Committee on Tuesday night to combine on Jan. 1, 1998, the two industries' separate deposit insurance funds. The committees also voted to require savings institutions to make one-time payments totaling $6 billion early next year to top up their badly depleted fund and prepare it for the merger. 
 Congressional budget rules allow these payments to be applied against the Republicans' balanced budget objectives, which allowed both committees to make less deep reductions than originally contemplated in Federal housing programs, Federal flood insurance subsidies and other spending. Savings industry executives volunteered the idea of paying the $6 billion because the alternative was years of paying higher deposit insurance premiums to their crippled fund than banks are required to pay to their fund.
The House Banking Committee also voted to require federally chartered savings institutions to turn themselves into banks by 1998, while the Senate Banking Committee would require both state and Federally chartered institutions to make the transformation by then.
But both committees left for later many of the ticklish details involved in accomplishing this. The House Banking subcommittee on financial institutions is scheduled to begin holding hearings on the issue on Thursday.
The Senate bill passed without opposition on a voice vote while the House bill passed on a party-line vote of 26 to 20.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, began warning last spring that if savings institutions had to pay higher deposit insurance premiums than banks, they would be unable to compete and would eventually collapse, requiring a second bailout of the industry, at a high cost to taxpayers.
Today's action "is a major step to insuring that we don't have another debacle," Senator D'Amato said in an interview this afternoon.
The Clinton Administration recommended the merger of the funds in late July, and is in the final stages of drafting a detailed plan for converting savings institutions into banks.
Bankers initially opposed sharing their deposit insurance fund with savings institutions, particularly because the savings industry's fund will pay $793 million a year in interest through 2019 on bonds issued in connection with the bailout of the 1980's. A merger of the funds would require banks indirectly to bear part of this burden.
But with Congress and the Administration in favor of a fund merger, bank lobbyists have tried more recently to insure that savings institutions turn into banks. That is because savings institutions are allowed to sell certain types of insurance and engage in some real estate deals from which banks are barred.
Senator D'Amato also said today that he and Senator Connie Mack, the Florida Republican who is the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, would introduce a bill on Thursday to give the Federal Reserve the single goal of seeking stable prices. The Fed currently sets interest-rate policy under a 1978 law requiring it to pursue stable prices, low unemployment and stable long-term interest rates.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve and a Republican, is scheduled to testify on monetary policy before the Senate Banking Committee on Friday, and is likely to welcome the legislation. He has testified repeatedly in the past that a single objective would make the central bank more effective in controlling inflation.
But Alan S. Blinder, the Federal Reserve's vice chairman and a Clinton appointee, has argued that a single objective does not make a central bank any more effective against inflation, and might lead to an unnecessary braking of economic growth for the sake of modest reductions in inflation.

HEADLINE: Boom Seen in State and Local Tax Aid to Business

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
State and local tax breaks for big businesses are booming, a survey showed yesterday, the same day legislators in Ohio and Michigan called for an end to such tax breaks and cited a statement by more than 100 economists in support of their stands.
The survey, by KPMG Peat Marwick, covered senior tax or financial officers at 203 manufacturing, distribution and retailing companies with sales of more than $300 million a year. Of those surveyed, 40 percent said their companies were more likely to be offered incentives today than they were a year ago and 73 percent said such incentives were more likely now than five years ago. 
 "This shows that states are becoming more pro-business," said Kerstin Nemec, associate director of KPMG's business incentives group, which conducted the survey.
The number of state and local tax-incentive programs for business has grown to more than 600 from 450 last year, according to Joey Dixon, president of Mancon, a Greenville, S.C., company that tracks such programs.
KPMG said that 81 percent of those surveyed did not believe that tax incentives would give them a competitive edge because they assumed competitors were also getting such deals.
One-fifth of the executives said they believed negative attitudes about city and county tax incentives were prevalent, but fewer than half of those executives said their use of such incentives was affected by public opposition.
"Companies are generally aware of the incentives and view them as effective, but do not take advantage of them as best they could," Robert S. Peters, director of KPMG's business incentives group, said.
Ms. Nemec said that "governments are not doing a very good job of advertising what they have to offer."
Mr. Peters said the terms of most incentives were negotiated privately to meet the needs of individual companies, rather than by following objective rules. "Most of this is done in a clandestine nature, and the specifics are left to negotiation," he said.
The survey results come as the growth in such incentives is coming under fire from social critics as well as some lawmakers.
The Maryland Legislature held a hearing Tuesday on whether its tax incentives to business were worth the loss of revenue and burden on other taxpayers.
In Ohio, State Senator Charles F. Horn, a Republican who is chairman of an economic development committee, held a news conference to call for an end to such incentives. He released a statement from 100 academicians criticizing such incentives and said he would hold hearings on the value of them.
In Michigan, similar statements were made by State Senator Dick Posthumus, also a Republican.
Senator Horn said: "Handouts to individual corporations have become a zero sum game with no wealth creation. They are drying up money for education. I believe Ohio can show economic gains by unilaterally disarming in this war among the states."
Dan Pilcher, economic development program director for the National Conference of State Legislatures in Denver, said these attacks illustrated a growing skepticism about the value of state and local tax incentives. "You will have to look hard to find any rigorous evaluation of tax incentives," Mr. Pilcher said.

HEADLINE: Choosing the Joys of a Simplified Life

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: SANTA BARBARA, Calif.

 BODY:
ELAINE ST. JAMES slides back her closet door to reveal a spectacle shocking to most American eyes: one pair of black loafers and one pair of boots, two skirts, two pullovers, eight T-shirts and six turtlenecks. And that's all. As a 52-year-old author and former businesswoman, she could afford more. But she doesn't need it. So she doesn't buy it.
That sparse sartorial tableau has its financial parallel in the personal budgets of Joe Dominguez, a former Wall Street analyst, and his partner, Vicki Robin: they live quite comfortably, thank you, in a middle-class neighborhood of Seattle on about $6,000 a year each, interest on their nest eggs of $100,000 each. They could easily earn more. They choose not to. 
 Gloria Quinones of East Harlem took a similar path when she gave up her $74,000-a-year job as a Legal Aid lawyer last year to focus on raising her sons, Diego, 10, and Julian, 14. The family now lives on her husband's salary as a public school teacher, and though she may not be buying any power suits, she wouldn't want them anyway.
"I feel free," she said. "I've broken out of that loop and I don't want it back."
Choosing to buy and earn less -- to give up income and fast-track success for more free time and a lower-stress life -- involves a quiet personal revolt against the dominant culture of getting and spending. Enough small revolts are now taking place, researchers say, to make a phenomenon known variously as Voluntary Simplicity, Downshifting and Simple Living a major and growing trend of the 90's.
This summer, pollsters announced the striking results of a survey measuring patterns of consumption. From a nationwide cross section of Americans, 28 percent said they had downshifted and had voluntarily cut back on their income in some way over the last five years to reflect changes in priorities.
Commissioners of the poll, the Merck Family Fund, a private foundation in Maryland based on the drug company fortune, said the 800-person focus group and telephone sample also indicated that 82 percent of Americans agreed with the statement "We buy and consume far more than we need." (Thirty-five percent said they had "upshifted" in the same period, in what the researchers said was a more traditional process.)
Many of the downshifters were parents who had cut their consumption to reduce working hours, thereby gaining time with their children. But many were also just responding to the yearning "to reduce stress, get more balance, get a saner life," said Juliet B. Schor, a Harvard economist who wrote the "The Overworked American" (Basic Books, 1993).
Voluntary Simplicity is an idea more ancient than Ecclesiastes, with stops at Buddha, Jesus, the Puritans and Henry David Thoreau. What is different these days, say those who are charting the trend, is that the seemingly unnatural choice to slow down and cut down shows signs of going broadly mainstream, across age groups and class lines. And, they say, it is taking on new power in light of Americans' growing environmental awareness.
Nor is it just an example of people playing monk or "yuppie conscientious objector," they say. Centered in the Pacific Northwest and with a full complement of newsletters, study circles, conferences and manifestos, Voluntary Simplicity "is exploding -- it's growing very rapidly, it's mushrooming," Dr. Schor said.
The Trends Research Institute of Rhinebeck, N.Y., has chosen Voluntary Simplicity as one of its top 10 trends of the 90's. It predicts that by the end of the decade, 15 percent of America's 77 million baby boomers will be part of a "simplicity" market for things like low-priced durable gardening and home products that are short on slickness and status.
They will be joined, said Gerald Celente, the director of the institute, by youngsters now in their early teens. "They're going to buy into the idea that we're overconsuming," he added. "This is the first group that's been indoctrinated green."
Since the end of the conspicuously consuming 80's, a striving for simplicity and thrift has been showing up in fields as wide-ranging as construction (architects note a tendency to renovate rather than to build) and physical fitness (witness the growing popularity of walking, a sport that requires nothing but a pair of shoes).
"Good sense tells you, 'Hey, maybe my landscape design should be less about a big power mower and big lawns and exotica and more about natural grasses that take little water and a little garden plot," said Travis Price, an architect based in Takoma Park, Md. "And sometimes you've got this wonderful mix of what your grandmother used to do, which was very conservative, and environmental sensitivity, and then just plain dollars and cents."
Mr. Price said that one of his clients planted thousands of dandelions in her yard in Aspen, Colo., thereby choosing a natural profusion of cheery weeds over a manicured lawn that wastes money and water.
For those simplifying their entire lives and not just their lawns, texts for neophytes are doing a booming business. They range from Duane Elgin's seminal "Voluntary Simplicity" (first published in 1981 and re-released in 1993 by William Morrow) to the Dominguez-Robin blockbuster, "Your Money or Your Life" (Penguin, 1992), which its authors say has sold 350,000 copies despite their advice to save money by getting it from the library, and Ms. Saint James's "Simplify Your Life" (Hyperion, 1994) and "Inner Simplicity" (Hyperion, 1995). Simple Living, a newsletter from Seattle, is a favorite, as is The Tightwad Gazette, published in Leeds, Me., with more than 40,000 subscribers.
Despite all its philosophical underpinnings, Voluntary Simplicity is a path of practical details and idiosyncratic choices. Its ideologues are aware that one person's luxury is another's necessity.
Among the steps they propose are:
* Buy only what you need; don't go shopping for entertainment. Buy what you can used, and wear things out before replacing them.
 * Dump household clutter. Move to a smaller place.
 * Pay off your credit-card balance and eliminate all but one card.
 * Opt out of holiday gift-giving if it feels oppressive.
Mr. Dominguez and Ms. Robin, for example, do not urge followers of their book's nine-step program to try to live as frugally as they do on their $6,000 each. They simply ask readers to perform some simple bookkeeping exercises to figure out where their money goes and how much they spend just dressing for work, getting to work, eating at work and recovering from work, and to decide rationally whether they are willing to spend their "life force" on maintaining these habits.
"We're going around whispering in America's ear, 'Why are you doing this?' " Ms. Robin said.
Mr. Dominguez added, "I got the brass ring and it tasted just like brass."
He also said that the country's top economists now say an increase in savings should be a top priority -- something that requires the kinds of changes that his program preaches.
Ms. St. James made her changes in midcareer. Sitting on the rose-scented deck of her home in Santa Barbara, Calif., and fresh from an hour of meditation that once would have been a luxury, she described a moment of epiphany five years ago, when she was a successful real estate broker. "I was sitting at my desk one day, and my schedule was full of phone calls and appointments and meetings with people, and I realized this was just not what I wanted to do," she said. "I had finally reached a point I think many of us reach -- of despair. We're tired of these complex lives and never having time to ourselves. I think the despair is coming from our souls."
She and her husband, Wolcott Gibbs Jr., a writer, decided to simplify. She gave up real estate. They threw away masses of extra stuff. They moved from their sprawling 3,000-square-foot house into a 600-square-foot condominium. They stopped their junk mail and gave up their newspapers. Ms. St. James cropped her hair to save the time needed for blow-drying. She distilled her wardrobe to its current limited palette of black, gray and white. She reduced her purse to a rubber band around a credit card, library card, license and money. She even stopped making the bed.
But if anything sounds too austere, Ms. St. James hastens to tell her readers, don't do it. Simplifying, she and other leaders of this trend stress repeatedly, is not necessarily about living in the woods or quitting work, or about deprivation and asceticism: it is more about dumping what doesn't make you happy in order to have some time for what does.
Ms. St. James's dark purring BMW, for example, is a source of pleasure for her. She makes no apologies for driving it, though she does note that she bought it used. Neither does she mind the daily hassle of caring for her two dogs, the gracious Piper and the newly acquired Channing, a seemingly hopeless neurotic. "Talk about complications to your life!" she said.
Similarly, members of a Seattle Simple Living study circle, an informal group that meets regularly with no leader -- laughed easily at their own inconsistencies.
For Cecile Andrews, a former college administrator who now runs Simple Living seminars, cutting back means having the luxury of time to stroll with her husband for treats at the Honey Bear Bakery, a homey Seattle cafe known as a hotbed of midlife slackers and non-cooks.
Janet Luhrs, a nonpracticing lawyer and the editor of the Simple Living newsletter (3,000 subscribers), relishes the sensuality of preparing her own food instead of "working at my job to pay the microwave people."
Ms. Quinones of East Harlem said that in addition to spending time with her sons and husband, she had been able to take a dancing class, to explore art and to begin learning how to sew while continuing unpaid work as a community organizer.
"I'm working on the right side of my brain now," she said. "I can take time out to be more creative."
For many, the frugal ideas of simplifying are not so voluntary: they become necessities after being laid off in the corporate brand of downsizing that has become the hallmark of the 90's economy. Mr. Celente of the Trends Research Institute said that after picking Voluntary Simplicity as a top trend of 1994, he chose Involuntary Simplicity for the 1995 list.
But the "involuntaries" add to the Simplicity movement, researchers say, even though they come to it in their struggle to adjust.
The vast majority of downshifters, too, Dr. Schor said, are not mainly motivated to reject consumerism.
"What they are doing," she said, "is experiencing a change in values or new priorities on what's important and making different kinds of trade-offs. They're saying, 'I no longer want to sacrifice my time, my sanity, my stress level to make money,' and lower income goes along with that."
In a guide for Simple Living circles, Ms. Andrews wrote that often the biggest payoff of frugality is freedom.
"A lot of people discover they never liked shopping or consuming much anyway," she wrote. "It was like being hypnotized, following the directions of some evil genie. We're like kids in a candy store, eating everything we can until not only does nothing taste good, but we get sick and begin a search for something more nourishing."
 
 
How a Couple Scaled Down
 KATHRYN AND THOMAS HENCHEN of Holmen, Wis., followed a procedure for would-be simplifiers that Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin describe in their book, "Your Money or Your Life" (Penguin, $11.95).
The Moment of Truth In early 1993, they began keeping a log of what they were spending -- not only in money but also in time -- to support the way they were living. In all (including things like clothes bought for work, food bought on the job and carfare), their monthly expenditures were $2,500 -- or $30,000 a year. Together, they were earning $45,000 yearly -- but were devoting approximately a combined 110 hours to work each week, including time spent commuting, getting ready and recuperating. "We didn't have time for a life," Mr. Henchen said.
Cutting DownThey scaled back, economizing on everything from food to car repairs. They began using the library instead of buying books. "We also got free movies there and self-help tapes," Mr. Henchen said (savings: $550 to $700 a year). They switched to wood heat (savings: $250 a year), started clipping grocery coupons (savings: $250 a year), and Mr. Henchen began changing the oil and rotating the tires on their two vehicles (savings: $500 a year).
Cutting Debt After 14 months, they had paid off their mortgage of $50,000.
Gaining Time Because they no longer needed to pay a $500 a month in interest and principal on their mortgage, they figured they could work 50 hours less a month. In total, they cut their expenses to $900 a month. Mr. Henchen, 35, has gone from working full time as the head of a printing company to working part time in real estate. Mrs. Henchen, 36, who still enjoys her job as a full-time saleswoman for a photoprocessing service, says they use their added time to enjoy each other's company, see family and friends, garden and appreciate nature.

Treasury Prices Advance Despite Wider Trade Gap

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices gained ground yesterday for the second consecutive session.
The advance came despite a Commerce Department report that showed the United States trade deficit widened to $11.5 billion in July. The trade report also showed that imports of capital goods surged to a fifth consecutive record high, which did not help the market's cause. 
 Still, the price of the 30-year bond rose 9/32 , to 10514/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.46 percent, from 6.48 percent on Tuesday.
William Gamba, senior vice president in charge of the government trading desk at Cowen & Company, said trading yesterday was affected largely by technical factors, noting in particular the December bond contract, which pierced a resistance level of 11416/32 to 11418/32 in futures trading, forcing buyers to cover short positions.
Buying of Treasury securities is often ignited by players covering short sales, traders said. This occurs when some market participants sell borrowed securities, hoping to buy them back later at lower prices, pocketing the difference. But when prices begin to rise instead of fall, these participants have to cover their short positions by buying back the securities to limit their losses.
The buying spree in the futures market pushed the contract's price near its recent high of 11430/32 . But the contract fell short, hitting 11426/32 for the day's high before closing at 11423/32 . Still, Mr. Gamba said, "it's a positive for the market when the close is only three ticks off the high."
Mr. Gamba also noted that there were a lot of people hedging corporate issues and as the corporate debt was sold, they were buying back Treasury securities. "Right now I think the bulls are in command here," he said.
Traders expected the market will remain focused on tomorrow's testimony by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. His semiannual report on the economy precedess the Fed's policy-marking committee meeting on Tuesday.
"Everyone is eagerly awaiting the Fed chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony before the Senate Banking Committe on Friday," Mr. Gamba said. "And the market is hopefully looking for some clues from his testimony as to what may come out of the next week's Federal Open Market meeting."
The market was not distracted by the Treasury's announcement that it would sell $17.75 billion of new two-year notes and $11.5 billion of five-year notes next week. The size of the auction was unchanged from last month, and the announcement had no impact on trading, Mr. Gamba said.
In when-issued trading the two-year note was offered at a price to yield 5.68 percent and the five-year note at a price to yield 5.90 percent.
In the corporate debt market, bonds of the AT&T Corporation held steady after the company announced that it would split itself into three separate publicly traded companies.
The difference in yields, or the spread between AT&T's 10-year bonds and similar-maturity Treasury securities widened by 2 basis points, to 50, then narrowed back to 48. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The Standard & Poor's Corporation, the credit rating company, said it was not clear how the split would affect the credit quality of the company's securities and put AT&T's AA-rated senior debt under review. AT&T has $26.1 billion in debt outstanding.
the Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Company said it was reaffirming the senior debt rating of AA+ , saying that the collective actions taken by AT&T yesterday would have positive credit implications.

Profit Taking Weakens Dollar As Japan Issues Stimulus Plan

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the Japanese yen yesterday in profit taking after the Japanese Government released its economic stimulus package.
The dollar was further weakened after the Bank of Japan did not aggressively buy dollars in the market and after a Commerce Department report showed a wider United States trade deficit in July. 
 While the size of the Japanese Government's stimulus package was larger than expected, many dealers decided to take profits after the dollar's recent gains. When the expected intervention by central banks failed to materialize in early Asian trading, the selling continued.
"People have determined that it was the last bullet in the chamber for Japan's attempts to support the dollar and weaken the yen," said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics, an investment advisory firm. "There isn't much they can do besides intervention to prop up the dollar."
The dollar was hurt late yesterday after comments by C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics, who is thought to be close to the Clinton Administration. Mr. Bergsten said the United States should seek to push the dollar to 90 yen.
In New York late yesterday, the dollar fell to 102.70 yen from 104.43 yen on Tuesday. Against the mark, the dollar fell as low as 1.4583 marks before settling at 1.4613 marks, down from 1.4880 marks.
Currency dealers sought out the mark after German officials voiced doubts that France and Italy would be able to become part of a single European currency.
Finance Minister Theo Waigel of Germany said Italy apparently would not be able to join the European Monetary Union because it could not meet the criteria set by the Maastricht treaty.
And a Bundesbank council member, Reimut Jochimsen, also had questions about the ability of other countries to meet the criteria to form a single European currency by 1999, particularly France. France, which issued its draft 1996 budget yesterday, was seen as not going far enough to insure that it met the criteria.
"That was critical in creating demand for marks, creating a flight to quality," Mr. Gilmore of Foreign Exchange Analytics said.
Also yesterday , the Commerce Department reported that the United States trade deficit for July climbed to $11.5 billion, setting a record for the second straight month.

HEADLINE: THE 104TH CONGRESS: MEDICARE;
HOUSE G.O.P. PLAN DOUBLES PREMIUMS OF MEDICARE USERS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
House Republicans disclosed today that their plan to slow the growth of Federal Medicare costs would gradually double health insurance premiums for the elderly. It would also limit payments to victims of medical malpractice and encourage doctors and hospitals to join together in selling their services to consumers.
While putting forth new details, the Republicans failed to provide the text of any legislation and acknowledged that they were still short of their goal of saving $270 billion over seven years. They left Democrats and elderly people hungry for more specific information about the Republican plan to redesign Medicare. 
 Speaker Newt Gingrich predicted that millions of elderly people would voluntarily enroll in health maintenance organizations, and he said the Government could save $70 billion over seven years as a result.
But representatives of the elderly said it was unrealistic to expect a big increase in H.M.O. enrollment as a result of the Republican bill. And even Mr. Gingrich conceded that his estimate of savings was much more optimistic than that of the Congressional Budget Office, the official scorekeeper, which is analyzing the Republicans' still-incomplete plan.
The new details of the Republican proposal did nothing to end the tumultuous political battle that has erupted over Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for 37 million people who are elderly or disabled. Representative Sam M. Gibbons, a Florida Democrat who has been in Congress for nearly 33 years, dismissed the Republicans' latest summary of their proposal as "pabulum."
He asserted that the Republicans were stalling as part of "a very deliberate plot to put their program over before the American people have any chance to understand how it affects them."
Democrats asserted that the Republicans' strategy was apparent in their decision to hold a single day of hearings on the plan, on Friday. In protest, Democrats were preparing their own hearings on Medicare -- on the Capitol lawn, they said, because Republicans denied them space inside.
Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said: "We're just dealing with another press release today. We have seen no specifics in terms of numbers. No numbers approved or disapproved by C.B.O."
The House Republicans said they expected to save $110 billion by curbing payments to doctors, hospitals and other providers of health care in the next seven years. And they said beneficiaries would contribute $60 billion to $70 billion, mostly through higher premiums, especially for affluent people.
These savings, together with the $70 billion assumed from greater use of H.M.O.'s and other forms of managed care, would generate $240 billion to $250 billion of savings, which is somewhat less than the Republicans' goal of $270 billion.
The Republicans said their proposals were needed to prevent Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund from going bankrupt. But they said it was taking longer than they had expected to translate their ideas into legislation and to convince the Congressional Budget Office that their proposals would actually save $270 billion. The Democrats contend that the plan goes far beyond what is needed to keep Medicare solvent.
The Republican problems were illustrated at a news conference today. Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, distributed a statement saying: "With this bill, Medicare is saved. With this bill, Medicare is preserved."
But in reading the statement, Mr. Archer made no reference to "this bill" and spoke instead of "our proposal," because there is still no bill, and Republicans were unable to say when they would have one. Several lawyers drafting the Medicare bill are preoccupied at the moment, working on legislation to repeal the 1965 law that established Medicaid, the Federal-state health program for poor people. The Republicans hope to save $182 billion over seven years from that program, and the House Commerce Committee expects to finish work on the Medicaid legislation on Friday, three days after it was introduced.
Under the Republican plan for Medicare, elderly people would have many more options than they do now; they could enter the rapidly changing private health care market if they wanted. They could, for example, get Federal money to buy private health insurance, set up "medical savings accounts" or enroll in a new type of health plan sponsored by groups of doctors or hospitals.
Medicare premiums would increase, along with the cost of the program. Under the Republican proposal, the monthly Medicare premium, now $46.10, would rise to the range of $90 to $93 in 2002. If there was no change in current law, the premium would rise to $60.80 in 2002. Earlier this year President Clinton proposed changes that would raise the premium to $83 a month in 2002.
The House Republicans would increase premiums even more for Medicare beneficiaries with annual incomes above certain levels: $75,000 for one person and $125,000 for a couple. The premiums would increase most sharply for individuals with incomes of more than $100,000 and for couples with incomes of more than $150,000. Republicans declined to specify the increase, but initial calculations suggested that such people might have to pay premiums of $100 a month in the near future, rising to $195 a month in 2002.
The Republicans proposed other changes to control costs that they said had been imposed on the nation's health care system by malpractice lawsuits, and the threat of such lawsuits. Under the proposal, lawsuits could not be filed more than five years after an injury occurred. Damages for pain and suffering would be limited to $250,000 for each case. The House passed a similar measure earlier this year as part of a bill to make comprehensive changes in the legal system, but the Senate rejected the limits.
House Republicans also propose to relax antitrust laws to make it easier for doctors and hospitals to form networks serving Medicare beneficiaries. Doctors who collaborate in such arrangements would, in many cases, be allowed to set their prices in consultation with one another, a practice often prohibited as price-fixing under current law.
Doctors have sought this type of exemption for years, and Dr. James S. Todd, executive vice president of the American Medical Association, welcomed it today. Commenting on the plan, Dr. Todd said, "Our reaction is basically favorable." He said the antitrust proposals recognized that "physicians have been at a disadvantage in trying to put together our own networks" to compete with H.M.O.'s and insurance companies.
To save money, the Republicans propose myriad changes in the formulas used to pay hospitals, doctors, nursing homes and medical laboratories serving Medicare patients. Hospitals, for example, would receive smaller allowances for inflation in the cost of the goods and services they use.
Special payments to hospitals with large numbers of low-income patients would be cut by 25 percent over the next seven years. Such payments are expected to total at least $3.1 billion this year.
John C. Rother, chief lobbyist at the American Association of Retired Persons, said he was pleased to see that the House Republicans had moved away from earlier proposals that would have sharply increased direct costs to beneficiaries. But he said, "We are extremely concerned about the overall level of proposed savings, which may well reduce access to care and the quality of care."
Mr. Rother said he doubted that there would be "a big acceleration of H.M.O. enrollment as a result of this bill." But he predicted that such enrollment would continue to increase, because H.M.O.'s "do a good job of controlling costs" for their members. About 10 percent of the 37 million Medicare beneficiaries are in H.M.O.'s.
Studies have found that the Government typically loses money on each Medicare beneficiary who joins an H.M.O., because those who enroll in such health plans are healthier than the average beneficiary, and the Government pays the organizations more than it would have paid if those people had remained in the standard Medicare program.
But Republicans today brushed aside such concerns. Mr. Gingrich predicted that sick and healthy people alike would rush to join H.M.O.'s.
In any event, the Republicans would impose strict annual limits on Medicare payments to H.M.O.'s. The limits are intended to guarantee that total Medicare spending does not exceed the targets set in the Republicans' seven-year plan to balance the Federal budget.

HEADLINE: Gingrich Threatens U.S. Default If Clinton Won't Bend on Budget

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
House Speaker Newt Gingrich threatened today to send the United States into default on its debt for the first time in the nation's history, to force the Clinton Administration to balance the budget on Republican terms.
His comments, a more extreme version of the hardball stance frequently used in past budget showdowns, raised the specter that the looming standoff may begin to rattle financial markets around the world. Mr. Gingrich's remarks came in the middle of a day in which the dollar plunged as much as 5 percent against major currencies before recovering slightly, sending interest rates up sharply. [Page D13.] The Speaker's statement appeared to be one of several factors that added to the markets' unsettled condition. 
 More broadly, Mr. Gingrich's speech to the Public Securities Association, which represents traders in Government debt, underscored the growing agitation and sense of imminent collision in official Washington as both Democrats and Republicans move toward a confrontation that could shut the Government down this fall.
Throughout the capital, there was a sense that the current had quickened and the rumble of a great waterfall could be heard close ahead. Angry disputes broke out on wildly varying issues. Republicans threatened to block sending American ground troops to enforce the Bosnia peace plan, agreed to vast reductions in the protection for endangered species and Federal lands, and pushed ahead with plans for radical changes in Medicare and Medicaid. Democrats fumed and vowed to do what they could to slow the legislation's breakneck pace.
Clearly part of Mr. Gingrich's autumn end-game strategy is to force the White House to accept much of this agenda -- many parts of which President Clinton has vowed to veto -- by holding an increase in the Federal debt limit hostage. Without an increase in the limit, the Government will be unable to meet many of the payments due in November for Social Security, military pay and interest on the Federal Government's $4.9 trillion in debt.
Such confrontational techniques have been used in the past. But it was highly unusual for a high Government leader to suggest, as Mr. Gingrich did today, that default on Government payments was not beyond the pale.
"I don't care what the price is," he said in his speech. "I don't care if we have no executive offices and no bonds for 60 days -- not this time."
Without concessions from the White House across the board, he said, there will not be any increase in the debt ceiling. "And we'll see how long they will last," he added.
Administration officials were still trying tonight to figure out how seriously to take Mr. Gingrich's comments. A few months ago, the Speaker backed away from his off-the-cuff suggestions that the United States should recognize Taiwan as an independent country, a step that would lead to a breach with China.
But Congress has little direct influence over foreign policy. By contrast, its control of the Government's purse strings gave added force to Mr. Gingrich's remarks. Indeed, the Speaker's comments drew a quick and harshly worded response from Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin. "The President won't be blackmailed by the use of the debt limit as a negotiating lever," he said in a telephone interview from Miami, where he was giving a speech tonight.
"It would be unprecedented and unwise for anyone in a position of authority to dismiss the consequences of default on the debt of the United States of America for the first time in our history," he added. "Even the appearance of a risk of default can have adverse consequences, and a default itself would increase the cost of debt for the United States Government for many, many years to come. A sovereign country's credit-worthiness is a precious asset not to be sacrificed under any circumstances."
Mr. Rubin said he did not expect the United States to default on any debt payment, a step that he has repeatedly called "unthinkable." But even a serious threat of a disruption in payments can move the markets, and may send borrowing costs soaring for the United States.
The Treasury Department estimates that every increase of one percentage point in interest rates would swell the budget deficit by $4.9 billion this year. Republicans, however, argue that interest rates should decline if the ultimate outcome of the dispute between the parties is a big cut in spending. They contend that any short-term blips in the market -- because of conflicts with the White House -- would be washed away by long-term benefits.
Aside from all the Sturm und Drang in Washington, the debt limit debate has not yet had much effect on the markets, traders said. "One of the risks is that foreign investors will not understand what is happening here," said David M. Jones, vice chairman of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, which trades Government bonds. "And if they get nervous, they will just flee until it all sorts out."
The issue will take on added urgency in the first five days of November, when the Government must pay $50 billion in Social Security benefits, Medicare and pay for active-duty members of the military. And on Nov. 15, about $25 billion of interest payments are due.
As Treasury officials concede, a number of financial tricks are available to keep the Government afloat even if the ceiling on debt is not raised. There are temporary debt limits, emergency "cash management sales" to keep money flowing in the coffers as short-term loans, and borrowing against other Government reserves. But all of the steps come with a cost, and none can go on for too long.
The debt limit exists as an institution in Washington because the Constitution mandates that only Congress can authorize borrowings. Before World War I, every bond issued by the United States required separate Congressional approval. Today, the raising of the debt ceiling essentially permits the Treasury Secretary to make the day-to-day decisions required to meet the Government's obligations.

HEADLINE: Rudy Perpich, 67; Led Minnesota for 10 Years

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MINNETONKA, Minn., Sept. 21

 BODY:
Former Gov. Rudy Perpich, a dentist who became Minnesota's longest-serving chief executive, died today at his home here, outside St. Paul. He was 67.
His wife, Lola, said he had died of colon cancer. 
 Mr. Perpich served as Governor for 10 years, from 1976 to 1978, and 1982 to 1990.
He was known for his unconventional ideas, and some critics even called him "Governor Goofy." He once proposed selling the Governor's Mansion. At another time, he erected a billboard in protest when he was not allowed to have a portrait of himself with his wife in the Capitol.
But Mr. Perpich was known as a strong supporter of education, economic development and innovative public policy. He said the highlight of his career had come when the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, had accepted his invitation to visit Minnesota in 1990.
His first stint as Governor came about in an unorthodox manner.
In 1976, Gov. Wendell R. Anderson resigned that post so Mr. Perpich, then the Lieutenant Governor, could succeed him as Governor and then appoint Mr. Anderson to the Senate seat left vacant by Walter F. Mondale, who had left to become Vice President.
In 1978, Mr. Perpich was defeated by Albert Quie in the so-called Minnesota Massacre, when the Democratic Party lost the Governor's office, both Senate seats and control of the Minnesota House. But Mr. Perpich made a comeback in 1982 and remained Governor until he was defeated by Arne Carlson in 1990.
An immigrant Croatian miner's son who did not speak English when he entered school, Mr. Perpich was a product of the rough-and-tumble Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party politics of the Iron Range in the northern part of the state, where his parents, Anton and Mary, still live.
A former dentist, Mr. Perpich began his public career in 1956, when he was elected to the Hibbing School Board. He was elected to the state Senate in 1962 and elected Lieutenant Governor in 1970.
He contemplated another run for Governor in 1994, but he decided that Minnesotans were not ready for his ideas. He said he would put off a run until 1998.
In addition to his wife and parents, Mr. Perpich is survived by a son, Rudy Jr., who is called Nick, of Minnetonka, and a daughter, Mary Sue Bifulk of Plymouth, Minn.

HEADLINE: Encore for Suriname's Ex-Dictator?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: PARAMARIBO, Suriname

 BODY:
Thirteen years after the United States considered sending marines up the muddy Suriname River to force a left-leaning military dictatorship from power in this small South American country, the dictator who ran that Government is now running for President.
The ex-dictator, Desire Bouterse, a 49-year-old career soldier who helped stage one coup in 1980 and another in 1990, is now chairman of the National Democratic Party. As he heads into national elections scheduled for next spring, his popularity is growing. 
 "You can tell everyone that we're 'coming soon,' just like in the movies," Mr. Bouterse told a rally of about 1,500 supporters who gathered under a large steel shed here in the capital one night recently.
As bats flew over their heads, the people in the audience heard Mr. Bouterse attack his favorite targets -- journalists, human rights campaigners, the current Government and the Netherlands, Suriname's former colonial ruler.
He also tried to explain his concept of decentralized government and how, if elected, he would divide Suriname into local districts that would have far greater self-determination than now. People in the stiff seats yawned.
Political theory is not the reason Surinamese support Mr. Bouterse. The country's economy is in a shambles. The exchange rate, which used to be seven Surinamese guildens to the dollar, is now 450 to the dollar. Taxes are higher, but the streets are filled with potholes.
Mr. Bouterse promises to fix everything, and he freely uses his wealth and influence to buy support.
"He brought us chainsaws and then he buys the timber from us," Herman Joeroeja, a Carib Indian who lives in the forest about 50 miles south of Paramaribo, said of Mr. Bouterse (pronounced BOUGH-ter-seh). "If he does good to me, I have to call his name good."
As he campaigns, Mr. Bouterse tries to put distance between the image of a serious politician he now tries to convey and the dark record of killings, disappearances, arrests and other rights violations that marked his decade in power.
In an interview at his office at his party headquarters, he said it was "a black page in our history" when soldiers under his command rounded up 15 opposition figures and journalists on Dec. 8, 1982, and murdered them at Fort Zeelandia, on the Suriname River.
"But people fail to realize the different coup attempts that took place under those 15 people who were killed," he said. "If the central Government hadn't taken action, we would have had not 15 deaths but 1,500."
While the victims were involved in campaigns to restore democratic government to Suriname, there has never been any evidence that they were plotting to overthrow Mr. Bouterse, although there were at least two attempts to oust him from power in that year.
In 1982, the United States was uneasy about Mr. Bouterse's overtures to Cuba, Libya and the Soviet Union, fearing he would allow another Communist beachhead besides Cuba in the Western Hemisphere.
Within a few weeks of the killings, American officials proposed a joint military operation with the Netherlands in which the Dutch would seize control of Paramaribo while United States warships insured that Cuba did not intervene.
When the Dutch hesitated, the United States considered other options. In his 1993 autobiography, "Turmoil and Triumph," former Secretary of State George P. Shultz described President Reagan as willing to send in American troops without Dutch support.
Later, American policymakers even considered an improbable plan for a force of up to 175 South Korean commandos to stage a raid on Paramaribo and overthrow Mr. Bouterse. In his book, Mr. Shultz called the plan "a hare-brained idea," and said post-Vietnam fears about American troops getting bogged down in a foreign land kept anything from ever happening.
Now, independent polls show Mr. Bouterse's party far more popular than the ragged coalition that has ruled since 1991.
"Bouterse may be in a position to be kingmaker in the next elections or even king himself," said Prof. Gary Brana-Shute, a cultural anthropologist at George Washington University who specializes in Suriname. "Bouterse and his friends no longer need military power. They've built a shadow empire of businesses and investments in Suriname and internationally to make the National Democratic Party one of the richest groups in Suriname."
The Dutch, who had granted Suriname independence only five years before the 1980 coup, were deeply embarrassed by the turmoil there and cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid after the deaths of the 15 opposition figures and journalists.
Mr. Bouterse said he tried to line up aid in the United States, Brazil, India and Venezuela and was rebuffed. Only then, he said, did he turn to the Communist countries to seek financial assistance. He denied he was ever a Communist.
"Here in Suriname we have had a very strong aversion against so-called Communism," he said. "Most of the dogs in Suriname were called Castro."
A civil war in the 1980's forced some 10,000 Surinamese to take refuge in neighboring French Guiana and sent an already stumbling economy into a free fall. The Netherlands pressed Mr. Bouterse to give up power, and he allowed elections in 1987. Then, in 1990, he dismissed the Government with a phone call in a bloodless coup.
A coalition Government was elected in 1991, but Mr. Bouterse's party, which took 12 seats, remained in the opposition. He stepped down as commander of the military in 1992 and says he devoted himself to building the party and doing what was necessary to make ends meet.
As it turns out, he made ends meet nicely. His wife drives a white customized Mercedes-Benz, and he is considered one of wealthiest men in Suriname, with interests in oil, timber, gold and real estate.
"All those things give you ample opportunity to drive a Mercedes," he said.
A Western diplomat here said that while Mr. Bouterse has supporters, the chance of his party's winning the three-quarters of the 51-seat Parliament that would be needed to name him President is "practically zero."
"Besides," the diplomat said, "the simple fact is that the United States would oppose it and so would the Dutch."
The issue is no longer Mr. Bouterse's Communist sympathies, although his erratic behavior the last time he was in power makes it impossible to say where he would stand.
This time, the United States' interest is in supporting a fragile democracy in Suriname; any retaliation against a Bouterse presidency would likely involve halting any business investments rather than military intervention.
On Nov. 25, Suriname celebrates the 20th anniversary of independence. Ceremonies are to be held at the presidential palace, which was used by Dutch governors during colonial rule, then by Suriname's first elected officials and by Mr. Bouterse himself before being abandoned because it was so deteriorated that it could no longer be used.
The palace is now being repaired with $1 million in Dutch aid, an example of Suriname's continuing dependence on the Netherlands.
"The condition of the palace is the result of eight years without maintenance," while the elected Government was in power, he said. "If we win the elections, you should return in six months and you will see the difference."

HEADLINE: Bill to Tighten Economic Embargo on Cuba Is Passed With Strong Support in the House

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
Despite the Clinton Administration's last-minute threats of a veto, the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly today to tighten the trade embargo against Cuba.
By a vote of 294 to 130, the House backed a bill that seeks to step up pressure on Fidel Castro by discouraging foreign investment in Cuba, which the bill's sponsors say provides much-needed hard currency to prop up the Cuban economy. 
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher sent a letter to Speaker Newt Gingrich on Wednesday saying that he would recommend a presidential veto and that the bill would "damage prospects for a peaceful transition in Cuba and jeopardize a number of key U.S. interests around the world."
The bill, which awaits Senate action in the next few days, would require the Federal Government to deny visas to foreigners who own or benefit from the use of property confiscated after the 1959 revolution in Cuba. It would also allow Cuban-Americans to file lawsuits in American courts to seek damages from foreign companies that buy or use expropriated properties, such as rum distilleries.
"Castro is increasingly desperate for foreign currency," said Representative Dan Burton, the Indiana Republican who is sponsoring the bill, said during the floor debate. "That is why he has embarked on a campaign to encourage foreign investment at the expense of Americans who had their property confiscated. Our bill is the tool that will deny him his last hope for keeping his regime in power."
Senate Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, is sponsoring a nearly identical bill that he hopes to attach to an appropriations bill.
In fighting the measure, Administration officials argue that by tightening the screws on Cuba's economy, it increases the likelihood of a violent explosion rather than a peaceful transition in Cuba. The Administration fears that such an explosion could not only cause many deaths and a flood of refugees, but could also force the United States to send troops into Cuba.
The Administration particularly objects to the bill's provision that would, for the first time, allow Cuban-Americans who were not American citizens at the time of the 1959 revolution to sue foreign investors in Cuba for damages in Federal courts.
The Clinton Administration says this provision will clog American courts, offend American allies and violate international laws by giving American courts jurisdiction over disputes in another country.
"These provisions would create tensions in our relations with our allies," Mr. Christopher said in his letter. "We know that this provision allowing lawsuits is already being used by the Castro regime to play on the fears of ordinary citizens that their homes and work places would be seized by Cuban-Americans if the regime were to fail."
Representative Robert Mendendez, a New Jersey Democrat, defended the bill, saying it "was about standing up for American interests" and would "give American citizens the right to sue for properties that are illegally confiscated."
In Havana, Rafael Dausa, a spokesman for the Cuban Foreign Ministry, told reporters that the bill would not destroy his country's socialist system, but would impede efforts to reduce tensions with the United States.
Mr. Christopher recommended a veto even though congressional Republicans had already deleted a key provision opposed by the Administration: one that would prohibit sugar imports from countries with companies that purchased Cuban sugar.
While praising the bill's objective of bringing democracy to Cuba, Mr. Christopher criticized the measure for tying the President's hands by setting strict requirements on when the United States could resume aid to Cuba once it has a government moving toward democracy. He also attacked the bill for calling on the United States to cut aid to countries that help complete a nuclear power plant in Cuba or provide goods or loans to Cuba at below-market rates.
The bill would also require the United States to reduce its contribution to the World Bank or other international financial institutions if they provide aid to Cuba.
During today's debate, the House rejected in a 283-138 vote an amendment that would loosen the 33-year-old embargo on Cuba by allowing the sale of food and medical supplies.
Representative Lee Hamilton, the Indiana Democrat who led the fight against the bill, said, "The philosophy of this bill is that if you make conditions in Cuba significantly worse, you will prompt the Cuban people to rise up against their Government." He and other opponents argued that the bill would increase the pain for Cubans without speeding Mr. Castro's demise.

Rally in Dollar Stalls; Currency Is Below 100 Yen
The dollar tumbled against leading currencies, dropping to less than 100 Japanese yen, to 99.05, in a retreat fueled by tepid central bank support for the dollar and continued speculation about obstacles to a single European currency.

Time Warner and Turner Board Meet
The boards of Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting System held marathon meetings to approve Time Warner's proposed acquisition of Turner, but neither board had voted on the deal by late in the evening. [D6.]
 
Olympia & York Unit Agrees to Deal
The board of debt-ridden Olympia & York's U.S. arm agreed to a restructuring that may give control of it to a group of creditors led by the Bronfman family.

Canada Kills Ban on Tobacco Ads
The Canadian Supreme Court ruled that a ban on tobacco advertising violated free expression by improperly prohibiting a manufacturer from communicating with customers about a legal product. [A6.]
 
Shanghai Exchange Cited in Scandal
A new report blamed the Shanghai Securities Exchange for lax supervision and accused two securities firms of manipulating the market in February's bond futures scandal. [D3.]
 
JWP Settles S.E.C. Fraud Charges

Smirnoffs Keep Name in Russia
A Russian court has ruled that the American vodka Smirnoff, the world's biggest-selling vodka brand, cannot be sold under that name in Russia. The court ruled that the Smirnoff family had the legal rights to the name there, and Russia's Chamber of Appeals of the Patent Office ruled that Heublein Inc., the American producer of Smirnoff, had no permission to use the name. Heublein said it would appeal the decisions. [D3.]
 
Court Refuses to Lift Magazine Ban

HEADLINE: A Forbes Is Ready to Spend In Pursuit of the Presidency

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
"Pick a number," said Malcolm S. Forbes Jr. on the eve of his run for the Presidency, genially highlighting his willingness to dip deep into his family fortune in a dark-horse quest for the Republican nomination.
"I've seen everything from 10 to 40 million mentioned," he said of what he might personally spend on a blitz to become a household name and crash the Presidential sweepstakes from an offstage vantage of business power, social privilege and political zeal. 
 "I don't know what it's going to be," Mr. Forbes added, stressing that his bank account was not the crucial factor in his planned announcement here on Friday.
"I need to get the message across," he said tersely, as if money was indeed the simple capitalist tool that his late father celebrated and compounded in the family publishing empire led by Forbes magazine.
The message of this 48-year-old media mogul and electoral novice is that the current crop of contenders is too mesmerized by the budget-cutting debate to seize the opportunity that he sees for driving the American economy forward.
He prophesies a "roar" of record growth and prosperity from new, young entrepreneurs, provided that the nation has the right leadership and laws. He is approaching voters with a demand, more than a call, for slaying the serpentine income tax code with a simple flat-tax payment (17 percent beyond the initial tax-free $33,000 of income for a family of four). He is hiring a cadre of gnarled and knowing veterans of past political wars to see whether his money and message can spark something combustible.
"No human being outside of this town could possibly survive a more complex, corrupt, incomprehensible, frustrating, anti-growth, anti-opportunity monstrosity than the tax code we have today," Mr. Forbes, a rapid-fire, note-free orator, told an audience here earlier this week.
"After all," he said, "the Declaration of Independence runs only 1,300 words. The Bible is 773,000 words. The tax code is 7 million words and rising."
The political pros sense a fresh payday in Mr. Forbes, at a minimum. "He's got one thing that other candidates don't have: $25 million," said Edward J. Rollins, who is not in his employ but knew Mr. Forbes as a "superb" adviser in shaping Christine Todd Whitman's tax-cutting stratagem in New Jersey.
"Steve's a real long shot right now," Mr. Rollins conceded, "but with nobody happy with what's going on in the party process, if he could get a good 20 or 30 days' spotlight, who knows, he might break in with something people are interested in."
Mr. Forbes, a conservative editorialist and world traveler as a Republican appointee to the boards of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, has already been attacking the Republican front-runner, Senator Bob Dole, as a candidate who voted for various tax increases and now makes false claims of being the most fervid tax-cutter in the field.
President Clinton is pitied more than pilloried in Mr. Forbes's view. "He did not rise to the occasion," says the neophyte, "and he's reduced today to portraying himself as a kinder, gentler Republican."
In trying to be a politician, Mr. Forbes talks in terms of needing the "inner compass" of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, plus the ability of Jack F. Kemp, the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, to reach people with a message of supply-side economic growth. It was Mr. Kemp's decision not to run for the Presidency that prompted supply-side Republican strategists to implore Mr. Forbes.
"Steve's whole approach is bottom-up capitalism, as opposed to top-down," said Jude Wanniski, a political writer and close friend.
The candidate's inner sanctum includes John Sears, a former Reagan campaign manager, as principal strategist; William Dal Col, a former aide to Mr. Kemp, as campaign manager; John McLaughlin as pollster and Carter Wrenn and Tom Ellis, conservative veterans from the political operation of Senator Jesse Helms.
"Who but Steve do you hear in American politics today with such an unvarnished, unambiguous, unashamed defense of entrepreneurial capitalism and growth and jobs?" asked Mr. Kemp, an enthusiast who is withholding formal endorsement of any candidate for now. "Steve's music to my ears."

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Power To Punish

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Getting the Federal Government's hands off private institutions is one of the main aims of the new Republican leaders in Congress. So they say. What they do is another matter, as we learn from Representative Robert Livingston of Louisiana, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.
In July Mr. Livingston wrote to the presidents of three private colleges, Middlebury in Vermont and Bowdoin and Colby in Maine. He complained about their rules on fraternities, for example barring any that are limited to one sex. 
 At a public university, he said, such restrictions would be forbidden by the First Amendment's guarantees of free speech and association. And these private colleges got "significant Federal funding," Mr. Livingston said. He asked for an "assurance" that they would end their "discrimination" against fraternities.
The letter's legal premise was false. Courts, including the Supreme Court, have long held that public universities may exclude fraternities.
But the real message of Mr. Livingston's letter was of course not law but power. The threat that Congress would withhold Federal aid could hardly have been plainer.
That kind of muscled official intervention in the business of private universities is dangerous. Their independence is a vital creative factor in the American economy and culture, and there is a deep national interest in protecting that independence.
The three college presidents, who all turned Mr. Livingston's pressure aside, saw the point. William R. Cotter of Colby said to me: "If one Congress can say you must have fraternities, the next one can say you can't have them. These decisions should be for private colleges."
John M. McCardell Jr. of Middlebury said: "Maybe I've read too much John C. Calhoun, but I really believe the private institutions must battle this at the outposts. It's about holding us hostage to particular chairmen in Congress."
Why was Representative Livingston so exercised? The Chronicle of Higher Education, which disclosed his letters, reported that as a student at Tulane he belonged to Delta Kappa Epsilon. D.K.E. recently sued Middlebury, unsuccessfully, over its rule against single-sex fraternities. And D.K.E. is now using Mr. Livingston's letter in a fund-raising appeal to alumni.
It looks as though Mr. Livingston was using his position as a powerful committee chairman to carry out a private vendetta. So much for the claimed desire to keep the Government's cotton-pickin' hands off private institutions.
A similar threat is present in even more dangerous form in legislation to restrict "political advocacy" by nonprofit groups. Representative Ernest Jim Istook Jr., Republican of Oklahoma, is trying to attach it as a rider to a pending appropriation bill.
The Istook amendment would apply to any organization that gets Federal grants. However small the grant, there would be tight limits on what the organization could spend on "advocacy" from its own, privately raised funds: no more than 5 percent of those funds up to $20 million, 1 percent thereafter.
Moreover the private groups would have to submit reports to the Federal Government on their operations, and the groups would be subject to Federal audits: a heavy bureaucratic burden. They would be barred from doing business with any organization whose budget goes more than 15 percent for advocacy.
Mr. Istook's targets range from the Y.M.C.A. to the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, from foundations to universities. His definition of "advocacy" is so broad that it includes not only lobbying Congress but filing briefs in court.
Hitting out at private organizations is a strange course for a conservative. From Alexis de Tocqueville on, admirers of American society have attributed its success in good part to its multiplicity of private organizations: civic, religious and the like.
It is also odd for conservatives to overlook the danger to the First Amendment. They have been rightly outraged at the idea of "politically correct" speech. Yet under this rider any group that gets the smallest amount of Government money would have to give up its First Amendment rights.
The real reason for the rider appears, again, to be a vendetta. Republican radicals in Congress resent what some nonprofit organizations have advocated. So they are trying to use their power to punish.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
While the Children Sleep

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
He strolled out of his apartment in Manhattan. He knew where to get what he wanted, no problem. He was back soon with his packages, the way some husbands come home with ice cream or flowers.
He took some of the contents, and so did his wife. She died. The two little kids were asleep. They found out in the the morning. 
 Happens all the time -- heroin overdose, dead on arrival. But he was a young magazine publisher and she a stockbroker -- both up and coming and everything to live for. How could they do this to themselves and the kids?
Soon somebody wrote a letter to The Times explaining how it happened. U.S. anti-drug policies are to blame. The "demonization" of drugs prevented people from learning how much heroin at what potency was O.K. for holding good jobs without dropping dead. That failure to acknowledge the enduring appeal of drugs is the "larger tragedy."
This was from a professor. He also is a senior fellow at one of those pro-legalization groups supported by tax-free foundation money.
This column is not directed to people like that. They make their reputations and living by being professional legalization pushers; they are gone, goodbye. It is addressed to other people, in academia, or journalism, some lawyers, who simply believe that making drugs legally available would reduce drug crime and save the billions spent on fighting drugs.
They are worth arguing with because they are people of influence. Their activities, writing, their money to pro-drug foundations, help create a casualness, an acceptance, toward drugs that increases their use.
I ask them to rethink the consequences of what they do. Start by calling the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, (212) 841-5227, to get its new report, "Legalization: Panacea or Pandora's Box?"
I have read myself groggy with studies on drugs. This one by the center -- at Columbia University and headed by Joseph A. Califano Jr. -- is one of the most valuable. From now on, the legalizers will have to deal with it.
Briefly, with only a taste of the evidence the report presents, these are some of the points it makes:
The drug war has made substantial progress that would have been impossible without laws and public support. The number of "current" users -- those who used drugs within the last month -- has dropped from 24.8 million in 1979 to 13 million last year, nearly 50 percent -- but not evenly in all cities and neighborhoods. The number of hard addicts has stayed steady at about 6 million. Wrestling with them is the job ahead.
Marijuana is the growing enemy of American youth. It not only weakens them physically and mentally in their growing years, reduces the I.Q. of babies if used by pregnant women, but also is the gateway to harder drugs. Teen-agers who use it are 85 times more likely also to use cocaine than whose who do not, 17 times more likely to use cocaine in their adulthood. Almost all Americans who use drugs begin before they are 21. And youngsters say that the major deterrent to use of marijuana and other drugs is legal penalty.
More access to drugs through legalization or permissiveness will hugely increase consumption and addiction. That will cost far more than the $13 billion spent to fight drugs -- in increased hospital costs, spread of disease, and drop in economic productivity and student learning abilities.
Drug-gang crimes would decrease only if drugs could be bought almost everywhere by grown-ups and kids, wiping out all black markets. Even so crime would increase -- by drug-related crimes not related to the drug trade, like murder, rape and assault.
Foreign experiments in legalization or permissiveness have failed. In the Netherlands, for instance, adolescent marijuana use has increased 250 percent. Registered harder-drug addicts have increased by 22 percent. Italy has the highest rate in Europe of addicts enjoying the "enduring appeal" of heroin.
I'm a little sick of trying to persuade pro-legalizers by statistics and money talk. Leave your pocket calculator home, just go out and look at the shaking people with shaking brains.
But reading this report should be the ticket to talking about legalization. Go argue with it. If you still want more access to drugs, stroll down to buy a few packets for yourself and your wife, while the children sleep. No problem.

HEADLINE: In America;
If Colin Powell Runs

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Julio Rodriguez pointed toward a parking lot on the other side of Kelly Street in the South Bronx and said, "He lived right over there."
The tall fence at the entrance to the lot was topped with coils of razor wire. Several cars, a school bus and a boat were parked in the lot. The Bronx is a motley place. 
 At the far end of the block a subway train rumbled along elevated tracks, its noise unnoticed by the small groups of unemployed men and women, some with small children at their side, who had drifted out of tenement buildings to pass the morning, desultorily, with neighbors.
"If Colin Powell ran for President it would show that someone from around here could be somebody," said Mr. Rodriguez, who is 24. "I would like to see him run and win. Everybody thinks we are nothing.
"If he gets to be President, the best thing he could do is find jobs for people. I've been looking, looking. I've been down to Manhattan looking. But nothing."
Rafael Roldan, a quiet, older friend of Mr. Rodriguez, wondered, "If the general runs, what party would it be?"
Mr. Roldan, 47, is a self-employed contractor from Queens. "Light construction," he explained. "Siding, roofs, masonry. My wife and I own our own home, but business is very bad and we're having trouble making ends meet. People can't afford to do work on their homes anymore."
Mr. Roldan was told that General Powell might run as a Republican, or as an independent. He won't run as a Democrat.
Now there was quiet.
Noel Rosa, who is 18 and who had been sitting off to the side, looked up. "Would he really run as a Republican?" he asked. "They are so prejudiced. They don't care about us. They are more for the rich."
His eyes were a mixture of anger and hurt. For urban dwellers, and especially for the poor, the Republican Party as currently constituted is the enemy -- the source of endless destructive, mean-spirited and racist initiatives that are already taking a terrible toll on communities across the country.
It is difficult to see how the ideologues who control the party could accommodate General Powell, or how he could accommodate them. His expressed views mark the general as a Democrat. It is difficult to imagine how a G.O.P. uniform would fit.
"Maybe as an independent," said Mr. Roldan. "I could see that. But not as a Republican."
The unspoken question on Kelly Street was how, in good conscience, General Powell could serve as the standard-bearer of a party that is waging all-out war against the poor and racial and ethnic minorities (and which is hostile to the interests of the middle class as well).
The general knows there is a problem here. "To some extent," he said in a television interview, "those who are seeking the support of the Republican right occasionally almost go to the point of demonizing some of our fellow Americans who have not benefited fully in the American dream."
The problem is much deeper than that comment would indicate. To take just one example, could the general defend the policies of the Texas tax terrors, House Republicans Dick Armey and Bill Archer, who can't wait to slash the taxes of the very wealthy while cutting back on the earned-income tax credit that has proved helpful to the working poor?
As an independent, General Powell could take his inspirational, value-driven message to the American people unhampered by those kinds of grossly inequitable gambits. (God forbid he favors such inequities.) He could articulate a vision of America's economic future, address the tragic social and cultural deterioration of the inner cities, and he could heal many, many wounds.
As an independent, the general could serve as a trusted bridge between the lower and middle classes. For years, the insidious and blatantly racist strategy of the Republican Party has been to pit the middle classes against the lower classes, while sucking money from both groups up the economic pyramid to the smiling faces at the top.
There is a hunger among many Americans for a Colin Powell run at the Presidency. The folks who need effective new leadership are in the lower and middle classes. The ultimate irony will be if the general presents himself to these voters as the candidate of the party that has done so very much to harm them.

HEADLINE: Artists Need Some Affordable Space for Work

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As executive director of the Lower East Side Printshop, a not-for-profit organization providing work space for artists, I read with interest your Sept. 19 news article on the plan for an artists condominium in Peekskill, N.Y. I congratulate the developers for recognizing the economic power that artists bring to declining or abandoned neighborhoods. 
 I was shocked, however, to learn that rents of $1,400 and condominium prices of $125,000 were considered affordable.
While a world in which sipping wine with like-minded others after a productive day in the studio is lovely, the reality is that most artists cannot afford such rents -- the Lower East Side Printshop's monthly fee of $60 is often a stretch for members.
Work space at a reasonable price for artists is a rare commodity, and one that is diminishing steadily as city, state and Federal funding for the arts diminishes. In the last five years, the Printshop has seen support for its work-space programs from the New York State Council on the Arts fall from more than $24,000 to $5,000 this year, and we are grateful to receive that amount.
But the demand from artists for a place to work has not likewise declined.
The partnership of public and private investment that the Peekskill project represents is exciting and is the wave of the future. Perhaps there is an ambitious developer somewhere willing to create a plan truly within the means of artists. I know a few thousand people who might be interested.

Till Death Do Us Part
Some works of art are so important to a corporation's image that no matter what the circumstance, the art and the company stay together.
In Manhattan, at the Equitable Life Assurance Society of America, that means moving Thomas Hart Benton's 10-panel mural, "America Today," one block east from the Equitable Tower at 787 Seventh Avenue to its new location, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, between 51st and 52d Streets. 
 The 1930 mural, which depicts the country's economic and social life at the beginning of the Great Depression, has adorned the lobby of the Equitable Tower since the building's completion in 1986. Equitable bought the mural for $3.4 million from the New School for Social Research 11 years ago.
"Since it wasn't part of the original architecture, we feel comfortable moving it," said Pari Stave, the Equitable's curator.
The owner of the Avenue of the Americas building, Olympia & York, has worked with its new tenant to make the Benton work more visible from the street than it was in the Equitable Tower. "Originally there were plans for planting trees and for a flagpole at the entrance to the building, but these were done away with so the mural could be seen through the building's glass facade," Ms. Stave said. She added that increased security and proper lighting had also been considerations in planning the work's installation.
Consolidation is the reason for the Equitable's move, which is to take place next summer. "We have six locations in Manhattan, and we wanted to put everyone together," a spokeswoman for the company said.
But the Equitable will still sponsor shows in its gallery in the Tower, Ms. Stave said, although most of the company's 600 works of art, which range from drawings and photographs to paintings and prints, predominantly by American artists, will move to the new offices. "If we keep our dining rooms in the Tower, some of the art will stay there, but that hasn't been decided yet," Ms. Stave said.
In Los Angeles, Michael Ovitz's departure as chairman and co-founder of Creative Artists Agency to become the president of the Walt Disney Company has caused many in the art world to wonder about the fate of Roy Lichtenstein's "Bauhaus Stairway: The Large Version," a 27-foot-high mural that hangs in the atrium of Creative Artists Agency's I. M. Pei building in Beverly Hills. The work, which is based on Oskar Shlemmer's "Bauhaus Stair," at the Museum of Modern Art, was commissioned specifically for the 1989 building and bought by Mr. Ovitz.
A Creative Artists spokeswoman, Anna Perez, said the mural was owned by W&S Properties. Mr. Ovitz is a partner in W&S. Ms. Perez declined to comment on whether the company would be buying him out of his share of the artwork. "This is a privately held company, and such financial matters are never made public," she said.
At Mr. Ovitz's new office, a Disney spokeswoman said that Creative Artists would speak for Mr. Ovitz until he began work at Disney on Oct. 1, and deferred all matters to Ms. Perez.
 
Farewell, 57th Street
 Two veteran 57th Street dealers in Manhattan, Alan Frumkin and Grace Borgenicht, are calling it quits. "I'm retiring from the gallery after 43 years, but I will still be active as a private dealer," Mr. Frumkin said this week. "I will be dealing in drawings by contemporary and European masters." The gallery, which is at 50 West 57th Street and shows predominantly contemporary artists, has been run by Mr. Frumkin and George Adams for 15 years. Mr. Adams will continue at the same address, changing the name to the George Adams Gallery.
Grace Borgenicht, who has shown the work of American artists for 44 years, is also retiring. "Since I passed my 80th birthday, I decided it was time to call a halt to the gallery," she said. The gallery, at 724 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, will close at the end of October.
 
Moving Uptown
 For the first time in 10 years, Mary Boone will show a new artist. In January, Ellen Gallagher, a 24-year-old abstract painter whose work was included in this year's Whitney Biennial, will have her first New York solo show at Ms. Boone's SoHo gallery.
Ms. Boone, meanwhile, is looking at spaces on 57th Street. "It's time to move uptown," she said. "The atmosphere in SoHo has become unbearable. It's no longer art-oriented. Galleries first came to SoHo with the understanding that collectors like to see art in the context of where artists work, but artists haven't worked here for over 20 years. Now SoHo has become mostly low-end retail stores."
One space Ms. Boone has her eye on is Blum-Hellman's, at 20 West 57th Street. But Irving Blum and Joseph Hellman are involved in a lawsuit to dissolve their partnership, and at this point the future of the gallery is uncertain.
 
1997 Whitney Biennial
 The Whitney Museum of American Art has had a big week. Besides announcing a $35 million capital campaign drive and the New York City Landmarks approval of its expansion plan, the museum had news about its 1997 Biennial.
Lisa Phillips, a 20-year veteran of the Whitney, will be a curator of the show. She selected Louise Neri, the United States editor of Parkett, an international art journal, to be the other curator. Ms. Phillips described Ms. Neri's role as "a meaningful collaboration," but said she would retain veto power. Ms. Phillips is also bringing in consultants from around the country.
The Biennial, which has always been a survey of what is happening in contemporary American art, may be broadening its reach. Since Ms. Neri is Australian and Parkett is a European publication, she brings an international perspective.
"There's a possibility we will include European artists," Ms. Phillips said. "We're still in the process of defining the context of the show."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
In Two Days, the Dollar Loses Most of a Monthlong Advance

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled against other leading currencies yesterday, dropping below 100 Japanese yen in a retreat fueled by tepid central bank support for the dollar and continued speculation about obstacles to a single European currency.
In two days of profit taking, the dollar has largely given up its advance of the last month. Since Tuesday, the dollar has fallen 5 percent against the yen and 4.3 percent against the German mark. 
 However, in afternoon trading today in Tokyo, the dollar climbed above 100 yen.
Yesterday's decline marked an about-face for the dollar, which had been ascendant since hitting a postwar low of 79.75 yen on April 19. It hit 100 yen early this month and passed 104 yen on Tuesday -- a 15-month high -- before starting its fall.
The slide began on Wednesday after the Japanese Government announced a new economic stimulus program. The Bank of Japan had been expected to buy dollars aggressively on the foreign-exchange markets after the release of the package, and when such an intervention failed to materialize, currency dealers sold dollars and took profits.
The profit taking continued yesterday, and as the dollar fell through important technical levels, dealers became cautious that central banks would step in to force it back above those levels. But there was no sign that the Federal Reserve and other central banks were buying dollars, and the selloff accelerated.
In trading in New York, the dollar fell as much as 5 percent against major currencies before recovering slightly. The dollar settled at 99.05 yen, down from 102.70 yen on Wednesday. The dollar fell to 1.4235 marks from 1.4613 marks. The British pound rose to $1.5906 from $1.5503.
"It's the sort of correction you can often get when markets move a long way," said John Ryding, a senior economist at Bear, Stearns & Company.
And analysts attributed part of the dollar's weakness yesterday to a strong surge in the mark and the Swiss franc, which dragged on the dollar as a result.
On Wednesday, two top German monetary officials voiced doubts that France and Italy would be able to become part of a single European currency. Monetary turmoil in Europe typically prompts a flight to the mark and the Swiss franc, which are considered safe-haven currencies.
The dollar fell sharply against the Swiss franc yesterday even though the Swiss central bank unexpectedly cut its discount rate by half a percentage point, to 2 percent, the lowest level in 15 years.
In New York trading, the dollar fell to 1.1408 Swiss francs, from 1.1725 francs on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Dow Retreats by 25.29 As Dollar Falls Sharply

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
The stock market slumped yesterday, dragged down by a plunge in the dollar that raised concerns that foreign investors might retreat from American securities.
Shortly before 2 P.M., the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 49.49 points -- just shy of the level that would set off the New York Stock Exchange's 50-point "circuit breaker" rule. It was the second time this week that the Dow fell nearly 50 points in daily trading. 
 Yesterday, the Dow closed at 4,767.40, down 25.29 points.
The broader indicators closed on the downside as well. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 3.77 points, to 583.00 and the Nasdaq composite index fell 6.58 points, to 1,058.51.
"There was continued disappointment that earnings for the third quarter will be less than analysts thought they would be," said Robert Turner, chairman of Turner Investment Partners in Philadelphia. "But we were encouraged to see the market start to build back up."
Bond prices also pulled back from their lows, but were nevertheless sharply down for the day. The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond tumbled 1 9/32 and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.55 percent, from 6.46 percent on Wednesday.
Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange vastly outnumbered advancers, 1,435 to 828. Volume on the Big Board amounted to 367.1 million shares, off from 400.1 million shares Wednesday.
Financial services stocks were hit by a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia that lowered expectations for an interest rate cut at next week's meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee. Chemical Banking fell 1 3/4, to 58 3/4; Citicorp, 1 5/8, to 69 3/8; BankAmerica, 5/8, to 59 3/4, and Wells Fargo 2 3/4, to 85 1/8. A so-called bad trade on the New York exchange at midday in J. P. Morgan - which dropped 1 3/8, to 76 5/8 -- threw the Dow industrials out of kilter before it was corrected.
Technology issues were down amid widespread anticipation that many companies in this sector will not meet profit expectations. Micron declined 2, to 85 5/8; Cisco Systems, 1 1/2, to 70 5/8; Applied Materials, 2 5/8, to 102, and Advanced Micro Devices, 1 1/4, to 33 1/8.
Some analysts voiced concern after Microsoft said that sales of its new Windows 95 computer operating system have slowed from the introductory pace a month ago. The stock closed at 90 5/8, down 2 1/2.
Wickes Lumber, which slipped 1 3/4, to 11 3/4, noted that it expects third-quarter net income to be below the corresponding period of last year. Professional Sports Care Management, which projected that third-quarter profits would fall short of expectations, fell 1 1/8, to 7 1/2. Food and drug stocks were a general exception to the downward trend, moving higher as the earnings of cyclical stocks weakened. Pfizer gained 1 7/8, to 50 3/4, after it said that sales will jump about 20 percent in 1995, while Eli Lilly rose 1, to 90, after Merrill Lynch raised its medium-term investment opinion. Campbell Soup advanced 3/8, to 49 1/2; Kellogg, 1 1/8, to 71 1/8, and Procter & Gamble, 1/2, to 75 3/4.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Tumble On Big Jump In Fed Survey

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were slammed to the mat yesterday, flipped by a weak dollar and a regional Federal Reserve report showing a strong business outlook. That set back optimism for another rate cut by the central bank this year.
"Both the rise in the Philadelphia Fed survey of regional business activity and the weakness in the dollar tipped the scale," said Tony Crescenzi, head of fixed-income trading at Miller, Tabak, Hirsch & Company, a New York brokerage firm. 
 Others also cited technical reasons for the market selloff, in addition to comments by House Speaker Newt Gingrich to the Public Securities Association. To force the Clinton Administration to balance the budget on Republican terms, Mr. Gingrich threatened to send the United States into default on its debt for the first time in its history.
The 30-year bond fell 1 9/32, to a price of 104 6/32 to yield 6.55 percent, up from 6.46 percent on Wednesday. Yields on notes with maturities of less than five years were down even more because they are more sensitive to changes in Fed rate policy. For bondholders, the decline meant a loss of $12.81 for every $1,000 of bonds held.
The Philadelphia Fed's index, a gauge of manufacturing activity in the Mid-Atlantic region, registered a stronger-than-expected 24.4 reading in September, compared with 4.4 in August. That means about 43 percent of the manufacturers surveyed reported higher activity in September, compared with 27 percent that had reported increased activity in August. The report dashed hopes for an interest rate cut soon.
The survey does not necessarily reflect a booming manufacturing sector nationwide, traders said, but it is a piece of information that the Fed's policy-setting committee will consider closely. Economists said the report sent members of that committee a warning ahead of their meeting on Tuesday.
Also released yesterday were the initial weekly unemployment claims figures, which rose by 1,000, to 365,000, for the week that ended on Sept. 16. Some economists said the initial unemployment claims still indicated a tepid labor market.
Hamilton Davis, a vice president of government trading at Kemper Securities in Chicago, said, "It was an interesting day," adding, "We retraced two weeks of gains in the dollar, in just two days."
"For this one day at least," he said, "the negatives have overpowered the long-term positives of the market." Among other things, the Commodity Research Bureau index, a portent of inflation, rose 2 points to levels "we have not seen since May 1990 in the index," he said.
Mr. Davis added, "Recently, dealers have been rewarded by buying nearby support levels in bond prices, but today the selling overwhelmed the buyers at the first support level and drove us down about one-half point in price on the long bond before anybody could recover."
The Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, is scheduled to appear before the Senate Banking Committee today to testify on the economy, and the market is eager to hear what he has to say.
The Philadelphia Fed survey said manufacturers might no longer be trying to cut inventories, which some market participants took to mean production cycles would have to pick up to match demand again, meaning more hiring, more income and more consumer spending.
Carl Palash, chief economist of MCM Money Watch in New York, a market research and analysis firm, said, "One important point is that the index is close to levels of the 1994 fourth quarter, when the manufacturing sector and economy were both strong." That, he said, put "a damper on expectations that Fed will ease next Tuesday."
Looking ahead, Mr. Palash predicted a rise in September durable goods orders of 3.5 percent, "and I think the risk is that the purchasing managers report will jump to 55 percent."
Mr. Palash said that since the Fed put so much weight on the health of the manufacturing sector, strong numbers like those released yesterday would weigh on the Treasury market. The Fed report's price components also suggested that inflation was not as benign as many had thought.
In when-issued trading in advance of next week's Treasury auctions, the two-year note was offered at a price to yield 5.78 percent, while the five-year note was offered at a price to yield 6 percent. Both suffered from the market's sharp drop, with yields up 10 basis points from the previous day as dealers sought to generate interest in the issues.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Hold at a High Level

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits for the first time held at the highest level in nearly two months last week, the Labor Department said today.
Initial claims for state jobless pay were little changed at a seasonally adjusted 365,000 in the week that ended last Saturday, after unexpectedly shooting up by 22,000 the week before to 364,000 claims, the department said. the number of first-time jobless claims was the highest since 372,000 applications in the week that ended on July 22.
The closely tracked four-week moving average of claims, viewed as a more reliable gauge of labor market conditions than the more volatile weekly figure, jumped to 354,750 in the latest week, from 350,500, the department said.
The number of people already receiving state jobless benefits in the week ended Sept. 9, the latest week for which those data are available, declined by 33,000, to 2,623,000 from 2,656,000 a week earlier, it said.

HEADLINE: A Fever, Once in Retreat, Surges in Latin America

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 22

 BODY:
After being virtually eradicated in the Western Hemisphere, dengue fever, a debilitating tropical disease transmitted by mosquitoes, is re-emerging with such force that it has now reached epidemic proportions in Central America and is bearing down on the United States.
The resurgence, health experts say, is largely the result of rapid urban population growth in Latin America and the Caribbean, which has led to lax sanitation procedures, overcrowding and poverty. While dengue fever does not pose as large a threat to the United States, experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warn that states like Texas and Florida face the risk of an outbreak. 
 More than 35,000 people have contracted the disease in Central America in recent months, and El Salvador and Guatemala have declared states of "national urgency," allowing them to deal with the epidemic as a natural disaster. At an emergency meeting in Guatemala this week, health officials from Central American and Caribbean countries met to coordinate their responses and to plead for foreign economic aid to help control the epidemic.
"If control measures are not implemented immediately, the rates will be tremendous for at least the next three months or so," said Dr. Gabriel Schmunis, an Argentine physician who is director of the communicable disease program of the Pan American Health Organization in Washington. "This is the rainy season in Central America."
The disease has also reappeared in other places, including Mexico, where an eightfold increase in the number of cases has been reported this year, and among American troops in Haiti and hurricane relief workers in the Caribbean.
Brazil has identified more than 88,000 cases this year, and in Venezuela more than 15,000 people have been afflicted, leading the Pan American Health Organization to warn in a recent statement of "the growing threat of a full-fledged epidemic" throughout the Western Hemisphere.
Experts say dengue (pronounced DEN-ghee or DEN-gay) is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito and is characterized by the sudden onset of a high fever, rash, severe headaches, nausea and vomiting. In English-speaking countries, the disease is known as breakbone fever because of the excruciating pain in the joints and muscles that usually accompanies it.
Four basic strains of so-called classic dengue have been identified. There is no vaccine or specific treatment for the disease, but in its classic form dengue is rarely fatal.
But health experts say they are now concerned about the emergence of a more virulent and potentially lethal form of the disease known as dengue hemorrhagic fever, which is caused by the same strains as classic dengue. Beyond their enhanced virulence, the greater severity of the strains also seems related to the genetic susceptibility of the victims, according to the American Public Health Association.
As its name implies, hemorrhagic dengue causes increased permeability of blood vessels, which leads to plasma leakage, shock and death in about 10 percent of reported cases.
Doctors say that falling victim to one variety of dengue does not confer immunity to the others. In fact, experts say that people who have been infected with one or more strains of classic dengue seem more vulnerable to the more severe form of the disease. Antibodies acquired in the earlier infection, they say, may overstimulate the body's immune cells and make them more susceptible.
With all four strains of the disease now having been observed in Central America, the experts warn, conditions for the spread of the hemorrhagic form are ideal.
Statistics on the number of hemorrhagic cases and deaths in the current epidemic are fragmentary and difficult to obtain. Health workers in several countries say they suspected that there has been underreporting of the extent of the epidemic, in part because governments do not want to scare off tourists.
Dengue has long been endemic to the tropics, but after World War II, governments throughout the Western Hemisphere started a coordinated effort to wipe out Aedes aegypti, which also transmits yellow fever. By the 1970's, the campaign had largely eliminated the mosquito and the dengue threat, and governments, ignoring experts' warnings, began to relax their vigilance.
But small pockets of the insect were left in Venezuela and some Caribbean islands, providing Aedes aegypti with the toehold it needed for a comeback.
"The eradication effort was stopped too soon, and when it was stopped, efforts to keep the mosquito from reinvading also were not continued," said Dr. Duane Gubler, a dengue expert at the Centers for Disease Control.
Then in 1981, a severe epidemic struck Cuba, infecting more than 300,000 people. President Fidel Castro initially accused the United States of introducing the virus as a form of biological warfare, but researchers later determined that the disease had actually been imported from Vietnam by Cubans returning from jobs there.
At the same time, a new and hardier species of dengue-bearing mosquito, Aedes albopictus, known as the Asian tiger mosquito, was introduced into the Western Hemisphere and became entrenched in the United States. The tiger mosquito, which ranges as far north as Chicago, has not been identified as a transmitting the current Central American epidemic, but is regarded as a potential carrier.
Over the last decade, there have been periodic eruptions of dengue in the Caribbean and Latin America, though on a scale smaller than this year's epidemic. Such outbreaks can be avoided, experts say, if governments and citizens follow simple and low-cost sanitation measures that eliminate mosquito-breeding sites.
"This is an urban mosquito, and the population of the cities has increased, so more people are exposed," said Dr. Schmunis of the Pan American Health Organization. "That is especially the case where there is no running water and the larvae of the mosquito can grow in places where water collects, such as barrels and tires."
Facing growing pressure from alarmed citizens, several Central American and Caribbean governments have begun extensive spraying campaigns. But health experts say such efforts are largely ineffective, since fumigation kills only adult mosquitoes outdoors and spares both their larvae and those adults that are indoors.
But as a result of this week's meeting in Guatemala, the affected countries have said they will step up their education programs. In several Central American countries, soldiers and health workers have already been deployed to clean up breeding sites and explain to residents the relationship between the disease and their sanitation practices.
To assist in that effort, Britain has already approved a small special aid package, and Norway is expected to follow suit. Although representatives of the United States Government attended the Guatemala meeting and Washington has expressed concern that the disease may soon spread to southern and border states, the United States has not contributed to the emergency fund.
On the average, about 75 cases of dengue are reported in the United States each year, brought back from abroad by Americans visiting the tropics. Dr. Gubler of the C.D.C. cautioned that an outbreak of dengue "along the entire Gulf Coast, from Texas to Florida" is possible, but said a full fledged epidemic is extremely unlikely.
In the United States, "mosquito densities are lower, local mosquito control districts do good work, and the life style of humans is not really conducive to an urban mosquito-borne disease like this," he said.

HEADLINE: Forbes Makes Official Entry Into '96 Race

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
The publishing executive Malcolm S. Forbes Jr. formally declared his intention today to seek the Republican Presidential nomination, promising lower taxes to free the economy from "political repression."
Surveying the already crowded Republican field, Mr. Forbes said that there was "an empty feeling in the campaign so far" and that other candidates were limited by a "narrow, cramped and constricted" view of what the nation could accomplish. 
 Mr. Forbes, 48, the chief executive of Forbes Inc., also announced at the National Press Club here that he would take a leave of absence and hand over the reins of the family's publishing company, which includes Forbes and American Heritage magazines, to his brother, Timothy, while he campaigned. He plans to largely finance his undertaking from his personal fortune.
Mr. Forbes, known as Steve, took over the helm of the company after his father's death in 1990. He said he would continue to write a column for Forbes magazine.
Mr. Forbes said his candidacy, which is widely seen as a long shot, would focus on his optimistic view of the country's growth potential. Emphasizing tax cuts over deficit reduction, Mr. Forbes predicted that an economic boom would flow from his proposals for a flat income tax and for using a type of gold standard to stabilize the dollar.
"I see an American economy that is the most innovative and productive and technologically advanced in the world, hamstrung by high taxes and counterproductive regulations," he said.
Mr. Forbes has no political experience beyond a stint as chairman of the Government's Board for International Broadcasting and his service as an informal adviser to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey. His campaign will have its headquarters in Bedminster, N.J.
What he lacks in political capital, Mr. Forbes believes he can make up in money. He has said he is willing spend millions of dollars of his fortune, free of the spending limits that constrain candidates who accept Federal matching funds.

Time Warner and Turner Finally Agree to Merger
 Ending a tumultuous five-week courtship, Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting said they would merge, reinforcing Time Warner's position as the world's largest communications company. 
 Time Warner said it would buy the 82 percent of Turner it did not already own in a stock deal worth about $7.5 billion. But the transaction ran into immediate problems because of thorny management issues and a conflict between Time Warner and another partner, U. S. West. The structure of the deal also drew a sharp protest from two other major shareholders in Turner Broadcasting: Comcast and Continental Cablevision. [Page 1.]
 
For more than 30 years, if Ted Turner was on board, he was the captain, but not any more. Mr. Turner is becoming vice chairman of the merged companies. [38.]
 
Mitsubishi Bank Sells Bonds
 Morgan Stanley managed the sale of $2 billion of convertible bonds for Mitsubishi Bank, the largest international convertible bond offering on record, which comes despite a crisis in much of Japanese banking. [43.]
 
Hanover Sterling in Stock Charges
 The S.E.C. filed administrative proceedings against the former president and two traders of Hanover Sterling. The men were accused of manipulating the stock price of All-Pro Products, the company owned by Lawrence Taylor, formerly of the New York Giants, who apparently had big losses in the deal. [39.]
 
Investment Spending Rises 9.4%
 American businesses plan to raise investment spending by 9.4 percent this year, to $600.7 billion, the fourth straight increase. [39.]
 
Rubin Suggests Bank Compromise
 Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said the Administration continued to favor allowing banks to merge with insurance companies as well as securities firms, but might be willing to accept a less extensive plan that would allow mergers only with securities firms. [38.]
 
Currency Turmoil Hits Markets
 Turmoil in the currency markets spilled over into stocks and bonds in Europe, sending prices down sharply. In Frankfurt, the DAX index of 30 shares fell 75.53 points, to 2,211.79; the CAC-40 index in Paris fell 63.23 points, to 1,790.69, and in London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index closed at 3,514.8, down 43.1 points. [42.]
 
Stocks Fall in Erratic Trading
 Stocks slipped in the same kind of erratic trading that the market had endured for much of the week. The Dow industrials fell 3.25 points to 4,764.15, the S.& P. index declined 1.27 points to 581.73, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 5.12 points to 1,053.39. For the week, the Dow lost 33.42 points. [43.]
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.58 percent, from 6.55 percent on Thursday, as Alan Greenspan described a rosy economic outlook in his semiannual report to the Senate Banking Committee. [51.]
 
Controversy Over Implant Book
 In a forthcoming book, a former Dow Corning executive describes what he sees as his company's unethical and reckless handling of the silicone breast implant issue. But the company contends that two years ago the executive, John E. Swanson, suggested that it pay him for the rights to a book he was hoping to write on the implant issue. [10.]
 
Forbes Declares for Presidency
 Malcolm S. Forbes Jr. formally declared his intention to seek the Republican Presidential nomination. Mr. Forbes, the chief executive of Forbes Inc., said he would turn over the reins of the company to his brother Timothy. [10.]
 
Soybeans Fall on Upbeat Reports
Soybean prices tumbled on the Chicago Board of Trade after an early frost in the Midwest appeared to do less damage to crops than had been expected. Soybeans for November delivery fell 18.75 cents, to $6.45 a bushel. [36.]
 
Farm Subsidies Survive Vote
 A vote by the House Agriculture Committee this week stymied efforts to scrap the system of farm subsidies that thousands of growers of cotton, rice and sugar say is not only a safety net in their risky business but also a way to stabilize prices and supply. [6.]

HEADLINE: Bright Prospects on Georgia Farm

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: EDISON, Ga., Sept. 22

 BODY:
Bob McLendon is in high cotton at the moment, literally and figuratively.
For one thing, the price of cotton is nearly twice its value as loan collateral. For another, a vote by the House Agriculture Committee this week stymied efforts to scrap the system of farm subsidies that Mr. McLendon and thousands of other growers of cotton, rice, and sugar say not only provides a safety net in their risky business but also stabilizes prices and supply. 
 Earlier this year, as he was planting his 1,900 acres of cotton in this rural corner of southwest Georgia, Mr. McLendon's ears were ringing with the promises by deficit-hawks in Washington to squeeze savings of more than $10 billion a year from the Government's farm subsidies and to throw farmers like himself to the mercies of the free-market system. Such talk was about as welcome as a boll weevil infestation to farmers like Mr. McLendon, 54.
But on Wednesday, supporters of the subsidies on the House Agriculture Committee voted down a measure that would have begun phasing them out over seven years as farmers adjusted their production and crop selection to market realities.
The plan, called the Freedom-to-Farm Act and sponsored by the committee's chairman, Representative Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, would have cut $13.4 billion from farm subsidies over the seven years. It would have meant a major philosophical shift from the way Government farm policy has evolved over the last five decades.
As he walked his lush green fields near here, brushing against the cotton plants weighed down with unopened bolls, Mr. McLendon compared the subsidies to his irrigation system. "I like them for the same reason that I like the irrigation system," he said. "It takes some of the gamble out of farming."
But Mr. McLendon, who has been farming for a long time, says he refuses "to get too high or too low" over a rise in cotton prices or in winning a battle in the long-term war over Government subsidies.
While lawmakers in Washington talked of efforts to end welfare as we know it, legislators like Representative Saxby Chambliss, a Republican from this section of south Georgia, headed back home this weekend with news releases trumpeting their roles in beating back a measure that would have "ended farm programs as we know them."
Mr. Chambliss and others said that during the August recess, shortly after Mr. Roberts's measure was introduced, he and other lawmakers started receiving calls from groups like the National Cotton Council of America. The group, Mr. Chambliss said, sought "to educate all 103 of the newly elected members of Congress" on the importance of the system of Federal crop subsidies to their members.
Daniel A. Sumner, an agricultural economist at the University of California at Davis, said: "There is a conflict for the Republicans with their free-market zeal and their traditional dependence on the farm vote. It is not uncommon to find rural members running on contradictory platforms of cutting Government while supporting subsidies."
But even Mr. Chambliss conceded that Mr. Roberts's proposal is not dead. At the very least, the defeat of a measure sponsored by a powerful committee chairman and embraced by Speaker Newt Gingrich has altered the debate and pointed the way toward some possible compromises. Mr. Chambliss and others are hoping for a measure that would allow some farmers and crops to stay in a reduced subsidy program while other farmers could opt out.
"We have a Republican conference meeting next Wednesday," Mr. Chambliss, a freshman lawmaker, said in an interview, "and I would like to see the Agriculture Committee staff talk with the cotton industry between now and then to reach some accommodation. Going against the chairman was the most difficult vote I had to make, but my constituents are the ones I have to listen to."
The developments have angered some consumer groups, who had hoped for major change in the program, which come up for renewal every five years.
"But we're in agri-business-as-usual land here," said Kenneth Cook, head of the Environmental Working Group, a private organization that contends the current program lines the pockets of millionaire farmers and corporations. "The big boasts of the Republicans of the last election are all gone now that the politics of it all has hit them."
Mr. Roberts's bill would have allowed farmers to keep the payments on subsidized crops on an annually declining basis. The payments would be made to those with a five-year record of growing the subsidized crop whether they grew anything or not. The idea was to stabilize the farmers' incomes while they experimented with new crops or increased and decreased their old crops to meet market demands.
At the same time it would have removed rules governing how much of a commodity farmers could grow and eliminated the subsidy program that pays farmers the difference between what a crop sells for and the Government-set target price.
The main alternative to the proposal is the Agricultural Competitiveness Act introduced by Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi. In the House, there is a nearly identical measure, which Mr. Chambliss is supporting and which he says would save the same $13.4 billion over seven years as Mr. Roberts's measure.
Mr. Cochran conceded in an interview that his approach represented a push for "minimal changes" in the programs. It would keep the system of target prices but freeze them at current levels. The plan's main savings would come from a 10 percent reduction in acreage on which farmers would be eligible for crop subsidies. The proposal also retains a host of loan programs to assist United States commodities in a world market where crops from many countries are heavily subsidized by government.
According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Roberts bill would, in the first year, have actually increased total subsidies to cotton growers by $443 million. That is because the levels from which the payments would decline would be pegged to a five-year average of benefits, and that would take into account the disastrous 1992 experience of cotton growers when there was a world glut.
But that does not sway Mr. McLendon. For one thing he believes the Freedom-to-Farm bill would suffer politically because it would make aid to farmers look more like a welfare program. While Government subsidies are now aimed at controlling prices and supplies of commodities, Mr. Roberts's proposal would leave the decision over whether to grow to farmers. If they chose not to grow, they could still collect a Government check.
While Mr. McLendon is likely to do well this year, and not receive any Government subsidies because of the high price of cotton on the open market, that was not always the case. Last year, market price of cotton dipped below the target price of 72.8 cents a pound by about one cent, and Mr. McLendon collected $12,000 from the Government.
In 1992, the cotton-glut year, he collected $100,000 from the Government -- the maximum that he was allowed under the program of target prices. His wife, Barbara, under whose name another farm operates, also collected $100,000 in 1992.
Without such a program, he said, he and other farmers would probably not take the risk of growing cotton.
"There's no such thing out there as a free market and we need strong programs in order to compete," Mr. McLendon said. "The real winner in all of this is the consumer because prices are stable as well as supplies."

HEADLINE: THE 104TH CONGRESS: STUDENT LOANS;
Democrats Stall G.O.P. Effort To Curb Aid for College Loans

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
Accusing Republicans of catering to bankers and ignoring needy college students, Senate Democrats today stalled proposals to curb direct Government loans to students and to charge colleges a fee for every loan their students receive.
With senators eager to leave town by early afternoon, Democratic speechmaking in the Labor and Human Resources Committee delayed a vote until Tuesday to give educational institutions and their lobbyists more time to plead for votes. 
 Responding to earlier alarms from colleges, Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, the Kansas Republican who heads the committee, scaled back a proposal she made on Tuesday from a charge of 2 percent of all Federal loans issued to students at a college, to .85 percent.
According to Democrats, the change in Senator Kassebaum's proposal would mean, for example, that the City University of New York, with $60 million in loans each year, would pay $510,000. Under the earlier plan, it would have been charged $1.2 million.
"It's a tax, and it's a regressive tax on those schools that educate the neediest students in our country," bellowed Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, whose daylong passionate debating volume led Senator Kassebaum to ask him, mildly, to "stop shouting in my ear."
The fee is intended to raise $2 billion over seven years, down from $4.4 billion in Mrs. Kassebaum's first effort to find $10.8 billion in savings to meet the Congressional target for a balanced budget. The other elements in today's budget plan would do these things:
*Require $4 billion in additional charges and reduced payments to lenders and loan-guarantee agencies.
*Eliminate the six-month post-graduation grace period in which no interest is charged on loans, saving $2.7 billion.
*Raise interest charges on the PLUS program of subsidized loans to parents, saving $694 million.
*Limit direct Government loans to the colleges and universities now using them, or about 20 percent of all institutions nationally. Under new accounting rules adopted this year at Republican insistence, $1.5 billion would be saved.
Today's debate, singularly substantive for a Senate argument carried on in the absence of television cameras, concentrated on the charge to colleges. But Senator Kassebaum defended it, saying that colleges "were a major beneficiary of Federal student loans."
Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, disagreed, saying, "This is a tax on students.".
Mrs. Kassebaum shot back: "This is not a tax. It's an origination fee. The Congressional Budget Office scored it and says it is not a tax."
Mr. Harkin replied, "I don't care what you call it, it's a tax."
At that point, Mr. Kennedy intervened, saying: "If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck. This is a tax."
Indeed, two Republicans, Senators John Ashcroft of Missouri and Slade Gorton of Washington, also called the proposal a "tax." They were supporting an alternative proposed by Senator Daniel R. Coats, Republican of Indiana, that would have eliminated the charge, ended all direct lending and raised other fees. It was defeated, 9 to 7.
The House Educational and Economic Opportunities Committee plans to meet next Thursday to vote on its version of the plan, which would also eliminate direct lending.
Then the budget committees in each house will package the proposals from the committees that deal with education into the omnibus reconciliation bill. In the House, specific amendments to change that bill will be prohibited, but they will be allowed in the Senate.
The basic Democratic argument, joined briefly by Senator James M. Jeffords, Republican of Vermont, was that cutting spending for education was bad for the nation's future. "You're hanging a dollar sign on the door of every college in America, saying 'No Entry Unless You're Wealthy,' " Mr. Kennedy said.
The Republican response was twofold, first to contend that there was little real pain for students in any of their proposals. Mrs. Kassebaum said her origination fee would cost students at the University of Kansas only $13.26 a year.
And the Republicans argued, as Mr. Coats put it, "The very best thing we could do for students, present and future, is to embark on a course of fiscal responsibility."
On Tuesday, the Democrats will try to reduce the savings to $4.4 billion, all of it coming from lenders and loan-guarantee agencies. The Senate voted for that approach in May, but a House-Senate conference raised the figure to $10.8 billion. Mr. Jeffords has said he will vote "present," so that if all other Republicans stick with Mrs. Kassebaum, her proposal will prevail.

HEADLINE: THE 104TH CONGRESS;
Medicare Prognosis for New York Is Grim

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN 

 BODY:
With far-reaching cuts in payments to providers, the House Republicans' proposal to redesign Medicare would deepen the financial crisis that New York hospitals are already facing, forcing some institutions to close wards and others to close their doors or eliminate services, particularly in areas that serve the poor and the uninsured, health care officials warned yesterday.
The plan would eliminate or curtail many Medicare payments that subsidize doctor training and that compensate hospitals serving disproportionate numbers of indigent patients -- a move that would be especially painful in New York, which has more academic hospitals and poor residents than most other cities. 
 Health industry analysts estimate that the proposals would cost city hospitals close to $6 billion over the next seven years.
"If these proposals are enacted, they will result in a severe fiscal threat to many hospitals in New York," said Dr. John Rowe, president of the Mount Sinai Medical Center.
Hospitals in the New York metropolitan area, particularly in New York City, are still reeling from drastic budget cuts they have made over the last few years in response to the growth of managed care programs and cuts in Medicaid reimbursments.
In the last year alone, New York hospitals have laid off thousands of employees -- including doctors, nurses, lab technicians and housekeepers -- in the biggest cutback of the local hospital work force in decades.
Hospitals here have been trying to improve their financial health through a number of strategies, including consolidating departments, affiliating with doctors groups, clinics and suburban hospitals to increase their market share, and cutting the time patients stay in the hospital.
But while those and other cost-cutting measures have led to leaner, more solvent hospitals, executives at city hospitals and industry analysts said yesterday that they will be hard-pressed to absorb the latest proposed cuts.
"This is especially critical because of all the other changes going on simultaneously," said James R. Tallon, president of the United Hospital Fund, a philanthropic organization. "New York has a demonstrably higher problem and will be much more devastatingly hit because of the concentration of medical education activity and a huge share of the most needy."
New York hospitals train 15 percent of the nation's doctors and depend heavily on the educational reimbursements from Medicare to cover their salaries.
These young doctors, in turn, provide much of the front-line care in the hospitals at a cheaper rate, making the Medicare educational payments a kind of indirect subsidy to institutions caring for the poor and uninsured.
Half of the roughly 12,000 medical residents in New York hospitals are not United States citizens. These residents work, predominantly, in the less prestigious hospitals -- in the 11 public hospitals run by the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, for example.
Under the new proposals, salaries of doctors who are not United States citizens would no longer be reimbursed by Medicare, leaving many inner-city hospitals here and across the country with huge, unexpected holes in their budgets.
The proposals also call for ending reimbursement for the salaries of residents who have been certified in one area of medicine and are training in subspecialties, like gastroenterology or dermatology. The only subspecialty exempted from this provision would be geriatrics.
In addition to cutting some payments for medical education, the proposal calls for cutting by 22 percent payments for some of the indirect costs of training new doctors, such as extra lab tests that are ordered and the longer hours needed to make up for the slower pace of teaching.
The Republican plan also seeks a 25 percent cut in the disproportionate share adjustment for hospitals, a premium paid to hospitals that care for large numbers of needy and uninsured patients.
To compensate for some of these revenue losses, the plan calls for establishing a new Graduate Medical Education and Teaching Hospitals Trust Funds. But the proposal does not specify how much money would be placed in the trust and exactly how it would operate.
What is more, local hospital executives noted, the plan contains a so-called look-back provision, which means that if the government fails to meet its projected savings, it could retroactively reduce its reimbursement rates and assess hospitals.
"We figure that at best, these cuts will cause a $35 to $40 million annual hole in our budget," said Dr. Spencer Foreman, president of the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. "On top of which, the look-back provides a substantial unknown and a lot of exposure. There's no question, hospitals will suffer."
Already Presbyterian Hospital, one of the city's leading academic hospitals, is actively seeking to merge with another medical center in the city, convinced that it is the only way it can survive government budget cuts and the increased competition spurred by managed care.
"The cut in indirect medical education and the disproportionate share will be a big hit for us, very big," said Harold Hogstrom, the chief financial officer for Presbyterian, where 65 percent of the patients are on Medicaid or Medicare. "We don't want to change the nature of our institution, but there is a real danger in the industry that the quality of education and research and clinical care will diminish if the pace of cuts keep up like this."

HEADLINE: Clinton Acts to Save Los Angeles Clinics

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 22

 BODY:
President Clinton today announced a $364 million Federal bailout of the beleaguered Los Angeles public health system, a move that will save one of the largest medical complexes in the country and could enhance Mr. Clinton's chances of winning re-election.
During his 20th Presidential visit to the nation's most politically important state, Mr. Clinton said at a news conference here this morning that last-minute "critical consultations" on Thursday in Washington with California officials had produced a rescue package that would prevent the financial collapse of the huge county care system. The county system mainly serves the poor but has been hard squeezed to provide services in recent years because of soaring costs and major cutbacks in Federal, state and local aid. 
 A county-ordered shutdown in services was to begin in slightly more than a week, on Oct. 1, with the most dramatic closing taking place at the sprawling Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center, a familiar stage backdrop for millions of fans of televised medical dramas.
Critics of the proposed shutdown have charged that it was grandstanding brinkmanship deliberately designed to win aid concessions. Whatever the case, the concessions were won in timely fashion -- and without all that much resistance from the White House.
"It would have been criminal to allow all those clinics to close," said Mr. Clinton, who on earlier visits to California announced multimillion Federal money packages to help the state deal with military base closings and numerous natural disasters.
Those aid grants, according to political experts, have significantly boosted the President's standing in the state, especially in the Los Angeles area, the biggest population center. In 1992, it was this area that gave Mr. Clinton the edge he needed to carry California and win the Presidency.
In return for the aid package announced today, the county agreed to make its three dozen heavily unionized and bureaucratically bound hospitals and clinics more cost-efficient. Among other things, the county, at Federal insistence, will fully embrace the growing national trend toward greater use of economical outpatient treatment as opposed to high-cost hospitalization, the latter favored by many of the county's medical care managers and many members of the heavily unionized hospital workforce.
"It puts the onus on us to change," said one County Supervisor, Gloria Molina, who added that Mr. Clinton had come to the rescue with a plan that could become "a model for the entire country."
The medical care crisis here reached a crucial juncture earlier this year when county officials added up their budget books for 1995 and found a $1.6 billion deficit, a good third of it caused by rising medical care costs. They decided that one way to help balance the books would be to close most of the county's public hospitals and clinics, which provide free health care to the 2.5 million Los Angeles residents -- out of a total population of 9 million -- who are too poor to afford medical insurance.
Efforts to obtain extra money from the state Government in Sacramento were to no avail. The state itself is strapped for funds because of various strict tax caps and because it is lagging in recovering from the recent national recession.
And in any event, Gov. Pete Wilson, a candidate for the 1996 Republican Presidential nomination, has steadfastly opposed any monetary state bailout of Los Angeles, much as he opposed any monetary state bailout of adjacent, bankrupt Orange County. However, he approved the details of the bailout announced today, pointing out that it would cost California nothing.
Had the shutdown of the county's hospitals and clinics begun on Oct. 1, the expectation was that thereafter private medical facilities or facilities run by nonprofit organizations would begin to pick up the slack, however onerous that burden might turn out to be.
Many social welfare exerts called that shutdown approach too Draconian and characterized it as brinkmanship and a deliberate political squeeze play in a highly sensitive area. As layoff notices began to go out, some hospital workers, many unionized, began conducting "sickouts," with one beginning this morning before the President spoke.
Other critics of the move asked how the rest of the budget gap would be closed, only to be told that a way would be found. Thus far, a few modest cuts and layoffs have been made here and there, but nothing on the scale proposed for the health care system.
In previous years when the county budget got out of balance, the county typically took out short term loans, sometimes putting up public buildings for collateral, a practice that has been sharply criticized.

HEADLINE: Robert G. Dunlop, 86, Executive Who Led Expansion of Sun Oil

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
Robert G. Dunlop, a retired chairman of the Sun Company Inc. whose 23-year tenure as president led to a rapid growth of the Philadelphia-based energy company and its expansion overseas, died at the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania on Wednesday. He was 86 and lived in Bryn Mawr, Pa.
The cause was complications from a stroke he suffered last week, a Sun spokesman said. 
 Mr. Dunlop, who was named president of the company in 1947 at the age of 37, was a self-effacing man who often said he was "only a bean counter," referring to his early years with the company where he started as an accountant in 1933. He usually remembered an employee's name after the first meeting and would surprise them by addressing them by their name the next time he met them.
He expanded the company's interests in petroleum refining and marketing by acquiring the Sunray DX Oil Company of Oklahoma in 1968, which brought with it large reserves and production capacity. Sun markets gasoline under the Sunoco brand name.
Born in Boston, Mr. Dunlop graduated with honors with a degree in economics from the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania in 1931. After serving as the president of Sun until 1970, he was promoted to chairman and chief executive. He retired in 1974 but continued to serve on the board until 1991.
Mr. Dunlop was elected president of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry trade group, in 1965, and held the post for two years.
He was also closely associated with the Boy Scouts of America. In 1972 he was awarded the Silver Beaver Award for distinguished service to the Boy Scouts, and in 1974 he won the Roger S. Firestone Distinguished Citizen Award from the same group.
He is survived by his wife, Emma; a son, Richard, of Salt Lake City; a daughter, Barbara Hauptfuhrer, of Strafford, Pa., five grandchildren and a great-grandchild.

HEADLINE: Pataki Is Off to Europe, Recalling Roots to Voters at Home

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Sept. 22

 BODY:
For decades, New York politicians have made a tradition of traveling overseas, ostensibly to encourage tourism and trade. But there has often been a less openly acknowledged goal: old-fashioned appeals to ethnic voters.
Today, Gov. George E. Pataki -- a suburban Republican who remains best known for having unseated the state's three-term Italian Governor -- followed firmly in his predecessors' footsteps by embarking on a one-week, privately financed trip to Hungary and Italy. 
 Though the trip has been billed as part trade mission, part sightseeing tour and part search for ancestral roots, it is less officially viewed as a pitch to the Eastern European and Italian immigrants and their children who still dominate New York's electorate.
"For people in New York in particular, you are expected to remember your roots," said Edward I. Koch, who during three terms as Mayor traveled overseas at least 18 times on what he called working vacations. "The mayor is a representative of every racial and ethnic community in the city. And the governor is the same for the state."
Between visits with business leaders and government officials in Budapest and Rome, Mr. Pataki will visit the birthplaces of three of his grandparents: two from villages in eastern Hungary and one from southern Italy. Before now, he never visited any of these places.
"It's going to be just a very moving personal experience," Mr. Pataki said.
But it is likely to be politically useful as well. Italians are the largest ethnic group and the largest ethnic voting bloc in New York State, and Mr. Pataki's visit to his grandmother's birthplace in Reggio Calabria, where he hopes to meet cousins for the first time, is expected to generate warm stories in the Italian and Italian-American press.
"It's good politics," said Assemblyman Dov Hikind, a Democrat of Brooklyn and an ally of the Governor. "It gets a lot of attention in the media in the foreign country and in this country."
Hungarians are much less of an electoral factor here, representing about 2 percent of the state's population, or about 262,000 people. But identifying strongly with his roots will help Mr. Pataki broaden what many political analysts consider the public's narrow view of him: an upper-middle class, Ivy League-educated Republican from the suburbs. In a state whose electorate is still dominated by immigrants and their children, the Governor's trip could appeal to many of them, Hungarian or not.
"For a guy who went to Yale and came from Westchester, to establish immigrant roots in a state that is still tribal in its politics is important," said Gerald Benjamin, a professor of political science at the State University at New Paltz. "It's building out the base. He's trying to make connections to more people."
Mr. Pataki's aides say there is little political calculation behind the trip. "That his grandparents come from these countries, that may help a little," said the State Commissioner of Economic Development, Charles A. Gargano, who is accompanying Mr. Pataki. "But not much."
Mr. Gargano said Mr. Pataki would be addressing groups of corporate leaders and investors in both countries, bringing the message that New York is more business-friendly. "I think it is important that they hear it from the Governor," he said.
Among American states, New York is the largest exporter to Hungary and second largest to Italy. Last year, the state sent $42 million in goods to Hungary and $700 million to Italy -- a relatively small part of the state's total economic output, estimated at $413 billion by the Federal Commerce Department.
Still, many trade analysts seriously doubt whether trips by a governor can affect foreign investment, since most important trade issues, like tariffs, are controlled in Washington.
"Low-level attempts at facilitation like this probably fall in the feel-good category," said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. Mr. Hufbauer said that if Mr. Pataki truly wanted to spur foreign commerce in New York, he should focus on the state's largest trading partner: Canada.
But, he added, "It doesn't get any political kudos for the Governor to visit the Prime Minister in Ottawa."
Moreover, Hungary is not in much shape to expand its commerce or investments overseas, since it is still struggling to raise capital for its own, budding free-market economy. If any business ties are developed, they are likely to lead to New York money flowing to Hungary, and not vice versa.
Pat Choate, an author and former commissioner of economic development in Tennessee and Oklahoma, said trips by governors can help close deals with individual investors. "But to do broad-based, cold calls -- that says vacation trip to me," he said.
Government watchdog groups have also raised questions about the financing of Mr. Pataki's trip. The Hungarian American Chamber of Commerce of New York and New Jersey, and the Hungarian Government, are paying for the Hungarian part of the trip for the Governor and his group. Italy-Italy magazine and Alitalia, the airline, are helping to pay for the Italian part.
Accompanying Mr. Pataki are his wife, Libby; their eldest son, Theodore; Mr. Pataki's half-Italian mother, Margaret; Mr. Gargano, three aides and two state police officers. The administration has not disclosed the cost of the trip, but hotel and airfare for the group are estimated at more than $30,000. Mr. Pataki's campaign fund is also paying for incidentals, including some meals and transportation costs.
Andrew Greenblatt, executive director of Common Cause, called the trip a "big gift" from business people who might have dealings with the state. "It's not just that they're sending the Governor to inspect a factory," he said. "They're sending his family on a tour of Europe."
Mr. Pataki replied: "I think having the Hungarian American Chamber of Commerce pay for the trip makes perfectly good sense. We could justify it as a government expense, but I wouldn't do that. And I think this is a better way for taxpayers."
The Governor is certainly not doing anything out of the ordinary. His predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo, traveled to Israel, the former Soviet Union and Japan on trips that were billed as either economic development missions or personal pilgrimages. Each time, private interests helped pay.
Similarly, former Mayor David N. Dinkins accepted private donations for trips to Europe and South Africa, and encountered criticism as a result. Though he said he was no fan of Mr. Pataki, Mr. Dinkins defended the Governor's trip.
"If he's making a trip to promote the State of New York, I think that's a good and positive thing," Mr. Dinkins said.

HEADLINE: Comments By Fed Chief Hurt Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of longer-term Treasury securities fell in choppy trading yesterday, as the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, making his twice-a-year report to the Senate Banking Committee, described a rosy economic outlook.
There was some initial buying as a number of market participants interpreted his comments to mean there might still be room for further interest rate cuts somewhere down the road, but then the market pulled back. 
 The price of the 30-year bond fell 12/32 of a percentage point, to 10326/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.58 percent, from 6.55 percent on Thursday, when there was also heavy selling. About the only sector that saw substantial demand was the three-month bill, which outperformed all other maturities, as the rate fell four basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.17 percent.
"On the whole, the near-term prospects for the U.S. economy have improved in recent months," Mr. Greenspan said, adding that there was no evidence that relatively high short-term interest rates were slowing growth. Analysts said those comments seemed to suggest that the central bank would not rush to ease interest rates next week at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on Tuesday, but would wait at least until November.
"As for the prospects of an immediate rate cut," said Anthony Chan, chief economist for Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio, "Mr. Greenspan dashed those hopes." But, he added, "Mr. Greenspan's comments on the budget assured financial markets that his main carrot-stick was intact, indicating that the Fed would continue to take fiscal policy into account when formulating policy."
This suggested that the Fed remained open to the possibility of lowering short-term interest rates again in exchange for the passage of a credible multiyear deficit reduction plan, Mr. Chan said.
With the chances for interest cuts on Tuesday now remote, Mr. Chan sees next week's committee meeting as a nonevent. Still, traders were reluctant to make any big moves at the end of the week.
"Perhaps the most important piece of data to be released next week will be Friday's Chicago purchasing managers index," Mr. Chan said, as the market will be looking for a confirmation or refutation of the Philadelphia Fed's robust report.
Robin Mesch, chief fixed-income analyst for Thomson Research, in Portland, Ore., said, looking into the next quarter, that the uptrend in prices "is shifting into a consolidation mode and "looking more negative going into October and early November." She sees "a target price on the long bond going as low as 10821/32 , but at a minimum of 11023/32 ."
Ms. Mesch said that with a resistance price of 11411/32 , the uptrend of the last few months was not likely to continue. The market "shows no evidence that the selling has been shut off," she said.
In the municipal market, a trade group representing bond dealers criticized a proposal by a self-regulatory agency on Thursday to levy a fee on municipal bond trades to pay for that agency's operations.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Is Optimistic On Economy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, today painted an optimistic picture of the economy. His statements suggested to investors that the central bank would not lower interest rates anytime soon.
Indeed, Mr. Greenspan, speaking before the Senate Banking Committee, said there was no evidence that relatively high short-term interest rates were slowing growth. His testimony came just a few days ahead of the Fed's policy-making committee meeting on Tuesday and dashed any remaining hopes in the bond market for a rate cut at that time, dragging down Treasury prices. [Page 51.] 
 "On the whole, the near-term prospects for the U.S. economy have improved in recent months," Mr. Greenspan said, though he warned that the economies of leading trading partners -- meaning Japan and Europe -- could still impede growth in the United States "The inflation picture is looking more favorable than it did in early 1995."
Mr. Greenspan's comments came at the end of a tumuluous week for the dollar, which surged past 104 yen on Tuesday before falling 5 percent, to well below 100 yen. In late New York trading today, the dollar settled at 100.10 yen, up from 99.05 yen on Thursday -- leaving traders saying that at least for now the currency seemed hemmed in.
Some of the dollar's recent weakness can be attributed to the turmoil in European currency markets, which pushed European stock markets down sharply. The mark has surged against other European currencies -- as well as the dollar -- amid mounting uncertainty over Europe's goal of monetary union. [Page 42.]
And investors are leery of buying yen, for fear of another aggressive round of dollar buying by Japan and the United States to support the dollar -- just the fear that monetary authorities in both countries are trying to instill.
But the sharp drop earlier this week has also made investors nervous about bidding up the dollar, especially at a time of continued high trade deficits and uncertainty over whether Congress and the Administration will touch off the much-talked-about "train wreck" over the failure to reach a budget agreement.
A shutdown of the Federal Government, which the Republicans have threatened, would likely scare foreign investors.
As always, Mr. Greenspan went to great lengths today to say very little. He repeatedly sidestepped efforts to draw him into the argument, touched off by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, over the potential ramificiations if Congress refused to raise the national debt limit in an effort to force Mr. Clinton to accept Republican budget-cutting plans.
Mr. Greenspan warned against any conflict that would lead the Government to the brink of default on its debt, a step that he said, dripping with understatement, would have "adverse effects on the economy."
But he declined to say just how adverse, despite suggestions by Democrats that Mr. Gingrich was playing with fire, and could so scare foreign and domestic investors that interest rates in the United States would have to rise to make its bonds more attractive.
The Federal Reserve chairman repeatedly expressed confidence that despite the bickering on Captitol Hill, a budget pact would be reached in the next few months.
"I'm more optimistic at this particular point about actually pulling this off," Mr. Greenspan said. "I have no doubt that the net result of moving the budget into balance will be a more efficient, more productive U.S. economy in the long run."

Japan Buys Dollars
 By Bloomberg Business News
 The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen and the German mark in New York trading yesterday, bolstered by intervention by the Bank of Japan and comments by American Treasury officials.
In Tokyo trading, the Bank of Japan bought between $2.5 billion and $5 billion for yen, traders estimated. Although the Federal Reserve apparently did not join in, "wariness of central bank intervention is supporting the dollar," said Ken Nixon, currency adviser at the Bank of Montreal/Harris Bank in New York.
Later in the day, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said the Administration supported a strong dollar. And Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said the Group of Seven leading industrial powers were prepared to cooperate on currency matters.
In New York, the dollar fell as low as 1.4081 marks -- the lowest since Aug. 10 -- before recovering to 1.4247 marks, up from 1.4235 marks. The dollar rose to 100.10 yen from 99.05 yen, and to 1.1471 Swiss francs from 1.1408 Swiss francs. The British pound fell to $1.5685 from $1.5906.

HEADLINE: Capital Spending Plans Increase For 4th Year, U.S. Survey Says

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
American businesses plan to raise spending on plants and equipment by 9.4 percent this year, the fourth yearly increase in capital spending plans.
The Commerce Department said today that a recent survey indicated businesses planned to spend $600.7 billion on new plants and equipment, up from $549 billion in 1994. 
 The survey of 22,500 companies completed earlier this month shows spending increases were planned in every business segment except the services industry. And there, the decline was smaller than first estimated.
The overall capital spending plans are larger than the $592.9 billion projected in an earlier survey last winter, when businesses indicated a 6.6 percent increase. Still, the increase would be smaller than the 12.1 percent increase in outlays in 1994.
Capital spending has not declined since 1991, when the last recession was ending. The strong pace of investments since then has been a major factor driving the economic recovery.
"There are two main reasons for the ongoing investment boom," saidGordon Richards, an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers.
"First, the price of computers is declining, which amounts to a fall in the cost of capital," he explained. "Second, businesses have been trying to restore profit margins -- chronically depressed since the late 1980's -- by raising efficiency and cutting costs."
Manufacturing companies said they planned a 26.1 percent increase in spending, to $181.8 billion, much larger than the 20.2 percent advance in the earlier survey.
Businesses producing durable goods said they planned a 32.2 percent increase, to $100.6 billion. Nondurable-goods producers projected a 19.4 percent advance, to $81.2 billion.
Cold Metal Products Inc., a steel processing company with headquarters in Youngstown, Ohio, is among the industrial companies that plan to expand this year. It recently announced that it would increase the capacity of its Ottawa, Ohio, plant by 40 percent in a bid to gain market share.
"Clearly, the manufacturing segment of the economy is trying to raise productivity by employing more technology and machines," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis.
Although the service industry projected a 1 percent decline in investment, to $117.3 billion, the drop would be less than the 2.6 percent decrease forecast last winter.
But companies in other areas said they planned increased spending: finance, insurance and real estate industry, up 27.7 percent, to $47.1 billion; transportation, up 14.5 percent, to $37 billion; wholesale and retail trade, up 11.1 percent, to $75.7 billion; communications, up 10.4 percent, to $49.3 billion, and utilities, up 10.2 percent, to $41.8 billion.

The Fun Doctor Calls

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
What fun it's been. The Newt Revolution, that was fun. Nobody has been more fun than Newt himself, although Rush has run him a close second. Those bumper stickers saying "Rush Is Right" are fun bumper stickers, and listening to grouchy people phoning their grumps to Rush and to Rush shooting ideas from the hip like a kid with the latest water pistol -- that's been fun.
Bill Clinton, he's been fun. Not as much fun maybe as Newt with his sci-fi vision of the future and his dalliance on the primrose path with Rupert Murdoch. Still, you don't get that many Presidents who spend their whole first term trying to figure out why they wanted to be President in the first place. 
 It's been fun watching Bill try to work it out. Reminds you of the lady in the Gilbert and Sullivan song who "doesn't think she dances, but would rather like to try." Now Bill's working like an ant colony for a second term. Give him another four years, goes the pitch, so he can find out why he wants to be President.
Is that fun? You bet your sweet patootie it's fun. And fun, sweetheart, is what it's all about. It's fun calling these statesmen by their first names. But, hey! -- what's that with the statesmen number? These are guys, not statesmen. Just guys. Great, human, ordinary, plain-as-the-wart-on-your-nose, all-American, mud-between-the-toes -- guys.
Guys are fun, always saying "Let's drink some brewskis" and flicking towels at each other's rumps in the locker room. Guys have nicknames. Bill and Newt are fun names to say. Bob is a fun name, and Phil, and Pete, and Pat.
When you say, "Newt, Bill, Bob, Phil, Pete and Pat," you double your fun the way people used to do by chewing Doublemint gum. Now there's the fun of saying those fun guy names, then there's the fun of knowing they think we wouldn't make them President if we had to say, "Newton, William, Robert, Philip, Peter and Patrick."
It's fun knowing what they think of us -- that we're that kind of saps.
O.K., the fun has been great fun for so long that it's hard to remember it was just one of those things, just one of those crazy things, a trip to Newtsville on Limbaughish zingers, a trip to Billsburg where you meet real people who actually believe that gutting the welfare system is going to:
1. Make ignorant, hopeless, bored, hedonistic teen-agers quit producing illegitimate children;
2. Help millions of uneducated, socially incompetent people find jobs in an economy whose official economic goal is to keep 6 percent of the work force unemployed;
3. Smite all 50 legislatures with such kindliness for the old and the helpless that they will raise state taxes to save these wretches from being kicked out of nursing homes.
4. Make the liver bile flow at the rate of eight pints a day.
Sure this last is a joke, but we are talking fun here. If those guys in Billsburg and Newtsville really believe gutting welfare will result in Points 1, 2 and 3, they'll believe anything.
It would be fun to go on and on about the fun: the fun it's been committing character defamation against the Clintons, the nutty sport of Newt's best-selling literary career, the fun of turning off your brain and lapping up the sound bites.
Now, though, fun time is over, and we are finally seeing where it's been carrying us from the first. Dr. Kevorkian is now waiting in the parlor. He's about to be shown upstairs to finish off the government we have known for 60 years.
Is this what we wanted all along when the fun was so intense? Do we know what we're about to get in its place? Do the designers of the post-government age know what they're doing?
In a matter of days they have been dismantling and redesigning structures that took years to put up. Who knows what is in these hastily sketched plans? The sound-bite artists will fill the air with reassuring bushwah about it, but who really has the vaguest idea what the results will be? Best bet: nobody.
The architects of the new age are not really fun guys. They are hard-eyed white men with the high-rise-Texas view of the world. This holds that the world would be a paradise if government would just drop dead and let business folks do what's best for themselves.
The fun is over. Dr. Kevorkian is with the patient.

HEADLINE: Diluting the Quality of Life

 BODY:
The latest state budget makes a tiny change in court procedure that is expected to save the state $1 million. In the process, it threatens New York City's ability to combat littering, urinating on the sidewalk, public drinking and other quality-of-life offenses.
The city's interests have fallen victim to Albany budget cutters before, but seldom has it lost so much for so little. 
 The $1 million amendment relieves the state courts of responsibility for violations of the city's Administrative Code, which prohibits a long list of offenses to urban civility, from fishing off bridges to carrying an assault weapon. Disobeying the code is not a crime, but people fined for violations have always been processed through the criminal courts. The system gave offenders a sobering reminder that the city takes quality-of-life rules seriously.
Not surprisingly, the judges have always wanted to be free of this extra workload, which involves tens of thousands of cases a year. The State Legislature always resisted their pleas. But when Gov. George E. Pataki demanded suggestions for saving money, the Office of Court Administration happily proposed that taking the Administrative Code violations out of criminal court would be an excellent economy move.
The projected saving was only $1 million. Still, the Legislature complied. The unspoken plan was obviously to pass the expense of handling the cases down to the city. But the city has no administrative courts to handle the quality-of-life offenses. As a result, more than 50,000 citations for acts like littering and urinating on sidewalks may become void.
This sort of debacle is not unusual in Albany, and the city's lobbying office seems too weak or disorganized to head off such disasters. The State Legislature has the power to do the city endless mischief, and the Giuliani administration needs to be much more vigilant.
But the more immediate problem is what to do about the city's popular quality-of-life enforcement program. The City Council has moved to upgrade some of the Administrative Code offenses to criminal misdemeanors that can be processed in the courts. It is astonishing to realize that possession of a rifle, sale of a switch-blade and illegal disposal of medical wastes have not previously been crimes in New York City. Now, thanks to last week's Council action, a citizen caught strolling around with an AK-47 or grenade launcher can at least be punished by a whopping 16 days in jail.
The Office of Court Administration says the bans on public drinking and sidewalk urination can be prosecuted under other laws. For instance, it says about 85 percent of the 20,000 public drinking offenders the court sees each year could be charged with disorderly conduct. But it is hard to see how the court is going to save time or money by trading 20,000 simple administrative hearings for 17,000 criminal prosecutions.
Either fewer quality-of-life cases will be prosecuted, or the court will not get any savings. In seeking to pass the buck, the Governor and Legislature have created a no-win muddle.

HEADLINE: Exploiting Young Workers

BYLINE: By Patricia Cohen; Patricia Cohen is the political editor of Rolling Stone magazine.

 BODY:
The debate over raising the minimum wage is still stuck in summer reruns.
Worried that most Americans think of minimum-wage earners as affluent suburban kids saving up for nose rings and Nikes, Democrats insist that these workers are adults, hoping to evoke middle-aged mothers and fathers rather than young people. Yet what supporters of a wage increase should be arguing is that it is precisely because most of the lowest-paid workers are young that the minimum should be raised. 
 "A popular misconception is that the minimum wage is basically paid to teen-agers who flip burgers in their spare time," Senator Paul Wellstone, a Democrat, said recently on the Senate floor, expressing a typical comment. "But less than one in three minimum- wage workers are teen-agers." True enough. Yet more than half of those who earn the lowest wages -- the 4.1 million who earn $4.25 an hour or less -- are under 25; nearly two-thirds are under 30. Those proportions are similar for the 8.5 million or so who earn less than $5.15 an hour and clearly could use the 90-cent rise in the minimum wage proposed by President Clinton.
Many of these young workers are unskilled, with few prospects for higher-paying jobs. Young high school-educated men have been hardest hit; those under 25 earn 27 percent less today than they would have 15 years ago, according to the Economic Policy Institute. High school-educated women earn 17 percent less.
Other young people who are only temporarily in low-paying positions are often saving for college or covering the cost of tuition, room and board and books, which has soared to $19,000 a year on average at private institutions. The average college student works 25 hours a week, earning the minimum wage or close to it. Ken Redd, a research analyst for the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, says there's no question that 18- to 24-year-olds "are working more than they would otherwise because of costs."
That burden will increase as Republicans chip away at student aid programs. Already, Congress has cut $10 billion from Stafford Loans, the largest program, over the next seven years, affecting five million students each year. On average undergraduates will have to come up with an extra $3,100 and graduate students an extra $9,400 each year if that cut is maintained, according to the Office of Management and Budget.
Smaller student programs are also at risk. House Republicans have cut off all Pell Grants to as many as 360,000 students from families with annual incomes between $20,000 and $30,000. Cuts to the Perkins Loan program would eliminate money for 150,000 students, while reduced Federal aid to State Student Incentive Grants for state scholarship funds would affect an additional 212,000 students. All this means that working students need a living wage more than ever.
Critics of an increase in the minimum wage argue that it would throw some people out of work. But a growing body of research has shown that raising the minimum wage did not increase unemployment in the past.
Reversing the declining prospects of young workers should be a national priority. But even Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who has promised to force a vote before the end of this Congressional session on the President's proposed increase, avoids connecting the dots. The last time he raised the issue on the Senate floor, he and other Democratic supporters barely mentioned that raising the minimum wage would help Americans in their late teens and 20's. Instead, the talk was mostly about the poor -- the constituency the Republicans have demonstrated the least interest in helping.
A Times Mirror poll found that Americans in every age group surveyed overwhelmingly supported raising the minimum wage, but the highest approval numbers -- 81 percent -- came from 18- to 29-year-olds.
The minimum wage is just the latest in a long line of issues in which the interests of young people have been obscured. Medicare and Social Security are perceived as issues of the elderly, but it is young workers who are paying for those programs and who are likely to end up with sharply reduced benefits themselves.
Is it any coincidence that disaffection from the political process among young voters is at an all-time high?

The Boss's Last Exit From Bronx

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN 

 BODY:
HEAVY morning rains didn't dampen the pace around 161st Street and River Avenue. A handful of joggers ran in Joe Yancey Park as the owners of tiny tobacco stores and variety shops lifted rickety security gates and elevated trains rumbled overhead.
Presiding like the regal nerve center was Yankee Stadium, the crown jewel of the beleaguered South Bronx. 
 On Thursday the Yankees completed a sweep of Toronto to keep pace with Seattle in a mad chase for a wild-card berth. Virtually one game stands between the Yankees and their first post-season appearance since 1981.
The area around the stadium is bursting with activity, but it is not bristling with the excitement of a chase. The Toronto series was slow. The entire season has been slow.
Only 17,766 tickets were sold for Thursday's game, an average of about 17,300 for the series and less than 24,000 this season.
George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' owner, blames the low numbers on the reluctance of fans to visit the South Bronx.
Earlier this week Steinbrenner, who had already rejected a $500 million package from New York City, escalated his threats to move to New Jersey. Responding to a proposal for a 50,000-seat stadium in the Meadowlands, Steinbrenner said he was excited about the offer.
I was stuck in traffic as details of the New Jersey offer and Steinbrenner's reaction came over the radio. The 155th Street exit off the Major Deegan Expressway was blocked to reroute traffic from the game.
My immediate reaction was that Steinbrenner could take his team -- and his traffic snarls -- to Jersey.
A day later the feelings hardened: I have grown weary of the man's threats. He's like a fickle lover who threatens to leave, to stay, to leave again, to stay again. There comes a point when you open the door and say, "Leave."
Unfortunately, things are not that cut and dried.
The Yankees have been in the Bronx since 1923 and have become a central part of the area's economic structure.
"If the Yankees were to go, the area would fall down; we'd have to close down," said Mike DelPrete, who manages the Stadium Tennis Center. DelPrete's clients come primarily from the Upper West and Upper East Sides of Manhattan. Like Yankees fans, few of his clients come from the immediate area.
"When we tell the parents that we're in the South Bronx, next to Yankee Stadium, they feel safe because there's more activity here because of the Stadium being here," DelPrete said.
The perception that crime and safety are problems at Yankees games is one of the central issues in the Yankees' continuing status in the Bronx.
George Suarez, manager of the McDonald's directly across the street from the Stadium, said he gets plenty of business on game days, but always before the game. "We get a lot of people coming in before, but almost nobody when they go out," he said. "They just want to get out of here."
Steinbrenner encourages the fear. He repeats unsubstantiated, tired concerns about safety and the uneasiness of fans as they come to and from the game.
George Bush had Willie Horton; George Steinbrenner has the South Bronx, whose residents are largely black and Hispanic. In an effort to ring out the best possible deal, Steinbrenner is using urban decay -- not the erosion of his marketing department -- to justify the team's low numbers.
The so-called Boss is playing the race game.
Let him play it in New Jersey.
I'll miss the Yankees, the cool diffuse lights that envelope the stadium at night like a halo; Bob Sheppard's voice floating over the Bronx, Harlem and Washington Heights with word of lineup and pitching changes.
And the stadium does serve as a buffer.
"When a game is going on I feel safe," said Anthony Hilton, a station clerk at the 161st Street elevated subway stop. "When you have games you have more police around. No games, not as many police."
The stadium is a security blanket. But is it worth an entire community being vilified by an expeditious owner?
The Yankees' contract with the city expires in 2002; Steinbrenner wants to make a decision next year.
The team and the community are hopelessly estranged. The symbol of their bond is the stadium, and that's all.
Let's part amicably, and get on with our lives.

Tough Trade Negotiator To Lead Party in Japan

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 22

 BODY:
Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, whose confrontational personality is well known to United States trade negotiators, was elected leader of Japan's biggest party today, putting him in line to be the next Prime Minister.
As president of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party, Mr. Hashimoto becomes a leading candidate for Prime Minister as speculation persists that the Socialist incumbent, Tomiichi Murayama, will soon step aside. 
 United States officials know the 58-year-old Mr. Hashimoto from his hard-line stance in auto trade talks earlier this year, when he faced down American demands that Japan guarantee American cars and car parts a fixed share of the Japanese market.
Although Mr. Hashimoto says he firmly supports good relations between the United States and Japan, his conservative views occasionally stray into right-wing nationalism, such as his refusal to say outright that World War II was a "war of aggression" by Japan.
In his 1993 book, "Vision of Japan," Mr. Hashimoto wrote that the relationship with the United States, while important, "is not something we must maintain by giving up our sovereignty as a state."
Mr. Hashimoto said today that his first priority would be to revitalize the Japanese economy, still ailing from the collapse of stock and real estate prices in the early 1990's.

HEADLINE: Americans Would Never Trade Cars for Trains;
On the Fast Track

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You're on the right track when you suggest that an investment in Amtrak is in the national interest (editorial, Sept. 16). If proof of the efficiency of rail service is needed, one need only look at two of our greatest economic competitors, Germany and Japan, where fast, dependable trains are an integral part of the economy and are taken for granted. 
 With our Federal Government providing research and development and setting standards, each state could develop a network of high-speed railroads (many states have such plans now) that could be connected in the same manner as the interstate highway system. Since trains can go downtown to downtown, new construction for railroads and stations could help provide the urban development needed in so many of our cities.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Carol Burnett Comes Round To Where She Started From

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

 BODY:
IT IS A RAINY SUNDAY MORNING IN early August, and Carol Burnett is fighting a cold. She is gamely attacking a Belgian waffle, popping vitamins C, B and E with calcium and beta carotene and talking about her return to Broadway after 30 years and several lifetimes of laughter.
She is trim and elegant in workout clothes, her surprisingly delicate fingers fondling the flatware. She looks younger than her 62 years and greets a stranger with a big hug and a kiss. But she is tired and bruised from 12-hour rehearsals, including bouts of fencing, and she hides her eyes behind smoky sunglasses even in this summer gloom. 
 She is living in a Boston hotel room, far from the newly built Santa Fe, N.M., home she has occupied for only 10 days. She is risking her neck in Ken Ludwig's latest boisterous physical farce, "Moon Over Buffalo," a fond look back at the world of mid-1950's live theater, which she cut her teeth on even as it was fading.
She doesn't have to do this.
"You know what, I do have to do this," she says in the friendly, matter-of-fact voice that warmed nearly 600 nights on CBS from 1967 to 1978. "Because I think it's very important to keep on trucking, to keep on doing. I don't mean trying to do parts younger than you are. It's not Norma Desmond time. It's doing what you can do, within a believable age range, and having fun. Getting back in the sandbox."
When, in response to some question or other, she bursts into that patented goony, gurgling giggle, you have to believe her. And when, on the stage, the long-suffering wife she plays is moved in the midst of lunacy to sudden, unforced tears of love, so are those people out there in the dark.
In "Buffalo," which opens next Sunday at the Martin Beck Theater after several weeks of previews, Ms. Burnett and her co-star, Philip Bosco, play George and Charlotte Hay, an oversize pair of second-rate Lunts touring the tank towns in repertory productions of "Cyrano de Bergerac" and "Private Lives." When Ronald Colman breaks his leg during the filming of "The Scarlet Pimpernel," the great Frank Capra threatens to descend on Buffalo to cast George in Colman's place. All manner of mistaken identity, marital discord and drunken chaos ensue.
Charlotte is a diva, and dizzy enough, but compared with George, a bibulous, adulterous, hopelessly insecure ham, she's solid and sane. As the play began its out-of-town tryout, that imbalance left Ms. Burnett, who created such madcap madwomen as Nora Desmond, in her television parody of "Sunset Boulevard," playing something like her old straight man, Harvey Korman, to Mr. Bosco's Carol Burnett.
"I knew when I read it that the story is George's in a way," Ms. Burnett said last month at the beginning of the Boston run, before changes were made to beef up her role. "I'm sure that will be, might be, talked about -- or thought about, or whatever. But that's not why I'm in this. I'm in it because I think it's a funny show, and I love the people in it, and I like playing with a better tennis player. It makes my game better."
That a star of Ms. Burnett's age and reputation would return to the New York theater in a vehicle in which she is less than the cynosure is a testament to her restlessness, to the paucity of new commercial plays, to her dissatisfaction with the current corporate climate of network television and to the scarcity of good roles in any medium for women over 40. Two other veteran Broadway stars, Carol Channing and Julie Andrews, are returning in vehicles tailored for them.
Since her CBS variety show went off the air, Ms. Burnett has worked selectively. She won praise for dramatic roles in theatrical films like "A Wedding" (1978) by Robert Altman and television movies like "Friendly Fire" (1979). She has also made comedy and musical specials for television, but two subsequent attempts at a sketch-comedy series in the early 1990's fizzled amid the changing tastes and economics of television comedy. And she has kept her hand in the live theater, whose discipline she never really left, most recently in California at the Long Beach Civic Light Opera in limited runs of "Company" and a Berlin-Gershwin-Porter revue.
"I haven't been away from the stage; I just haven't been in New York," she said. "And I just had such a good time in Long Beach that I said, 'You know, I'd love to do -- I don't care if it's Off Broadway, Off Off Off Broadway, it could be in somebody's living room -- but let's, you know, see.' "
Elizabeth Williams, the producer of "Buffalo," who had worked with Ms. Burnett on a Los Angeles production of A. R. Gurney's "Love Letters," sent her a script last year. "She was very game, and very excited about it and wanting to move forward," Ms. Williams said.
But early in rehearsal, Ms. Burnett's presence swiftly posed a challenge for Mr. Ludwig and the director of "Buffalo," Tom Moore. In the last month, they have frantically rewritten and reshaped the play to add one-liners, deeper characterization and bits of comic business to make Charlotte a more equal foil for George. So much new dialogue was added daily that at one point, a stage manager left a two-foot-high stack of paper in Ms. Burnett's dressing room, with a gag note informing her that it was her latest lines.
"Once Carol was cast, there was going to be that balance problem," Mr. Ludwig said. "I'd always intended it to be a story about the two of them, but as the story evolved, George goes off and gets drunk and does all the things that make him the center of the action, and it was less about both of them than it was about him. We've tried to adjust that balance to show more of what their aspirations have been, and where they're both going."
Ms. Burnett was so concerned that an early performance and her own candid discussion of her role might have left a reporter with adverse impressions that she telephoned just before the Broadway previews to express her delight at the revisions and to assure audiences that they would find plenty of her to laugh at. "There is much more lunacy for both of us," she said.
Snippets of Ms. Burnett's greatest hits do crop up in Charlotte: a baleful 25-second double take, those full-throated yells. But a smidgen of her old "Shirley Dimple" takeoff on Shirley Temple was dropped as unnecessary, and her performance is no waxworks. Still, whatever she does, her fellow actors say, audiences tend to respond to her as if she were the same wacky presence who was beamed into their living rooms 25 years ago.
"They don't see her as an actress; they see her as this great comedienne, and that poses a different set of circumstances over which no one has any control," said Mr. Bosco, a veteran farceur who won a Tony Award for his starring role in Mr. Ludwig's "Lend Me a Tenor" in 1989. "The audience sometimes reacts to her as Carol Burnett, this larger-than-life figure, rather than as an actress doing what she does."
Ms. Burnett is well aware of the limitations of her familiarity. Having made mincemeat of the Billy Wilder classic on her old show, she half-jokingly proposed that she be a substitute in the Los Angeles production of "Sunset Boulevard" during a planned hiatus after Glenn Close left for Broadway.
"I said I would learn that whole part just to play it for three weeks, and the challenge would be to see if and when I could get the audience to stop laughing," she said. "They wouldn't go for it; they were too frightened." Similarly, when she appeared as a presenter at this year's Tony Awards show, the higher-ups, fearful of offending the musical's producers, nixed her notion of entering down John Napier's Gothic staircase on the "Sunset" set.
But she insists that she doesn't feel confined by the public affection. "Confined?" she says. "I'm grateful for anybody that says I really like your work. The difficult thing about being a performer -- and you just have to realize it and go with it -- is that it's not like being an artist or a painter or a writer. Because someone will walk by a painting and say, 'I hate that painting,' or 'I hated that book.' But they say about a performer, 'I hate her.'
"So I'm always pleasantly surprised when somebody might come up and say, 'I really enjoyed your work in such and such,' as opposed to 'I really enjoy you.' I mean, I'm flattered, but the flip side of that is 'I hate you.' "
Hardly anyone seems to hate Ms. Burnett. In a world known for temperament and tantrums, she stands out. Mr. Bosco praises her as "the loveliest star one can imagine; no pretensions, very down to earth, very professional, works like the dickens, always prepared." Mr. Moore, the director, said: "I've worked with a lot of stars, and for the most part, it's not my favorite thing, simply because one has to spend so much time thinking about what one says, and you don't have to do that with her. It's an enormous gift."
 MS. BURNETT IS USED to looking out for other people's feelings, and has been for a long time. She grew up the daughter of mostly absentee alcoholic parents: a mother who dreamed of writing for the fan magazines and a father who was a door-to-door salesman when he was able. She was raised in a one-room flat in Hollywood by an eccentric grandmother, the "Nanny" for whom she began tugging her ear in greeting. Hers is a classic stage-struck story: $50 from an anonymous angel to pay her first semester tuition at U.C.L.A., where she fell in love with performing; a $1,000 loan to finance her first foray to New York from a sponsor who insisted that she keep his identity secret.
She burst onto network television three times in one week in 1957, performing a nightclub comedy song, "I Made a Fool of Myself Over John Foster Dulles," a heartsick paean to the pickle-pussed Secretary of State. Two years later, she fulfilled her dream of acting in a George Abbott show, making a successful Broadway debut as Winnifred the Woebegone, the "terribly timid and horribly shy" heroine of "Once Upon a Mattress," Mary Rodgers's musical version of "The Princess and the Pea." (In 1964, she was to be a hit in another Abbott show, "Fade Out -- Fade In," although that success was shadowed by a feud she had with the show's producers.) Soon, she had a regular gig on "The Garry Moore Show," and the rest is history.
The world -- and comedy -- has changed since then, and she lets out a long hoot when asked if any young performer today could make a splash singing "I Made a Fool of Myself Over Warren Christopher." Does she still laugh at what America laughs at, and what does it laugh at, anyway?
"I don't know," she says. "I laugh at what I laugh at, and you know, if you get 30 percent of the audience laughing, you're successful."
Her offstage life has had its share of tears. There were two divorces, the second from the television producer Joe Hamilton, her husband of 21 years and the father of her three daughters, Carrie, Jody and Erin. Their eldest child, Carrie, had a well-publicized struggle with drugs in high school but put it behind her a dozen years ago. Mr. Hamilton died in 1991, and Ms. Burnett has been on her own since 1984. In recent years, she told interviewers she was content to travel solo, but now she says she's looking.
"I see somebody coming along, and I don't know who," she said. "You can have a family, but they have their life. And you can have a family in the theater, and that lasts a certain amount of time and will always mean something to you as a wonderful period in your life that can never happen again. However, there is something very important about being numero uno to somebody else and I would like that, so I'm sending out the pheromones."
"I don't mind if he's younger," adds Ms. Burnett, whose grandmother's boyfriend when she died at 81 was a 40-year-old jazz musician from Redondo Beach. "Because anybody older, usually, with the exception of people in this business, are curmudgeons, or they're chauvinists."
Is she nervous about returning to the town where she made her dream come true? "I want to take the George Abbott approach," she says. "I've done the best I can, now go home and get some sleep. It's no longer in my hands. I've done my work, and what somebody else thinks about it is certainly their privilege."
"Nothing's scary about it," she adds. "It's just getting out of your own way and not worrying it. Just do it. As my grandmother used to say, 'Leave it lay where Jesus flung it.' "

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE;
Remodeling New York For the Bourgeoisie

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
THE RESTORATION OF BRYANT PARK, completed in 1992, is one of the nicest things New York City has done for itself in a long time. And the park's inviting new restaurant, designed by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer, is a fine place from which to savor the view. With its arcadian, trellised facade, accented by the Mediterranean resort chic of white canvas umbrellas, the restaurant offers a perch from which to enjoy the trees, grass and fountains, the surrounding cityscape and, above all, the cheering prospect of people enjoying a public space without fear that something awful is going to happen. No wonder the restaurant, which opened for business last spring, has been hailed as an urban miracle.
The true miracle, perhaps, is that the restoration has recaptured not only a place but also a time, a period before the park fell into disrepair. When the city was prosperous enough to create parks and New Yorkers were not afraid to use them. And yet the sensation is not purely one of nostalgia, for the restoration and the restaurant are also oddly representative of the present era in the city's history. Though Bryant Park resembles an oasis, its revival is not an exception. It is of a piece with many other projects that also seek to reinscribe secure middle-class values within the urban center. 
 They range in scale from large-scale residential enclaves like Queens West and Riverside South, both loosely modeled after Battery Park City, to the Starbucks-style cafes that have sprouted all over town. Across the city, Business Improvement Districts have been devising design guidelines, as well as providing security and sanitation, once provided by the public sector. In the city's rusting industrial districts, new zoning proposals would encourage the rise of suburban-type "superstores," while chain emporiums like Bed, Bath and Beyond have invaded the city's heart.
The transformation of 42d Street into a family entertainment center; the proliferation of theme restaurants on 57th Street; the renovation of Penn Station and Grand Central Terminal into upscale shopping malls, with trains attached: there's no sweeping master plan coordinating these projects. If anything, they signify the capitulation of the public planning process to private enterprise. That's one reason it's not easy to grasp what these projects portend. Taken individually -- a park here, a chain store there -- the projects are of limited significance. Their meaning arises from the aggregation.
And it's a perplexing meaning, because it contradicts the narrative that has ruled the city throughout much of this century: the departure of the middle class and the city's polarization into extremes of rich and poor. These new urban projects fall between those extremes: too accessible and affordable to hold adequate snob appeal for the rich but beyond the reach of the lower economic echelons, they are pitched to those in the middle. Not the lower middle, not even the middle middle, but white-collar professionals. Bed, Bath and Beyond is not, after all, Porthault, and Starbucks is not Petrossian. Perhaps, in honor of the increasing influence of Business Improvement Districts, we ought to call this new city Business Class.
It is not a new development, nor is it unique to New York. Many older American cities have sought to reverse their economic decline by fostering a kind of hybrid urban-suburban culture, an ethos that fuses suburban security and standardization with urban congestion and pizazz. Festival marketplaces, like those developed by the Rouse Corporation in the 1970's, were among the first manifestations of this genre. The gentrification of old brownstone neighborhoods, the conversion of lofts from manufacturing to residential use, the rise of the gay subculture as a stable force in the urban economy: these, too, have contributed to the impression of an urban revival.
If that image has become more conspicuous in the past few years, that is partly because the extremities of the preceding decade -- the glitz development of the 1980's, the homelessness of the early 1990's -- have receded from the foreground of urban consciousness.
Is that a good thing? Earlier this year, when employees of programs intended to aid homeless people in the Grand Central business district were accused of assaulting them instead, it became apparent that there is something misleading, or at least incomplete, about the Business Class image. Suddenly the difference between a genteel gated suburban community and Business Improvement Districts did not seem so profound. If anything, the Business Improvement District looked more sinister because its gates were invisible. While these districts preserve the city's traditional image as a place of social accessibility, image and reality no longer coincide. Rich and poor are still polarized, but the gap between them is less conspicuous.
It's hard not to be of two minds about this development. On the one hand, those who care about the city's future can only welcome the social and economic stability that a middle class provides. Even if what we're seeing now is in large part image, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Images can sometimes engender reality: a burnished urban image is far more likely than a tarnished one to attract and maintain businesses, tourism and other forces pivotal to the city's economic well-being.
Even the most favorable trend, however, has its price, and the cost of the Business Class city needs to be much more talked about. There's a moral authority to the city's openness, for example, a democratic interplay between freedom and equality that has long been central to New York's identity. This stands to be eroded if the urban center is remade into a fortress. Of course, moral authority isn't worth much if there is no city left to embody it. But without that authority, what is the difference between a city and a mall?
 POVERTY, RACIAL Prejudice, environmental abuse: a lot of critical issues are dimly concealed by the veneer of middle-class affluence. Compared to them, it may seem the most trivial of pursuits to talk about the look of the veneer itself: about design, about taste, about art. And yet, it's precisely because the veneer has the potential to deceive that talking about it in visual terms takes on social significance. What lies beneath the veneer is significant, but so is the veneer itself. Does it reflect who we are?
The old Barnes & Noble sale annex on lower Fifth Avenue had orange industrial carpet over floorboards that creaked and it felt like a firetrap. The new Barnes & Noble store over on Avenue of the Americas has lush green carpet, classical music noodling softly in the background and a cafe perched on a balcony. It's so pleasant that you want to linger for hours.
It is pleasant to go into those Starbucks-style coffee bars; the coffee is good and the atmosphere is pleasant. Shopping at the World Financial Center in Battery Park City is pleasant. It is particularly pleasant to see those depressing bunion ads on the subways giving way to bold designs boosting upscale products.
When pleasantness begins to pall, one can go in for excitement. The new Chelsea Piers are exciting! The plunging two-story escalator at Sony's Lincoln Square multiplex is exciting! The interior David Rockwell has designed the "Official" All Star Cafe, a sports-theme dining and restaurant going up in Times Square, will be very exciting! Pleasant. Exciting! Pleasant. Exciting! Is this architecture? Or an experiment in mass Pavlovian response? Design? Or a drug?
"Middle class" is often taken as a synonym for the safe, the stodgy, the mediocre. But being middle class in New York is supposed to mean being culturally aware. Yes, you get some material rewards: a decent place to live, nice clothes, a tasty dinner. But you also keep up with movies, painting, theater. You read a book. If Mark Morris or Laurie Anderson is appearing, you try to get in. You care about what that new curator at the Whitney is going to make of the opportunity. Even if you do not take an active interest in these things, you still have the reassuring knowledge that you're living in a place where almost any cultural appetite can be satisfied.
But if your appetite is for contemporary architecture, you're out of luck. If you go to Paris, London, Barcelona, Los Angeles, Tokyo and many other cities, there's usually a new building that you have to see, or you will die. You may hate it, but your life depends on it. But when visitors from abroad come here, what do you show them? There's the skyline, of course, and the street gridiron, two of the greatest architectural spectacles of all time. But when it comes to recent buildings of stature, where do you look?
A few weeks ago I was out walking with the fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi, and at one point we strolled past the Millennium, the new luxury high rise on the Upper West Side. I like the building and was planning to write something favorable about it. But Mizrahi said, "Well, you'll have to tell me what you like about this. Because to me, it's just another eyesore. Maybe a slightly better eyesore."
I wanted to respond, "Well, how would you feel if someone took a look at one of your dresses and said, 'Ugh, another rag on a hook'?" But I had to admit, the man had a point. It's been some time since people could look up and see a building with something fresh or startling to say about the contemporary city and the creativity that drives it.
Thirty years ago, the cityscape found room for works by Mies van der Rohe, Wallace Harrison, Eero Saarinen, Marcel Breuer, Frank Lloyd Wright, Walter Gropius and Gordon Bunshaft. Not all of their buildings were great; some were terrible. But what they contributed was much more than a handful of potential future landmarks. Even the worst of their projects, like the Pan Am Building, helped create a picture of the city as an open-ended, ongoing project, a place that recognized the power of architecture to symbolize a city's willingness to respond to change with fresh ideas. That symbolism went far toward securing New York's reputation as a global cultural center in the postwar decades.
That's what's missing from this emerging picture of a Business Class New York: some show of public awareness that the city remains a dynamic experiment. Yes, we love to shop, and we deserve a comfortable refuge from urban turmoil. But we're also a city that historically recognizes the difference between creating and consuming. Where are the buildings strong enough to carry that tradition forward?
The irony is that the general level of architectural design in New York is higher than it has been in a generation. The firms that garner many of the most prominent commissions -- offices like James Stewart Polshek & Partners, Beyer Blinder Belle, Fox & Fowle, Alexander Cooper & Associates -- do superior work. Their sensitive, urbane designs represent an enormous advance over the days when architects approached a building site as an island unto itself. But it is Business Class architecture, not world-class architecture. It seldom risks greatness.
It should be a source of civic pride that some of the world's most celebrated architects live and work in Manhattan and a matter of shame that many of the most gifted seldom build here. And their few New York projects are distant from the center. Richard Meier hasn't built in New York for 20 years -- his entire mature career to date -- and his last building was in the Bronx. Rafael Vinoly, designer of the most important public building now in construction in Tokyo, built an excellent gymnasium last year, in the Bronx. Peter Eisenman built a little fire station 10 years ago in Brooklyn. I'm not a great fan of the skyscraper Gwathmey Siegel built on Broadway at West 48th Street, but I respect it. It's architecture, and it's centrally located.
 SITE, THE FIRM THAT, ALONG with Frank Gehry, won this year's Chrysler Design Awards, has built nothing here except interiors. Ditto Emilio Ambasz. Michael Graves has designed a shop. John Hejduk has renovated one building. Diana Agrest and Mario Gandelsonas, active in projects from Des Moines to China, have designed, I believe, a townhouse. Aldo Rossi, who has maintained a New York studio for the past decade, has built nothing here. Arata Isozaki, who also maintains a local office, has designed a discotheque and has collaborated with James Stewart Polshek on the Brooklyn Museum expansion.
Among the younger generation -- arguably the most highly educated in history -- it's even worse. While their contemporaries in Los Angeles have built enough to be called the Santa Monica School, Steven Holl, Tod Williams and Billie Tsien, Henry Smith-Miller and Laurie Hawkinson, Hariri & Hariri, have been confined locally to interior renovations.
Then there is the long list of world-class architects whose work one might expect to see in a city that prides itself on being a cultural capital; to name a few: Tadao Ando, Renzo Piano, Frank Gehry, Rem Koolhaas, Richard Rogers, Rafael Moneo, Toyo Ito, Jean Nouvel, Antoine Predock, Zaha Hadid.
Of course, cities have more important things to do than collect trophy buildings by famous designers. And architecture encompasses important things besides esthetics. But it's not as if New York were setting new standards in environmentally or socially responsible design, either. And since we are still putting up buildings, and architects are still designing, why can't at least a few of them be alert to the moment we live in?
Some people might prefer architecture to remain confined to consenting adults in the privacy of their converted lofts. The idea has taken hold that architects are to be regarded as rampaging egos, user-unfriendly, contemptuous of the city and its traditions. Though there may be some truth to this, there is also something profoundly anti-urban about making New York endlessly atone for excesses committed by modern architects in Jane Jacobs's day. Most architects have learned their lesson since then. Some have a lot to teach.

90's Obsession Finds a Home in Old Forms

BYLINE: By Margo Jefferson

 BODY:
TRAGEDY Tomorrow, comedy tonight, said Stephen Sondheim, and would that this were true outside the confines of a theater. For most of us, life is melodrama tonight and comedy tomorrow. The wit (and the will) to make fun of our grief is always -- minimally -- a day away.
In "The Food Chain," by Nicky Silver, which is playing at the Westside Theater, melodrama and comedy nearly devour each other. "I'm telling everyone to see this play," said a French friend. "It's like a Feydeau farce." And he's right. 
 In those turn-of-the-century French romps, husbands and wives coupled, uncoupled and cross-coupled in each other's drawing rooms, bedrooms and bachelor flats with mathematically efficient panache. Here in America, almost a full turn of the century later, solitary men and women couple, uncouple and cross-couple with noisy desperation, talking about themselves the whole time.
It isn't really dialogue. Instead, they're hurling monologues at one another: laments, rants and cutting diagnoses of their mothers, fathers and once-and-future lovers; the looks and talent they have or wish they had; their most humiliating moments, in high school or in the SoHo restaurant where they ate alone last night and had to endure the waiter's asking "Are you alone?" in a tone of insolent familiarity.
Amanda (played with high-strung hauteur by Hope Davis) is a rich, thin and conspicuously cultivated poet who, as the play begins, is pacing the floor of her conspicuously dreary New York apartment because her husband has been missing for two of the three weeks they have been married. (The furniture is castoff modern; the color scheme is green and beige with touches of pink, yellow and black.) She picks up the phone and finds herself calling a crisis hot line; soon she is explicating herself to Bea (Phyllis Newman), a relentlessly earthy and practical Jewish widow and mother who once ran a needlepoint store but who now, thanks to her crisis training, does all she can to run the lives of unhappy strangers.
The stage revolves, displaying a lavender bachelor flat with gym equipment in one corner and a large photograph of a perfectly developed male torso dominating the wall behind a bed. Serge (Patrick Fabian), with a body almost as perfect as the one in the photo, sits on the bed listening to headphones, lost in a Mick Jagger reverie, waiting for his new lover to call.
He is interrupted by a knock on the door. "Let me in or I'll kill myself," a voice calls out cheerily. And in bursts Otto (Tom McGowan), the ex-lover from hell, who is fat, funny, foul-mouthed, fast-talking and furious at everything and everybody. He bounces around the apartment wolfing down food and spewing out insults. You may be a model, he reminds Serge, but you're only a runway model: "You're not good-looking enough to be in print." His running gag is "Do you think you could love me if . . .," followed by some improbable condition and finished off with an insult. ("I tattooed your name on my rear end, and now I sit on you all the time.")
The stage revolves again, back to Amanda's apartment, but I will say no more: farce depends on a series of improbable but airtight coincidences and mishaps that link each character (not least the absentee husband and the absent lover) into what Mr. Silver calls the food chain and what Aretha Franklin used to call a chain of fools. "Where's the justice?" asks Ms. Newman's perfectly pitched Bea, the deus ex machina in the guise of meddling mother. Then, uttering a short expletive, she shrugs off justice and settles for comic symmetry.
In Old World farce (not just the light-hearted Feydeau sort but even a radically darkened, complicated one like Jean Cocteau's "Indiscretions"), the plot -- the meetings and schemes, the self-assured calculations -- ruled the emotions. The closed structures that people lived by were social first; the psychological was a byproduct. In this New World farce, emotions (obsessions, really) dictate plot. The maniacal, oddly logical structures that rule us are our own psyches: our needs, traumas, neuroses; our compensations and cover-ups. It's the stuff of melodrama, all right (inner lives usually are). And when private melodramas meet, they explode into farce.
The formal constraints of farce (the fast tempo, the double-dealing plot twists, the artificial symmetries) are good for Mr. Silver, at least for now. His prose strives to be witty, analytic and rhetorically astute at all costs. The price (I am thinking of his previous play "Raised in Captivity") can be emotional incoherence: his people's strenuously expressive lines, combined with their obtuse, even brutish actions, can make you wonder if they aren't just a device -- if he doesn't really want to push them aside, take the stage himself and hold us captive with a series of brilliantly written, artfully autobiographical stories and monologues.
Mr. Silver does still have fits of overwriting and underediting. (When one theatergoer thinks he heard Amanda's tirade about women's handbags in a Christopher Durang play and another thinks she heard it on the Comedy Central cable channel, attention must be paid.) But I felt I was watching a writer find the form that best suits his obsessions, aided by his director, Robert Falls, and by his physically adept, emotionally alert actors. How right George Bernard Shaw was when he called laughter "the natural recognition of destruction, confusion and ruin."
 
'The Island of Lost Shoes'
 That being said, let's consider the kind of divine comedy that outwits destruction, confusion and ruin by inventing its opposite: a world that is half Utopian (perfect order) and half Arcadian (perfect romance). No form is better suited to this than a musical comedy: being able to stop the action with a song or dance is as close to omnipotence as anybody is likely to get. And the more artifice the better: the costumes should be brazenly fake, and glittering; the virtuosity should show and not hide behind naturalism. Everyone has a second self, the alter ego or the imaginary companion from childhood, now onstage where it belongs, performing like a trouper.
Bloolips is a five-man troupe of British drag queens. They sing (Ray Dobbins created the pastiche of clever songs), they dance, they act, they clown and, because they're in drag (English music hall has a venerable drag tradition), they do on the stage what we do in our dreams, which is to play whatever part we need to, in violation of sexual, social or intellectual unities. (Yes, you were Dostoyevsky in your dream. But for reasons that remain unclear, you seemed to be Burt Reynolds as well.)
"The Island of Lost Shoes" is the Bloolips show that is playing at P.S. 122 through tonight (can't they stay longer?), and trying to describe what goes on in it is like trying to describe a dream. Puns and other wordplay abound. Moods and costumes change with dazzling frequency. Times are hard in London and the girls of Bloolips -- especially the leading lady, Bette Bourne, in her billowing bronze top, with bronze-feathered hat and red mules -- are feeling blue. Bette is old ("past the four-dozen mark"), she drinks, she's unemployed at the moment and her sexual charms are faltering.
Let's take a vacation, cry her loyal friends Bella Bechstein, Naughty Nickers, Lavinia Co-op and Harmony. Of course, this is code for that old musical rallying cry, "Let's put on a show!" No sooner are they en route to Greece than one of those utterly benign plane crashes ("We're losing attitude -- I mean altitude," cries Bette) leaves them stranded on what could be the Island of Lost Souls but turns out to be the Island of Lost Shoes. They're stranded in a consumer's Bali Hai, "where you do as you please, and where shoes grow on trees"; where you can go hunting and gathering for clothes each day because the habitat includes steamer trunks filled with frocks.
How to tell of the wonders of the island? Like all fantasy isles, it has a resident monster, an 8-foot-tall transvestite on stilts (played by Lavinia), who looks like a ravaged Neptune until she is pacified with offerings of makeup. Then she turns herself into a haunting blonde in gold, who moves like an ethereal Sally Rand and delivers an exquisitely ghoulish Actors Studio monologue (with "Clair de Lune" playing on an organ) about the perilous pleasures of being Marilyn Monroe.
As for the pleasures of show business, they're all here. Not just in the array of costumes Bloolips wears (maribou trim, brooches and chokers, fringed and beaded dresses, brazen pink and black checks, negligees, picture hats and pith helmets with veils), but also in the array of styles they pirate, parody and embody.
There's the old music-hall shuffle, Jolson-style, that accompanies the raucous "What Did Robinson Crusoe Do With Friday on a Saturday Night?" There are the diligently vivacious, overdressed Busby Berkeley tap numbers ("We're in the Money" done with credit cards instead of gold coins). When Bette wants to emote, she declaims "King Lear" very nicely. And at one point she steps forward to apologize to us for what she calls "the shoddy quality" of a certain gag. We live and work on so little, she explains in a throbbing voice, "gathering puns by day, stitching together sketches by night." "Lord, I'se a-weary, I'se a-weary," she concludes, and the swooping tremolo of the drawing-room poetess gives way to the plantation pieties of a minstrel in blackface.
Musicals season their plots with romance, but they can do without it. What they can't do without is the romance that blossoms between the performers and the audience. Bloolips courts and teases us wonderfully. Bella Bechstein, Naughty Nickers and Harmony are good supporting players. Lavinia Co-op is a wonderfully eccentric comedian and mime. And Bette Bourne? Ms. Bourne is a great performer.

HEADLINE: Winning Owners Over to the Landmarking System

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
BUYERS have begun moving into nine formerly derelict houses in the Bronx that have been restored with city financing under the eye of the Landmarks Preservation Commission to something like their original glory.
The buyers are presumably pleased, and so are the supporters of the Longwood Historic District, in which these buildings on Hewitt Place and Beck, Kelly and Dawson Streets are now handsome architectural specimens. 
 "To see the first families move into these brownstones after 15 years of effort gives us quite a sense of accomplishment," said the Rev. John W. Redic 2d, chairman of the Longwood Historic District Community Association. "We are just tickled to death."
Less tickled are the three small contractors who were responsible for the work. They had no easy time satisfying the Landmarks Commission's supervisors with the quality of their efforts. Which leads to the question, what level of excellence does restoration work have to reach to pass muster? Are the standards reasonable?
Perhaps the answers will always be subjective, but indirectly, at least, the issue is addressed in a report issued last May by the Citizens Housing and Planning Council of New York, a civic organization that deals with housing and development issues. The report is called "Landmarks Preservation in New York City: An Affirmative Approach." It was prepared by a committee headed by William R. Ginsberg, a former Parks commissioner, and it has the tone of a friend and supporter offering suggestions. The J.M. Kaplan Fund financed the study.
Its underlying assumption is that to become a success as a tool for historic preservation in New York City, the Landmarks system should encourage confidence, not fear, in property owners. And as landmark designation has turned toward low- and moderate-income areas of the city, the report says, the need to confront the cost implications of maintaining landmark structures has become more acute.
Negative attitudes among owners toward landmarking arise, the report says, from "exacting maintenance and repair standards and the time, cost and uncertainty associated with navigating a rigorous regulatory process."
On the question of standards, the report favors the application of principles established in the United States Department of the Interior's "Standards for Historic Rehabilitation." They are guidelines on methods and materials, to be applied "in a reasonable manner, taking into consideration economic and technical feasibility."
One recommendation of the council is that owners be allowed to present cost information to the Landmarks Commission. Under the policy that long prevailed, applicants could not inform the commission about the cost of using original materials or possible substitutes. The reasoning was that the law barred commissioners from making decisions on economic grounds. That policy has been dropped by the current chairwoman, Jennifer J. Raab. Doing so has given the commission greater flexibility to work with owners to fashion acceptable solutions to preservation problems, she said.
The planning council has much to say on tax policy: Stop overassessing, and hence overtaxing, landmarked properties with unrestored buildings, it advises. One suggested way to do this would be to tax only the landmarked structure, and not the land beneath, particularly when the unredeveloped structure is in a high-density, high-value area. Another approach is to make the landmark status of a property clear on Finance Department records, which may prompt lower assessments on buildings for which designation is detrimental to resale value.
The report notes that small residential buildings and low-density commercial buildings in historic districts, or very small landmarks in high-density zones, may well be overassessed under current practices.
Another recommendation is to make all landmarked properties eligible for the J-51 program, which frees older residential property for many years from most of the taxes attributable to the rehabilitation work. Currently, properties south of 110th Street in Manhattan that have an assessed value of $38,000 or more per apartment are ineligible for J-51 benefits.
The council also advises that the panoply of city loans and grants for lower-income housing should be made available to landmarked or historic-district properties. Some of those incentives, now either unavailable or available only on a restricted basis in most of Manhattan, should be expanded to include certain excluded Manhattan areas, the report advises.
BUT whatever happens at the policy level, there may still be problems at the construction site. Contractors without long experience in landmarks work may be in for a rude awakening.
The turn-of-the-century houses in the Longwood Historic District were in the city's tax-foreclosed housing inventory for years. Most have stoops, double doors of framed glass, bay windows and decorative brownstone trim around windows and doors. Those on Hewitt Place are part of a strip of houses with wooden porches, galvanized shingles on the roof and a metal cornice.
"All three of the contractors had a great deal of difficulty meeting the Landmarks standards," said Aaron Lewit, director of construction for the Enterprise Foundation, a nonprofit producer of low-income housing, who monitored the job on behalf of the city. "All three had a lot to do over after they had done it once." The Community Preservation Corporation, a bank consortium that supports moderate-income housing, financed the project and helped select contractors.
At one point, the Landmarks Commission's inspector declined to approve pointing work on the side facade of a Dawson Street house on the ground that the mortar was too wide in the joints between bricks. In another case, the contractor on Hewitt Place was obliged to refabricate an odd-sized cellar window that he had had custom made to the preservation architect's standard. The first window turned out to be too small when it arrived. The contractor wanted to correct matters with wood trim.
On Kelly Street the contractor had to redo much of the masonry work on the front stoop. On another occasion, on Dawson Street, a change order obliged a contractor to replace the rear portion of a roof with new slate, although it is invisible from the street. The same contractor said he had to wait out a whole winter to do the brick pointing on Dawson Street because it took so long to select the color. Forty color samples were prepared for selection, he said.
The Landmarks Commission provided $12,500 a house under its facade improvement program, or $112,500, for the Longwood work. When the contractors "costed out" the job based on the specifications from the preservation architect, Judith Saltzman, the anticipated cost came to $277,000. A larger subsidy from the Department of Housing Preservation and Development made up the difference.
But the need to redo completed work caused the restoration to be far more costly to contractors than the cost figures imply. In construction, profitability depends not only upon staying within budget but also upon completing on time.
Four buildings, on Hewitt Place and Dawson Street, were ready for occupancy six months before the Landmarks Commission would permit the issuance of even a temporary certificate of occupancy. The five other buildings, on Kelly and Beck Streets, had no sign-off either, but the contractor had other construction-related problems.
The Kelly Street buildings are now ready to be occupied, Mr. Lewit said, but the contractor has had to leave $30,000 in escrow pending a Landmarks sign-off.
The three contractors were J.H. Loewy of Queens, L&L Construction of Manhattan, and Brender-Hecht Associates of Brooklyn.
All nine houses have been sold, the two two-families at $110,000, the five three-families at $125,000 and the two four-families at $150,000. The housing agency provided $1.23 million for the job, about $45,500 per apartment. Four houses are occupied and the rest should be by mid-October, the Enterprise Foundation said.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Contingency Auditors and Leases;
Tenants Using Specialists to Check Up on Landlords

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
ALAN J. POMERANTZ, the real-estate specialist at the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges, has a client who wants to renegotiate his lease. Mr. Pomerantz hired a lease auditor to scour the lease and the rent bills for discrepancies.
While the tenant would, of course, welcome a refund, money is not the audit's raison d'etre. "The more we find, the more leverage we have with the landlord," Mr. Pomerantz said. "And if the problems affect other tenants, he has even more incentive to settle with us before our claim becomes public." 
 Landlords had best get used to such stories. Lease audits are increasing in frequency, scope and acrimony.
The current crop of auditors do not just check whether bills conform to the lease. They challenge the way rentable space is calculated and common-area charges assessed. They question whether the landlord's method of charging for electricity constitutes illegal "reselling" of power rather than distribution of same. They charge that landlords overpay for cleaning services and building managers.
Tenants rarely discuss their audits, and auditors insist they are simply protecting tenants' rights. But some landlords and lawyers say something more insidious is going on. They say too many auditors are charging on a contingency basis -- no payment up front, but a big chunk of savings that result -- and thus are motivated to pick apart all but the most precisely worded lease clauses.
"To the landlords, they come across as bounty hunters," said Lawrence F. Reilly, a real estate partner at the Morristown, N.J., law firm Pitney, Hardin, Kipp & Szuch.
"It's like they throw everything they can find against a wall, and see what will stick," said Anthony E. Malkin, president of W&M Properties, which is undergoing a nasty audit battle at a building in Stamford, Conn.
Landlords and management firms readily trot out examples. Bruce Mosler, vice chairman of the Galbreath Company, says one auditor recently questioned the amount that Galbreath was paying in taxes and service fees at one building, not the formula it applied to apportion those costs.
"The tenant wanted to break its lease and figured we'd settle," Mr. Mosler said. "We told them to take a hike."
The Durst Organization is fighting with a major tenant whose contingency auditor spotted fuzzy lease language regarding rent escalations. According to Douglas Durst, when the lease was negotiated 15 years ago, both sides agreed that the rent would go up by 4 cents a square foot for every one percent increase in the porter's wage. The auditor construed the lease to mean the rent would go up a tiny fraction of a cent.
"They are telling us that we agreed to a $200 annual increase," said Mr. Durst. "An accounting firm wouldn't do this."
The contingency auditors counter that tenants hire them expressly because they scrutinize leases closely and will chase longshots. They say that tenants who employ hourly auditors find it unaffordable to pursue small claims. They defend the hefty percentages they charge by noting that they can go through a dozen leases before they find an overcharge.
And they say landlords look for lease loopholes, too. They cite landlords who dismiss their property management agency and then charge double in fees to manage the property themselves; landlords who characterize a new cooling tower as an operating expense, which can be passed along to tenants, rather than a capital expense, which cannot; landlords who get around leases that forbid them from passing along promotional costs by inviting their staff to parties for brokers, and calling it training.
"Leases contain tons of ambiguities, and interpretation depends on how aggressive the landlord is," said Marc E. Betesh, president of Kislak Lease Services, a lease auditing firm in Woodbridge, N.J.
Other auditors say that corporate financial staffs and fixed-fee auditors have no incentive to chase down gray-area charges.
"If we audited on a fixed-fee basis, we'd simply report to our clients, and that could be the end of it," said Joel I. Binstock, president of York Consulting Group, a Manhattan-based lease audit firm.
ON one thing, everyone is unanimous: Audits have become a common, and probably permanent, part of the real estate landscape. During the last recession corporations caught on to the huge dent that occupancy costs made in their budget, and worked at getting those costs down. In the process, many realized that their rent bills were processed by accounts-payable people who knew little about real estate clauses.
"People who hadn't seen the lease were approving sizable payments," said Joel G. Shapiro, managing director of the accounting firm BDO Seidman's real estate group.
Landlords, meanwhile, faced a slashed income stream, and often pared their own administrative staffs, upping the chance for billing errors. Brokerage firms faced fierce competition for a dwindling number of deals, and used audit services to build relationships with new clients. And individual brokers, building managers and others who were downsized out of jobs, or whose mainstay businesses dried up, used contingency auditing to replace evaporated incomes.
Landlords say it is that latter group that has turned lease auditing into an acrimonious exercise. They say that the contingency auditors knowingly raise specious issues, hoping that the landlord will settle to avoid the legal fees, time and general ill will that fighting back could entail.
"They disrupt tenant relationships and besmirch reputations," Mr. Malkin said.
Landlords are trying to fight back through air-tight clauses in new leases. They are saying that tenants can only question a bill within 60 days after the bill is issued ("That's ridiculous -- it can take 30 days for the bill to get to accounts payable!" Mr. Binstock said). Instead of granting blanket access to expense ledgers, they now say tenants can only have information they reasonably need to explore an area in dispute. And many insist that only accountants charging flat or hourly fees do audits.
"Large tenants may negotiate better access to the books, but I will never agree to show those books to anyone but a C.P.A.," said Arthur L. Bocchi, who handles leasing at 666 Fifth Avenue, at 52d Street.
Actually, the fee issue is not so cut and dried. Many accounting firms use "value added billing" for lease audits; they charge a retainer, with a bonus that reflects a percentage of the savings their audit yields.
"In that sense, even accountants are contingency auditors," Mr. Shapiro said.
Still, the accounting firms are likely to be more restrained than the contingency audit firms. Many are in the business just to prevent competitors from establishing relationships with their clients. And many want to capture landlords as accounting clients.
Brokerage firms also tread a fine line when they do lease audits. The business gives them entree to tenants. But it also puts them in an adversarial position with owners -- one reason that few brokerage firms will audit leases in buildings they manage.
In fact, many brokers have soured on the business. "It is just not good business for a brokerage to antagonize owners," said Dan Gronich, the head of Grubb & Ellis New York, who says he will check whether a tenant's bills reflect the deal he negotiated, but never charges a fee for that service.
OTHERS have strongly limited the types of audits they will do. Julien J. Studley and Cushman & Wakefield pretty much limit their audit business to their own tenant-clients, and often do the audits for free.
"You do so many to find one that makesmoney, it doesn't make sense to pursue this as a business," said Kurt Handschumacher, Studley's corporate managing director.
Of course, such firms occasionally do miss windfalls. John Santora, a Cushman & Wakefield senior managing director, says that a free audit he did for a 200,000-square-foot tenant in Newark yielded a $200,000 rebate in taxes, as well as a $300,000 annual reduction in electricity charges.
"Sure, it hurt not to participate in the savings, but they are a good client," he said.
Those brokerages that remain in the audit business are generally less aggressive than the full-time contingency audit firms.
"We don't look for every last nickel, we just want to see that tenants get the deal they were promised," said Robert A. Sass, executive managing director of Williams Real Estate, which will lower or even waive its one-third-of-savings fee for a tenant that gives Williams its leasing business.
Of course, many audits do end amicably, with both sides trying to follow the spirit of a lease, not just its letter.
Mr. Betesh did an audit for one client who rented space in a building that was not yet completed, and whose lease specified he would pay 50 percent of operating expenses over $500,000. The first year of the lease, the operating expenses jumped to $650,000.
It turned out that the negotiations had been predicated on the client paying half of costs in excess of $5 a square foot for a 100,000-square-foot building, and the completed building was 130,000 square feet.
"It was an honest mistake," Mr. Betesh said. "The landlord readily resolved it."

HEADLINE: Wanted: Large Condos In the Premier Buildings

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
AS the Manhattan housing market sputters along, coughing, starting and stalling like an old tin lizzie, at least one segment seems to be moving steadily: large condominiums in prime buildings.
Like a mantra, one real estate broker after another cites the apparent success of Millennium Tower, at 101 West 67th Street, where the top 12 stories of the 56-story rental/retail/condominium complex are for sale. The tower's 93 condominium apartments command prices that average $675 a square foot, and go as high as $890 a square foot -- over $1 million for a two-bedroom apartment. After a year of sales, the building is 90 percent sold, with the majority of the apartments sold in pairs, and combined for even bigger spaces. 
 Real estate brokers and even rival developers also cite the progress of Donald Trump's latest condominium complex, the Trump International Hotel and Condominium, which was once the Gulf and Western Building at 15 Columbus Circle but is now being rebuilt, and given a new address: One Central Park West.
Judy Banham, the sales representative of the Sunshine Group, the building's marketing agents, said that contracts have been signed for 28 of the 166 units, at a total of $38 million since sales began in early summer. Nevertheless, agents involved in some of the sales emphasize that the units that went first are those with the best views of Central Park and the Hudson River, and they say there has been some hard bargaining going on, a fact Mr. Trump does not deny.
Demand, agents say, is strong -- but buyers are choosy. There is "a two-tier market in condominium sales," according to Alan Rogers, managing director of Douglas Elliman Real Estate, "the high end and the low end."
"With only a few exceptions," he said, "there's no new construction, and the old inventory is not suitable for many of the new buyers." In many cases, he said, "We're stuck with essentially a poor-quality inventory: smaller apartments in 'off' locations."
According to Barbara Corcoran, head of the Corcoran Group, a Manhattan real estate firm: "The greatest demand for apartments today is for grand condominiums in premium buildings with spectacular views -- it's outpacing every other sector of the marketplace. There's too little to select from and too many buyers."
Ms. Corcoran estimated there were "three times as many buyers for condos than for co-ops, with only one-fifth the product." In 1993, she said, 459 two-bedroom condominiums sold for more than $400,000; last year that figure climbed to 638. Douglas Elliman, in its midyear 1995 report, concludes that both the price and the volume of luxury condominium sales have risen.
MANY brokers report that their clients are showing an increased desire for the "flexibility" offered by the condominium form of ownership compared to a co-op's restrictions. Condominium boards do not have the same broad powers to reject applicants as co-op boards, and generally allow owners to rent out their units at will.
As a result, developers who are beginning to build apartments to sell after the long recession are building only condominiums. The Jack Parker Organization has broken ground for its "mid-level" ($400,000 and up) condominium at 72d Street and Second Avenue, and the Brodsky group will break ground next month for a 250-unit luxury condo tower on East 76th Street in back of the St. Jean Baptiste Church. A small new condominium building at 205 East 76th Street, developed by Robert Ezrapour, has been built and one model apartment is finished; there will be only six full-floor, three-bedroom, three-bath apartments available, priced from $595,000 to $725,000.
In addition to the new construction, at least one building's owners are attempting to shift from rental to condominium status: At the Allegro, constructed in 1989 at 62 West 62d Street, 26 apartments have been put up for sale; if 18 of the apartments are under contract of sale -- representing 15 percent of the building's 120 units -- the building can be converted to a condominium, according to state regulations.
Dolly Lenz, Sotheby's top-selling condominium broker, said the building's sponsor has already turned down offers close to the asking prices -- between $405,000 and $470,000 -- for two of the 1,100-square-foot two-bedroom units, "so that's how strong a position they feel they're in." Last Wednesday night, Rose Associates, the sponsor, held a cocktail party for brokers -- and more than 300 showed up.
High-end condominiums have always been attractive to foreigners -- many of whom prefer not to deal with co-op admission committees, who in turn are more comfortable with people who view their New York building as a primary residence. And while the frenzy of foreign buyers -- particularly the Japanese, has certainly abated since the mid-80's, there are still plenty of such sales.
Half of the contracts signed for the Trump International were for foreign buyers, according to the project's marketing agent -- and Mr. Trump said he was surprised it was not more. Another surprise, according to the agent, is that a substantial number of sales have been to Californians. About a third of the units at the Millennium Tower went to foreigners, according to a sales agent there who stressed that the building also attracted New Yorkers, including many families.
Brokers say the success of the Millennium is due to two key factors, and they say both must be present in a project to insure success: an exciting or chic location, preferably with spectacular views, and oversize, well-constructed apartments.
William L. Zeckendorf, president of Zeckendorf Realty, said that he launched the Millennium Tower when "there was nothing but doom and gloom and the market was going nowhere -- we knew we needed to get high prices to make it work."
Mr. Zeckendorf ordered apartments 50 percent bigger than was common in the 80's and, he said, paid three times as much to design his lobby and his corridors: $30,000 for each corridor, compared to the average $10,000. His one-bedroom apartments total 1,000 square feet; his two-bedrooms, 1,500.
The developers who will be successful in the new market, brokers say, have learned from the past: the shoddily constructed cookie-cutter studios and tiny one- and two-bedroom apartments in glitzy towers built in the 80's now sell poorly. Many either languish on the market or are withdrawn after a few months or years, and rented out -- sometimes at surprisingly good rentals.
Adding to the potential problems of owners of some less-desirable condominiums, especially if they bought their apartments a decade or more ago, is a financial consideration that lawyers and developers say will only loom larger as their buildings age.
Because of the way condominium ownership is structured, there can be no underlying mortgage on the building -- and there is virtually no way to put one on, since each apartment is a separate piece of real estate, with its own title and deed.
So when condominiums need major repairs -- like roofs or repointing -- there is only one way to raise the money if the condominium's reserve fund, traditionally smaller than a co-op's, does not cover the cost: assessments.
Although board presidents and managing agents in buildings who have had these problems decline to have their buildings' addresses published, because of a possible effect on resale values, several spoke with great emotion about the importance to condominium boards of immediately putting aside money for such contingencies.
David Kuperberg of Cooper Square Realty, which is primarily a management company, is sending a newsletter to all its buildings stressing the importance of long-term planning, which Mr. Kuperberg said was missing from most condominiums. "Most exist on what we call a 'one and pray' basis," he said. "They plan for one year and pray that no major problems will occur."
The board members and managing agents also spoke of another problem inherent in condominiums: when an individual unit owner defaults on both his carrying charges and his mortgage, the condo board must take a back seat to the bank in recovering any money (in a co-op, the board has the first position). As bank foreclosures grind on, the common charges accrue, easily totaling thousands of dollars. When the unit is ultimately sold at a foreclosure sale, the price often may not equal the mortgage amount owed. The bank takes what it can -- and nothing is left over for the condo board.
ONE former president said one owner who did not pay his carrying charges ran up a bill of $65,000; in a counterclaim, the owner said the building owed him $45,000. The building agreed to call things equal. "We gave him a credit of $20,000 just to get rid of him," the former board president said.
Stuart Saft, a real estate lawyer who is chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives, is proposing state legislation that would hasten the foreclosure process. The legislation does not attempt to reverse the banks' and the boards' position on who has first call on funds from foreclosure sales. "It just attempts to stop the bleeding, to stop the hemorrhage," said Mr. Saft, adding that if passed, the new law might cut the time of a contested foreclosure from four years to four months.
Meanwhile, a number of managing agents have recently begun to push condominium boards to add a line item to their annual budgets for the reserve fund.
"We are trying to get the condominiums we manage to focus on this issue -- it's becoming a more serious issue every day," said Oskar Brecher, president of American Landmark Management, which manages about 20 condominiums. Two buildings his company sponsored -- 923 Fifth Avenue and 58 West 58th Street -- historically took different approaches to the problem.
At 58 West 58th Street, a more "middle-of-the road" condominium in terms of the affluence of its apartment owners, he said, the reserve fund must be large enough to handle most common expenses. Right now, the condominium's goal is to have no less than $250,000 at any one time.
At 923 Fifth Avenue, one of the many white-brick apartment houses converted to condominiums in the 80's after it was built in the 50's for rental tenants, there has been a different approach.
"These owners are the types that would rather have the money to use as working capital -- when we needed money, we'd just ask them," said Mr. Brecher. But now, he said, there is a new sense that there should be a reserve fund. "Now we have started salting away money," he said.
No. 923 Fifth Avenue is a good example of an older condominium building that, despite its undistinguished exterior, still manages to sell well, according to sales agents. A major reason is its location: at 73d Street. There are only a handful of condominiums on Fifth Avenue on the Upper East Side, and the apartments that face Central Park are considered blue-chip. A six-room, 1,500-square-foot apartment with a park view at 923 Fifth sold in January 1995 for $1.5 million, or $1,000 a square foot.
"A condo on Fifth Avenue is generally more valuable than a co-op on Fifth Avenue," said Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth-Warburg Associates. "They're simply more scarce, and the buyers who want them have very few alternatives."
When the apartment hunter moves away from the poshest neighborhoods, brokers say, the gap narrows. At a nondescript postwar brick condominium at 141 East 55th Street, a 595-square-foot one-bedroom is for sale for $185,000, with total monthly charges of $715; a comparable co-op might be priced between $140,000 and $150,000.
For the more ordinary condominiums that languish on the sales market, renting is a definite option, and brokers say that in today's hot rental market, an apartment in a so-so building rents for almost as much as a comparable one in a luxury building. At the Savoy, a condominium at 200 East 61st Street built in 1986, a one-bedroom with great views rents for $2,400; one is on the market for $369,000. At The Monarch, a 1984 building in a less desirable location -- 200 East 89th Street -- a one-bedroom is currently for sale for $229,000, yet the rental income is pretty much the same, according to brokers' listings of both sales and rentals.
Roger Erickson, senior vice president of William B. May Real Estate, said there is only one rule: "A brand new building in a great location with big apartments will sell."
"It's like buying a new car," he said. "Some people won't do anything else. They love the new car smell, the feeling that they're the first to live there." Other than that, he said, the condo market is "spotty" and goes building by building. He gave as an example the condominium building at 45 West 67th Street -- right across the street from the Millennium Tower.
Mr. Erickson currently has the actor Kevin Kline's apartment for sale. "It's a 2,200-square-foot duplex with spectacular views for $1.05 million," the broker said. "And I can't understand why it hasn't sold. That's less than $500 a square foot."
IN addition to the Millennium and the Trump International, real estate agents familiar with Manhattan's condominiums listed the following buildings as among those significant within the market:
* Trump Tower: In the height of the market, the best apartments here were trading for $1,500 a square foot. Agents say that the pace -- and the price -- have fallen off since its heyday and that the apartments are not distinctive. But the Trump Organization disputes those comments, arguing that the best apartments fetch more than ever. The 2,500-square-foot apartment 57L, which faces Central Park, sold in August for $3.2 million, $1,280 a square foot. Meanwhile, apartment 63H, a 1,076-square-foot apartment without a park view, sold in July for $650,000, or about $600 a square foot.
* 1049 Fifth Avenue: With its entrance on 86th Street, this former hotel that was gutted and expensively rebuilt features large apartments with prewar finishes. Though apartments here have taken a while to sell, the building is now 92 percent sold, according to a spokeswoman for the developer. This year, apartment 17A, a seven-room, two-bedroom apartment with a paneled library and city and park views, sold with a maid's room and a storage room for $2.1 million; subtracting the value of the extra rooms, the price was over $1,000 a square foot.
* 817 Fifth Avenue: Unusual for a condominium because it is a prewar building, this tower at 63d Street has elegant, single-floor apartments the owners sometimes rent for more than $20,000 a month. Steve Wynne, the Las Vegas casino owner, recently signed a contract for $4.5 million for an apartment.
IN Greenwich Village, at the four prewar condominiums known as the Bing & Bing buildings after the company that once operated them, including 45 Christopher Street and 302 West 12th Street, brokers' listings indicate a sharp rise in sales prices. Apartment 14B, a two-bedroom at 45 Christopher, sold in March of 1992 for $385,000; by last May the same apartment six floors lower brought $440,000.
The Galleria, built in 1975 at 117 East 57th, suffered in the pit of the market from a slightly worn-looking lobby. Now, according to Roberta Title, head of condominiums at Gumley-Haft Real Estate, whose company also manages the building, it has a new board of managers composed of tenant owners. The new board has put in plantings and completely redone the rooftop gathering room and terraces, and acted to stabilize rising carrying charges.
In December 1991, when the market was at bottom, apartment 39H in the Galleria sold for $267,000 in a foreclosure sale, according to transfer records. The same apartment, 1,208-square-foot "convertible two-bedroom" -- one bedroom plus dining room -- is back on the market, priced at $539,000. Ms. Title said she did not think the price was high for today's market; Apartment 37D, also a "convertible two," is under contract for $509,000. Apartment 45A, the biggest apartment in the building, a two-bedroom with dining room, sold two months ago for $925,000, or more than $500 a square foot.
Yale Robbins, a company that gathers statistics on condominium sales, confirms the trend: In January 1994, the average per-square-foot sales price at the Galleria was $450; by this July, it had shot up to almost $600.
Olympic Tower, at 641 Fifth Avenue, at 51st Street, has its detractors among agents, who grumble that it is not being properly maintained. Others say that the rooms, if not spacious, are not tiny and that the building remains popular with Europeans, who still insist on a Fifth Avenue location. Again, location within the building makes all the difference: an outstanding view is considered readily salable, according to brokers; other units may languish.
All in all, brokers say it is the prime condos that are selling the quickest. "Big, family-sized condos are so hot you can feel the heat right down to the bottom of your feet," said Clark Halstead, head of the brokerage that bears his name. In the 80's, he continued, "developers -- in their wisdom -- built teeny-weeny chicken coops, because the conventional wisdom was that they'd get more per square foot.
"In fact, it's proved the opposite -- the bigger apartments and the best views bring the most money."

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/Public Housing;
In the Beginning, New York Created First Houses

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
THEY demolished another high-rise housing project last month, the six giant buildings of the Lafayette Courts complex in Baltimore, providing additional evidence to support the belief of many people that the public housing vision has gone awry. So how are things at New York's first housing project, built in 1935? Fine thank you -- and not just because First Houses, at the southwest corner of Third Street and Avenue A, is no taller than the trees that shade its cozy courtyard.
In the 1930's the idea of government-built housing was dangerously close to socialism, almost a cuss word at the time. But reformers drew on generations of disgust with the growing urban slums and the more recent Depression to mobilize for a new approach. Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia appointed Langdon Post, a housing activist, to head the city's new Housing Authority. Post had been head of the Tenement House Department, a city agency. 
 Post found Washington impossibly slow in using its large relief funds for slum improvements, and he wangled $300,000 and free Works Progress Administration labor to attack a dozen mid-19th century tenements on the Lower East Side.
At the time there were two competing views of how to remake the older sections of the city: the visionary one, clearcutting to create a completely modern landscape, and the nuts-and-bolts one, emphasizing rehabilitating buildings in small clumps. This second method was the one the Housing Authority tried out first, planning a renovation of the old buildings and demolishing every third building to reduce housing density and increase light and air. The resulting 122 apartments opened in December 1935.
The architect, Frederick Ackerman, put the entrances to the buildings in a rear courtyard with benches and plantings, and gave them new skins of industrial-style brick.
The Housing Authority received 3,800 applications for the 3- and 4-room apartments, which rented for $6.05 per room, about two-thirds of what similar apartments in surrounding slums cost. Interviewers carefully screened out those families who they felt were too poor, too rich, too big, too small, too lazy and too dirty. May Lumsden, who was in charge of the screening, wrote in the magazine Survey Graphic in 1936 that she got only "the very finest types" for tenants.
Of the 122 families selected, 81 had had no private toilets, and 20 had had some rooms with no windows. So they were properly grateful: "I never knew what color my furniture was before; I never saw it before except by electric light," Mrs. Lumsden quoted one of her happy new tenants as saying. At the end of a year there were no delinquencies and no family was on relief: the first tenants of First Houses were barbers, taxi drivers, garment workers and the like.
Over the years First Houses has changed little, in part because of landmark designation in 1974. There are new windows, and a gate to keep the homeless out of the central courtyard at night. The tenements to the south have been demolished, flooding the rear courtyard with sun underneath giant London plane trees. Tenants now congregate in a protected courtyard with light and air so luxurious it makes some apartment houses on Park or Fifth Avenues look like, well, tenements.
Andrew Hladeck, who moved in in 1946 after serving as Gen. Douglas MacArthur's personal cook, says that in recent decades the Housing Authority has been lax on supervision of the maintenance staff and the tenants, and he knows that some tenants illegally sublet or share their apartments. Mr. Hladeck, who was a cook at Child's for many years and is now retired, pays $424 a month for a two-bedroom apartment.
John Hamill, acting director of the Housing Authority, said that no complaints had been received about illegal subletting at First Houses but that any future complaints would be investigated. He said that in terms of supervision, "we have done our best with limited resources."
IF public housing nationwide is generally so problematic, and if so many cities have demolished developments, why hasn't New York torn down any, high-rise or low-rise? "While other Housing Authorities solve their problems with dynamite," Mr. Hamill said, "the New York City Housing Authority has persevered and currently maintains the largest and most viable housing stock in the nation."
Roger Starr, a former New York City housing administrator and a contributing editor at the magazine The City Journal, said that compared to other cities, the Housing Authority, with its 184,000 units, had been very careful in tenant selection. "They got lax in recent years," He said, "but they've reverted to a strict policy in the last 8 or 10 months."
Albert Davila, a spokesman for the Housing Authority, said that evictions citywide were up: 912 this year through July, against 384 for all of last year. There are 150,000 families on the waiting list, he said.
Elsie Griesbacker, the president of the First Houses tenants association, said she waited 16 years to get into the development and has been a tenant for 12 years. She said she also wants greater supervision. After 60 years, she said, the interiors need a major overhaul.
She is hoping that First Houses will get a $4.5 million Federal grant to pay for new plumbing, bathrooms and electrical improvements. But neither she nor her neighbors wants to move. "Most people, walking by, don't even know it's a project," she said.

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY & CO.;
A Distressed Town's Famous Son Sends Investment Money Home

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER 

DATELINE: PENNS GROVE

 BODY:
Mystery swirled around this Delaware River community for months: who was the secret buyer of 12 waterfront acres in the depressed heart of town?
No one had been interested in Penns Grove real estate since the sprawling Du Pont chemical works next door in Carneys Point, once a cornerstone of the local economy, began laying off blue-collar workers decades ago. Statistically, if not emotionally, this town of 5,200 is the state's second most economically distressed municipality, after Newark. 
 When papers were filed naming the corporate entity Screwball Inc. as the purchaser, a thrill of hope and expectation surged through the town. The man who controls Screwball is the area's most famous son, the actor Bruce Willis.
Soon tourists, the first in memory, were taking pictures of the vacant 12 acres, a stone house and a shuttered bank building that Mr. Willis had bought for $750,000. They entered one of the few remaining businesses on Main Street, Willis Hardware, to ask if it was owned by the star, who became famous from the television series "Moonlighting" and his "Die Hard" films, and now commands more than $10 million a picture. "No relation," they were told.
And they wanted to know if Mr. Willis's equally famous (and rich) wife, the actress Demi Moore, had been spotted this summer talking to contractors hired to renovate the stone house the couple planned to occupy on visits with their three young daughters.
But mostly, everyone wanted to know what plans the couple had for the property.
"So far, all we know is he owns a house with a very large backyard," said H. Donald Stewart Jr., a local real estate broker whose office handled the purchase.
Mr. Willis's press agent in Los Angeles said the actor would not comment on his plans for Penns Grove. But some of the locals have reached what they figure is the only logical conclusion: riverboat gambling.
Philadelphia is trying to win approval from Pennsylvania voters to license floating gambling halls. If that happens, many people think New Jersey will follow.
"I think we'll have riverboat gambling one day," ventured Paul Morris, Penns Grove's Mayor. "If Bruce Willis knows someone who knows someone who knows there will be gambling on the river, then he has picked a location that is strategically located to serve the riverboats."
Penns Grove was settled by Quakers three centuries ago. During World War I, when the Du Pont gunpowder plant turned into a round-the-clock operation for 25,000 workers, the town's night life turned rowdy as the population went from 2,000 to 10,000 almost overnight. Contemporary accounts tell of "staggering" crime rates, bands of thugs blowing safes, bordellos above taverns, gambling and murder.
Besides Du Pont, the river was the economic heartbeat of Penns Grove. Ferries carried travelers back and forth to Wilmington, Del., directly west. Excursion boats, traveling between the 300-foot pier in Penns Grove and the Philadelphia docks, gave revelers a day's outing. Meat and eggs from sturgeon pulled from the river were canned in a factory near the pier, reportedly the largest caviar producer in the United States. World War II and the postwar boom brought petrochemical plants to the banks of the Delaware north of Penns Grove.
Then two things happened from which the town never recovered. The New Jersey Turnpike was built, and the Delaware Memorial Bridge opened to carry north-south traffic between New Jersey and Delaware. Penns Grove became a backwater for interstate travel, and residents were soon driving across the bridge in 15 minutes to shop in Delaware, which has no sales tax. Sweet shops and haberdashers that had once done a bustling commerce on Main Street were closed, leaving only a few merchants.
Mr. Willis was born in Germany in 1955. Soon after, his family settled in Carneys Point, where his father and uncles worked at Du Pont and other plants. Industrial employment was already in a slide as blue-collar workers lost jobs to technology, and expectations about future jobs were low when Mr. Willis graduated from Penns Grove Regional High School in 1973.
"I grew up here and saw it all go downhill terrible," said Debbie Pruette, who was a junior the year Mr. Willis left to start hunting for work as an actor in New York City. She and others remember him as a wisecracking, popular guy not much different from the roles he has created. He was student government president and was voted by his class to be the student with "the most school spirit."
Mr. Willis has come back to Penns Grove for high school reunions, most recently in 1993. But there was no hint that the local boy who had made good was destined to return as a prominent investor.
"I give him credit for actually bringing some of his good fortune back here," said Adele M. Stalcup, 43, the only lawyer in town. She has been struggling to restore Leap House, a sagging three-story Victorian pile across from Mr. Willis's land. "But I'm not sure if I am going to like Bruce as a neighbor if he turns this place into a little Las Vegas."
Others were more optimistic. "I'm not sure Bruce Willis even knows what he wants to do with the property," said Rose Maurice, head of the local Neighborhood Preservation Program. "But he brings excitement to a town that needs some cheering up after more than two decades of decline."

FUN AT THE JAYS'
Friends of the 64-acre John Jay Homestead in Katonah are holding their third yearly Old-Fashioned Country Fair today from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. with dozens of attractions for children and adults.
The $10-a-car admission will be used to support the historic site's educational programs. 
 Of special interest to animal lovers is a 4-month-old, 40-pound Siberian tiger cub -- one of several nonpettable animals to be admired. Its handler, Andrew Simmons, will also bring along an 8-month-old bear cub, an alligator snapping turtle, a python, a European eagle owl and a peregrine falcon.
While children will have to observe the creatures from a distance, they will be able to pet the goats, sheep, geese and a donkey in the homestead's farm-animal compound.
There will be pony rides, rides on wagons drawn by Belgian draft horses, three-legged races, egg tosses, demonstrations by artisans, an antique car and tractor display, storytelling, numerous games, music by the New York Blue Grass Authority, lots of food and many door prizes rounding out the agenda.
In addition, anyone with a home-baked apple pie may submit it for judging. The winner will get a free dinner for two at the Monkey Bar in Manhattan.
The Homestead is on Route 22. For more information call 232-5651.
 
ARMONK ART OUTDOORS
 Nearly 170 artists representing 17 states from coast to coast will take part in the 34th Annual Armonk Outdoor Art Show on Saturday and Sunday from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. It will be held at the American Legion Field behind the North Castle town offices on Bedford Road. Admission will be free, but a donation will be appreciated to support projects at the North Castle Library.
It was the Friends of the library that started the show years ago, bringing it to a stage where it is now rated among the top 200 exhibitions of its kind in the country by the professional artists publication Sunshine Artist Magazine.
Judged in six categories, the entrants are well known in their fields of oil, watercolor and acrylic painting, sculpture, mixed media, graphics, and handcrafts. Prices range from $35 to $9,000, and six works -- one in each category -- will be distributed as prizes in a raffle for visitors.
Among the artists represented are Michael Patterson, Peter Bramhall, Laura Breitman, Albert Drogin, Guenther Riess, Sue Phalieros and Carol Turentine.
For more information, call 666-7544.
 
A SMITHY AT MUSCOOT
 William Fitzgerald is a seventh-generation blacksmith, the first of his family to be born here or anywhere outside of County Limerick in Ireland.
He will lead four blacksmithing workshops at Muscoot Farm in Somers for anyone who wants to learn the craft.
The first of the five-hour sessions will take place next Saturday from 9 A.M. to 2 P.M.; the others are scheduled on Oct. 7 and 28 and Nov. 4 during the same hours. Each session costs $65 and is limited to five students.
"We have five forges, five anvils and five sets of tools for them to work with," Mr. Fitzgerald said. "And this is not a situation where people come and watch me demonstrate. They do all the work, I just guide them through it."
In addition to running his own ironworks where he makes horseshoes, ornamental objects, gates, fireplace tools, and provides decorative items for churches and building contractors, he has held the classes at Muscoot for a dozen years.
Many of his students come back for increasingly advanced instruction. The most popular items for first-time students are fireplace pokers and nails, but each student can make whatever he or she likes.
"Making a nail is very difficult because it's so small," he said. "The iron heats up and cools down quickly, before you have a chance to draw the point or make the head." Fires are stoked with soft coal and the forges are hand cranked the old-fashioned way.
Hard-soled shoes, not sneakers, are to be worn, with jeans, sweatshirts or other sturdy clothing. Leather aprons are provided for protection.
To register or obtain more information, call 232-7118.
 
BIG POWER BREAKFAST
 The first suburban breakfast to be held by the 240,000-member National Association for Female Executives will have as its theme "The Big News in 'Big' Business -- Thinking Small."
It is scheduled on Tuesday from 8 to 10 A.M. at the Nestle Building, 100 Manhattanville Road in Purchase, and registration is $30.
Planned in conjunction with the Entrepreneurial Center of Purchase, the event will be attended by members of the two organizations and the public from Fairfield, Rockland and Bergen Counties as well as Westchester.
Marge Lovero, president of the Entrepreneurial Center, will moderate a panel discussion by Maurice Cox, vice president of Pepsico in Somers; Dee DelBello, publisher of Westfair Communications and the wife of Alfred DelBello, a former Westchester County Executive, and Joanne Reilly, senior vice president of National Westminster Bank.
Billed as a "not for women only" event, the program is aimed at executives and owners of small businesses, focusing on the demand by big businesses for outside entrepreneurial ideas and services.
Call (212) 477- 2200, extension 334, to register or obtain more information.
 
BUSINESS AND ASIA
 Sharon Russell FitzSimmons, international finance and treasury executive for Philip Morris International, will be the speaker at the Westchester County Association lunch on Wednesday at the Rye Town Hilton in Rye Brook.
Her topic will be "Is the Time Right for You to Be Doing Business in Southeast Asia?"
She will outline opportunities in the markets of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, where a population of 425 million generates a gross domestic product worth $570 billion and the per capita income is $1,400 a year. As a result, those markets are beginning to compete strenuously with the developed economies of Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong.
Ms. FitzSimmons is a graduate of the Harvard Business School who spent four years in management positions at Philip Morris's Australian operations before becoming involved in the company's Asian expansion.
A reception will begin at 11:30 A.M., followed by the lunch and presentation at 12:15. Reservations at $50 may be made by calling 948-6444. ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: Dollars and Dallas: League of Their Own?

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
ON the field, they butt heads. Off the field, in the business of merchandising and promotion, the teams of the National Football League have long embraced one another, a 32-year success story in socialism. They sell their names and logos for use on jackets, T-shirts, mugs, caps and other goods through a central organization, NFL Properties. And at the end of the year, each of the 30 teams shares equally in the proceeds. No matter that the Dallas Cowboys alone account for one-fifth of all sales of N.F.L. merchandise, nearly twice as much as the next best team.
Enter Jerry Jones, the Arkansas oilman who in 1989 acquired the Cowboys and their stadium for $140 million. Mr. Jones's mantra is that teams can market themselves on their own much better than does NFL Properties, and he has set out to prove it in ways that are enraging the league. 
 Last month, he gleefully tweaked the league when he told Coca-Cola, an NFL Properties sponsor whose soda is poured in 28 of 30 N.F.L. stadiums, that it was out, replaced by Pepsi-Cola and Dr. Pepper, in a 10-year, $25 million deal. Then, this month, he struck a deal with Nike, which is not an N.F.L. sponsor, that stunned the league and the many companies with which it does business. For the price of $2.5 million a year through 2001, he let Nike paint its trademark swoosh on the Cowboys' stadium, develop a theme park at the stadium, and outfit all Cowboys coaches and other sideline personnel in Nike-made attire.
Mr. Jones flaunted his deal during a nationally televised Monday night game against the Giants at Giants Stadium. He distributed a news release that blared "Cowboys Owner Bucks N.F.L. Again," and strode to his team's sideline with Phil Knight, the chairman of Nike, and Monica Seles, the tennis star and Nike endorser.
Mr. Jones has even called for the end of NFL Properties, to encourage each team to pursue individual entrepreneurial success. "You don't have to be a rocket scientist to do better than they did," he said. "You wake up in the middle of the night thinking of ideas."
Now the league has decided enough is enough, and is taking the extraordinary step of suing one of its own. Last Monday, it took on Mr. Jones in United States District Court in New York, seeking $300 million in damages. It contended, among other points, that Mr. Jones had embarked on a "wrongful plan and scheme to destroy the structure and operations of NFL Properties in order to gain for the Cowboys more than an equal share of licensing revenue."
It is a debate that is energetically argued in many fields, from Hollywood to law to consulting to finance. The biggest producers tend to believe that everyone should eat what he kills, while their colleagues favor throwing everything into a common pot. Just as bankable movie stars now insist on fees 50 times greater than the supporting actors and just as investment bankers bargain for huge bonuses linked to their own deals, Mr. Jones wants an end to one-for-all-and-all-for-one.
And when everyone cannot come to terms, an organization can come apart at the seams.
The dispute also raises an issue that dogs all the professional sports leagues. Is the N.F.L. a single business that competes in the market for entertainment, the way McDonald's competes in the restaurant market? Or is it a group of independent businesses conspiring to dominate the professional football industry? Not surprisingly, sports leagues have been loathe to touch the question: an unfavorable answer would open them to antitrust suits, blowing away the authority they exercise in everything from the division of television revenues to collective bargaining with players.
A day after the lawsuit was filed, Mr. Jones alighted at a special owners' meeting in Atlanta, where his 29 brethren and league officials questioned his renegade philosophy. While he muted his often rousing rhetoric, he nonetheless said he had done nothing wrong.
"In my mind, there is no issue of the rules not being followed," he said. Nike, Pepsico and Dr. Pepper struck sponsorship deals not with the team but with the stadium, he said, and therefore did not fall under N.F.L. restrictions.
Mr. Jones is now rumored to be on the verge of a deal with American Express, which the league believes would ambush its sponsorship deal with Visa U.S.A., which just began, and a deal with AT&T, a rival to GTE, another NFL Properties sponsor.
"This is a big crack in Properties," said Michael Beindorff, executive vice president of Visa U.S.A., the San Mateo, Calif., credit card company. "We're very concerned because we've invested a lot of money in time, planning and strategy in this unique five-year relationship."
PAUL TAGLIABUE, the N.F.L. Commissioner, and Sara Levinson, the president of NFL Properties, who was recruited a year ago from MTV, argue that Mr. Jones is working against the best interests of the other teams, and that what's good for the league is good for every team.
They paint an Armageddon-like scenario if Mr. Jones's free-enterprise system defeats the N.F.L.'s brand of socialism. They see the value of sponsorships and licenses falling, declining product quality, and the destruction of NFL Properties' carefully designed and highly integrated methods of promoting the league. All this is spoiling a time when NFL Properties' revenue, from 325 licensees and 35 corporate sponsors currently, has grown nearly 400 percent since 1988.
"It's impossible to pull out one area of Properties without destroying the entire fabric of what we're doing," Ms. Levinson said. "To build an audience, you have to promote the game through what we, the sponsors and retailer do."
NFL Properties abhors chaos and any attempt to divert it from its course. As a promotional machine, only the National Basketball Association is its peer. In addition to awarding product licenses and selling sponsorships, it plans the Super Bowl. It executes large national promotions and sweepstakes like Coca-Cola's "Monsters of the Gridiron," Gatorade's "Punt, Pass & Kick," and a Hershey's Super Bowl sweepstakes with coupons on 100 million candy products. And it stages the N.F.L. Experience, an theme park at the Super Bowl.
The battle between Mr. Jones and the N.F.L. is particularly fiery because the Cowboys are a valuable asset, trading on the three decades of nearly unbroken national fame, from the days of Tom Landry and Don Meredith, through the current reign of Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin.
"This wouldn't be happening if it were the Tampa Bay Buccaneers doing this," said George Daly, dean of the Stern School of Business at New York University.
In 1990, when the Cowboys' record stood at 1-15, merchandise with the Cowboys name and logo accounted for just 2 percent of the retail sales of NFL Properties' licensees. At that time, the struggling team actually benefited from the revenue-sharing arrangement.
But by 1992, the share had risen to 16.9 percent. It peaked at 27.8 percent in 1993, and is now at 20.3 percent, still far greater than the second-place San Francisco 49ers, at 11.3 percent.
"I'd be doing this if we were still at 2 percent," Mr. Jones said.
The two sides could compromise on a formula that guarantees teams a minimum payment from NFL Properties, but would reward those that sold the most with extra payments. Or the league could allow teams to solicit sponsorships from companies in product categories not pursued by NFL Properties.
"They have to change," said Frank Vuono, president of Integrated Sports International, an East Rutherford, N.J., sports marketing company and a former NFL Properties vice president. "The rules were created for owners who didn't own their own stadiums and didn't spend $200 million for their teams. There's room for mediation, and the business-oriented owners know it. But Jerry's forcing the rest of them not to trust him. He's telling sponsors that he'll deliver the most prominent team in the league, get them on 'Monday Night Football' and make it worthwhile not to sponsor the N.F.L. -- and do it at a cheaper price."
If the lawsuit goes to trial, the focus will be on the N.F.L.'s inner operations and could examine the antitrust implications of a partnership whose members cooperate by sharing their gate receipts, television fees and NFL Properties revenues.
Some experts on sports business support the N.F.L. "Tagliabue is right," said Mr. Daly of the Stern Business School at New York University, who has done work for the league. "If you want to maximize the value of what's produced, you do it on a coordinated basis."
He said he agreed with the N.F.L.'s view that a sponsorship deal involving the Cowboys stadium is the same as a deal with the team itself. "You can no more separate a stadium from a team than you can the left guard from the quarterback."
BUT Paul Weiler, a professor at the Harvard Law School, disagreed. "Jones is right as a matter of law," he said.
Professor Weiler said one issue was "whether an NFL Properties exclusive contract can be extended to cover stadium licenses." More important, he said, is "whether the contract violates antitrust law as a restraint of trade." Lacking an antitrust exemption to market on a leaguewide basis, "the N.F.L. clearly does not have the right to control stadium deals," Professor Weiler said.
Still, said Andrew Zimbalist, a professor of economics at Smith College, antitrust law has usually been applied with restraint to the governance of sports leagues. "Courts do look at the structure of leagues and exempt certain centralized activities," he said.
Mr. Jones is a rogue in a league with few others, except the Oakland Raiders' Al Davis, who successfully challenged the N.F.L.'s right to control the relocation of a franchise when he moved from Oakland to Los Angeles. His return to Oakland caused the league last month to file suit.
Mr. Davis, president of the team's general partnership, obliquely criticized the suit against Mr. Jones. "I like the way he does business," Mr. Davis said. "He's a winner." He would not say whether he would buck NFL Properties, as Mr. Jones has. He probably cannot: he does not own the team and the stadium he plays in, in contrast with Mr. Jones, the Miami Dolphins' H. Wayne Huizenga and the New England Patriots' Robert Kraft.
Mr. Jones said he had no problem with sharing television and gate revenues. One critic, Tom Shine, president of Logo Athletic, the apparel maker and second-largest NFL Properties licensee, said: "He likes some rules and not some others. This isn't a buffet line."
But Mr. Jones thinks he has the right to choose his team's apparel, control his sidelines and select any sponsors he wants for his stadium.
"Jerry is shaking up the status quo and we're glad to be part of it," said Brad Shaw, a spokesman for Pepsico.
NIKE also seems pleased. Indeed, Mr. Jones and Mr. Knight made for a perfect mating of business renegades. Mr. Knight has proudly built a company -- its slogan, "Just Do It," summarizes its philosophy -- that is known for flouting the sports bureaucracy. Frustrated in its attempts to become a league licensee, Nike made an end-run, assured by Mr. Jones that it was doing no wrong.
"We are pleased to have an agreement with Jerry Jones, which we believe will prove to be good for the sport," said Keith Peters, a company spokesman, who added that Nike still wants to become a licensee.
How will this battle conclude? The Federal court may eventually tell the combatants to settle before it imposes a plan. That scenario led to the creation of the league's current free agency plan with the players' union. Mr. Jones may be pushing the limits, in hopes that the league will partly agree. Mr. Tagliabue, who has never been as publicly angry as he was at last Tuesday's owners' meeting, may not be so willing. Pat Bowlen, the owner of the Denver Broncos, said: "I'd like to think there could be a negotiated settlement with Jerry, but I doubt it. The only solution may be for Jerry to come home."

HEADLINE: To Fight a Crash, Funds Buttress Their Cash

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
AS the bull market in stocks charges ahead, mutual fund managers are putting as much money to work there as possible, keeping less cash on hand than at anytime in nearly two decades. Month after month, the big fund companies have insisted that this is no cause for concern. Even if the market tumbles headlong, they say, they have enough cash in reserve to handle redemptions from investors who might suddenly want to sell.
Now, though, some cracks are appearing in the industry's facade. T. Rowe Price Associates, the fund company in Baltimore, recently sought clearance from the Securities and Exchange Commission to secure emergency sources of cash should they be needed "to meet unanticipated or excessive redemption requests by shareholders." 
 Other fund companies have also explored ways to guarantee emergency access to cash. State Street Bank in Boston said it had responded to more than 20 inquiries from small and midsized fund families, which it declined to name, about providing guaranteed lines of credit in recent months.
"There were a few inquiries after the 1987 crash, but they were nothing to compare with the level of interest being exhibitied today," said Joe Belanger, a vice preisdent in charge of mutual fund lending at the bank. "There's a concern on the part of funds that there may be a pullback in the market and that they might need access to liquidity on a timely basis without having to sell stocks into a declining market."
Even the least superstitious of investors might be left queasy by these defensive moves, what with the Dow Jones industrial average approaching the eye-popping level of 5,000 and the frightful month of October around the bend.
To be sure, no one is panicking yet -- not even T. Rowe Price, which needed to consult the S.E.C. because of its desire to set up a joint credit line for most of its equity and bond funds.
But the significance of a company as prominent T. Rowe Price -- whose $45 billion in more than 60 funds makes it the fourth-largest company specializing in no-load funds -- preparing for a massive wave of shareholder redemptions is apparent. "The industry is clearly much more conscious and concerned about what could happen if there were a substantial selloff," said Geoff Bobroff, a mutual fund consultant in East Greenwich, R.I.
The fund companies most vulnerable in a stock selloff would be those with few funds under their roof and those without the deep pockets of a brokerage firm or other financial institution. Merrill Lynch Asset Management, for example, has the financial might of its parent company, and Fidelity Investments considers the cash hoard in its money market funds a sufficient source of capital, either for emergency borrowing or loan collateral. Smaller firms have less to fall back on.
Most mutual funds have always had the ability to borrow money to meet emergency needs -- generally up to 50 percent of net assets under the Investment Company Act of 1940. To do so, individual funds or fund groups generally approached banks only when necessary.
Under this arrangement, a fund paid nothing until it actually borrowed the money. But it was not guaranteed that the bank would have money to lend at that time.
By contrast, committed lines of credit, as sought by T. Rowe Price, stipulate that the bank will lend up to a specified amount any time the client asks for it. These contracts carry an annual fee, charged either to the fund or to the management company.
"If all conditions remained constant, and if the history of the industry were a good predictor of the future, uncommited credit facilities would likely be adequate to meet the emergency liquidity needs of Price Funds," T. Rowe Price wrote to the S.E.C. on April 28. The S.E.C. cleared the plan in a letter dated July 31 and made public last month. In its request, the company cited several important developments that made binding commitments desirable.
For one, fewer banks have been willing to extend uncommitted lines of credit, apparently because the banks earn no money on them unless a loan in made, the company said.
But the letter also outlined broader reasons. "The mutual fund industry has many new funds," the company noted. "The ripple effect of how these funds and their shareholders handle negative market events could have significant impact on the redemption activity of the mutual fund industry at large."
In a phone interview, Henry Hopkins, chief legal counsel at T. Rowe Price, emphasized that the company "does not have any current need or have any impending anticipation of needing" access to emergency lines of credit to handle redemptions. "It is what I call good planning. We sought simply to make certain we had the capability and the authority to secure credit if in the future we determine it is advisable."
But the reasons cited by T. Rowe Price reflect a sentiment that is gaining strength across the fund industry, particularly with cash levels near all-time lows as a percentage of fund assets.
In recent months, the cash on hand at stock funds has dwindled to just under 7.1 percent, the lowest level since the fall of 1978, when the mutual fund industry was one-fortieth its current size. Similarly, cash levels in bond funds have hovered near their historic lows for two years, most recently dropping to 6.1 percent.
Market analysts watch mutual fund cash levels because they indicate future buying power -- that is, how much new money rests on the sidelines, ready to buy stocks or bonds. But for the last six months, the level of uninvested cash in equity mutual funds has remained below 8 percent, a level that market strategists say often indicates a stock market top.
Combined with the growing influence of mutual funds in equity markets generally, that low cash levels might be a prescription for disaster. That was the substance of a warning recently issued by Henry Kaufman, the famed Wall Street economist whose firm bears his name. "I think that in the face of an extraordinary market disturbance, perhaps along the lines of the 1987 stock market break, there is the potential for very large redemptions from both equity and bond funds," Mr. Kaufman said.
So dire is the possibility, he said, the industry should consider "introducing some circuit breakers in the mutual fund sector, analogous to those that have been developed succesfully by the stock exchanges and the futures exchanges."
Mutual fund regulators point out that the system has been tested on several occasions and withstood considerable pressure. Not in the 1987 crash or at any time since have mutual funds asked to suspend redemptions because of a cash crunch, said Heidi Stam, associate director of the division of investment management at the S.E.C.
 Cash levels reported by the industry may also be misleading. Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said that the huge growth in recent years of growth and income funds -- at one-third of total equity fund assets, the single biggest category of stock funds -- skews the numbers. Because growth and income funds hold stocks and bonds, often in the form of Treasury notes, as well as cash, their cash ratios tend to be lower than the rest of the group.
In addition, Ms. Cohen said, many funds now have the authority to use derivatives, which means they can create synthetic cash through risky maneuvers, like collecting cash in exchange for promising to buy stock later at a predetermined price if the market falls. "I believe the effect of those two features is that cash levels are higher than the numbers would indicate," she said.
Nevertheless, since the crash of 1987, fund companies have been scrambling to arrange access to more cash, and that trend has accelerated recently. "Our business has probably doubled in the last 12 months," said Mr. Belanger of State Street Bank.
Climbing over each other for business, banks have reduced by about 40 percent the annual fee they charge funds for committed credit lines. Mr. Belanger of State Street Bank said nearly all of the major banks that provide other services to mutual fund companies have been working on loan agreements as well. He cited the Bank of New York, Mellon Bank and Chase Manhattan.
The fund companies that have signed up for credit lines with State Street manage $1 billion to $30 billion in assets apiece and have requested loan guarantees of up to $200 million, Mr. Belanger said.
T. Rowe Price said it might require much more. "The current thinking is in the range of $400 to $500 million," or about 1 percent of assets under management, for a credit line to be shared by about 50 funds, the company said in its letter to the S.E.C. Under the plan, T. Rowe Price's funds would share the cost of setting up a committed credit line, with each fund paying part of the annual fee based on its assets and on whether it borrows money. The fund company said last week that it had not established such a credit line yet and called the S.E.C. letter a technicality because each fund could have secured a credit line without regulatory approval. The biggest companies have some other options as well. Fidelity Investments, a unit of the FMR Corporation, has taken steps to insure its bond and stock funds are able to meet redemption demands. In 1990, the company received permission from the S.E.C. for a borrowing program that allows Fidelity money market funds to lend to Fidelity stock and bond funds on a short-term basis.
Arthur Loring, senior vice president and general counsel at Fidelity, said the program was a response to the crash of 1987, when Fidelity deferred for several days the transfer of cash to shareholders who had sought redemption.
When an investor redeems shares in a mutual fund, the investor receives the "next calculated" price for his shares, usually the price at the end of the day the request is made. But the fund's manager legally has seven days to transfer the cash.
In normal markets, most fund companies make that transfer the day the shares are sold. But in 1987, Fidelity told sharesholders it would take longer to pay them, because of the volatility of the market. In an emergency, funds also have the option of paying investors in shares of stock from the portfolio, rather than cash, though no fund was forced to do so in 1987.
While redemptions have calmed down significantly since then, Fidelity has made extensive use of its internal lending program. Jane Jamieson, a Fidelity spokeswoman, said loans among Fidelity funds had occurred an average of "less than 10" times each year from 1990 through 1994 to "fund redemptions and facilitate settlement." No loans have been necessary this year, she said.
Other big fund companies also have contingency plans for a wave of redemptions, but they also express confidence they will be able to meet demand. John J. Brennan, president of the Vanguard Group, said Vanguard has the ability to borrow but lacks a companywide guaranteed line of credit. "We've seen a dimunition in redemption rates since 1987," Mr. Brennan said. "The average mutual fund holder now is much less likely to be an active trader of stocks or bonds based on short-term criteria."
Daniel Maclean, general counsel at the Dreyfus Corporation, a unit of Mellon Bank, played down the significance of the T. Rowe Price letter. "The letter is a very minor item in the larger picture," he said. "Normally, for a mutual fund to borrow money is not difficult because we have the best collateral available."
In addition, "absent a major collapse, you don't have a circumstance where you can't sell securities," Mr. Maclean said. "You may have to sell at a price you don't particularly like, but you can sell."
Smaller fund companies face bigger problems getting quick access to cash, especially if they don't have a variety of funds, like money market funds, which presumably would attract more money in a market downturn. Daniel S. Perkins, a co-manager of the Perkins Opportunity Fund, sees no cause for alarm. His fund, at a mere $34 million in assets, is a top performer this year and is the only fund managed by Perkins Capital Management. It has an uncommitted credit line of $3 million -- nearly 10 percent of assets.
He expects lenders to come through with cash if asked, but he acknowledges, "If one fund is getting major redemptions, chances are it will be a problem for the whole industry." Incidentally, he said, the fund recently raised its cash level to about 12 percent.
Mr. Bobroff, the fund industry consultant, points to some significant differences between the mutual fund market today and that of 1987. More than half of today's funds didn't exist then, he said, nor did the no-fee fund programs like Charles Schwab's Onesource. Those programs' customers could drain fund companies if they began switching money out of stock and bond funds into a money market account managed not by the same fund company, but by the Schwabs of the business.
Disinterested parties and interested watchers alike note that fund shareholders have never panicked and bailed out of mutual funds en masse. "The experience over the last eight years is that the market has been extremely liquid," said Bob Adler, president of AMG Data Services, an Arcata, Calif., firm that tracks cash flows at mutual funds.
That has probably saved not a few poorly capitalized fund companies. "In 1987, there probably were some fund companies that were teetering that didn't fail because it was not a prolonged selloff," Mr. Bobroff said. "But if we were faced with a 1973-74 debacle, Lord only knows what the industry would do.'
But mutual fund shareholders do sell when the market declines. According to data from the Financial Research Corporation, a Chicago company that tracks fund statistics, the number of months of cash on hand at stock funds to cover redemptions at their current levels has been low all year, at about five months' coverage. That is hardly apocalyptic, especially when fund managers often have access to new money to offset redemptions.
Still, the only times the coverage fell lower were in March 1994, January 1992 and October 1987. If redemptions as a percentage of assets were to rise to their level of October 1987, the cash coverage would slip to less than three months. Moreover, funds would not necessarily bear the weight of a massive selloff equally. Some funds have far less cash, and a few have invested borrowed money already, making them far more vulnerable.
All of which has fund companies -- if not fund shareholders -- checking to see if they are ready for an unpredictable decline in the market. It is not hard to imagine why T. Rowe Price and other fund companies might want to make sure they have access to cash, said Mr. Belanger. "They are a service organization, and they live and die by their reputation in the marketplace," he said. "It's very hard to tell your customers that you don't have their money when they want it."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Time on Their Side, Saving on Their Minds

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
IT is one of the conundrums of investing: why don't the young do it? After all, they are the ones who can reap the most rewards from the passage of time, and they have plenty of years to recover from mistakes.
Sure, some people in their 20's do save. Some recent surveys suggest that more twentysomethings are saving for retirement than did their elders at a similar age. 
 But many young Americans do not salt anything away, or at least not much. And the same force, time, that makes youthful investing pay off also makes delay costly, as a calculation by the Vanguard Group, the mutual fund company, makes clear.
Imagine a 25-year-old who invests $1,000 a year at 8 percent interest, does so for 10 years and then stops his contributions. At age 60, despite stopping at age 35, he will have nearly 36 percent more money than someone who waits until age 35 to start investing the sum and does so every year religiously for 25 years.
"That's the power of compounding," said Rob Cummisford, a consultant for Ibbotson Associates, an investment consulting firm in Chicago. "Your money gets invested sooner, and it has extra time to work for you."
So who are the young investors who have cracked investing's biggest conundrum and gotten that lucrative head start? What spurred them to begin? What were the hurdles?
Some people in their 20's are just naturally farsighted, like Daniel D. Soine, 24. Having paid off his credit card debt and seeing his savings account grow a bit beyond its opening balance, Mr. Soine, a public relations executive with the United States Professional Tennis Association in Houston, now invests $100 a month in the Janus Fund, a growth-oriented mutual fund. He has about $1,300 so far. "Once I get up to the $2,500 minimum, I'm going to start up with an aggressive growth fund, 20th Century Ultra," he said. "I want to get that aggressive growth while I'm young," suggesting that he will close out his Janus Fund account.
Ken Kurson, 26, a staff writer at Worth, a personal finance magazine in Manhattan, also has an eye on the future. Earning $35,000 a year, he started investing about 18 months ago. "I suddenly had money for the first time," he said. So far, he has $1,000 in the Berger 100 fund, a growth fund with many technology holdings. He has also put $5,000 in Wasatch Aggressive Equity Fund and $2,000 in Founders World Wide Growth. Mr. Kurson also holds some stock in Apple Computer and Scripps Howard.
Of course, Mr. Soine and Mr. Kurson are lucky to have money to invest. For the young, it is a scarce commodity.
"Most people in their 20's are just trying to scrape by and pay the monthly bills," Mr. Soine said. "Saving for retirement is the last thing on their mind."
But sometimes a little taste of scraping by can spur saving, as it did for the Depression generation if not for baby boomers. Paul Kopasz, a 32-year-old songwriter, spent much of his 20's scrounging around downtown Manhattan, barely making ends meet. For a while, he lived as a squatter on the Lower East Side.
In recent years, his life and economic status had turned around. He has moved to the more affordable town of Lexington, Ky., and he earned $50,000 last year, mostly through performing. With memories of the Lower East Side fresh in his mind, he has also put away $3,000 in the Berger 100.
"Living in New York made me think more about the hard-nails aspect of having money," he said.
Even so, it is hard for Mr. Kopasz to see the needs of faraway old age. "The money is not for retirement, really," he said, adding that he has heard all the doomsday predictions for Social Security in the next century. "It's more of a security blanket."
But those dire Social Security forecasts do worry Ana Marie Cox, 23, a New Yorker who works as an editorial assistant at Alfred A. Knopf, the publishing company. Indeed, she is skeptical that Social Security will be able to provide adequately for her parents, who are in their early 50's, much less for herself. "I would like to be able to help my parents out when they get older," she said.
Ms. Cox, who said she earns about $20,000 a year, won't be able to contribute to her company's 401(k) until next year. In the meantime, though, she is squirreling away what she can. By cutting out lunches and forgoing compact disks, she has managed to save about $300.
"In the next couple of months, I should have enough for a minimum investment" in a mutual fund, she said. "I haven't decided where yet, though." She does, however, keep a file of newspaper clippings about funds to help guide her choice.
How did Ms. Cox see the financial light at such a young age? "There was a point when I just started to get on my feet after I graduated, when I started to see that being financially secure was going to be important," she said.
Like many others in their 20's who have started to invest, Ms. Cox does not shrink from aggressive-growth funds and other choices that can produce high returns but also carry high risk. "I can afford the risk of investing in a mutual fund, I think, because I am young enough," she said. "I like the logic of long-term investing."
Investing experts say such thinking is on target. The longer the investor's time frame, the more he or she can ride out the bumps of risky investments. But setting specific objectives is another tenet of good investing, and here Ms. Cox is a bit hazy on her aims, much as Mr. Kopasz sees his investing just as an all-purpose cushion. "I'll probably have a better idea in 10 years," she said. This lack of clear goals makes the activity more like all-purpose saving than investing.
Also like other young people, and unlike many boomers, Ms. Cox has made some basic life decisions with an eye on hard-edged financial realities. She quit graduate school at the University of California at Berkeley, where she was studying American history, to avoid the student loans that are the bane of many in her generation. Far-off financial consequences drove her choice of employment too. "The reason I took the job," she says of her position at Knopf, "was because of the 401(k)."
Fear of the future is not the only cause of this vigilance. Despite their haziness about goals, young people have some financial sophistication.
"What we have learned is that people in their 20's and 30's today are much more knowledgeable than people that age were 20 or 30 years ago," said Richard Eisenberg, the 38-year-old executive editor of Your Future, a personal-finance magazine produced by Time Warner that is aimed at people in their 20's. Not only do younger adults now have many more sources of financial information, he said, but they are not as preoccupied with another investment, real estate, as were their elders.
But they are a bit like boomers in another way: politics. "Being concerned about money is not as uncool as maybe it was during the 'Don't trust anyone over 30' days," Ms. Cox said. "But there still is that kind of rhetoric out there.
"People want to make a living and make money, but they don't want to be accused of selling out," she continued. "I really felt guilty when I told people I wasn't going to work at The Nation but instead went to work at a giant multinational corporation," making a reference to Advance Publications, which owns Knopf.
Mr. Kurson looks to the last decade for the reason. "The go-go 80's have been so stigmatized as an era of avarice that young people today want to disassociate themselves from it," he said.
Nevertheless, many young people do invest, and for some the lure is an ambitious one: early retirement. "I would love to retire in my late 40's and 50's," Mr. Soine said. "That's one of the key reasons why I am investing." Maybe he will succeed and maybe he will not, but by starting early, he is certainly increasing his odds.

Breaking Up Is...Oh, You Know
It was certainly truth in advertising. After AT&T dropped its bombshell about breaking up, it said in a full-page ad aimed at customers, shareholders and communities it touches: "That probably means you." Yes, it's the most widely held stock -- 2.3 million Americans have some. And it's a presence in nearly everyone's life. So now what? Well, for phone customers, it's nothing like the '84 breakup, which created the service mishmash we have now; it's just corporate musical chairs. For investors, it's good news now -- the stock shot up 10 percent. But over time, it's a question: will those fabled "widows and orphans" wind up with AT&T's stronger or weaker pieces? And oh yes, how about the company? The equipment business, experts say, could do terrifically, could do terribly. A global expansion might be helped, might be hurt. The only consensus: the business world will really feel it.
 
 
MEDIA GIANTS
 
Time Warner Makes Its Move
Time Warner and Ted Turner finally made up their minds: Time Warner will shell out $7.5 billion in stock for the Turner empire, making it the No. 1 media company, even ahead of Disney-ABC. For Gerald Levin, Time Warner's chairman, it's a big shift: from buying cable systems to getting things like CNN and the Cartoon Network. And Ted Turner gets to be vice chairman, with, as he said, his "life savings" in Time Warner stock. It's not over, though. US West, a Time Warner partner, said the deal didn't have its consent, and Consumers Union attacked the deal, saying it would raise phone and cable rates. Stay, as they say, tuned.
 
POLITICS
 
Welfare Overhaul, Squared
It can hurt to get your wish. President Clinton wanted to "end welfare as we know it," and that's what the Senate gave him last week. But it was if he asked for a banana and got a huge fruit bowl in crinkly green plastic, for the wise senators voted more to demolish than to tinker. Block grants would go to the states, $70 billion would be cut from anti-poverty spending over seven years, and there's no expansion in education, training, or subsidized jobs. All of which, said Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, wouldn't end welfare but "create 50 welfare systems" and could mean "real tragedy for the children." But another Democrat, Tom Daschle, called it "the best bill we are going to get." And Mr. Clinton, having orated himself into a corner, just may have to sign whatever bill emerges.
 
AUTOS
 
Safety, Before the Law
In the wrong hands, with the wrong luck, cars are mass murderers. Yes, they're getting safer -- with seat belts, air bags, stronger frames, high brake lights, other goodies. And as each safety item proves itself, the lumbering regulatory process makes it mandatory -- too quickly for some, too slowly for others. Then when cars kill anyway, auto makers can argue -- unless there's some defect -- that they've paid their legal dues. But have they? That was the question last week as a New Hampshire court ruled that a trial could be held to test Ford's liability in the death of a woman in a car with no air bag -- even though it was an '88 car, built before air bags were mandatory. In other words, should car makers rush to add any safety device as soon as it exists?
 
AIRLINES
 
All the Earthly Comforts
Last week British Airways introduced snazzy new first-class compartments, or "pods," complete with armchairs that turn into beds, tables for two, video units, phones -- and privacy. It's all designed by a specialist in yacht interiors. Now, said a travel agent, business people "can use their time in the air as if they were in their office." But is that sameness what our souls crave, or are we nurtured by variety? Some days, we've got the comforts of home; others, the mind expansion of travel. They're gradually blending into one. Oh, good news, though: the first-class New York-London fare is still only $3,367. One way.
 
CANADA
 
New Life for Tobacco Ads
A crucial tobacco battleground is advertising: antismoking activists want it banned, saying it lures young people to smoking, while tobacco companies insist it should be legal to promote a legal product. Smoking foes looked to Canada as a model, since in 1988 it banned nearly all tobacco ads. But last week Canada's Supreme Court struck down that ban, saying it was unconstitutional because it violated free expression. This stunned antismoking activists, one of whom said of the tobacco companies, "They are unmatched in terms of their resources and lack of ethics." But a tobacco industry spokesman said new ads would be aimed at "people who have already decided to smoke."
 
EDUCATION
 
When Johnny Can't Pay
The personal finance articles make it all wonderfully simple: sock away 98 percent of your income every month, and paying for college will be a breeze. All right. Fine. Meanwhile, out in the real world -- the one where 2 percent of your income won't quite pay the mortgage, plus buy new shoes every week (those growth spurts!) -- parents just can't pay those scary college bills. The result: loans are soaring. In a report out last week, the Education Resources Institute said loans hit $23.1 billion in 1994, up from $7.9 billion a decade ago. Federal loan programs, it said, disbursed more in the last four years than in their first 20, and half of students now graduate in debt.
 
POLITICS
 
Taking His Marbles Home
"Foreign investors will not understand what is happening here," one economist worried. Of course they won't. How could they be anything but mystified as our legislators try to reinvent the entire American way of life in time for tonight's cocktail hour? But this concern had a specific cause: Newt Gingrich's threat last week to snap the congressional wallet shut and send the nation into default for the first time ever if the President refuses to dance to the Republican music. "I don't care what the price is," Mr. Gingrich said -- a price, by the way, that would include failure to make November Social Security payments.
 
VISIONARIES
 
Farewell, Mr. Popcorn
Orville Redenbacher. Hmm. Probably some suitably homespun-looking character actor recruited to lend his name and face to overpriced popcorn. Sorry, you're way off. An agricultural scientist, he spent years coming up with the first real improvement in popcorn since long, long before the Pilgrims -- a fluffy wonder that expands up to 40 times its original size, not the puny 20 times of old popcorn. He and a partner made their breakthrough in 1965, he peddled the popcorn from his station wagon until Marshall Field's introduced it in 1970, they sold out to Hunt-Wesson in 1976 -- and their popcorn became the leader in the nation's $1 billion annual market. So raise a buttery handful to Mr. Redenbacher, who died last week at 88.

HEADLINE: What About Lilco Shareholders?

 BODY:
All of the plans, including Dr. David Bronheim's [Letters, "A Plan to Buy Cheaper Electricity," Aug. 13], suffer from the same illusion. They proceed from the presumption that Lilco shareholders are invaders from outer space who arrived on Long Island to capture an electric utility and bilk Long Island's residents via exorbitant electric rates.
In fact, the backbone of Lilco shareholders are Long Island residents who invested their money in a local electric utility because they trusted the officials they elected to office. Long Island has the highest electric rates in the nation, because New York State investor-owned utilities are burdened with the highest local and state taxes. Dr. Bronheim should know that Lilco investors have a binding agreement with the state in the form of a legal franchise, and Lilco owns huge tracts of land bought decades ago, and most of its equipment and transmission lines were built at costs vastly lower than they would be today. 
 The State Appellate courts have ruled unanimously that utility shareholders must be compensated at a figure approaching replacement value in a public takeover, and a private takeover would require a shareholders' vote.
The Public Service Commission has held lengthy hearings, No. 338242. The shareholders were assessed the full cost of Lilco management failures, and shareholders suffered a decline in share value, from $35 per share to $6 and years of no dividends. The P.S.C. hearings also noted that the Shoreham fiasco was accomplished by procedural delay caused by antitechnology zealots during a period of the highest interest rates in recent history. Interest costs were higher than $1 million a day for many years.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who foamed at the mouth in his eagerness to take over Lilco, had all of the alternatives that are being suggested today, and after years of maneuvering the best he could do was to buy Shoreham for $1 and pass the cost to the ratepayers. Meantime Con Ed's Indian Point 2 General Electric nuclear plant, a twin of Shoreham, is operating at 90 percent capacity factor, and it is Con Ed's lowest-cost generating source.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
The Forest Primeval Isn't What It Used to Be

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
TO travelers zooming along the highways of the northeastern United States in search of the first fall foliage, the deciduous woodlands that decorate the landscape like a blanket of fluffy, colorful cumulus clouds might look like a sign of improving environmental health. Surely, this is the way things were before Europeans set foot on these shores. Or is it?
It is true that the Northeastern woodlands have refilled much of the space once taken up by farms, that the trees are growing bigger and that animals like black bears, beavers, wild turkeys and even moose have returned. But does this mean that the forests have recovered from two centuries of destruction, or that they ever will? 
 In many ways, the character of the forest has been transformed beyond recognition. It has been cut up into so many fragments that much of its native biological richness has been lost. Where once there were elms and prothonotary warblers now there are Japanese honeysuckles and cowbirds.
The northeastern deciduous forests are remnants of a band of temperate-zone woodlands that encircled the globe 10 million years ago. Since then, they have proved remarkably resilient in the face of almost constant disturbance. The last ice age pushed the trees south, and when they finally began to recover their territory, within the last 10,000 years, they encountered a new disturbance: Indians. To make the landscape more passable and attract game to the tender re-growth, Indians regularly set fire to the woods. The burning favored thick-barked oaks over thin-barked species like maples, birches and beeches, creating large oak-studded open stretches.
Contrary to myth, then, much of the forest that greeted the first European settlers was not a dark wilderness but rather something like the settlers' own tame English parks. One 17th century arrival wrote that these areas made the country "very beautifull, and commodius."
Still, the settlers wasted no time in clearing the rest of the land to make room for farms. At various points in the 18th and 19th centuries, farmers managed to cut all but about 2 percent of the Northeast's trees.
Finally, though, the forest got a break. About a century ago farmers began abandoning the Northeast and moving to the Midwest, where the soils were better. This simple economic act, more than any deliberate restoration effort, was the reason that the woods made a comeback. When the farmers left, the trees began to reclaim their fields.
In general, the Northeastern forests have more recovery potential than many other ecosystems, simply because they get more rain. According to Reed F. Noss, a conservation biologist at Oregon State University, who was an author of a Federal study of endangered ecosystems this year, the forests of the Northeast tend to regenerate on their own if they are simply left alone.
Ecologists say the woods still have some distance to go, though, and they may never get back to their pre-settlement state. "What we now have," says Dr. Mark McDonnell, a botanist and ecologist at the New York Botanical Garden's Institute of Ecosystem Studies at Millbrook, N.Y., "is a forest that's 80 to 90 years old" -- middle-aged, but not yet mature from an ecological standpoint. (Contrary to popular belief, many of the older and bigger trees are in cities and older suburbs, where they escaped destruction by farmers.)
The percentage of Northeastern land now in forests ranges from 89 percent in Maine and 87 percent in New Hampshire to 31 percent in Delaware, 42 percent in New Jersey and 43 percent in Maryland, according to the latest estimates by the United States Forest Service. Sixty-two percent of New York State is in trees, and 59 percent of both Connecticut and Pennsylvania.
But these forests are different from their predecessors. Chestnuts and elms have been all but wiped out by diseases imported from abroad. The region's magnificent and stalwart oaks, deprived of the Indians' fires that once kept competing trees in check, are having trouble regenerating, and they are threatened by a fungal infection called oak wilt. Sugar maples and red maples have been attacked by a disease of unknown cause and by maple wilt. All told, says Dr. McDonnell, the future of at least 10 forest trees, including beech, flowering dogwood, sycamore, white ash, balsam fir and hemlock is clouded by disease or pests.
What is replacing the old trees? The forests are being taken over by exotic plant species like the well-known ailanthus (or tree of heaven), the Japanese honeysuckle, the bittersweet, the Norway maple and the Amur cork tree. Although exotics were introduced as ornamental trees (and the City of New York continues to recommend some of them for urban planting), many have escaped to the wild.
 
More Vulnerable
 For example, the naturalized relatives of the Norway maples, with their thick, low canopies, are crowding out native species. They cast a deep shade that ruins sun-loving trees' chances for survival. And because their leaves do not decompose well, the plants near them on the forest floor do not always thrive.
Roads, power lines, encroaching exurbanites, high-tech industries and vacation homes have also taken a toll. Dr. McDonnell says 71 percent of the forest in the rural New Jersey highlands, regarded as a reasonably wild area, consists of patches smaller than 50 acres.
This fragmentation isolates plant and animal populations, so that each species is more vulnerable to local extinction. Fragmentation also creates lots of forest "edges" -- places where non-native species invade the forest and displace native ones. At the forest's edge trees are more susceptible to being blown down and to being eaten by game animals like deer. The more forest edges there are, the smaller the range of deep-forest creatures. For instance, songbirds like the red-eyed vireo, the wood thrush and the prothonotary warbler are now being pushed aside by raucous bluejays and parasitic cowbirds. And the "edge effect" can ripple surprisingly deeply into the forest.
To many people, one kind of forest is as good as another. But for ecologists something irreplacable is slipping away. "We have enough quantity, but what we're losing is the quality habitats" and the native plants and animals that go with them, says Dr. McDonnell. "We're losing that natural heritage."

India Repels an Invasion of Money

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI

 BODY:
TO Indians reading about her in the country's newspapers and magazines, Rebecca P. Mark has hardly been presented as a friend of India. Ms. Mark has been widely cast here as a robber baron for her role in winning the Enron Development Corporation, a subsidiary of the Houston-based energy company, a contract to build India's largest-ever power plant. After Enron had spent nearly $300 million, the project was canceled last month by nationalist politicians in Maharashtra state who said India didn't need the plant.
So when Ms. Mark left her New Delhi hotel on a recent afternoon to visit the India Gate, a soldiers' memorial that is one of the capital's principal landmarks, it was a surprise to find her surrounded by well-wishers. One man, Rakesh Aggarwal, a New Delhi lawyer sightseeing with his family, put it simply: "Personally, I think India needs power."
 
American Assumptions
 There is a lesson in this for American companies, and for all outsiders approaching India as it reaches for a new relationship with the world. Many companies responding to India's market-based economic reforms have behaved as if they had read a standard primer on India -- a country that is desperately poor, 60 percent illiterate, but unusual among Asian nations in being a thriving democracy, having English as its common language and a proven legal system. From this, they have assumed a congenial environment for investment. 
 But these companies, and sometimes the embassies that advise them, have not always taken account of how aspects of India that seem so familiar can work in ways that are not so friendly. In the face of Enron's problems, there are many with long experience of India who say that it is a major mistake to underestimate the willingness of politicians here to resort to demagoguery to stir passions -- a fear of foreign depradations, for example -- that are part of the emotional and psychological archaeology of India. When this happens, foreign companies that were welcome one moment can find themselves pariahs the next.
When Enron was invited to build a power plant by the Indian Government three years ago, it agreed against a background of crippling power shortages. Almost every day, airports and railways shut down when power goes out; factories juggle working hours around the vagaries of electricity, sometimes managing only one dead-of-the-night shift. And in the shantytowns where nearly half the population of the big cities live, the only power available is whatever slum-dwellers can bootleg by stringing makeshift connections onto high-voltage lines, with consequences fatal to thousands.
Last week, Maharashtra invited Enron to send executives here to re-negotiate its contract. But if the company agrees, it will effectively be accepting sharply reduced profitability as a lesser evil to a drawn-out court fight for compensation. And it will be re-cutting its deal with Maharashtra without much support from the New Delhi Government that invited it in the first place. Since Maharashtra reneged, the Government of Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao has gone ominously quiet, apparently judging that the nationalists have the winds of public favor.
Enron's Ms. Mark is not the only American executive who proselytized for India, only to have to face a corporate board at home wanting to know what went wrong. Two weeks ago, it was the turn of Kentucky Fried Chicken, whose first restaurant in India, in Bangalore, was closed by city authorities, then re-opened by a court order, after opponents accused it of exposing customers to cancer and other ailments allegedly linked to the company's chicken formula.
If investing in India were to be judged by the common man's good will, it wouldn't be so tricky. In a country where 350 million people are officially listed as living below the poverty line, every foreign company that sets out its stall is inundated with people hoping for work. But the politicians on all sides have virtually ignored such obvious benefits. With a national election to fight next spring, the Hindu nationalist parties that control the Maharashtra government brushed aside expert studies on the Enron project -- along with 13 court rulings in Enron's favor -- when it scrapped it.
To many Indians, the Enron fiasco has been a sobering demonstration of how ready politicians on all sides have become to shun the country's obvious needs in favor of approaches that seek to capture large "vote banks" by stirring destructive passions. Before foreign investment was an issue, the most promising field for the demagogues to work lay along the fault lines in Indian society, the fractures of caste and ethnicity and religion. Before Enron, Maharashtra's Hindu nationalists had grown powerful by fomenting anti-Muslim passions, culminating three years ago in riots in which at least 1,200 Muslims died.
For many years, the secular tradition of the Congress Party, the party of Nehru and his descendants, surmounted India's divisions. But in the 1980's the party sank to new lows in popular support, and with Mr. Rao in charge it has pandered to Hindu extremism and "caste-ism" and, worse, has become almost a byword for corruption..
To many Indians who despair of this cynicism, the best hope for a political rebirth lies in economic reforms -- the hope that the Rao Government has set in train a process under which entrepreneurship, and not political or bureaucratic favor, will become the final arbiter of wealth -- and that, if poverty and illiteracy decline, so will the potential for corruption and demagogy.
But all this could be jarred if the forces that derailed Enron continue to gain momentum. There are Indians who believe that even the project's cancellation can work to India's benefit. "All you have to do is to talk to the average taxi driver," said Rajendra K. Pachauri, an energy economist and one of the experts who reviewed the Enron project. "Whatever the politicians say, he understands one thing very clearly, that India has at last entered an era of economic possibility. He sees a chance for himself, and he has no intention of allowing any politician or bureaucrat to deny it to him."

HEADLINE: FAULT LINES: The Big One: Washington's Political Earthquake;
Seismic Shift In the Parties Reflects View On Business

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS Newt Gingrich's army of anti-regulatory troops tore through the Capitol last week, terminating bureaucracy and welfare benefits with extreme prejudice, and even threatening to default on United States bonds if that's what it takes to force the Clinton Administration to cut the budget their way, there was a temptation to stick familiar labels on the combatants.
Certainly liberals are among those appalled at the depth of cuts in Medicare, and conservatives are happily at work opening up Federal lands to loggers and slicing the Commerce Department into a half-dozen pieces. But using the old labels obscures a newer fault line running through Washington. More than ever the struggles between Democrats and Republicans -- and some of those between Republicans and Republicans -- have far more to do with the divergent interests of big and small business. 
 Ever since Bill Clinton came to office, he has done more for the Fortune 500 than virtually any other President in this century -- making trade the No. 1 priority by, for example, pressing the North American Free Trade Agreement into enactment over the objections of labor, or opening up relations with Vietnam before every rice field around Saigon sports its own Japanese factory.
In contrast, the new Republican revolution -- even more than the Reagan Revolution of more than a decade ago -- belongs to small business, the disaffected and the thousands upon thousands who have become involuntary entrepreneurs after being laid off or bought out. Their agenda is championed by Mr. Gingrich and many newcomers in the House Republican majority that was swept into power last year. What sets this aggressively activist class of freshmen Republicans apart is their roots on Main Street: Nearly 60 of them grew up in business, mostly small business, and think that most "business-government partnerships" excluded them.
In some ways they bring to mind the Republican constituency of William Howard Taft, who was famously rude to big-business executives who came to his door (his half-brother had to caution the President that he was giving affront to "all our friends") but rarely met a tariff he didn't like. That was an era, like today. when business seemed so reflexively Republican that there was little danger in going populist.
"There is this traditional cleavage within the Republicans that goes back to the beginning of the century," said Michael R. Beschloss, the presidential historian. "And over the past decade, as the Republicans have moved more and more to the right, the pragmatic, moderate executives of big firms are not sure where to go. On some issues the dividing line is not always that sharp, but there are a lot of strange splits and new alliances. And big business is still struggling with the fact that Bill Clinton is the first President who has pushed hard on the issues that are important to them, and understands economic realities of the world in a way no Republican President has."
That hardly means that big business is suddenly the Democratic Party's best friend, or even that the change in alliances is likely to have much electoral resonance. After beating down the doors in China and Japan, promoting free trade pacts in Asia and Latin America and opening a "war room" that uses the power of the United States Government to win contracts for American business around the world, the White House's frustration is palpable. "It's incredible," said a Clinton political adviser. "They all tell us we've done a great job, understood their problems in a way Bush and Reagan never did. And yet the money goes to Newt, and when you look at the polls of business executives, maybe 5 percent or so express real support."
In fact, big business now looks like a constituency in search of a party -- culturally alienated from the Democrats, perpetually frustrated by the Republicans.
Certainly there is common ground with Gingrich & Company. Business-led organizations like the Coalition for Change have spent $10 million financing television and radio ads calling for a balanced budget sooner rather than later.
But the Republican majority seems to go out of its way to tweak the boardroom. Seizing on a phrase once favored by Labor Secretary Robert Reich (who was told by the White House to pipe down) House Republicans scream daily about "corporate welfare." That may be more hype than reality (on the same day welfare went under the knife the Senate saved the Market Promotion Program to advertise American farm goods overseas) but there is no question that it is the small-business owners who have Congress's ear.
It was small businesses that led the charge against health care changes -- which would put them at a disadvantage against their bigger brethren, who can better afford any new burden -- and it is small businesses leading the drive against environmental rules that big business can also better cope with, and sometimes turn to its advantage.
The new order was aptly illustrated last week when Mr. Gingrich threatened to force a default on Government obligations if that's what it takes to make the White House see the budget his way. America has never defaulted -- and if it did its cost of borrowing around the world would soar. The bond markets shook, not because anyone thought a default was imminent but because the mere specter of high officials bandying about the possibility could drive away foreign investors and send interest rates up.
The old, Eastern-establishment Republicans of the Eisenhower-to-Nixon era would have blanched at the very thought of publicly suggesting national financial suicide. Mr. Gingrich's allies just smiled a smile that seemed to say: Who cares what investors around the world think? We need every weapon we can get to force the White House to accept our budget, even if it means threatening the nation's credit rating.
Much the same divide can be seen in the early skirmishing over new Republican proposals for financing the Federal government: the flat tax and a tariff on Asian imports -- the latter the proposal of Pat Buchanan, the most protectionist of the Presidential candidates. Flat-tax advocates tend to be small-business owners looking to even the playing field with big competitors who have armies of tax lawyers.
Meanwhile, any company that relies on exports for a huge part of its sales -- Boeing, Intel or Procter & Gamble -- recoils whenever Mr. Buchanan opens his mouth.
"Big businesses have learned in recent years that they export or die," a senior Administration trade official said recently, "and they need all the help they can get."
Small businesses, no surprise, are less interested in market opportunities in Bombay. Partly it is a matter of resources, but partly it is a matter of world view. Even the smallest companies in Japan have a fairly subtle understanding of export markets; in the United States, officials frequently have to start their "emerging markets" seminars with a map: This is Indonesia.
No wonder, then, that it is the House freshmen, driven by memories of how disconnected from Washington small business feels, who have led the drive to dismantle the Commerce Department office by office. To them, it is just another rule-making bureaucracy. Now it looks like the trade side of the Commerce Department will be spared, but only after Commerce Secretary Ron Brown made repeated pleas for executives to come to its defense.
Mr. Brown was one of the architects of the new, business-friendly Democratic Party. If he can keep his department together -- a big if -- his next challenge is to make sure Bill Clinton gets a return on that investment.

HEADLINE: Manufacturers Challenge Economic Policy

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The nation's manufacturers, restless that weak demand is restricting production and profits, declared yesterday that the United States is capable of much greater economic growth, without a sharp increase in inflation, than the Clinton Administration, the Federal Reserve and Wall Street believe is possible.
The manufacturers' declaration, in a resolution adopted unanimously by more than 100 directors of the National Association of Manufacturers, is their bluntest, strongest statement on the issue. It came just before a Federal Reserve meeting on Tuesday to consider whether to lower interest rates to stimulate growth. 
 Several Fed officials have suggested in recent public statements that they are satisfied with current growth and will not act to reduce rates. But a poll of more than 100 top executives of manufacturing companies who voted on the resolution at the association's semiannual board meeting in Washington suggested that they want the Fed to push down short-term rates on Tuesday by a quarter of a percentage point.
"If you look at the last year or so, we have had intervals of high economic growth without inflation," said Dana G. Mead, who is chairman of the association and also of Tenneco Inc. "We think that basically underscores the point that we should not be scared by the bugaboo of inflation."
Mr. Mead said the manufacturers association, which represents 15,000 companies, would try to push the 1996 Presidential candidates to endorse faster growth. The issue is this: Does the economy have the capacity -- enough factories and skilled workers -- to expand output by more than a 2.5 percent annual rate without eventually running short of enough goods and services to satisfy the demand? Shortages would result in inflation, as consumers competed for scarce products.
The Federal Reserve and Wall Street's traders say that 2.5 percent is the upper limit. None of the Republican front-runners in the campaign have challenged this view. Neither has the Administration's economists. Laura D'Andrea Tyson, assistant to President Clinton for economic policy, repeated the Administration view in a speech to the manufacturers yesterday.
Even the manufacturers had been vague. While they have pushed for months for policies that would stimulate growth, they had previously declined to set a specific target. Yesterday they did so -- producing a number that made their lobbying effort far more specific.
"We now believe a target range of 3 percent to 3.5 percent annual G.D.P. growth is both realistic and appropriate," the manufacturers said in their resolution, referring to gross domestic product, the standard measure of economic growth -- a statistic that adds all of the wealth generated in the economy each year.
Regarding the election campaign, Mr. Mead said: "We intend to ask each political candidate where he stands on this issue specifically. Do you believe economic growth greater than 2.5 percent is possible, and if so, how would you get there?"
The economy grew at an annual rate of only 1.1 percent in the second quarter and 2.7 percent in the first, after reaching 4 percent or more through most of last year. The sharp decline in growth, and with it demand for manufactured products, clearly played a role in the manufacturers' advice to the Federal Reserve. "The common assumption that the economy cannot exceed annual growth rates of 2.5 percent without risking a resurgence of inflation does not reflect changed economic realities," the resolution said.
The nation's inflation rate has remained at 3 percent or less for the last year.
The manufacturers insist that they have become far more efficient and productive in recent years than either the Federal Reserve or the Administration acknowledge. Mr. Mead, for example, says that Tenneco's paper operations can now make paper at greater rates of production than Government statistics acknowledge. But if there is not the demand for the paper, then the alternative is to hold back on production, laying workers off in the process.
"By increasing economic growth to at least 3 percent, we would significantly reduce the downsizing that is going on," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the manufacturers association. "You won't eliminate it, but you would reduce it."
The manufacturers, in their resolution, also favored a balanced budget by the year 2002, but acknowledged that this "downsizing of Government could in the near term dampen economic growth." With lower Government spending, the task of stimulating economic growth falls heavily on the Federal Reserve.

HEADLINE: Yankees Look Away From Bronx

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
Some days it seems there ought to be three sets of baseball standings. One for each division, a second for the wild-card races and a third devoted entirely to the daily speculation about where or whether the New York Yankees will move.
At the moment, those standings would put the Bronx in the basement behind the West Side of Manhattan and the New Jersey Meadowlands in a pennant race. As George M. Steinbrenner 3d, the Yankees' principal owner, is set to begin a new round of talks with officials in both New York and New Jersey to determine where the team will land when its lease expires in 2002, there is finally light at the end of this years-long tunnel. Yankee officials say they hope to decide by Opening Day, April 1. 
 Although the Yankees say no formal decision has been made to move, the chances of their staying in the South Bronx appear dim, and government officials say the Yankees appear eager to be in a position of deciding between a glitzy stadium in Manhattan and a convenient and lucrative ball park in New Jersey.
"I have to be practical about this," said Charles A. Gargano, the Commissioner of the State Department of Economic Development. After a year of haggling over renovation designs for the stadium and the surrounding roadways in the South Bronx failed to produce anything acceptable to the Yankees, he said it had become clear to him that Mr. Steinbrenner "cannot be satisfied there."
David W. Sussman, the Yankees' executive vice president, insisted that the Bronx remains a viable option but said "the reality is we spent a year, and the city and state devoted a lot of attention and resources and creativity, and the plans that were developed really didn't meet the objectives we all set out for."
Another Yankee official with knowledge of the negotiations, speaking on the condition of anonymity, was more definitive about the prospects of the Bronx option: "I think it's barely breathing, if at all."
For the last year, the search by government officials for a New York home for the Yankees has focused exclusively on the renovation of Yankee Stadium. But two weeks ago, the team informed city officials that it was rejecting its final proposal -- No. 13 -- and once again cited problems with traffic flow, parking and what team officials say are fans' fears of going to night games in the South Bronx, despite statistics showing that the area around the stadium is virtually crime free during games.
A game of chicken has emerged around the issue of declaring the Bronx moribund. Neither the team nor the city wants to appear to be the one that pulled the plug on the Bronx, people involved in the negotiations said.
Such a stance could tar Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani as the Mayor who oversaw the dismantling of an institution and who administered a further blow to the Bronx, whose Hispanic voters he courts. And Mr. Steinbrenner, his brash self-interest notwithstanding, is eager to avoid being branded a latter-day Walter O'Malley, who was disdained by New Yorkers for moving the Dodgers to Los Angeles.
Since the state and city are eager to keep the team in the Bronx, one city official involved in the negotiations said it was up to Mr. Steinbrenner to say, "No matter what you build, it's not going to work in the South Bronx." But Mr. Sussman said that without any detailed proposals on sites for a new stadium, it would make no sense to rule out staying in the Bronx.
Beginning as early as next week, the Yankees will start negotiations with city and state officials in New York to study other options. At the same time, according to a team spokesman, Howard J. Rubenstein, Mr. Steinbrenner is expected to receive a formal proposal from officials at the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority for a new stadium at the Meadowlands.
Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, said he thought Mr. Steinbrenner had masterfully orchestrated the situation so that he could play off two states against each other. "This is the hugest shell game in the world," said Mr. Ferrer, a potential rival of Mayor Giuliani's in 1997. "Steinbrenner is trying to leverage the city into giving him a billion-dollar boondoggle on the West Side."
Mr. Ferrer has been among the most vocal critics of Mr. Steinbrenner, saying he has hurt attendance at games with repeated statements about fans' fears of the South Bronx, with high ticket prices and with little marketing to the area's Hispanic population. Besides, Mr. Ferrer said, if the team was playing better, more fans would come. He said the wild-card race, in which the Yankees are contenders, amounts to a contest to determine "the best of the worst" and is not creating fan excitement.
But Mr. Sussman said while the Yankees draw small crowds at home, they are one of the top drawing teams on the road.
"I think that says that this is an exciting team and fans want to see us, but they don't want to see us in Yankee Stadium," he said.
Initially, the search for new sites in New York will focus on Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, the Yonkers Raceway and the West Side of Manhattan, near the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. Other sites on a state list to be considered are the railyards at 207th Street in upper Manhattan and two other tracts in the Bronx.
But the only one that gets more than a flutter of eyelids from team officials is the West Side. Although Mr. Sussman said the team was eager to look at all proposals the state and city brings its way, one Giuliani administration official who has had extensive contact with Mr. Steinbrenner and who spoke on the condition of anonymity said it had become clear to all those involved that "if the Yankees had their druthers, they would prefer a stadium on the West Side."
The official said an initial review by the city "showed it could be a huge success on the West Side -- it could make a lot of money." But it could also cost a lot of money --some estimates are as much as twice the $600 million the Yankee Stadium renovation would cost.
And if traffic is a problem in the Bronx, surely Manhattan will hardly solve that. But team officials say that fans would be more willing to endure the hassle in midtown than they have been in the South Bronx.
The biggest attraction of Manhattan is the "sizzle factor." But New Jersey has beckoned Mr. Steinbrenner for years. The relative values of New Jersey and Manhattan are not much different for the Yankees than they are for anyone else deciding whether to leave the city for the suburbs.
New Jersey is decidedly second-tier in the glamour business, but an owner could get more for the money there -- more space, fewer traffic headaches and a greater sense of fan security.
As the Bronx fades from the discussion, so does the Yankee tradition. The calculation over where the Yankees will end up has become complex. But there are still sentimentalists who love the game and the deep tradition, as expressed by Mr. Gargano last week: "The Bronx Bombers belong in the Bronx. They've been there for 72 years."

HEADLINE: Congress's Science Agency Prepares to Close Its Doors

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
After more than 20 years of advising lawmakers on the most complex scientific and technical issues, a small Congressional agency will soon cease to exist, but it is vigorously pursuing its mission to the last.
The agency, the Office of Technology Assessment, widely praised for offering impartial advice and analysis to the senators and representatives who must make decisions on technical issues in which they have little expertise, will close on Sept. 30. 
 Although little known to the public, the agency has had a presence and influence in many of the great scientific debates on Capitol Hill. As Congressmen passed laws and budgets dealing with issues like medical research, climate change, the space program, genetic engineering, telecommunications policy and defense against nuclear weapons, studies by the agency have played pivotal roles.
The agency, one of Congress's smallest, with a $22 million annual budget and fewer than 200 employees, fell victim to budget cutting by the Republican majority and, its supporters say, shortsightedness about its value in providing unbiased, understandable advice on complex issues.
Some of the 130 professionals on the agency's staff have already left for other jobs, but most have stayed on and are working to the end to finish studies. Even as they empty desks, pack boxes and circulate resumes, staff members working in offices a few blocks from the Capitol are rushing to complete and distribute as many studies as possible before the deadline.
"We are going to put out 60 to 65 reports this year, compared to the 50 or so we normally release," said Dr. Roger C. Herdman, a doctor who has served as director of the agency since 1993. "It's really a point of pride for many of the people here to finish what they've started and get the reports to the people who asked for them."
Some studies, which normally take 18 months to 2 years to complete and can be hundreds of pages long, will be truncated because of the deadline, he said. Because there is no time to have some printed, he said, they will be distributed in photocopied versions or made available electronically on the Internet.
Several big studies were not far enough along to be finished, Dr. Herdman said, including reports on the role of the United States in United Nations peacekeeping operations and how to protect against weapons of mass destruction that fall into the hands of terrorists.
Critics of the agency, including Representative Robert S. Walker, the Pennsylvania Republican who heads the House Science Committee, said that in the past, the agency had taken so long to do its comprehensive studies that they were released after legislation they could influence was written. Dr. Herdman of the agency admitted that reports sometimes lagged behind legislation, but said agency researchers, when asked, had issued shorter interim reports or had testified at legislative hearings about studies in progress.
There are a number of theories about why the agency, which had been highly praised in Government, academic and scientific circles for its analyses and impartiality, lost out in the new effort of Congress to cut the size of its own budget. While some critics said the agency could be cut because its research duplicated work done by other public and private organizations, others said it had become vulnerable because of the way it was set up in 1972 to maintain its political neutrality.
The agency was established during the Nixon Administration to give Congress technical expertise equal to that available to the executive branch through its many departments and agencies.
Sometimes referred to as the think tank for Congress, the agency is overseen by a board with equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats and an even division between senators and representatives. To keep the agency from being overwhelmed with requests, only the board or committee chairmen and ranking members of the minority party could request studies. The agency was required to present several options, not just one, after a study, and to project the consequences of each choice.
During floor debates, the agency's reports were often quoted by both sides of an issue, supporters say, indicating that the agency was doing its job of supplying factual material to elevate the discussion.
Because the agency tried to be so neutral and because it was insulated from direct contact with most members, proponents say, new committee chairmen and members of Congress brought into power with last year's Republican takeover had little or no knowledge or appreciation of the agency. Without visibility and champions, an agency can quickly find itself in trouble.
"If you belong to everyone, you belong to no one," said Dr. John H. Gibbons, head of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Dr. Gibbons, who headed the technology office for 14 years before becoming President Clinton's science adviser in 1993, said the demise of the agency after it had proved its effectiveness reflected an anti-intellectual and anti-science mentality among some members of Congress who were not interested in looking at issues factually.
"Closing our eyes to issues is a very poor way to plan for our future," Dr. Gibbons said.
Senator Connie Mack, a Florida Republican who helped to lead the effort to kill the agency, and other opponents said its role could be filled by other Congressional fact-finding agencies, like the General Accounting Office and Congressional Research Service, or private organizations, like the National Academy of Sciences.
"The explosion of technology in America has been accompanied by an explosion in information on technology," Mr. Mack said. "O.T.A.'s efforts are being duplicated elsewhere in Government and in private industry."
But Representative Amo Houghton, a Republican whose New York district includes Elmira, Jamestown and suburban Ithaca, said the information explosion was the problem, not the solution. Mr. Houghton, who would have been chairman of the agency's board if it had survived, led the effort to save it. Obtaining unbiased information for making decisions has become harder, not easier, he said.
"O.T.A. acts as an impartial 'honest broker,' " Mr. Houghton said. "Members of Congress are deluged with advice from many quarters, but it is often tinged with the underlying bias and political agenda of the bearer."
Mr. Houghton, who said he favored reducing Government and cutting costs, said some lawmakers were so anxious to cut down the size of Government that they were not being selective. This shortsightedness, he said, will hurt the nation's ability to mobilize its resources in science and technology and to develop policies that create jobs and economic growth.
"We are cutting off one of the most important arms of Congress when we cut off unbiased knowledge about science and technology," Mr. Houghton said.

HEADLINE: A Struggle to Defend Housing Aid for Poor

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
A mere mile north of the Capitol, up in the Shaw neighborhood's poverty ghetto, the Rev. Jim Dickerson wonders aloud about politicians' enviable power to find certainty in fresh hyperbole.
"They're locked in an ideological battle that's out of touch with the reality down here on the streets," said Mr. Dickerson, a local pastor as steeped in the intricate problems of the poor as any downtown professional is in the arcana of special-interest lobbying. 
 Mr. Dickerson, whose scorn of welfare dependence is visceral, started organizing the poor 35 years ago as a Christian minister, when the cliche was "the war on poverty" and politicians backed it big. Now, still in the same rough neighborhood, he has survived long enough to see the latest Congress delivering on the "Gingrich revolution" of multiple cutbacks for the poor. It disheartens him not for the motive so much as the lawmakers' scant interest in actually looking into the good effects of the old, suddenly dying social strategy.
"The people doing away with these programs have never been here, never seen the work the money has done," said Mr. Dickerson, standing in the lobby of the Whitelaw Hotel, an exemplar of the Shaw neighborhood's slow, steady attempt to rise from the ashes of the 1968 urban riots.
The Whitelaw was built by pioneer black entrepreneurs at the turn of the century and gutted by poverty and drugs, crime and fire in the modern crisis of the cities. But it stands handsomely renewed now and occupied for the last three years by 35 welfare-free, working-poor families. Their arrival upward was made possible through a Federal community development program that allows tax credits to private-sector developers in building 110,000 apartments a year, more than 90 percent of the nation's new low-income housing.
"Amazing," said Mr. Dickerson, speaking not of the program's results but of the fact that it has just been threatened in the dramatic swoop of general cutbacks in programs for the poor that is moving rapidly through both houses of Congress. The housing tax credit and a companion program that requires banks to take part in urban renewal by extending mortgage loans in low-income neighborhoods are on the budget-cutting block. In their vulnerability, they are largely overlooked in the more melodramatic debate over unwed mothers on welfare and the passion to end traditional Federal guarantees of minimal help to the poor.
"The politicians have never seen the people positively affected by this, the community transformed," Mr. Dickerson continued, his voice echoing in the restored lobby of the Whitelaw, a landmark in the city's black history. "If they did, they could not in any good conscience take this away."
Like community development professionals in poor neighborhoods across the United States, from large renewed swaths of the South Bronx to Shaw's wobbly resurrection here, Mr. Dickerson was speaking in open despair at the notion that the low-income housing tax credit program has few defenders, either in Congress or in the embattled Federal bureaucracy, since it is rooted too locally, too undramatically.
"The poor are going to get a huge pay cut this year, and its going to come in a variety of forms," noted Paul S. Grogan, president of the Local Initiatives Support Coalition, an intermediary group that helps channel expertise and resources to nonprofit community development sponsors in impoverished areas. "But we don't have enough good programs to part with this one; that's the insanity of it," he said, describing the move against developers' housing tax credit as an act of "carnage."
Critics in Congress insist the credit program is a hangover from the era of overly generous Federal tax shelters open to large-scale corruption. They want to "sunset" the program with a tentative closing two years hence, a device community development professionals say might help the new Congress find budget savings on paper but would instantly freeze construction of all new low-income housing in the nation.
"The change will be dramatic and it will be stark," said Mr. Grogan, drawing a contrast with welfare cutbacks whose effects might prove less discernible than a sudden stop in low-income housing construction. "This program is the engine that has allowed a great deal of neighborhood stabilization to occur."
Up in Shaw, Mr. Dickerson is desperately inviting any and all lawmakers to come and see the Whitelaw before voting the sunset of the program. "No one is more opposed to the dependency system than the families in the Whitelaw," he said, expressing wonder at how sweeping and indiscriminate politicians can be in delivering on promises of change.
"They're isolated," he said of those politicians. "They're encapsulated."

HEADLINE: Driving, Buying, Reading and Remembering Route 66

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

DATELINE: CLINTON, Okla., Sept. 23

 BODY:
On most mornings, the talk at the "Liar's Table" -- a daily confluence of old-timers in overalls at Pop Hicks's Restaurant on Route 66 -- centers on who can tell the biggest whopper and get away with it, and whether the Red Tornadoes are going to win the high school football game the next Friday night.
But this week at Pop Hicks's, an institution since 1936, where the coffee was as muddy as a creek bottom and laughter ricocheted off the walls, the talk was about the opening today of the splashy pink neon and tail-finned Oklahoma Route 66 Museum, the first museum officially dedicated to the legendary stretch of road. Route 66 launched a mass migration of Dust Bowl families in the 1930's, a jazz classic in the 1940's, a popular television show in the 1960's and now a cult following. 
 The new pioneers are reading Route 66 (a glossy new quarterly magazine); watching Route 66 (travel videotapes); listening to Route 66 (audiotapes), and buying Route 66 (cookbooks, sofas, salt and pepper shakers, afghans, guidebooks and the $195 limited edition Route 66 Commemorative Watch that lets you "wear 2,000 miles of history on your wrist").
"The museum is good for Clinton but it'd be good anywhere they put it," said Joe Morgan, a retired engineer with the Oklahoma Department of Transportation who donated an old Phillips 66 sign to the museum. "A lot of broke people went over that road and became millionaires."
The museum, which is expected to draw 50,000 to 60,000 people a year to this town of 10,000 in Oklahoma's western plains country, is the most visible sign yet of the revitalized interest in what people here still refer to as "the old road."
The museum was built by the Oklahoma State Historical Society, a state agency, with $250,000 in contributions from the citizens of Clinton and an $850,000 Federal grant given for "highway enhancement." It continues the grand tradition of spunky Route 66 roadside attractions, like the Meramec Caverns in Missouri, whose signs still proclaim, "Greatest Show Under Earth!" The museum will also serve as the flagship in a string of nine satellite exhibits to be sprinkled in small towns along the route.
Melba Rook of Lamdergin, Tex., drove 200 miles to attend today's opening, where she was wearing her Route 66 shirt and belt buckle. "People are tired of fast food, fast times," she said, when asked why she had come to the museum. "The effort and feeling that people had gave a heart and soul to old 66. People are starting to realize that again."
Travel on the mythic highway of John Steinbeck, of Dorothea Lange's stark Dust Bowl photographs, and of the television buddies, Martin Milner and George Maharis, and at one time Glenn Corbett, has been steadily increasing, fueled most notably by Europeans, some on vintage Harley-Davidson motorcycles, in hot pursuit of the "real" America.
It is not possible to drive the route uninterrupted. But this year, 20,000 die-hards will travel most of the roughly 2,400-mile route, through eight states from Chicago to Santa Monica, according to Tom Snyder, founder of the Route 66 Association. His group, based in Oxnard, Calif., is one of 8 state, 2 national and 10 international groups devoted to preserving the highway.
These visitors represent an estimated $20 million in revenue for the gas stations, motor courts, eateries and other businesses along the route, Mr. Snyder said.
Oklahoma, which contains more miles of Route 66 than any other state (396 miles), is a natural home for the nation's first Route 66 museum. The highway, the "auto river of the American west," in the words of Arthur Krim, a Cambridge, Mass., historian and geographer of the road, was conceived in the young state in 1925 as an effort by local boosters to link the former Indian territory with Chicago and Los Angeles. Advanced by a Tulsa, Okla., highway commissioner, Cyrus S. Avery, to divert traffic from Kansas City, Mo., and Denver, it was later promoted through Phillips 66 gasoline, which appropriated the magic numbers and logo, and by the United States Highway Association, based in Clinton. Both touted Route 66 as the Main Street of America.
In Oklahoma, the road has become the state's biggest tourist attraction, said Tom Myers, the economic development director for the state tourism office. He estimates that the state's Route 66 tourists could spend more than $40 million next year -- if they can find it.
Jim Ross, who produces route maps and guidebooks, and who used to use a pickax to detect the old roadbed, said that about 80 percent of the original paved sections across the country are driveable, but some are abandoned fragments leading nowhere. Improvements and bypasses to the road began almost immediately after its completion in 1926, attempts to "straighten out its "hooks, elbows and hairpin turns," according to Mr. Ross. Navigating Route 66 can be baffling because the road contains many dead ends and sections that have been taken over by city roads or the interstates.
Although the vast majority of travelers still prefer "that linear slab of monotony," in the words of Michael Wallis, Route 66 booster and author of "Route 66: The Mother Road" (St. Martin's Press, 1990), Route 66 sojourners have made a fetish out of tracing authentic pieces of the highway. They have been guided in their quest by the dramatic resurgence of "Historic Route 66" signs, complete with the legendary shield, that began appearing in June in all eight states. The signs resulted from persistent lobbying by the statewide Route 66 Associations, which held car rallies, foot races, peanut brittle sales and box suppers to raise money to supplement the states' investments. The signs represent "democratized history," said Michael Jackson, chief architect for the state historic preservation office in Illinois, where approximately 600 signs went up this summer. "This is coming from the grass roots up," he said.
To some extent the new wanderers are having a peculiar impact on the road. In Holbrook, Ariz., Motor Trend magazine reported recently, a video crew was seen surrounding a nondescript roadside eatery, "acting like it was the Dorothy Chandler pavilion on Oscar night." The Mother Road is giving birth to a host of celebrity offspring, like 80-year-old Lucille Hamons in nearby Hydro, Okla. (population 977), whose tiny, 53-year-old roadside stop is featured in the German coffee-table book she keeps near her checkout counter, "Route 66: Strasse Der Sehnsucht." Nevermind that she does not know the German translation ("Route 66: Street of Longing").
The lust for Route 66 souvenirs has been such, according to an Oklahoma Department of Transportation planner, David Lopez, that "people have been stealing the new signs as fast as we can get them up." Some souvenir hunters are going to extremes. Jim Ready, a rancher who ropes his longhorns along Route 66 in Chandler, Okla., said that last year, two Dutch tourists confided they wanted "a true American sign." He let them take their newly purchased reproduction Route 66 signs out back, and then "let them borrow my guns so they could shoot holes in them," he said.
Rubbing shoulders with local residents like Mr. Ready remains part of Route 66's appeal. Driving the road from Tulsa to Clinton, passing through canopies of elms and watching a tarantula cross the road -- something, for better or worse, that would never happen on an interstate -- is to be reconnected to an intimate, smaller-scale America, where vintage 1940's motel cottages with American flags dot the path. The road itself is winsome and intimate, hugging the lilting, pitching contours of the land as if it has always been there.
But clickety-clicking through the landscape of Dorothea Lange's stark photographs is, still, to be aware of what had been: shells of long-abandoned gas stations, cafes and bus depots overrun with wildflowers.
The museum, whose exhibits are not yet finished, attempts to come to grips with this legacy, which has embraced "tragedy and prosperity on the same highway," in Mr. Krim's words, by telling the story of the road nationally through roadside objects unearthed from citizens' basements and attics. It includes a zany re-creation of a 1950's diner and the display of a 1928 International Harvester truck, the type depicted in "The Grapes of Wrath."
Poignantly, perhaps, the museum is being viewed as a means to infuse these towns with some of their lost prosperity. Many smaller communities are trying to rebound from being bypassed by the interstate and from from the oil bust, the decline of the family farm and rural flight. In the decade between 1980 and 1990, the smaller Route 66 towns in Oklahoma, such as Depew (population 502) lost an average of 8 percent of their populations, according to the Oklahoma Department of Commerce.
"Little towns are suffering, and see tourism as an economic base," said Dr. Bob Blackburn, deputy executive director of the Oklahoma Historical Society. "Travelers are looking for these places, the America they think is gone. It's still there, off the main highway."
In McLean, Tex. (population 850), the Route 66 Association, led by Delbert Trew, a retired rancher, recently preserved the state's earliest surviving Phillips 66 station. Four years ago, they opened their own private Texas Route 66 exhibit as part of the Devil's Rope Museum, which displays more than 1,000 varieties of historic barbed wire in an old brassiere factory. Last month, 1,091 people visited the museum, he said.
"The interstate bypass just devastated us," Mr. Trew said. "We wanted to do something to revive our little town. So we just gathered everything up." In true Route 66 style, "everything" includes a 15-foot-tall Cobra head from the Regal Reptile Farm, once a prime Route 66 attraction, now defunct.
Such gumption is typical of the road.
Members of the Oklahoma Route 66 Association gathered for their annual fall cruise in Clinton this morning, with members driving a canary yellow 1959 Metropolitan, a vermilion 1957 Chevrolet Bel-Air, a candy-apple red 1964 Impala and a souped-up 1941 Chevrolet with the Oklahoma license plate: MUVN ON.
Not everyone plans to drive the route. Margie McCauley, 67, of Landers, Calif., is walking the entire route, accompanied only by her dog, Lollipop. Since she left Barstow on May 6, her weight has been whittled to 98 pounds from 118 pounds. Though she seems like she could blow right off the highway, on Sunday she will leave Tulsa and strike out for Chicago. Her brave odyssey bears the gritty stamp of generations of nomads before her. "I want to keep going," she said. "I love seeing what's around the corner."

HEADLINE: Clinton Plans To Lift Public Out of 'Funk'

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23

 BODY:
President Clinton, who won office talking intensely about policy details, now says that in his first two years he failed to talk enough about "the big picture" of these tempestuous times. As he gears up for his re-election campaign, he says that anxious Americans may feel "like they're lost in the fun house" and that it is his job to "get people out of their funk about it."
Returning from a weeklong fund-raising and political trip around the nation late Friday, Mr. Clinton made it clear in a discursive 45-minute conversation with reporters aboard Air Force One that he was long since out of his own funk about last fall's Republican electoral victory. Now, he said, it is his responsibility to help lead people through the "tumult and upheaval" of the information-saturated 1990's. 
 "I'm also trying to get people out of their funk about it," said Mr. Clinton, relaxed in blue jeans and cowboy boots and squatting on a carry-on suitcase. "My own belief is that human beings -- particularly the American people -- are capable of enduring a lot of difficulty and a lot of tumult and upheaval if they understand it.
"What makes people insecure is when they feel like they're lost in the fun house," he said. "They're in a room where something can hit them from any direction at any time; they always feel that living life is like walking across a running river on slippery rocks and you can lose your footing at any time."
It was not a Southern President coming back from the mountaintop with a pronouncement of malaise, but when Mr. Clinton ambled back from his cabin on Air Force One, he was clearly consumed by big thoughts. Energized and barely winded by a swing that took him to nine cities in four states in five days, he confessed that even in a radio interview with Larry King in Los Angeles on Thursday, he had to fight his tendency to go into too much detail about policy questions.
"I loved doing it, but I found myself about three questions in and said, No, no, no, no, I'm doing too much of the, you know, details of the specific issue they're asking without trying to keep putting it into larger contexts," Mr. Clinton said in the Air Force One interview -- just minutes after finishing a lengthy detailed discussion of education policy.
In his months of contemplation and reading, the President has found a new friend: history. Sounding a theme he tried out repeatedly on last week's trip, he says he now believes the nation is going through its most profound period of social, economic and technological change in a century, since the dawn of the Progressive Era, that real wages are stagnant even as the economy grows, that Government still has an important role to play in directing investment in education and that it is the President's job to explain all that to a restless public skeptical of politicians and power.
"I think in the first two years I knew exactly what I wanted to do, and I was obsessed with doing it -- much of it requiring the Congress to go along," Mr. Clinton said, in apparent reference to his health care plan and ambitious legislative agenda. "And I would have been better served, I think, and the country probably would have been better served, if maybe we'd done, even if we'd done just slightly less, if people had understood some of the big picture more.
"And the President has to impart that big picture," he added. "If you go back and look at Lincoln's speeches, for example, he was always explaining the time people were living in and putting the big issues in terms of choices that had to be made, so that he basically never let the people off the hook."
Mr. Clinton said that hewing to traditional dichotomy between Republican and Democratic ideology in the current debate over reshaping Government missed the point.
"If we talk only in terms of programs and dollars, right, and they talk only in terms of the evils of Government," he said, "both sides are letting the people off the hook." He said he had tried to tell his own aides not to get caught up in partisan sniping, "and I'm also trying to tell the Democrats that they need to just relax and say what they believe."
Without mentioning the possible parallel, Mr. Clinton was careful to stress that he intended no Jimmy Carter-type indictment of "malaise" among the electorate, repeatedly saying he wanted to make the public see these times as "quite exciting," despite the challenges of economic and social dislocation.
The President, whom aides described as restless and blue for weeks, even months, after last fall's election, said he had worked his way out of his own funk by reading history.
"I don't mind adversity," he told the reporters traveling with him. "I have difficulty when -- I don't think I can do my job as President if -- I don't understand what's happening. And I really spent a lot of time trying to understand what was going on, and I really think what I said is true. I think that I and all of us had underestimated the dimensions of the changes and challenges facing us. So now I feel quite good about that."
Asked if he thought Lincoln could have survived daily television scrutiny, Mr. Clinton waxed reflective about the media circus whose talk shows, satellite links and town hall formats he has often exploited to his advantage.
"Well, I think in the information age," he said, there can be "too much exposure and too much information and too much sort of quasi-information. I mean, you guys have to compete with near-news, too. It's like, you know, when we were kids, we'd drink near-beer."
He added: "There's a danger that too much stuff cramming in on people's minds is just as bad for them as too little, in terms of the ability to understand, to comprehend."
Mr. Clinton said he had a harder task than the Republicans in explaining the role for an activist Government in an age when the public is skeptical of Washington, tired of taxes and anxious about its own future and economic well-being. He said that was why he had personally asked the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, to help forge a compromise plan for overhauling welfare, even though he had criticized some of the Senate bill's basic provisions.
He said he had told Mr. Dole in a White House meeting early in the process that "I would really go a long way to try to meet him in agreement, and I thought that welfare reform had become a symbol for the country and I didn't want it to become a symbol of division."
The President said: "The real interesting thing is whether the chemistry between the House, the Senate and the President can lead to a creative kind of tension that will move us forward. That's the argument I keep making to the Speaker, the personal plea I made to Bob Dole on welfare reform."
So has the President now found the words to explain all this?
"Yeah," he smiled. "But I can't do it in 30 seconds."

An Apology to the Welsh
 LOS ANGELES, Sept. 23 (AP) -- The White House has apologized to people of Welsh heritage for President Clinton's use of the expression "welsh on your debts" on Friday.
A White House spokeswoman, Ginny Terzano, said: "There was never any intention to use this as an ethnic slur, and we apologize to anyone who may be offended. The President simply used this word to point out that we must not fail deliberately to meet our obligations or debts."
Mr. Clinton was announcing a $364 million bailout for cash-strapped Los Angeles County when he said: "The United States is a good citizen. We don't welsh on our debts."
Rees Lloyd, a lawyer for the Glendale-based Twm Sion Cati-Welsh-American Legal Defense, Education and Development Fund, said the apology fell short of what was required.
"It's outrageous that the President of the United States would use this slur in a statement he knows would be reported and would be legitimized," the lawyer said. "This sure is a left-handed apology. 'I apologize for using it, but it's O.K. because this is what it means.' The President should be ashamed."

HEADLINE: At 2d Plant, Rumors Are Now Reality

BYLINE: New York Times Regional Newspapers 

DATELINE: LIBERTY, S.C., Sept. 23

 BODY:
For hundreds of workers at an AT&T computer manufacturing plant here, the end of the line came quickly.
On Wednesday, Robert E. Allen, the chairman of the AT&T Corporation, made the surprise announcement of the plan to break up the telecommunications giant. By Friday, workers here had begun cleaning out their work areas and getting their severance pay. 
 And by Christmas, the plant here, which provided full- or part-time work to 1,184 workers, will be closed, a result of AT&T's decision to get out of the personal computer business and refocus the rest of its computer operations. Friday was the last day for 600 employees; the others will leave gradually.
For weeks, there had been hints that the plant might be closed. But for many people it was a shock that their last day would come so soon. Many were relieved, however, that the uncertainty had been cleared up.
"We expected it; it was a relief to get the rumors out," said Darnell Corley, an employee for eight years.
The economy in this far western corner of South Carolina has been strong, thanks to a growing number of manufacturing jobs, the most prominent being the BMW auto assembly plant near Spartanburg. Many of the AT&T workers said they were confident that they would find new jobs quickly.
Mrs. Corley, an eight-year employee, said she had interviewed at a nearby company that is a supplier to the BMW plant.
Employees used Thursday and Friday to go over the details of severance packages with company officials. The packages included a lump sum of $5,000 and other pay based on the number of years with the company, employees said, plus health benefits for six months and help in finding other employment.
The economy of Liberty, which has a population of 3,200, is not expected to feel much of an immediate impact. Most employees commute from nearby towns like Pickens, Greenville and Clemson.
Unemployment rates in the area have been low. Pickens County had a jobless rate of 3.5 percent for August, among the lowest in the state.
The closing will also hurt businesses near the plant. Nikahil Patel, who bought a Phillips 66 service station across the street in 1992, said he expected to lose about 20 percent of his business. "I'll make some adjustments," he said.

HEADLINE: Awaiting Call, Helms Puts Foreign Policy on Hold

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23

 BODY:
After two months of pressure tactics intended to force the Clinton Administration to revamp its foreign policy bureaucracy, Senator Jesse Helms has dug in, vowing to continue to hold up all ambassadorial appointments until he is taken more seriously.
As part of his campaign, the North Carolina Republican has halted business meetings of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, frozen 400 State Department promotions and blocked more than a dozen treaties and other international agreements, including the second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention, so they cannot be voted on by the full Senate. 
 As a result, 30 ambassadorial nominees and one Assistant Secretary of State are awaiting confirmation, about 15 percent of American embassies around the world have been left without new ambassadors and the day-to-day foreign policy business on Capitol Hill has ground to a halt.
All this is being done to make an unrelated point: that the independent agencies that handle arms control, foreign aid and information be eradicated and swallowed up by the State Department, a move that Senator Helms asserts will save the taxpayer $3 billion over four years.
Senator Helms acknowledges with pride that he has seized hostages as the only way to get the Administration's attention.
"These people are playing hardball and dirty pool at the same time and I'm not going to cave in," he said in an interview. "But all the President has got to do is say, 'Senator, let's talk,' and we'll talk. It'll end on the day the President says we'll make a deal and we bust up that little fairyland."
From the Administration's point of view, the Senator should have been satisfied with a meeting he had with Mr. Clinton last month and he is undermining the President's ability to make and execute foreign policy.
"The situation is creating management and morale problems that interfere with the conduct of diplomacy," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said in an interview. "Our problems around the world are difficult enough as it is without the extra burden of not having our personnel in place."
The impasse has become even more serious, Mr. Christopher added, with the nomination on Friday of James Sasser, the former Democratic Senator from Tennessee, as Ambassador to China.
Making Presidential nominees suffer has long been a favorite pastime of Senator Helms, who, as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, controls their fate.
He held up Winston Lord's confirmation as Ambassador to China in 1985 until Ronald Reagan promised not to give aid to Chinese population control programs. In 1987, he delayed the confirmation of Melissa Wells as Ambassador to Mozambique because he wanted the Reagan Administration to throw its support behind the country's anti-Communist rebels.
But those were precision strikes of limited duration; this time, it's an open-ended scattershot offensive.
Never before has the Foreign Relations Committee been closed down, a move that prevents committee members from meeting to iron out legislative disagreements and to act on appointments, treaties, promotions lists and authorization bills.
In addition to the two arms control treaties, Senator Helms is also preventing the committee from taking action on international conventions on women and the environment and more than a dozen bilateral investment treaties.
"The Administration and Congress have shared goals of advancing arms control and nonproliferation, advancing our economic interests and helping Americans abroad," said Wendy Sherman, Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs. "Our nation's security interests are being held hostage."
Meanwhile, the ambassadors-to-be, their personal lives and their careers on hold, wander the corridors of the State Department casting about for something to do:
*The ambassador-to-be to Kazakhstan, for example, is pushing papers on the Bosnia task force;
*The ambassador-to-be to Sri Lanka -- whose nomination has been pending since April -- spends his mornings studying irregular Sinhalese verbs, even though he already speaks the language;
*The ambassador-to-be to the United Arab Emirates sold his house, had nowhere to go, and has paid several thousand dollars of his own money to store his furniture.
Because the nominees cannot assume they will be confirmed, they are banned by Congress from meeting with officials from the countries they hope to work in or with American businessmen who conduct business in those countries.
"There's a lot of talent just sitting around waiting to move," said Richard Moose, Under Secretary of State for Management. "The chief of mission is the President's personal representative and it is he or she who makes the embassy run efficiently. Our Government is not highly regarded if there's no ambassador there. No doubt about it."
Not true, said Senator Helms. "Nothing is going to pot because an ambassador's not there," he said. "I've seen them come and I've seen them go and the best thing about almost all of them is when they go."
It is impossible to measure the exact impact of the absence of an ambassador on diplomacy, particularly in an age of e-mail and good telephone lines, and at a time when more and more diplomacy is done from Washington.
But the State Department admits it might have known more about the palace coup as it was unfolding in Qatar last summer if an ambassador had been in place in Doha.
Mr. Moose and others say that it borders on the irresponsible not to have ambassadors in troubled countries like Lebanon, Moldova and Zaire, emerging markets like Indonesia and strategically important countries like Pakistan and Panama.
And foreign governments feel slighted when they have no ambassador to talk to.
During a recent trip to Washington, President Ernesto Perez Balladares of Panama appealed personally to Senator Helms to change his mind. "The President asked simply, 'When are we going to get an ambassador?' " said Panama's Ambassador to Washington, Ricardo Alberto Arias. "And Helms said, 'As soon as we get an agreement with the Administration.' "
Last month, the White House assumed it had the problem on the road to resolution when Mr. Clinton, in an unusual gesture to a member of Congress, invited Senator Helms for an hourlong meeting in the private quarters of the White House.
As Mr. Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and other senior aides listened, Senator Helms and his aides presented charts and graphs to sell their plan. But Mr. Gore had already rejected the idea of merging the three agencies as part of the Administration's campaign to reinvent government, and he raised objections (politely) along the way.
As a peacemaking gesture that day, Senator Helms unblocked a group of nominees and lifted the hold on seven tax treaties. "Further good faith from the Administration will be met with further good faith from the Committee," a statement from the Senator's office said.
Not coincidentally, some of the nominees whose appointments were cleared have important friends on Capitol Hill.
The White House and key Democratic lawmakers successfully weighed in to get Mark Gearan, the White House communications director, confirmed as head of the Peace Corps, for example.
The Senate Majority leader, Bob Dole, helped push through both Tom Korologos, the longtime Republican lobbyist, as a member of the Broadcasting Board of Governors, and Victor Jackovich as Ambassador to Slovenia.
Now with the Sasser nomination as ambassador to China pending and the White House eager to get relations with Beijing on track, the Administration has begun to realize that it must make the next move, although senior officials don't agree on a counterproposal.
Senator Helms is so determined to reorganize that on Thursday, with Senator Dole's backing, he tried to tack an amendment covering his plan onto the foreign aid bill, a move that could have derailed the bill and opened it up to a Presidential veto.
In an effort to break the logjam during debate on the bill, Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, tried to broker a deal that would have freed 15 nominees and provided a resumption of normal business on the Foreign Relations Committee in exchange for abolition of one of the three agencies in question and a $2 billion savings over the next two years.
But the Administration sent word that the deal was not good enough and it went nowhere.
"Quite frankly, we didn't think it was very much," a senior Administration official said. "And there was concern about the treaties."
Although Senator Helms withdrew his reorganization amendment so that the foriegn aid bill could pass, he has vowed to try again. And he remains convinced from his meeting at the White House that the President liked his ideas and would be in touch.
"The thing I remember the President saying more than once was, 'Who can be against this?,' " he said, describing the President's response to his plan. "'He said, 'Jesse, I'll get back to you." Well, he hasn't gotten back to me."

HEADLINE: In Ohio, the Breakup of AT&T Spells 1,300 Lost Jobs

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: DAYTON, Ohio, Sept. 22

 BODY:
Roxetta Stepp has had more cheerful meals than her lunch Thursday at Flanagan's Pub with co-workers from one of the offices of AT&T Global Information Systems, which is across the street from the pub.
AT&T said Wednesday that it would sharply scale back the computer subsidiary, which is based here. As part of that overhaul, many workers had already been laid off and Mrs. Stepp knew that in a few hours her supervisor would dismiss her, too. 
 Still, she was taking the gloomy day in stride. Nearly two months ago, she was warned that her department was likely to be closed as part of corporate cost-cutting. That warning had allowed her and her husband, David, who also works at the company, to hold off on plans to build a new home and avoid what could have been a nightmare.
She also took comfort in knowing that her husband was not among the 1,300 losing their jobs here. Prior to the dismissals, 4,600 people worked at the Dayton plant.
"For now, our rented condo looks pretty good," Mrs. Stepp said.
But the Stepps and their co-workers and Dayton's civic leaders were surprised that the overhaul, which also eliminated 7,200 computer division jobs elsewhere, was accompanied by a plan to spin the computer company off as a separate business by 1997 as part of a plan to abandon the personal computer market.
That decision reopened some old psychological wounds: Long before there was AT&T Global Information Systems, there was the National Cash Register Company, NCR, or simply "The Cash." It was the pride of Dayton. By 1991 it was the nation's fifth-largest computer manufacturer and AT&T was in a hard-fought battle to buy it as part of its vision to build global computer networks.
When NCR employed more than 20,000 people here in the 1970's, it was Dayton's best-known member of the Fortune 500 and the question was more often what it could do for the community than vice versa.
The answer had traditionally been "almost anything." Parks, schools, country clubs and cultural institutions all grew from NCR's largesse. When the city was flooded in 1913, the company quickly built boats to help with relief efforts. Most of all, NCR's cash registers and early entry into the computer business reinforced the image created by inventors like the Wright Brothers and Charles Kettering of Dayton as a hotbed of innovation and entrepreneurship.
NCR had already struggled through hard times and moved much of its business out of the area when AT&T acquired it in a bitter takeover fight. Employment here had plummeted after a labor dispute in the early 1970's as the company phased out mechanical cash register manufacturing. Still, the company had managed to gain new hope and a profitable foothold in the computer business by 1991.
It hurt area residents to watch it erode as AT&T fumbled attempts to build on it. AT&T bruised local feelings when it dropped the NCR name last year, and this week's news created still more nostalgia.
"What used to be NCR is back," The Dayton Daily News said in an editorial Thursday. "The company renamed AT&T GIS returns to its independence as a downsized set of damaged goods."
Just how damaged could be an important question for the economy in this southwestern corner of Ohio. The region, with an employment base of 460,000, should easily absorb many of the 1,300 employees AT&T is laying off here. The unemployment rate is a relatively low 4.8 percent because the biggest employers, General Motors and the Wright Patterson Air Force Base, are both holding their own and many smaller technology companies supporting the auto and aerospace sectors are thriving.
But employment rates have not been growing as fast as in the rest of the nation. For those without high-tech skills, there are few jobs with wages and benefits anywhere close to those being lost. And companies that employ as many highly paid workers as AT&T is shedding are hard to attract.
Still more depressing, some economists fear that even if AT&T's stand-alone computer business keeps its headquarters here, Dayton is more likely to suffer further job losses than witness its rejuvenation. "What's here has become corporate overhead," said John Weiler, an economist at the University of Dayton. "Even those who didn't get fired are keeping their resumes current."
At Flanagan's Pub, widely acknowledged as the best spot for sounding out AT&T employees, such skepticism is on hold for now. "Some people who came in this morning were pumped up," said Pat Flanagan, the pub's proprietor. "They're calling the new company NCR Jr. and they feel like they might control their own destiny again."

HEADLINE: A Rising Star Shines Brighter on His Book Tour

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE, Sept. 23

 BODY:
Nick Pappas, a veterinarian from Chesterton, Ind., does not agree with Gen. Colin L. Powell on every issue. In fact, he does not know where the general stands on most issues, but he does not care. He admires General Powell for qualities that transcend something as mutable as Government policy and respects the general all the more for ignoring what voters like himself may think.
"We want a leader in the White House," he said. "We don't want a pollster. And I really don't think we've had a leader since Harry Truman." 
 Dr. Pappas, who canceled his office hours, drove an hour and a quarter into Chicago and then waited in line for two hours to get the general's signature, may be a devoted Powell fan, but he is not an unusual one. A week into the general's 23-city publicity tour, he has had book signings in Washington, Boston, Chicago and Milwaukee, and everywhere the story has been much the same.
Hundreds, and in some cases, thousands, of people have showed up. They have waited for hours -- in a parking garage, out in the rain, on the street in a Midwestern cold snap. They are black and white, old and young, affluent and unemployed. They believe they might be meeting the next President of the United States.
"This is history," said Jennifer Schweitzer, a postal clerk from Milwaukee who got in line in front of the Harry W. Schwartz Bookstore at 6:45 A.M. for a book-signing that started at noon. "It's history, and I want to be a part of it."
Although the general continues to search his soul, as he puts it, trying to decide whether to run, his book tour has the air of a political campaign -- not the flesh-pressing campaign of a hungry primary candidate, but rather the roped-off, walkie-talkie-directed campaign of a sitting President.
Spontaneity is minimal on General Powell's book tour. Outside of the autograph seekers who have paid the $25.95 for his autobiography, he has almost no contact with potential voters. He makes one carefully controlled public appearance a day and travels surrounded by his own security detail.
Before each book-signing, the general gives a brief news conference, with reporters and cameras sandwiched between racks of calendars and cookbooks. In response to the increasingly querulous questions about his intentions, the general gives the same measured, low-decibel answers:
He does not have a passion for running for office. He needs to make sure that running would be the best way to serve.
After his stop in Boston, a reporter for The Boston Globe suggested that the general just hold up flash cards: "Maybe." "I hope so." "I'll find a way to contribute."
Despite his studied attempts to avoid commitment, the general occasionally does reveal something about the political philosophy he says he is developing. He told The Boston Herald he did not believe that Social Security should be automatically exempted from budget cuts. He told reporters in Chicago that he opposed cutting off welfare benefits to unwed mothers who had more children and favored the Senate's version of welfare legislation. He is "intrigued" by school vouchers, he said in Milwaukee, a city experimenting with vouchers, but he added that he had some reservations about the "hard core" that could be left in the public schools.
General Powell has often said that if he enters the Presidential race it will be to win, and anyone who doubts his seriousness should see his competitive streak at work in signing books. At every store he has visited, he has broken some sort of felt-tipped record, a fact that his aides relate as if tracking an Olympic event.
At Lauriat's Bookstore in Boston's Copley Place Mall, the general signed 1,833 copies of his autobiography, "My American Journey," easily beating the store's previous record-holder, the radio host Don Imus, who had signed 1,050. At the Harry W. Schwartz Bookstore here in Milwaukee, he signed 1,902 copies, thoroughly demolishing the record held by former President Jimmy Carter, who had 762.
Nationally, "My American Journey" now tops several best-seller lists and is the fastest-selling book in the history of its publisher, Random House.
General Powell frequently portrays his book tour as a way to learn what Americans are thinking. In a brief interview inside Chicago's Afrocentric Bookstore, where he signed 200 books for sale later, General Powell insisted that was the case, even though his average contact with a potential voter lasts about four seconds.
"People can communicate in rather short, terse phrases," he said.
The general said the people he had met were "very, very friendly, very, very warm, and full of advice for me of all kinds."
The autograph seekers are familiar with the positions General Powell has enunciated so far -- in favor of abortion rights, the death penalty, affirmative action and some forms of gun control, and against organized school prayer and homosexuals serving openly in the military -- views the general calls the "sensible center" of American politics.
"He's not too far to the right and not too far to the left," said Juanita Williams, an independent businesswoman from Chicago who was waiting for the general in a chilly rain. "But he does believe in making a person get off their buns and do what you have to do."
Others said that while they did not agree with all the general's views, they would vote for him because of his "character," "integrity" and "leadership."
Andrea Kodys, a college student from Worcester, Mass., said she disagreed with the general on capital punishment and on gay servicemen but still believed "he's the kind of leader we need."
To be sure, not everyone came hoping to meet the next President. Many came out of curiosity, or just to collect an autograph. Some came to protest his stand on abortion. And a few came to tell him not to enter the race.
"I hope he doesn't get involved in politics," said a man in Milwaukee, who refused to give his name. "He has too many high virtues."
At every stop, there were members of the Draft Powell for President Committee, asking those in line to fill out cards urging the general to run as a (check one) Republican, Democrat or Independent.
Prem Popat, who was handing out the cards in Boston, described herself as a "conservative, pro-life woman." Despite the general's abortion rights views, she said, "I think he's a man who exudes leadership, and I think that's something the country is yearning for."
General Powell acknowledged that the tremendous outpouring of support on his book tour would make it that much tougher for him to decide not to run.
"I think you have to be brain-dead," he said, "not to take away a level of pressure from this, and a level of expectation."

HEADLINE: Lure of Cuba Draws Some Aging Exiles

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: HOLGUIN, Cuba

 BODY:
The narrow street lined with guava and mango trees and cactus-plant fences was deserted as the taxi came to a halt and Gilberto Zaldivar got out.
To his right was the house where his sister was born and where he grew up until he was a teen-ager. Across from it, the family bodega was gone and a house had taken its place next to the shed where his father used to store beans and other grains. 
 As he looked around, word of his arrival spread quickly, and suddenly Mr. Zaldivar was surrounded by incredulous neighbors who greeted him with shouts of "Betico!" (his childhood nickname) and hugged him and gleefully noted that he was fat. For the next hour he and his car were mobbed as he drove through the village of Deleyte, here in eastern Cuba, popping in and out of houses.
It was a scene reminiscent of a political campaign tour in some small American town, but this was Cuba, and Mr. Zaldivar, a Cuban exile visiting for the first time in 34 years.
"Oh, my God! The spitting image of Marina," said a neighbor, Maria de los Angeles Leon, 58, referring to his dead mother. "Do you remember me?"
Mr. Zaldivar, 61, had not forgotten, even when it seemed as if he had written off Cuba to pursue a new life in New York. Like thousands of Cubans of his generation and older who left after Fidel Castro's revolution took an openly Marxist-Leninist turn, he became an American citizen and over the years lost hope of ever returning.
But it is within those same generations, the ones who feel most cheated by Mr. Castro and who have fueled the politics of hostility toward the Cuban Government, that age and anxiety about seeing Cuba and family again have worn down the resistance of many to visit.
There is also a growing desire among many exiles for alternatives to help bring democracy to Cuba and normalize relations. In the meantime, the return of those who have gone back after decades, like Mr. Zaldivar's, is marked by jarring emotion, an absence of recrimination and the sad clash between memories and the reality that is Cuba today.
Mr. Zaldivar, executive producer of the Repertorio Espanol theatrical company in New York, is not involved in exile politics. But the gradual extinction of his family in Cuba and impatience with persistent cold war-like relations between Cuba and the United States prompted his attempt to reclaim his country decades after he gave it up.
He said he mostly came to see his two remaining uncles and one aunt, whom he called his "principal nexus" to Cuba. In a painful coincidence, both uncles died four days before he arrived.
"If the Mexicans and the Spaniards come, why can't I?" Mr. Zaldivar said. "I didn't come for the beaches but to see my family."
Already, thousands of Cuban-Americans have come to Cuba from the United States to bring food and medicine and other essentials to their families, despite tighter travel restrictions last year and the American trade embargo. There has been increasing contact between Cubans on both sides through the cultural and academic exchanges allowed by both countries.
Cuban officials say 48,000 exiles visited the island in 1994, most of them to see relatives. They say some have sought to return to live as well, but a housing shortage and the inability to collect retirement pensions from Cuba are obstacles.
During his 12-day visit to Havana and Holguin this month, Mr. Zaldivar, who left Cuba in 1961, when he was 27, smiled at the sight of the capital's colonial architecture and long seawall. When he spotted the majestic steps of the University of Havana, which he attended for two years, he erupted into clapping.
But he was shocked by the atmosphere of abandonment, even though he had expected it because of the country's economic problems.
In Havana, he found streets darkened by power outages, stalled vintage-model cars at intersections and enormous crowds at bus stops, former luxury hotels thriving with stained carpets, peeling paint and lobbies filled with prostitutes, who he said seemed more widespread and noticeable than in the old days.
Everything was both familiar and new. The Arlequin, the theater Mr. Zaldivar helped administer as a hobby after work as sales manager in Havana for the nationalized B. F. Goodrich Company, now houses Health Ministry offices on a wide street choked with cars, bicycles and pedestrians. His family's last house in Havana has been subdivided into three homes, the fate of many dwellings in the capital.
That house, in Vedado, in what used to be a middle-class district, was next to the Venezuelan Embassy, now a shelter for families who come for treatment in the capital's hospitals. It was there, next door, that Manuel Urrutia, the first President after the revolutionary triumph, sought asylum after Mr. Castro accused him of treason.
It was one of the events that persuaded Mr. Zaldivar that the new Government could not be trusted to follow a democratic path and spurred his decision to leave. His sister had left six months earlier, when militia duty was forced on her.
On May 11, 1961, he told co-workers, "I'm going downtown" and headed for the airport instead. He said goodbye only to his parents, who followed two years later.
Mr. Zaldivar returned to Cuba after hardly any contact between his immediate family in the United States and those left behind, including his mother's 10 siblings. His first overture was last November, when AT&T resumed service to Cuba and he called a cousin on a whim.
Ties had been severed after his father bequeathed his modest sugar farm and other property to a brother, a fervent supporter of the revolution, who turned them over to the Government in an action approved by other family members. The break was so complete that no one from Cuba called or wrote after his parents died in Miami -- his mother in 1983, his father four years ago.
In Holguin, he now found many relatives poorer than he left them, complaining that they needed soap or toilet paper and having no qualms about begging him for money. Some said they ate only one meal a day. Mothers said their children lacked milk and school supplies. Most were in desperate need of dollars, which Cubans increasingly need to buy basic necessities.
Four relatives asked him to sponsor them to gain entry into the United States, including a cousin, who said he could not support his wife and two children as an electrician, and the 46-year-old daughter of his only remaining aunt.
"The only one who can help us is you," the aunt told him as she watched him eat a lunch of lamb, congri rice and yucca her daughter cooked in his honor. "Remember, I washed your diapers."
In the midst of need, there was the sheer joy of reuniting and no mention of political feuds. Mr. Zaldivar, who is single and has only one sister, who lives in Miami, suddenly could not keep track of his family. At one house, 28 relatives gathered around him for a family portrait.
"He died desperate to see you again," Nilvia Zaldivar, 51, a daughter of one of the two uncles who died, sobbed as she embraced him.
While older relatives interrogated him about the whereabouts of other family members in the United States, younger ones were full of their own questions:
"Is it true crime is rampant in 'the North?' "
"Can you change jobs?"
"How do you look for work?"
"Why did you leave?"
Mr. Zaldivar, overwhelmed, grinned and said little. But in a rare flash of anger, he asked a cousin who was a Communist Party militant, the one who was taking him around past sugar cane fields and billboards filled with revolutionary fervor: "How could this happen? Why can these families live in these conditions?"
There was no answer. Mr. Zaldivar, who had been surprised by the light police presence on the streets, still found widespread reluctance to discuss politics or criticize the Government and a tendency to be cautious with words.
Prodded by questions, most Cubans blame the American embargo. Those who stayed said they understood why relatives like the Zaldivars left. Some said they had toyed with the idea themselves but did not want to leave the country or to part with loved ones.
In Havana, Miguel Benavides, 55, an actor and acquaintance, said he was "happy because of his success but sad because he is not here." He said he had no doubt Cuba's fate would have turned out differently had people like Mr. Zaldivar stayed.
"Many valuable people left," he said, noting he himself stayed because he was more interested in collective benefits than personal ones. "They have a lot of blame to share."
Thirty-four years later, Mr. Zaldivar left again, with a new sense of commitment to Cuba. He wants to be the first to bring American theater to the island "when the doors open."
He vowed to bring his sister on his next visit. A realtor in Miami, she remains bitter and angrily refused to accompany him on this trip. Mr. Zaldivar said his parents, too, would have never approved of this return with Mr. Castro still in power.
But Mr. Zaldivar said he has become the hope of family members who feel hopeless.
"It's not just the poverty but an attitude that the solution won't come for them," he said. "They see a total lack of opportunities. They never imagined it would come to this."
It heartened him that one of them asked him to help finance a "paladar," as Cuba's private, home restaurants are known.
"Without having known capitalism, he understands it and wishes it," he said, promising to help when legally allowed.
From the airport, he called two cousins, one in Holguin, the other in Havana, to bid his last goodbyes.
"I'll see you soon," he said, carrying in his bags half-century-old photo albums from relatives and two prescriptions for bifocals from Deleyte neighbors.

HEADLINE: Notes on Affirmative Action

 BODY:
One week into the rolling soldier's 1995 tour, it is possible to make a hopeful if tentative judgment about its impact on the national mood. Colin Powell, for the moment at least, is having a calming effect on the national discussion of "hot button" issues. We admit to pleasant surprise that General Powell's qualified endorsements of affirmative action, gun control and abortion rights for women and his sensible opposition to mandatory school prayer prompted little opposition, even from the fundamentalist fund-raisers and professional zealots who make their livings on those issues.
At any rate, Mr. Powell is to be thanked for the vapor trail of sanity that seems to be following him, especially on the issue of affirmative action. President Clinton, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and a few others have stood bravely against those who want to use anecdotes of white disadvantage to justify a Federal chokehold on minority opportunities in politics, education and jobs. But our sense is that Mr. Powell's personal example and his qualified defense of affirmative action have done more than Mr. Clinton's commendable speech to refresh national thinking. The country needed Mr. Powell's reminder that the creation of special opportunity for the victims of historic discrimination is both economically sound and morally worthy. 
 Still, Mr. Powell could have done an even greater service by being more forthcoming. Affirmative action has only one entry in the index of "My American Journey." He defines his wish for continuing efforts to level the playing field without resort to mathematical quotas, but misses the opportunity to explore fully his experience in an Army where he saw black soldiers encounter disciplinary problems because they were conditioned by "less opportunity, less education, less money, fewer jobs for blacks" on the outside. Mr. Powell is gracious in acknowledging his debts to the civil rights movement and pioneering black officers, but he is also too willing to accept the bootstrap platitudes that his political mentors, Ronald Reagan and George Bush, substituted for social policy.
So it is useful to read the Powell book alongside Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s interview with the author in the Sept. 25 issue of The New Yorker. In the book, we learn of Mr. Powell's zeal for "entrepreneurial capitalism" and his unfocused belief that the Democrats are hostile to it. But Mr. Gates adds the valuable information that Mr. Powell is "now a wealthy person" whose holdings once included a share of a Buffalo television station. It was purchased in concert with a wealthy cousin, Bruce Llewellyn, under a tax-break program passed by a Democratic Administration and Congress to promote minority ownership of radio and television.
Mr. Powell records his elation at making general at 42, but Mr. Gates and others provide the detail that Clifford Alexander, the Secretary of the Army under President Carter, forced the Pentagon to integrate the promotion lists that produced Mr. Powell's opportunity. Mr. Alexander told Mr. Gates that there were "a number of black generals" of equal talent who never got General Powell's political breaks.
Now that he has defended affirmative action, Mr. Powell can advance it by discussing more fully the combination of personal ability and mold-breaking opportunity that brought him to this moment. His rise rests fundamentally on individual merit, but it also reflects a mix of Democratic door-opening and Republican sponsorship. Mr. Powell's American journey points up powerfully why this society needs more efforts like those that positioned him to compete fairly in the military, invest in the television business and reach, if he chooses, for the Presidency.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
In Defense of Peace

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The Jewish New Year begins tonight, but my friend Abraham Foxman won't be in his regular seat at his Orthodox synagogue in Bergen County, N.J., where he was a member for 20 years. Mr. Foxman, director of the Anti-Defamation League, quit his synagogue after his rabbi wrote articles accusing Israel's Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, of leading the Jewish people on a Holocaust-like death march, because of his willingness to trade land for peace with the Palestinians. Says Mr. Foxman, himself a Holocaust survivor: "I could not tolerate belonging to a synagogue where the rabbi treats anyone who supports the peace process as a sinner."
Unfortunately, Mr. Foxman's experience is not unique. Some of the Orthodox Jewish press these days reads like Al Ahram in the 1950's, with weekly diatribes against Israel's leaders. What is encouraging is that a mainstream Jewish leader like Mr. Foxman has stepped forward to challenge this view. Polls show that two-thirds of American Jews support Mr. Rabin, but you would never know it listening to the tepid support he gets from some weak-kneed mainstream groups, like the Conference of Presidents. 
 The right-wing Jewish critique of Mr. Rabin goes like this: "He's giving up everything and getting nothing."
Oh really? Thanks to the Rabin peace process, for the second year in a row young Israelis won't be spending their Rosh ha-Shanah holiday patrolling the Gaza Strip, dodging rocks and bullets. For Israel, this peace process isn't just about who controls which hill. It's about what sort of state Israel should be. And the state Mr. Rabin wants Israel to be -- if the security arrangements can be negotiated -- is a state that is not endlessly occupying two million Palestinians, with the moral rot that produces.
The opponents of the peace process want to turn the Jewish people from advocates of a universal morality into just another tribe grubbing for its maximum interests, whatever the consequences. It may be that the Arabs are so inalterably hostile to Israel that Israel will have no choice but to adopt such a stance. But for the sake of those who elected him, and for the sake of future generations, Mr. Rabin is trying to test whether there is an Arab partner for a peace that allows Israel to remain true to its Jewish and democratic values -- and be secure.
Thanks to the peace process with the Palestinians, Israel now has diplomatic or economic relations with half the Arab world, as well as with countries that shunned Israel in the past, like India, China and Vietnam. These have become huge markets for Israeli businesses and explain why Israel is now one of the world's fastest-growing economies. Some 80,000 Israelis visited Jordan this year. There would have been no peace treaty with King Hussein without the IsraeliPalestinian talks' paving the way.
Yeah, that Rabin, what a sucker! He's giving up Israeli responsibility for patrolling the seven biggest Arab towns in the West Bank, and he's giving up Israel's responsibility to run the lives of every Palestinian there. And he's doing it without having to move a single Jewish settler, and he's doing it while maintaining Israel's military control along the Jordan River and the high ground in the West Bank, and he's doing it while setting up a test for Yasir Arafat to see if he can maintain this peace, because if he can't it will go no further.
Will all violence end tomorrow? Of course not. It was a 100-year war; it is not going to be a five-year peace. But it is sheer fantasy to think that halting the peace process will end terrorism. The only way to diminish Palestinian terrorism is to build incentives and controls into a peace agreement. Palestinians do not care a fig about what is good or bad for the Jews, but they do care about what is good or bad for themselves. This peace process, for the first time, has created a Palestinian majority which recognizes that to do good for itself, it must do good for Israel's security as well.
Mr. Rabin's critics treat him as if he were some misguided American liberal. Hardly. His peace process is built on three hard-nosed calculations -- that maintaining the status quo is a strategy of despair, that because Israel cannot trust Palestinian intentions any peace agreement must control Palestinian military capabilities,and that if it all works, one day the Jews of Israel may have less of the land but more of a home.

Speaker Newt Gingrich appeared to back off slightly late Friday from his threat to have the United States default on its obligations unless President Clinton accepted the Republican plan for budget cutting.
In an interview with Bloomberg Business News, Mr. Gingrich, Republican of Georgia, suggested that he might be willing to raise the debt limit temporarily -- a period he defined as "a couple of days or a week" -- so that the Government could continue to make payments on Social Security, veterans benefits and interest due on bonds. 
 But Mr. Gingrich's approach would effectively mean that the Administration would have to get new Congressional approval on a daily or weekly basis to keep operating. This would give Mr. Gingrich continued leverage over the White House in his effort to force a budget deal on terms dictated by the Republican-controlled Congress.
Ordinarily, Congress approves a new debt ceiling annually, giving the executive branch the freedom to decide when to issue Government bonds. Last year the Government issued roughly $2 trillion of new bonds, although much of that was simply rolling over the Government's $4.9 trillion of outstanding debt.
Mr. Gingrich seemed to be trying to calm the bond markets, which are nervous that a confrontation between Congress and the White House could interrupt Government payments. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin has warned repeatedly in recent weeks that a default would be "unthinkable," and that even the specter of default could raise interest rates and thus increase the cost of operating the Government.

IN AND OUT OF VOGUE
By Grace Mirabella with Judith Warner.
Illustrated. 257 pp. New York:
Doubleday. $25. 
 WHEN Grace Mirabella suddenly replaced Diana Vreeland as editor in chief of Vogue in 1971, the fashion industry was taken by surprise. Vogue was the leading fashion magazine of the growing group of Conde Nast publications. Ms. Mirabella seemed an odd choice for the job. For Vreeland, fashion was about youth, flamboyance and fantasy. Ms. Mirabella, her assistant for nine years, was the opposite: a down-to-earth hard worker with a business and retailing background. She edited the magazine for 17 successful years, the circulation tripled, and then, in a striking replay of events, she was abruptly fired and replaced by Anna Wintour, a glamorous and much younger woman.
Traditionally, most of the editors of Vogue had been from New York society; Grace Mirabella's parents were Italian immigrants who lived in New Jersey (her father was a salesman). She was born, she says in "In and Out of Vogue," in Philip Roth's Newark, "a city of strivers pushing forward from immigrant enclaves." New Jersey, she says, "is more than a place; it's an adjective" -- as illustrated by a recent New Yorker cartoon showing an unfashionable, overweight matron walking on the street wearing a T-shirt marked "DKNJ." The caption: "Donna Karan's nightmare."
It is hard to imagine Grace Mirabella, a champion of the very sort of chic but wearable clothes that Donna Karan has sold with such success, working for someone like Diana Vreeland. But in the 1960's, the era of the "Beautiful People," she did. Vreeland, who had great style and an extraordinary eye, was given to statements like "Pink is the navy blue of India" and "The bikini is the most important thing since the atom bomb." A typical Vreeland memo, this one about a runway model, reads: "Her outline is splendid. Her proportion unique with the small round head, long throat and legs but she can look as if she was walking toward a strange destiny which I am sure most Swedes are."
When Ms. Mirabella took over at Vogue, a major revolution in women's fashion was under way. As millions of young American women poured into the workplace and into professional careers, the go-go boots, love beads and miniskirts of the 60's were giving way to more practical, wearable clothes. But by the mid-80's, fashion had, predictably, changed again. In the Reagan era there was lots of new money, the cult of celebrity flourished and runway fashion shows became wild spectacles with even wilder clothes.
Even though Ms. Mirabella subsequently started her own magazine, with the backing of Rupert Murdoch (it is now a bimonthly published by Hachette), the blow of her dismissal from Vogue was severe. Ms. Mirabella has a number of scores to settle, and settle she does. She fires volleys at Anna Wintour, describing her as "cold," "suspicious," "autocratic" -- "a vision of skinniness in black sunglasses and Chanel suits" who was "playing the movie version of a fashion editor a la 'Lady in the Dark.' " She also has harsh words for Si Newhouse, the publisher, with his "dull gaze" and "glumly decorated office," and Alexander Liberman, the editorial director of the Conde Nast empire, behind whose "honey-soaked delivery was an iron will, a tin ear for dissension and an ego the size of the Newhouse fortune."
The photographer Richard Avedon is, she says, a "royal pain" who "achieved some of his best effects with girls who were utterly strung out on dope." And in the 60's, Andy Warhol and Viva and the whole crew smelled "like unwashed underwear and pot" as they milled around the Vogue offices with their cameras. She describes the American designer Halston's clammy hands and unfocused gaze when he was high on drugs and says that Yves Saint Laurent was "a rather lost-looking man with a bottle and a glass in his hand, looking like someone who couldn't remember anymore how or where he'd started."
This is strong stuff from the former editor of the publication whose senior staff members once wore hats at their desks and lunched every day at the Colony Club. Vogue was from its start an upper-middle-class magazine, run by society women who wore clothes from Paris and dispensed advice for the well-dressed woman on fashion, society and etiquette. (A member of the staff once tried without success to throw herself under a subway train, and Edna Woolman Chase, the first editor in chief, is reported to have told her when she came back to work: "My dear, we at Vogue don't throw ourselves under subway trains. If we must, we take sleeping pills.")
In the 50's Mary McCarthy had described Vogue as a forbidding monitor enforcing the discipline of Paris. Its sole concession to its provincial subscribers was a pattern department. McCarthy said: "Furs, jewels, sumptuous materials, fine leathers, line, cut, atelier workmanship, were the very fabric of fashion; taste, indeed, was insisted on, but taste without money had a starved and middle-class pathos. The tastefully dressed little woman could not be a woman of style."
Grace Mirabella set out to address this tastefully dressed little woman, who was now someone leading a complex, busy life, more often than not with a full-time job and a family to take care of. She had a no-nonsense approach to fashion: "What I've always cared about, passionately, is style. Style is how a woman carries herself and approaches the world. It's about how she wears her clothes and it's more: an attitude about living. Dressing up in the most expensive thing around has nothing to do with style. Style transcends money, fashion trends, 'prettiness.' "
During the late 80's, Ms. Mirabella had increasing run-ins with Alexander Liberman. "I thought of his favorite line about the women's movement: 'Clearly the women of the future will be bald,' how he dismissed story ideas: 'No, you don't want to do a story on the pro-choice movement. Nobody cares . . .' and how he reacted when we wanted to do a story on the changing roles of women: 'You don't need to do another story about working women. Women are cheap labor and always will be.' "
SHE says her attempts to show clothes that were liberating and to cover relevant issues of the day did not go far in the era that culminated in the bouffant excesses of Christian Lacroix and the appearance in Vogue of sadomasochistic photographs by Helmut Newton. The 80's, she recalls, "was an emperor-has-no-clothes era, start to finish. Clothes were about labels, designers were about being celebrities, and it was all, on a bigger and bigger scale, about money. Until eventually, as the 80's turned into the 90's, fashion came to be about nothing more than itself. It degenerated, like post-modern art, like post-modern architecture, into a self-referential game full of jokes and pastiches that amused the fashion community enormously and did nothing at all for the woman shopping and trying to find something to wear. At the very same time that women were really emerging as a potent economic and political force in America, there were no clothes for them at all."
Ms. Mirabella says Ralph Lauren once told her that he could always count on her to talk straight. "In and Out of Vogue" -- written with Judith Warner, who has also written biographies of Hillary Clinton and Newt Gingrich -- does not have the breathiness of fashion-magazine prose but rather the simple, blunt delivery that Ms. Mirabella prides herself on.
Her story conveys all the immediacy of the front line, and apart from the gossip it is an interesting chronicle of the vicissitudes of American fashion and the successful appearance of clean-cut, wearable clothes from designers she championed -- among them Geoffrey Beene, Ungaro, Halston, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Giorgio Armani. It leaves you feeling sympathetic toward Grace Mirabella while turning the pages to see who is attacked next. Her book is fascinating, humorous, wry and ultimately rather sad. It offers insight into both the fashion and magazine-publishing businesses, which in the past decade have converged in ways that no one would have predicted when Ms. Mirabella became editor of Vogue.

HEADLINE: FAULT LINES: The Big One: Washington's Political Earthquake;
The Social Engineers Let Welfare Go Unfixed

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
EIGHTY-SEVEN of the Congress's 100 Senators voted last week to abandon 30 years of Federal welfare policy for an untested and drastically different alternative, a stampede that would be historic enough were it all that happened. It wasn't. Three of every four Democrats, 33 in all, joined in scrapping a system their party had invented, nurtured, expanded -- and declined to reform as recently as last year. That opportunity lost, they have now acceded to what had been unthinkable: the end of the very entitlement that guarantees Federal aid to the poor.
So begins the final journey of the Great Society, with Lyndon Johnson's political progeny clambering aboard a bandwagon they could have steered but chose not to. It is unlikely to be a one-time event.
Republicans will reap the credit or blame 
 for dismantling the Federal social bureaucracy that began with the New Deal. But Democrats, by failing to keep vigil over programs that did not change with the times, let its foundation crack. The new Congress is merely the demolition crew.
In the last week alone, House committees voted to end the Federal entitlement for Medicaid, the Johnson-era health program for the poor, and reduce the earned income tax credit, a Carter Administration anti-poverty venture. Congress is disassembling the Legal Services Corporation, cutting Head Start, reducing funds for public broadcasting and the arts and paring or abolishing other Democratic legacies. In most cases, charges of waste and mismanagement are the pile-drivers sinking the pillars of Republican ideology.
Those charges have been especially damaging for welfare programs whose beneficiaries are not so politically powerful and, to listen to the Republicans in their shrillest moments, not so deserving. But some more popular programs were hardly exempt. Republicans began a major overhaul last week of Medicare, warning that it, too, is riddled with waste and careening toward bankruptcy.
They may be right. Some of these programs are no doubt rotten ideas, poorly executed. Others were good ideas poorly executed, and still others good and reasonably effective government. In a way, it hardly matters. All were part of a guileless effort to remake society that began as a revolution and became the status quo. A transformed economy, cultural upheavals and the Democrats' reluctance to adapt their own shopworn ideology seem to have laid them all bare to counter-revolution.
"We blew it," one icon of the era, Mario M. Cuomo of New York, said in a recent interview. "We were in power for a long period of time. We didn't correct ourselves. We didn't sharpen our agenda. We didn't stay up to date. And we paid the price."
Isabel Sawhill, a scholar at the Urban Institute, suggests that Gresham's Law is at work -- that bad Democratic management has finally driven out basically good policy.
Welfare is the showcase example. The basic subsidy, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, was begun to assist the children of widows and other victims of circumstance in the Depression. As recently as 1960 it remained so, serving only 745,000 families at a cost of about $1 billion a year.
By the 1960's, it had clearly become inadequate. Industry rose; subsistence farming shrank; blacks and other poor streamed to cities. President Kennedy's first Congress let states broaden A.F.D.C. The Supreme Court barred states from denying benefits to classes of recipients, such as families newly moved to another state. Food stamps became easier to get. The welfare rights movement eased the stigma attached to handouts.
And in a way, it worked. As Michael Katz noted in his 1989 analysis of welfare, "The Undeserving Poor," Federal programs lifted about half the poor over the poverty line from 1965 to 1972. Infant mortality plummeted. Few would argue that the average poor family is worse off today than in 1960.
But the costs were huge. A.F.D.C. now costs $23 billion and reaches 14 million households. The dole became the rule for a vast swath of society, the plight of the program's children worsened rather than improved, and the list of ills it was supposed to cure -- crime, illegitimacy, drug use, family breakup -- only got longer.
 
Democrats Against Clinton
 Yet Democratic efforts to overhaul the system were fitful. President Clinton's own proposal to link welfare to work -- and to create jobs -- died last year, largely because the Democrats, who still controlled Congress, refused to embrace it.
Robert Shapiro, vice president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a new-Democratic idea factory, says Congress clung to a notion of giving the poor a share of an endless economic expansion that was in fact ending. "Rather than saying that these programs can't solve these problems and that we need additional emphasis on responsibility, they said 'More aid is the answer,' " he said. "And when those become the terms, these programs have to fail."
There was surely more to it than that. But the basic theme of good intentions, unrestrained and unquestioned, courses through many of the programs Republicans now seek to decimate or abolish.
Many experts call the earned income tax credit -- actually, a Government check that keeps the working poor above the poverty line -- the best antipoverty program of all. It encourages work and is cheap to run.
But its history is instructive. It began in 1975 as a tiny and temporary effort to buffer poor workers from an increase in the Social Security payroll tax. Since then, the credit has been extended, indexed to inflation, made permanent, and finally, in 1993, offered to childless couples. It grew from $252 million to $20 billion and could become most costly welfare program of all.
The new Congress points to studies claiming that a third of the payments have gone to ineligible workers or, sometimes, con artists. The Government cracked down on fraud, but Republicans say some beneficiaries make $50,000 or even $100,000 a year.
Another success story, Head Start, is under assault, too. Head Start has schooled 14 million children in 30 years; Democrats long clamored to expand it. President Bush did so in 1992 to silence election-year criticism. But Edward Zigler, a Yale University psychologist who helped start the program and remains an advocate, says the expansion was disastrous. "They wanted to triple the size of Head Start without any plan, any plan whatsoever. Just throw money out there," he said. The result: wasted funds for hastily trained teachers and staff in catch-as-catch-can surroundings.
There's more. The Legal Services Corporation, intended to give the poor entry into the justice system, faces extinction amid accusations that lawyers clock time for liberal causes rather than clients. Supplemental Security Income, the last resort for the disabled poor, faces cuts, accused of frittering billions on drug addicts, alcoholics and families whose children have questionable behavioral problems. Medicaid now spends much of its money on elderly nursing-home patients, many of them middle class, as well as the younger poor. Even Medicare, which began 28 years ago with a $3.7 billion allotment, now costs $170 billion, grows by 10 percent a year and threatens to eat the entire budget in one gulp.
So was the Great Society wrongheaded? Or just wrongly run? Its basic tenets -- some obligation to the poor, to children and the disabled and the sick -- are probably permanent principles of American society, in one form or another. Democrats chose one form. In a lapse of vigilance, they may have ceded the right to choose another.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: BROWNSTONE BROOKLYN;
Montague St. Faces Rigors Of Popularity

SERIES: Shoptalk: An occasional look at commercial districts around New York.

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
These days, when the telephone rings at the Brooklyn Heights office of William B. May, the real estate company, it is often a prospective business owner eager to find commercial space on Montague Street, the neighborhood's main shopping thoroughfare.
The company receives about 20 such calls a week, compared with two or three a week several years ago, said its vice president, Christopher Thomas. "Usually, I have to tell them there's nothing available," he said. Until recently there were as many as six vacancies along the four short blocks of Montague Street. Today there are none. "Things have never been so tight," Mr. Thomas said. 
 But not everything is rosy on Montague Street, which connects downtown Brooklyn to the waterfront promenade of Brooklyn Heights. While the street has captured the attention of national retail chains like Banana Republic, Starbucks and the Gap, many smaller merchants are struggling.
The influx of chain stores has sent rents soaring to $75 to $90 a square foot, comparable to rents in SoHo or the Upper East Side, Mr. Thomas said. The rents have forced out some longtime shopkeepers, and those who remain complain that business has yet to recover from the real estate crash and recession of the late 1980's.
To maintain the area's economic well-being, the Brooklyn Heights Association hired a consultant last week to explore the formation of a business improvement district. The B.I.D., which requires the approval of the majority of the street's 103 merchants, would impose taxes on the businesses and use the money to look after their interests in areas like marketing and street cleaning.
The B.I.D.'s first battle could be against a city plan to allow vendors to set up food carts on Montague Street. Sidewalk vendors are banned from the neighborhood, and most merchants want to keep it that way. "Besides the fact that our sidewalks are too narrow, these vendors don't pay taxes and they leave the street a mess," said Bill Hurcomb, owner of Boro Photo at 146 Montague Street.
A hearing before the Department of Business Services is scheduled for Oct. 2.
The growing competition on Montague Street has been particularly fierce among restaurants, which now make up at least a third of the street's businesses. One local fixture, the Leaf and Bean coffee shop at 136 Montague Street, which sold bulk coffee and tea and also had a small cafe, was forced out in January after the monthly rent was doubled, to $10,000. A more upscale restaurant, the Height Cafe, quickly took its place.
Armando's, an Italian restaurant at 143 Montague Street that opened in 1938, has begun to feel the pinch from the competition. In the last year, six new restaurants have opened within 100 yards of Armando's, five of them Italian.
"We all can't survive," said Armando's owner, Peter Byros. "In order to be healthy, the street has to have more than just restaurants and big chains." ANDREW JACOBS

An article in the Neighborhood Report last Sunday about the commercial district on Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights misidentified the establishment that succeeded the Leaf and Bean. It is Ozzie's Coffee Bar, not the Heights Cafe. The article also misstated the closing date of the Leaf and Bean. It was June 1994, not last January.

HEADLINE: For Part-Time Business Students, Golf Will Have to Wait

BYLINE: By DANIEL McGINN 

DATELINE: PURCHASE

 BODY:
ON a sunny morning late last month, 40 alumni of New York University's Westchester business program met at Sterling Farms Golf Course in Stamford for a day of golf, sun and fun. Of the school's 240 current students, however -- all of whom were invited -- just one attended.
"Time becomes a very precious commodity once you enter the program," said Mary K. Oberhelman, Westchester director of New York University's Stern School of Business. "It's a lot easier to do things like that when you don't have to go to school." 
 For the part-time Stern students, passing up a round of golf is one of the many sacrifices required in pursuit of a master's degree in business administration. They attend classes on the Manhattanville College campus here for three hours a night, two nights a week, for more than three years before receiving their degrees. But the time invested appears to be worth it.
Earlier this year, U.S. News & World Report named Stern's program the best in the United States in the magazine's first ranking of part-time programs. The list is based on a survey of business school deans nationwide. N.Y.U.'s Business School has long been renowned for its part-time program, in part, according to Business Week's most recent guide to M.B.A. programs, because of the school's history as a place where Wall Street executives could take classes after work at nearby Trinity Place, where the school was founded in 1916.
The school's roots in Westchester are more recent. In the mid-1970's, as more corporations fled to the suburbs, Manhattanville College was seeking to put its classrooms to use in the evenings.
In 1977, the Stern School began renting a suite of offices in Brownson Hall and holding sessions in classrooms upstairs. Workers from nearby corporations like International Business Machines, Kraft General Foods and General Electric flocked to the program, which matriculated about 700 graduates in the next 18 years.
Part-time M.B.A. programs often don't get the respect of their full-time counterparts, said Dick Kwartler, editor of The MBA Newsletter in Floral Park, L.I., who estimates that two-thirds of the country's 275,000 students pursuing M.B.A. degrees attend school part-time. "There has always been more prestige attached to the full-time programs -- that's where the glamour is," he said. "There has always been a stigma attached to the part-time programs, but the heads of the schools are aggressively attacking that."
Ronald J. Patten, dean of the business school at DePaul University in Chicago, referred to the phenomenon as "the Rodney Dangerfield complex" in a recent story in The MBA Newsletter.
He said that the increasing number of companies that will pay for employees to pursue the degree on a part-time basis show that corporations value the programs.
At N.Y.U., administrators say their part-time program is every bit as rigorous as full-time study. "It's not watered down in any way," Ms. Oberhelman said. "It's the same requirements as the full-time program, whether you're in the city or here."
Students in the Westchester division can choose to major in finance, general management or a combined finance-international business program. Other majors are available to students who wish to travel to the city for additional courses.
No matter what their major, master's degree candidates complete 60 credits of course work, consisting of 30 to 33 credits in required courses like accounting, economics, marketing and finance, 12 to 18 credits in their major, and an additional 12 to 18 credits of electives. Most students take six credits a semester and take 10 semesters, including summer sessions, to complete the degree.
Tuition and required fees total $5,133 a semester, putting the total price for the degree at more than $50,000. Many students' employers pick up all or part of the cost.
The program, which receives nearly 200 applications a year, admits a class of 80 students each fall. The average student admitted into this year's class is 27, has more than six years' work experience, scored 639 out of a possible 800 on the Graduate Management Aptitude Test and maintained an undergraduate grade point average of 3.3, Ms. Oberhelman said.
The school's primary competitors for applicants are Fordham University, which operates a satellite M.B.A. program in Tarrytown, the University of Connecticut's Stamford campus and Pace University. But for Susan Schiffler, who was accepted by Pace and the University of Connecticut in addition to N.Y.U., the choice was easy.
"I wanted to further my education, and I looked for the best school in the area," said Ms. Schiffler, a Yorktown resident employed at I.B.M. who began classes at Stern this month. "N.Y.U. was it without a doubt."
Ms. Schiffler is taking financial accounting on Monday evenings and microeconomics on Thursdays. After one session of each class, she was impressed.
"The professors are really personal," she said. "They bring a lot of good examples into class."
The examples were apparent in Prof. Robert Schwartz's Foundations of Finance class on a recent Tuesday night. As he led the class of 55 through topics like "The Flow of Funds From Households to Firms" and "The Structure of the Securities Industry," he mixed theory with stories of where he was during the 1987 stock market crash (having his Volvo repaired) and his advice for the best one-word guess on any finance exam ("liquidity"). "How did you know that," he asked as a student answered a question by reading from the notes projected on the overhead screen.
The payoff for the long evenings of staring at overhead projections is the chance for career advancement and the salary increases that go with it. Christine Doria, a 1987 graduate of the program who lives in Rye Brook, began classes in 1983 while working as a process design manager at Union Carbide in Tarrytown. Shortly after graduation she moved to Bankers Trust in Manhattan, then in 1990 moved to Chase Manhattan, where she works as a business manager in the securities lending division.
"If I didn't have the degree, I'd probably still be in a technical position," Ms. Doria said. "Maybe I could have become a business manager, but it certainly would have taken a bit longer."
Stern's downtown division has produced some famous alumni, including Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and Ismail Merchant, the film producer. The Westchester program hasn't graduated anyone of comparable status yet, but its director said that it's only a matter of time.
"It takes a while," Ms. Oberhelman said. "Just wait a few years."

HEADLINE: Few Protest Metro-North Fare Hike

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
IF Westchester commuters were upset by the average 9 percent fare hike proposed for Metro-North, they did not turn out to protest. Only 15 people showed up at a hearing held at the public library here recently by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
Of those speakers, four were elected officials and three came to complain about train service in Rockland County. 
 The meeting was in marked contrast to a raucous counterpart in Manhattan several days earlier, where more than 100 speakers unleashed their anger and frustration on the authority's board, which in addition to the Metro-North fare hikes has proposed a 25-cent increase on subways and buses and a rise in bridge and tunnel tolls.
E. Virgil Conway, the authority's chairman, said he saw the low turnout as an acknowledgment of Westchester commuters' happiness with the service and acceptance of the increase.
"I think the light turnout reflects a high level of satisfaction with Metro-North," Mr. Conway said. "Citizens understand that fares have not been raised for many years and that the proposed increase was fair and appropriate."
Indeed, some of those who did speak commented on the improvements that have been made by the railroad in the last decade.
"I remember going to the railroad station to hand out political documents in 1980," said Sandra R. Galef, the Democratic Assemblywoman from Ossining.
"The trains were always late, so we had plenty of time to talk to commuters, and they were really mad. Service has greatly improved, and I think commuters would support a modest increase."
Not everyone was so sanguine about the proposal. Naomi C. Matusow, the Democratic Assemblywoman from White Plains, also said that service was excellent, but she still protested the fare increase.
"It doesn't take a financial genius to figure out what's going on here is a tax shift," Ms. Matusow said. "This fair increase is subsidizing Pataki's income tax cut," she added, referring to Gov. George E. Pataki. "I think the M.T.A. has an obligation to stand up on its hind legs and to say that money is important to commuters. You should be fighting for a restoration of those funds."
Because of city, state and Federal budget cuts to mass transit, the authority faces a budget deficit of $816 million. Just over half of the cost for services is paid through government subsidies; the rest comes from fares.
The fare and toll increases are part of a new phase of the authority's capital-investment plan, which is intended to rebuild the commuter railroads and the subway and bus system. The authority has already spent more than $20 billion on the plan since 1982. Metro-North has seen more than $1.4 billion in capital improvements, much of it spent on replacing deteriorating cars and tracks. On-time rates have improved from about 80 percent in 1983 to its current 96 percent, one of the best records in the country.
Improvements already begun or planned on Metro-North include expanded parking in North White Plains and along the New Haven Line, refurbishing all New Haven Line stations in New York, a new station in Cortlandt and expanded parking in Goldens Bridge and Irvington.
Some critics have questioned how the capital-improvement program can continue with shrinking state aid for day-to-day operations and no new state aid for capital improvements. But Mr. Conway, who was appointed by Governor Pataki five months ago, said he will be able to carry out the authority's plans.
"There are always naysayers," Mr. Conway said. "I agree with the Governor's expressed view that economic growth is needed. We are still heavily subsidized by the government. But this is an era where authorities like ours have to be more and more self-sufficient. The basic assumption in the financial plan is that internal efficiency will do the lion's share of expense reductions."
One of the themes many speakers expressed at the New York City hearing was the belief that Governor Pataki and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board were favoring the suburbs over the city in its proposed plan. But several speakers in White Plains argued that most suburban commuters will be doubly hit by the fare increases. Not only do they pay for parking at train stations but they will also have to pay increased Metro-North fares and increased transit fares if they take the subway or a bus to get to their offices in New York City.
The fare increases on the Harlem and Hudson Lines and the New York State section of the New Haven line will average 9 percent, with some fares increasing more and others less. For instance, under the proposal, the monthly commutation fare from Rye to Manhattan would rise to $152 from $138, a 10.1 percent increase. The one-way off-peak fare would rise to $5 from $4.75, a 5.3 percent increase. From Peekskill, the monthly fare would increase to $193 from $172, a 12.2 percent increase. The new fares are expected to be instituted on Nov. 1.
Another issue raised at the hearing was commuter safety. Patricia Dolan, who works as a chef and commutes out of North White Plains, said she often felt threatened as she waited for trains.
"My main concern is safety of the stations," Ms. Dolan told the board. "I can't tell you the number of times I've been followed. I won't ever take a local train, especially at night. You feel so scared. Something has to be done. As a woman, I need some protection."
Donald N. Nelson, president of Metro-North, said that the hearings -- which are required by state statute -- were helpful in that they gave people a chance to express their opinion and that the board sometimes comes away with new information. In response to Ms. Dolan's complaint, he said that he would look into lighting the North White Plains station. He added that the railroad has increased the number of Metro-North police officers to 197 from 140.
"Security is important to us and we have several new police programs aimed at what that customer was complaining about," Mr. Nelson said. "But the fact remains that at any one time we have 40 to 60 cops and 160 stations, so it's possible for a person to commute and not see a police officer. Still, the coverage is much better than it used to be."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
A New Life for Old Mills, Silent for a Decade

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

DATELINE: WINDHAM

 BODY:
WHEN the American Thread Company closed its plant here in 1985, it left 1.2 million square feet of vacant mill space on a 40-acre property where 2,000 people once worked.
Now, after a decade of false starts, a project that envisions a mix of offices, light industry, shops, restaurants and a museum in the complex is already attracting tenants to this northeastern Connecticut community about 30 miles east of Hartford. 
 With almost $6 million in public grants, three buildings have been demolished, and four structurally sound ones with a total of 100,000 square feet are being cleaned, repaired and repainted.
"More has been done with that property in the last 10 months than in the previous 10 years," said the town's First Selectman, Walter M. Pawelkiewicz.
The plan is to lease 100,000 square feet a year for five years, which would use up most of the space that can be salvaged and create 1,200 jobs, said Geri W. Langlois, executive director of the nonprofit Windham Mills Development Corporation.
"So far, based on the contacts that we've had, I think it's possible," Mr. Langlois said. "But people have to be patient. It took American Thread 65 years to build this property up to where it is today. To fill it up again in just five years would be a major accomplishment."
As the Windham Mills project moves forward on the east end of Main Street, Windham officials are finding growing enthusiasm for a downtown revitalization effort.
"The mill project is giving the community a sense that something is happening in the downtown, that things are positive," said Irene I. Flaherty, executive director of the Windham Community Redevelopment Agency.
She said the project was already generating more interest in the agency's two major holdings, a five-acre parcel of vacant land near the mills and a turn-of-the-century Greek Revival building on Main Street.
Marguerite P. Reich, executive director of the Windham Regional Planning Agency, said what happens at the mill could affect the economy of the entire northeast corner of the state.
"Windham has always been the economic center of the region," Ms. Reich said. "It's the place where people work and shop."
The chief promise of the mills project is that it could bring to one site some healthy economic diversity -- housing, commercial and retail space and light manufacturing.
The mill project, with its walkways along the Willimantic River and restored blacksmith shops and textile museum, could also become the anchor for a planned heritage corridor park in the region, she said.
THE mill complex is in Willimantic, a hamlet in Windham that once identified itself so closely with the mills that its police cars bore decals that showed a spool of thread. So when American Thread announced it was leaving, the town lost its economic breath.
There followed a succession of developers who promised to restore the mills, but none of them delivered. Then last November, with $5.7 million from the state's Department of Economic Development and almost $200,000 in Federal economic diversification funds, the town took the property by eminent domain and began repairs on its own.
Russell S. Pratt, a contractor who is chairman of the Windham Mills Development Corporation, said he was surprised to see that after years of neglect the mills were in relatively good shape.
"The strength and integrity of these structures is incredible," Mr. Pratt said. "The structure itself is a fortress. You've got two-foot-thick granite walls, and floors built to support industrial equipment of a century ago, which was extremely heavy and vibrated constantly."
Features such as 4- by 16-inch yellow pine roof beams, ornate staircases, 12- to 20-foot ceilings and maple floors will add to the allure of the space, he said.
"No one could afford to replicate what we have here," Mr. Pratt said. "Anything else just becomes vanilla space after you've seen this building."
Mr. Pratt said most of the renovations so far have made the buildings habitable -- the roof replacement, repairing the sprinkler system and replacing wiring.
"Now we're structurally sound, watertight and safe," Mr. Pratt said. "A lot of what's been going on here hasn't been apparent to passers-by, but we've reached a point where it's going to start looking different on the outside as well."
Restoration is planned for 11 buildings totaling 412,000 square feet. Another two buildings with 224,000 feet of space are being evaluated.
Because of the size of the project -- at the height of production, American Thread was filling two 15,000-gallon fuel oil tanks daily to warm the mills -- each job becomes massive. All 2,800 windows in the complex will be removed and replaced by aluminum-framed double-paned windows, each costing $425.
"From the outside," Mr. Langlois said of the windows, "you really can't tell the difference, but they're a lot more efficient."
"Primarily this is a job-creation project, and an industrial property re-use," Mr. Langlois said. "We're going to save as much as we can, but buildings that aren't economic to renovate are going to have to come down, and items such as windows will not be restored."
Mr. Langlois said much of the focus would be on the river views along the back of the building.
"Only a handful of people in Willimantic even know this view exists, so to open it up to public access is one of our top priorities," Mr. Langlois said. Among the accommodations planned are an outdoor stage area to seat 500 people for concerts, a boardwalk, and a restaurant overlooking the river.
EIGHT buildings are in such bad shape they will have to be demolished. And an arson fire June 10 destroyed a 400,000-square-foot building that probably could not have been saved anyway.
Windham Mills, which traces its roots to 1857, offers space at $3 per square foot a year, with minimum spaces of 1,000 square feet available for leasing. Two tenants, Temporaries of New England and Indar's Stair Company, have moved into a total of 3,000 square feet of office space.
While the price is competitive, it's hard to predict how leasing will progress. Because of a glut of space on the market right now -- some real estate brokers estimate the vacancy rate for commercial space to be as high as 50 percent in Windham not including the mill space -- it might be hard to attract tenants even at $3 a square foot.
"People who have a large quantity of space and are looking to fill it are offering it as low as $1 per foot, and even giving the first month free," said Joseph Underwood, a commercial real estate broker in Windham.
But Mr. Langlois said he was confident of his project's future. He is helping to arrange financing for two prospective tenants, and is in contact with several others.
"There's a lot of naysayers in town," Mr. Langlois said. "At first we were told we'd never get the money, then the roofs would never be done before winter, then we'd never get tenants. But slowly, the arguments are eroding. We got the money. The roofs are fixed. The tenants are starting to come in."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Eugene C. Gavin;
A Second Tax Amnesty, Tough Love

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
EUGENE C. GAVIN, who was the Republican State Representative from Westport in 1993 and 1994, was appointed Commissioner of the Department of Revenue Services this year, responsible for 900 employees and a $47 million budget.
In his new job, Mr. Gavin is overseeing Connecticut's tax amnesty program, which seeks to raise $31 million in back taxes from people who have not filed returns, or have hidden income. 
 Mr. Gavin, a former director of state and local taxes for the Coopers & Lybrand accounting firm, discussed the tax amnesty program recently at his Hartford office. Following are excerpts from that conversation.
Q. Connecticut had a tax amnesty program five years ago. Is it a good idea to have a second one so soon?
A. I recommended to the Governor to have another tax amnesty program because we didn't have a personal income tax in 1990. We looked at the 34 states that have had a tax amnesty program and most of the applications were from personal, individual filers. Two-thirds of the revenues raised under those programs came in from individual filers.
Connecticut is the first to offer a second, full-blown tax amnesty program. I don't like to say never, but I really would be hard pressed to say when or if we should ever have another amnesty program.
Q. How well did the state do with the first amnesty?
A. We received about 10,000 applications. It was supposed to raise $10 million; it ended up at $55 million.
Q. Should the Federal government offer a tax amnesty?
A. The time is right. They believe 18 percent of the taxpaying public is not paying their fair share. That's a huge gap.
Q. Is there public support for a crackdown on tax cheats?
A. There was a national survey done recently that said the No. 1 priority of taxpayers was to have their state tax agencies go after taxpayers who aren't paying their fair share. People are sick and tired of subsidizing the tax cheats, the tax deadbeats, the tax outlaws. I believe that, too. I have to comply with all the laws you do, and I probably have to comply with them to a higher standard.
I don't want to hammer anybody without giving them a chance. Tax amnesty is going to give everyone the chance to come forward, without penalties, without fear of criminal or civil prosecution, maybe even get a reduced interest rate.
Q. Isn't the interest rate on unpaid taxes set by law?
A. Right now, for tax liabilities before July 1, 1995, you could pay up to 20 percent interest. That's very high. One of the initiatives of the department that was passed by the legislature was to apply a lower rate that is more in line with current interest rates. It's still too high, but it's down to 12 percent beginning July 1, 1995.
If your original liabilities were due in 1991 and 1992, that 12 percent versus 20 percent is a big incentive.
I justified giving that to people because when we have to go out and audit people, that costs money. Out of 900 employees, 300 are in the audit function. That costs taxpayers.
If people come forward, we haven't used one dollar of taxpayer money to find them. And if that person or business has been earning money in the state for three years and not paying taxes, we get a lot of money in 1995. But even more important, we get a continuing tax payment from then on in. It becomes an annuity.
Q. Has anyone studied how much the 1990 amnesty program added to the tax base?
A. The quick answer to that is no. And that's another reason I believe the second tax amnesty program is a good idea. In 1990 they did not keep statistics on the new taxpayers and what it meant on an ongoing basis. Obviously they were very pleased with the results, and maybe they were so ecstatic they overlooked a few things.
Also in 1990, they did not develop the profiles of people who came forward, and try to figure out how we missed them before. We're going to do that in 1995, I guarantee it.
Q. Isn't the campaign a little threatening, particularly the slogan "Make your move before we make ours" that you display in your office?
A. We're not trying to intimidate. We're giving you the opportunity to come forward, whether it's out of fear that we will find you -- and we will -- or out of conscience.
Q. Are people going to be afraid to come in and ask about amnesty?
A. If they're afraid to come to the department for help, there are other sources. Three organizations have agreed to give free advice, tax advice and assistance in completing amnesty applications. They are the Connecticut Society of Certified Public Accountants, the Connecticut Bar Association and the Connecticut Society of Enrolled Agents.
If people want to talk to the Department of Revenue Services, they can get the same advice without any fear of subsequent action by us by calling 800-321-7TAX, a toll-free number that provides answers on a completely confidential basis, and if you want to file an application they will be able to monitor it for you and give you its status at any time.
Q. Are people who are caught cheating on taxes going to be able to file an amnesty application?
A. The only people eligible for amnesty are those who are not under audit, and not under civil or criminal investigation.
Q. Are you relaxing enforcement at all during the amnesty program?
A. It's actually being stepped up a little bit. We've formed a discovery unit with about 25 people who have expertise in all the taxes in Connecticut. One of their first initiatives is they're going after professional athletes and entertainers who might come in for one night and earn $100,000. I estimate that will represent about $16 million for the four years covered by amnesty and about $4.5 million to $6 million a year from now on.
And that's only the first initiative. There are others that we will be starting during amnesty. That should give you more incentive to file for amnesty as soon as possible.
Q. Does a three-month amnesty encourage procrastination?
A. Almost two-thirds of the applications that come in are in the last three weeks of the program. But it's not a good idea to wait. If you think you have a problem in September you should file in September, because if you wait until November you're giving us another 60 or 70 days to contact you for an audit, and then you're not eligible.
Q. Is everyone who comes in going to be audited?
A. No, that would be unlikely. We have made the amnesty application program as simple as possible. We want it to be taxpayer friendly. But it is like any tax document you file. It is subject to audit, and you could be audited, so I encourage people to be as honest as possible.
Q. Will you be coordinating with other states and the Internal Revenue Service?
A. The I.R.S. is mad at Gene Gavin, because it would like Connecticut to turn over all the information we receive under tax amnesty. I said I am not going to do that. None of the information that comes in will go to other states or to the Internal Revenue Service.
The only exception will be if the I.R.S. asks me, "Do you have any information on XYZ Company?" If they identify who they want, I will provide them any information we have.
Q. The Federal government has a program that if you turn in a tax cheat you get a portion of whatever is collected. Would something like that make sense for Connecticut?
A. Amazingly enough, we get the calls for free. I understand it, I'm a human being. If you're paying your taxes, and you know your neighbor down the street is cutting his tax liability in half, maybe because he has a cash business or he's not registered with the state, you're going to want to turn him in.
Our second initiative, is going to target businesses that are paying their fair share of taxes and are upset because they know there are related businesses that are not. I'm going to level the playing field.
The other thing we're going to develop further is sharing information with other state agencies. The Department of Consumer Protection, the Department of Motor Vehicles, the Department of Environment Protection, the Liquor Commission -- every agency that issues any type of license. Some businesses license themselves with consumer protection and not with the tax department because in the past we didn't have the legislation or technical skills to do the matching. But if you register with any state agency, we're going to find you.
Q. Have you taken any steps to make sure your employees don't treat people like deadbeats?
A. During the amnesty program we want people to feel comfortable to come forward. I've instructed every one of my 900 employees to act accordingly, and if anyone has a problem with that, my number is 297-5650, and anyone can call me.
Anyone who comes forward, we're treating with kid gloves. The only caveat I want to add to that is we are stepping up audit activities and arrest activities, so I want you to come forward before that happens to you. Because it will happen.

HEADLINE: Chamber Plan Finances Small Business Loans

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
IN one of the first programs of its kind in the country, the Westchester County Chamber of Commerce this month began a $4.2 million privately capitalized loan program intended to help small businesses with start-up and expansion costs.
Initially, the program is being run in conjunction with seven banks but is expected to expand, said Harold E. Vogt, the chamber's president. He said he was receiving inquiries daily from other interested lending institutions. 
 "For years, the lament of small businesses has been about obtaining financing," Mr. Vogt said, explaining that banks tend to avoid business loans of $50,000 or less because they "require as much attention and paperwork as $5 million loans."
Under the Westchester Regional Small Business Loan Program, as it is being called, loans of $5,000 to $50,000 will be available to eligible small businesses through the banks, but the Chamber of Commerce will perform the administrative paperwork and screening tasks.
"We will cover those expenses instead of the banks," Mr. Vogt said, explaining that his organization will be hiring a loan administrator to help applicants develop business plans and fill out applications.
The County Chamber will work with the State Small Business Development Center to create the business plans, which Richard Feitelson, a spokesman for the center, likened to a road map.
The critical business plan, which is often required in loan application packages, "shows where you are, where you want to go and how you are going to get there," Mr. Feitelson said.
Loans will be be pre-approved and 90 percent guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. In addition, each participating bank will make available $200,000 a year for the program over a three-year period. Participating banks are Chase Manhattan and Chemical Bank, Key Bank, Marine Midland Bank, NatWest Bank, North Fork and Waterhouse Bank.
The Westchester County Chamber of Commerce loan program is being patterned after a pilot program started a year ago in Syracuse. That program has delivered 18 loans to small businesses, said Steven Cohen, president of the Westchester County Bankers Association.
Mr. Cohen observed that many well-known large companies like Federal Express and Microsoft were started with loans from the Small Business Administration.
Start-up consulting firms, financial services and food service companies are among the types of new businesses in the market today, Mr. Cohen said.
Observing that there are "a lot of talented people out on the street these days," he said that many new business owners are former bankers who became unemployed after bank mergers.
The loan program is intended to aid "a whole gamut of businesses," with purchases of equipment, expansions, new campaigns and other expenses, Mr. Vogt said.
Further details on the program are available at 948-2110. ELSA BRENNER

THE WINNER-TAKE-ALL SOCIETY
How More and More Americans
Compete for Ever Fewer and Bigger
Prizes, Encouraging Economic Waste,
Income Inequality, and an
Impoverished Cultural Life.
By Robert H. Frank and Philip J. Cook.
272 pp. New York:
Martin Kessler Books/
The Free Press. $25. 
 WHAT do Boris Becker, Alan Dershowitz, Diane Sawyer, Michael Jordan, Elle Macpherson and John Grisham have in common? According to Robert H. Frank and Philip J. Cook, they are all beneficiaries of "winner-take-all markets," in which the top performers tend to monopolize pay and prestige, leaving little in the way of either gain or glory for the vast numbers of also-rans -- the equivalent of a third world in the professions, with a few wealthy oligarchs and a miserable majority.
The phenomenon is long familiar in industries organized around superstars. Mr. Frank, who teaches economics at Cornell University, and Mr. Cook, who is a professor of public policy at Duke University, contend in "The Winner-Take-All Society" that the star system is becoming common in many fields, at the cost not only of social equality but of long-term efficiency: "In effect, the reward structure common in entertainment and sports -- where thousands compete for a handful of big prizes at the top -- has now permeated many other sectors of the economy." In arguing that efficient markets may produce outcomes harmful to society, the authors challenge the conventional wisdom of both conservatives and neoliberals. It is a challenge that is particularly timely now that income inequality in the United States has reached proportions not seen since the Great Depression. "The incomes of the top 1 percent more than doubled in real terms between 1979 and 1989," they point out, "a period during which the median income was roughly stable and in which the bottom 20 percent of earners saw their incomes actually fall by 10 percent."
Mr. Frank and Mr. Cook reject the argument that inequality is increasing as a result of changes in "human capital," that is, "individual productivity and related qualities, including education, experience, unique talents, temperament, drive and intelligence." Human-capital theorists tend to attribute the growth of inequality to the failure of those at the bottom of the ladder to take advantage of opportunities, because of lack of training (Robert Reich) or genetic inferiority (Charles Murray). Citing Christopher Jencks's analysis in his 1972 book "Inequality," that differences in human capital account for no more than 15 percent of variations in income, Mr. Frank and Mr. Cook argue convincingly that slight changes in the distribution of talent cannot possibly explain the radical growth in inequality: "The winner-take-all perspective urges us to look first to the nature of the positions people hold, rather than to their personal characteristics."
To give only one example, the fact that the pay of a typical chief executive of a large American company is 120 times that of a manufacturing worker today, compared to a mere 35 times in 1974, is the result not of changes in the abilities of bosses and workers, but of the fact that companies now routinely raid one another for executives, thus bidding up their pay. In Germany and Japan, chief executives are promoted almost entirely from within, and have not experienced enormous pay increases. (Among other things, this fact gives the lie to those who excuse the overpayment of American executives by referring to "the globalization of the economy"; the key factor is the unique and peculiar structure of American corporate management.)
Until recently, conservatives have argued that the growth of income inequality is a statistical illusion. Now, intelligent conservatives, like David Frum, are taking a different tack: the increase in inequality is real, but since the main cause is the surge in incomes at the top, why complain? Mr. Frank and Mr. Cook offer an answer. The star system, in fields from law and corporate management to university teaching, is distorting American society by diverting talented young people into competitions that most will lose: "Our claim is that . . . market incentives typically lure too many contestants into winner-take-all markets, and too few into other careers," a point also made by Derek Bok in "The Cost of Talent" (1993). The most compelling example is the diversion of "our most able students" into finance and law in hopes of being the next George Soros or F. Lee Bailey. The free-marketeer's assumption that students will rationally calculate their chances of success in a given field is belied by what one psychologist has called "the Lake Wobegon Effect," after the Garrison Keillor town where "the men are good-looking and all the children are above average." As Mr. Frank and Mr. Cook note, "Winner-take-all markets attract too many contestants in part because of a common human frailty with respect to gambling -- namely, our tendency to overestimate our chances of winning"; they fear that hordes of young actors doomed to failure are being joined by wannabes in law, finance and journalism who might have succeeded and served society in other fields.
The least convincing part of "The Winner-Take-All Society" is the proposal to deter such "overcrowding" by means of higher taxes on superstars: by directing wannabes to alternative pursuits, "the effect of the tax is thus to reduce the cost of the winner-take-all tournament"; society need not worry about discouraging Pavarottis because "the people most likely to drop out would be those whose odds of making it into the winner's circle were smallest to begin with." There would be fewer starving artists and more comfortable engineers.
 IT is not at all clear, however, that "a more progressive tax structure would not reduce but actually increase economic efficiency." By Mr. Frank and Mr. Cook's own account, the greatest gains in winner-take-all markets have gone to top performers in already well-remunerated professions. Higher progressive taxation might make superstar lawyers less common, but as long as the average lawyer makes more than the average engineer, it would not encourage aspiring lawyers to go instead to engineering school (Mr. Frank and Mr. Cook do not discuss the possible effects of a tax on all lawyers).
The case for higher rates will have to rest on arguments more plausible than a deterrent effect on actors, Wall Street wizards and novelists who lack the talent to make it to the top. Another of the book's arguments is more persuasive, and just as likely to outrage the devotees of laissez-faire. It calls for "positional arms races" in professions that without special rules and customary inhibitions will degenerate into winner-take-all melees. Mr. Frank and Mr. Cook cite restraints on cutthroat competition in sports, like team roster limits, revenue sharing and pay caps that "prevent both large- and small-city franchise owners from getting into an all-out bidding war for one another's players." And they lament the destruction of the "positional arms control agreement" in higher education after the Justice Department charged Ivy League schools with antitrust violations because they colluded on their financial aid policies. Now that universities have been not merely allowed but forced to use financial aid to compete with one another for the brightest students, the authors predict, "financial aid will be captured disproportionately not by the students whose families most need it, but by the students with the highest grades and test scores."
Mr. Frank and Mr. Cook tend to make winner-take-all markets a one-size-fits-all explanation, and many readers will find some of their remedies worse than the disease. Nevertheless, "The Winner-Take-All Society" is a major contribution to the debate about the causes and consequences of inequality in America. "As today's young economists look back to the early years of the Great Depression, most are astonished to realize that, less than a lifetime ago, their predecessors thought that the cure for a stagnant economy was to reduce the supply of money," Mr. Frank and Mr. Cook write. "The problem of our time is not depression but the multiple evils of rising inequality, budget deficits and slow growth. Yet the quintessential conservative policy prescription of this era -- tax cuts for middle- and upper-income people -- is no more likely to cure these problems than monetary contraction was likely to cure the Great Depression." Mr. Frank and Mr. Cook have provided a timely reminder that the reward structure of the free market and the optimal incentive structure of an equitable, efficient society may not coincide at all.

HUDDLE FEVER
Living in the Immigrant City.
By Jeanne Schinto.
302 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf.
$24. 
 IN the course of this account of life in Lawrence, Mass., the author, Jeanne Schinto, remarks, "When it comes right down to it, where you will be happy living depends on where you are most comfortable; not where you belong according to some 'rule' about work or class, but where you feel you belong -- which is usually the place where you feel free to be yourself."
That rambling, clumsy, good-hearted sentence gives an accurate flavor of the book, which is also chatty, anecdotal to the point of being gossipy and given to the well-intentioned cliche as well as the muddled summary. It is also premature, because things change, places change, people come and go. As for cities, some are hopeless. That is also the subtext of the book. At one time such personal accounts of closely observed residence would be concerned with distant cities: "Rangoon Jottings," "Ten Years in Khartoum," "A Decade in Bangkok." Yet Lawrence is just that sort of city -- a remote, bereft, rotting and blighted place that was once prosperous and proud. Its social structure was complex in an Asian way even before the Vietnamese displaced the Irish.
After years of living on the periphery of middle-class life in Greenwich, Conn., and Washington, Ms. Schinto went to Lawrence because her husband, Bob Frishman, needed to supervise his family's furniture business. But this was much more than a relocation. The move was cultural outreach of a bold kind, for the couple made a deliberate decision to buy an old house in Lawrence and live in this now-decrepit city in the hope that the street and the town would rise again. An alternative would have been to commute the short distance from Andover. But Andover was no challenge at all. Well organized, tidy, prettily painted, a buffed-up and well-appointed antique with a colonial pedigree, and also the site of a distinguished school, Andover is consequently snobbish, preppy, fastidious, racially and culturally monochrome and insufferable. "Known for its urban blight," Lawrence, right next door ("a city of old Italians and young Latinos"), became home for the couple.
"Huddle Fever," the story of Ms. Schinto's 10 years in Lawrence, is an unclassifiable and somewhat garrulous chronicle that deals in sociology, local history and politics, the rise and fall of American manufacturing, the unpredictability of neighbors and the paradoxes of American immigration. It is no help to Lawrence's dignity that Robert Frost was a Lawrence High School grad (valedictorian of the class of 1892), or that Leonard Bernstein grew up there. This is overshadowed by Willie Horton, who committed his 1974 murder there, and by the city's high unemployment and even higher percentage of welfare cases. Once the Irish and Italians went to Lawrence to work in its clothing mills, the city became, by 1911, "the cloth-making capital of the world, easily surpassing two of its early-day rivals -- Manchester, N.H., and Manchester, England -- combined." Latterly, new immigrants have gone to Lawrence from Puerto Rico and Cambodia and Vietnam -- as well as from other cul-de-sacs in Massachusetts -- to sign on for free welfare money.
As the city lost its grip on manufacturing, it went downhill, and the gigantic mills became derelict. Ms. Schinto's history of Lawrence's luminaries and declining fortunes, drawn from earlier, academic scholarship, shows the author's indignation and sadness. She sketches the history of the town fathers, of Billy Wood's famous textile operation, the American Woolen Company, and the important contradictions of Roman Catholicism in Lawrence. But it remains a book that makes up in feeling what it lacks in design or fluency; it would have profited by being more rigorous. Ms. Schinto describes the experiences of her friends and acquaintances, but in sentences like "Terri Kelley says a Vietnamese girl told her" (a story of prejudice), she cannot adequately convey the larger picture of a town of new immigrants with a terminal disease, where it is easier to get on welfare than get a job.
 WHEN a city is viable, as Lawrence was, and offers work to people and a fair day's pay, there is a sense of community in spite of the ethnic differences. Working people learn to rub along together. In the absence of work, there is despair and foolishness and waste. The best intentions cannot change that. But despair is not the thesis of this book, which is, ultimately, not the tale of a ruined city but of the experience of living in it. It is awkwardly, unapologetically personal. This is the story of two good people, Ms. Schinto, a novelist and anthologist, and her husband, who ran unsuccessfully for Lawrence's City Council. Their residence was an altruistic experiment, and like many other altruistic experiments it ended in disappointment, confusion, alarm and flight. The town they hoped would improve just got worse; the street they hoped would rise fell into decay and became the haunt of arsonists and drug dealers. In the end the hopeful couple move the few miles to Andover, and, almost against their will, they quite like it. Perhaps Ms. Schinto will write a similar book about smug little Andover.

COMING OF AGE
The Story of Our Century by Those Who've Lived It.
By Studs Terkel.
468 pp. New York:
The New Press. $25. 
 LATELY there's been a slew of books on getting old. That figures. We're a nation of narcissists and more of us are living longer. More aging navels, more aged gazers. Studs Terkel, who has made a life's work of chatting with celebrities and plain folks for a Chicago radio program, has also published books of oral history every few years. "Working" (1974) was his first, followed by others on race, World War II, which he labeled "The Good War," the Great Depression and the fate of the American dream. Now in his own 80's, he has conducted and collected interviews with some 70 men and women who have logged their biblical threescore years and ten or more.
But don't let the title "Coming of Age: The Story of Our Century by Those Who've Lived It," or the label "oral history," fool you into expecting some kind of broad, inclusive overview. The people interviewed for "Coming of Age," though diverse in their life histories, are an inordinately like-minded crowd, and the language spoken here is pure Terkel: the voice of the embattled old liberal shaking his stick at the 20th century.
If you don't fancy sitting in on the last meeting of the Norman Thomas fan club, you will probably bypass this book. Mr. Terkel may even expect that: he's been preaching to the choir so long he may not care about the sinners. Even his footnotes, often quoting from his own work, tend to multiply examples and emphasize opinions rather than elucidate obscurities. To be sure, he makes a token stab at including conservatives -- an investment banker here, a once powerful lawyer there, even one self-confessed Republican. But if you had a buck for everyone here who snarls at Ronald Reagan and George Bush, you'd have enough to send a nice contribution to your favorite political action committee.
If many readers are put off by such politics, it will be too bad because these grayheads (as the author calls them) are great fun to listen to and their stories, if not startling, are instructive. For those who have never heard an account of the 1937 strike against General Motors' Fisher Body Division in Flint, Mich., Genora Johnson Dollinger, 80, recalls the event in spirited detail -- company goons, tear gas, bloodied heads. "Our society is set up in such a way that we don't rely on the memory of old people," says Hazel Wolf, 95, whose own vivid memories include growing up as a daughter of a Wobbly, becoming a Communist in the 1930's, being jailed for a day in the McCarthy-era 1950's (accused, absurdly, of attempting to overthrow the Government by force), working as a legal secretary and living happily for the past three decades on Social Security and a rent subsidy. She still has enough juice in her batteries to make speeches and pester politicians on behalf of her favorite causes (labor, the environment, women's issues). To recharge, she camps out: "I have a little tent, a sleeping bag and a little pad," which she takes to the woods, she explains to her no doubt startled interviewer, as if this were the normal run of affairs for nonagenarians.
Not all the interviewees are as inspirational, but most are personally admirable. Almost no one gripes about isolation, pain or the limited resources that are the lot of many very old people. In fact, you have to read this volume in small doses for fear of choking on all the earnest good cheer, courage in the face of adversity, acceptance of mortality balanced with a cussed determination to keep fighting the good fight. (Though most of these folks deplore the competitiveness of American life, they are not about to let anyone get the better of them, including the old man with the scythe.)
For anyone over the age of 70, the minimum age of the interview subjects, there is a risk that these tales will be not inspiring but depressing: compare yourself -- at any age -- to "slim," "perky," "bustling" Alice McGrath, a former labor organizer, who reports that her 75th birthday party gathered "bankers, progressives, Chicanos, old friends, the whole bunch." "The newspapers were saying how wonderful I am," she said.
You can't help agreeing, of course. Who would fault a woman still angered by the world's injustices, still full of spit and vinegar, still ranting at her Jacuzzi-mates about racism, homelessness, poverty, the folly of the Cuban embargo? But by the time you finish reading about this paragon, you wish Mr. Terkel had played her off against a mere mortal, someone like George Jameson, the 102-year-old codger who was interviewed in a British newspaper last month. Old George takes life a little less seriously, reveling in his pint of bitter in the morning, his lunchtime stop at the local for another pint, his jam sponge at teatime, his stiff Scotch before dinner, his favorite sitcoms, "a little cuddle" from his wife at bedtime and the glass of brandy and milk on his bedside table in case he wakes during the night.
Sure, Studs Terkel aims higher than the old-codger interview. All his protagonists have made their marks, whether famously -- like the economist John Kenneth Galbraith, interviewed at 85; the jazz bassist Milt Hinton, 83; the actress Uta Hagen, 75; Marvin Miller, 72, the first head of the baseball players' union -- or more quietly, like the teachers, doctors, nurses, policemen, lawyers, public servants and organizers who labored in obscurity. But though he may aim high, Mr. Terkel's interviews don't soar. He seems to have asked all his subjects a series of unimaginative questions: on their childhoods, mentors, turning points in their lives, regrets (if any), their commitments to their community, feelings about technology, health care, hopes for the next generation, for the future of the race, their religious beliefs, how they would like to be remembered, etc.
Maybe because the questions are so relentlessly pedestrian, they elicit banal answers. Many childhoods were poor but happy. Some of the people were born rich, but most have achieved compassion. Some fear technology, some embrace it, all warn of its dangers. The Depression looms large, though for most it is remembered almost fondly, and for some there's a hint of nostalgia, even a wish for a return to the good old days of unemployment and labor unrest. The powerful drop names, the religious praise God, even the atheists are pious.
The century's wars, the great strikes of the 1930's, the McCarthy era, the corrupting influence of television, the selfishness (or generosity) of the young: all prove springboards, sadly, more for opinion and generalization than for real storytelling. There's little poetry.
But there are notable exceptions. Amid the treacle there's the mean old German lady whose first sentence is "We were very important people in Berlin," and who goes on to vent resentment, bigotry and a mesmerizing rage for seven hard-hearted pages. And then there are the delightful yarns of Robert St. John, 92, who as a young reporter covered the Lindbergh kidnapping, the mob and one of Roosevelt's Presidential campaigns. He "retired" from newspapering at 30; then, by a series of flukes, he got sucked back by World War II into spot reporting and broadcasting, was blacklisted in the 50's, still writes and lectures (and still knows how to tell a great story) and delivers a highly politically incorrect prescription for living to an obstinate old age.
ONE of the longest interviews is also one of the strongest -- a talk with John Gofman, 76, one of the all too few scientists included, considering that this is a century that has been shaped by science. Dr. Gofman, a whistle-blowing chemist, physician and antinuclear activist, is just one of the angry old prophets gathered here who will not go gentle into anyone's night. In fact, his visions of decay and disease are enough to give us all bad dreams.
And occasionally, the language and imagery in other interviews is inspired. Bessie Doenges, 93, a columnist for a Manhattan neighborhood weekly, describes the daily exhaustion of the aged as evening comes on: "Then it's 8 o'clock and I fight sleep, damn it all. I fight it with everything I've got! I don't want to go to bed, life's too short. Actually, I sleep 12 hours or maybe 14. Sleep is my last lover. I don't want it, but there you have it. . . . I accept it with grace. What else can I do?"
What else indeed? These interviews will find an audience, and there will be more such to come. Two of Mr. Terkel's informants are writing their own books: one will be called "Waiting to Die," the other "Aging Well and Dying Well." Until then, "Coming of Age" gives us a glimpse of a stage of life we all look forward to eagerly, considering the alternative.

THE END OF RACISM
Principles for a Multiracial Society.
By Dinesh D'Souza.
724 pp. New York:
The Free Press. $30 
 DINESH D'SOUZA, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a leading conservative think tank, believes that one of the biggest obstacles facing African-Americans today is liberalism. Whenever black people do anything wrong, liberals are quick to excuse their behavior. This makes it harder for young blacks to pull up their socks, do their homework and get jobs. "Today the most formidable ideological barrier facing blacks," Mr. D'Souza says, "is not racism but antiracism."
Mr. D'Souza sees liberals as cultural relativists -- people who infer, from the mistaken premise that every culture is as good as every other, that the crime-ridden, drug-infested culture of the ghetto is just as good as that of the white suburbs. "Relativism has now imprisoned liberals in an iron cage that prevents them from acknowledging black pathology," he writes. "This explains the interminable liberal rhetoric about the 'root causes' of poverty, the 'bitter hoax' of the American dream, the mysterious disappearance of 'meaningful' jobs, the prospect of a 'resurgence' of 'hate,' the danger of 'imposing one's morality.' " If it were not for the insidious influence of cultural relativism, defenders of affirmative action (like this reviewer, who is a card-carrying liberal) might give up "the unquestioned assumption of contemporary liberalism" that "racism is responsible for black failure, and that given the persistence of racism in society, there is no alternative to institutionalizing race as the basis of job hiring, voting, law and education."
Having abandoned this assumption, we liberals might then come to agree with Mr. D'Souza that we should never have assumed that "segregation was a system established by white racists for the purpose of oppressing blacks." We might cease to believe that "the civil rights movement represented a triumph of justice and enlightenment over the forces of Southern racism and hate." Such beliefs are largely due, Mr. D'Souza thinks, to the adoption of "Boas ian assumptions." He treats the anthropologist Franz Boas (1858-1942) as the founding guru of cultural relativism, and claims that Boas exerted a bad influence on both W. E. B. Du Bois and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Black leaders might have understood segregation better had they not held, as Mr. D'Souza says King did, "the Boasian proposition that inequality between whites and blacks is not natural but the conventional product of past and continuing discrimination."
"History shows," Mr. D'Souza tells us, "that the principles of the civil rights movement developed as a direct outgrowth of cultural relativism." This led the movement to misconstrue both the purpose and effects of segregation: "It correctly targeted discrimination, but wrongly construed private individuals and companies, rather than government, as the primary threat to black prospects." Its leaders did not notice the hardship that segregation laws imposed on, for example, the streetcar companies, which were forced to buy extra equipment. So they did not see that segregation "represented a triumph of government regulation over the free market." They also failed to grasp that although there was a "vicious racist backlash" after Reconstruction, this "was over by the 1920's," and that segregation "represented a compromise on the part of the Southern ruling elite seeking, in part, to protect blacks."
The fatal influence of cultural relativism reached right up to the Supreme Court. For in citing social scientists in Brown v. Board of Education on the destructive effects on black children of segregated schools, "the Court's exaltation of the 'feeling' of inequality reflected the subjectivity of Boasian relativism: to be unequal is to be perceived as unequal." As Mr. D'Souza sees it, in holding that separate schools are inherently unequal, the Warren Court took the first step down the road that led from desirable color-blindness to undesirable affirmative action programs.
Mr. D'Souza is cheered that some African-Americans now agree with him that "if blacks can close the civilization gap, the race problem in this country is likely to become insignificant." But, he claims, "the mainstream of black intellectuals simply refuses to criticize African-American pathologies or to seek internal reform." People like William Julius Wilson, who in "The Truly Disadvantaged" traces the ghettos back to black unemployment, are, Mr. D'Souza believes, pretty well unredeemable. "In Wilson's view," Mr. D'Souza says sardonically, "blacks just happened to arrive in the cities around the time that unskilled jobs were leaving"; Mr. Wilson cannot admit that the shortage of jobs is caused by the civilization gap, rather than vice versa.
If Mr. D'Souza's story is right, white Americans can relax. Their ancestors may have treated blacks harshly, but that was a long time ago. Racism is a thing of the past, for (Mr. D'Souza asks) "if white racism controls the destiny of blacks today, how has one segment of the black community prospered so much over the past generation, while the condition of the black underclass has deteriorated?" We liberals are inclined to respond that one reason that one segment of the black community has prospered is that affirmative action worked. Even though we wonder whether affirmative action programs still command enough public support to be viable, we agree with Cornel West that "given the history of this country, it is a virtual certainty that without affirmative action racial and sexual discrimination will return with a vengeance." We accept Mr. Wilson's explanation of why the condition of the black underclass has deteriorated: its members are surplus to the requirements of the national labor market.
 MR. D'SOUZA is right that there is a "civilization gap" between ghetto and suburb, and that distrust of black ghetto teen-agers can be viewed as rational because it's based on culture rather than race. But does he really believe that they will get jobs if they develop better habits? That the "last hired, first fired" pattern of employment had nothing to do with the transformation of our inner cities since World War II? Does he really think that Mr. Wilson's detailed and careful historical account is just cultural relativist mythmaking?
It is hard to say whether he does, because his book contains so little argument, so little genuine debate with his opponents. "The End of Racism" is bloated with quotations and anecdotes, but has virtually no argumentative structure. There is no cumulation of results from chapter to chapter, only an increasingly self-confident reiteration of the same slogans. Writers like Mr. West and Mr. Wilson are quoted only to be waved aside, sneered at as intellectually and morally bankrupt liberals. Mr. D'Souza's contempt for those who disagree with him is so great that he cannot take their concerns seriously.
The only analytic tool Mr. D'Souza uses is his idee fixe, cultural relativism. But Franz Boas was not the simpleton Mr. D'Souza makes him out to be, and few liberals hold the absurd dogma that all cultures are on a moral par. What makes us liberals doubt that it is up to blacks to close the civilization gap is not a philosophical dogma but the plausible, empirical claim that there will always be a civilization gap between people with hope and people without it, people who know they have a chance in life and people who know they do not.
It is, alas, true that liberals who work in multicultural education, and in the "diversity" industry, often do make cultural-relativist noises. Mr. D'Souza, whose previous book was "Illiberal Education," wants to use these noises as evidence for the bankruptcy of all liberal ideas. But he barely tries to defend his startling claim that "the principles of the civil rights movement developed as a direct outgrowth of cultural relativism." The civil rights movement was an expression of naked moral outrage at unnecessary human suffering. It was the great, inspiring moral event of our lifetime: the moment at which our country showed that it was still capable of moral progress and of a national moral identity. The idea that it was somehow based on false philosophical principles is weird. Mr. D'Souza's tone of lofty intellectual condescension toward men like Du Bois and King is very hard to take.
Until conservatives stop talking about philosophical principles and start talking about the causes of suffering, and until they start offering more plausible proposals for relief than "let the blacks civilize themselves" and "end dependency on big government," they will not contribute much to American public life. Conceivably somebody could make a case for the claim that white Americans are now entitled to relax, go color-blind, and let the African-Americans rebuild their culture on their own. Mr. D'Souza has not even begun to make it.

HEADLINE: More Casinos, More Players Who Bet Until They Lose All

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: DAVENPORT, Iowa

 BODY:
Down to her last dollar, Linda Edwards bet it on the slot machine and felt sick to her stomach as it vanished, like the $75,000 that had gone before.
Since the riverboat casino opened here four years ago, Ms. Edwards, a 46-year-old factory worker, has squandered her retirement account, taken out three loans and borrowed to the hilt against two credit cards. "It takes hold of you," said Ms. Edwards, who has a teen-age daughter at home. "I had thoughts of suicide."
Gambling, the fastest-growing industry in America, has spread like prairie fire across Iowa, a state that did not even have a lottery until 1985 and now has 10 big casinos, not counting the horse track in Altoona and the dog track in Council Bluffs, both of which have 24-hour slot machines. 
 No longer does the state impose a maximum loss of $200 a day for each player on the riverboats. Now there are no limits, and some card games are as high as $1,000 a hand. It is an astonishing metamorphosis of Midwestern mores: It was in Dubuque during the 1970's that a Roman Catholic priest went to jail on bingo charges, and now nearly 9 of 10 Iowans say they gamble, a recent survey found.
And in a statistic that has caused some alarm in the state, 5.4 percent of Iowans reported a gambling problem, up from 1.7 percent in 1989.
"You ask around, and just about everyone now knows somebody with a gambling problem," said Tom Fennelly, a state counselor who works with Gamblers Anonymous here, which has twice needed to move into bigger quarters recently.
Among the 24 recovering gamblers who gathered for support in a former law office in downtown Davenport, more than $200,000 had been lost aboard the riverboat casino a few blocks away, where Main Street crosses the Mississippi River. Six of them had gone bankrupt.
Meetings of problem gamblers are springing up here and throughout the nation, especially in the smaller cities and towns that had been isolated from casinos until the last few years.
For some gamblers, the chase for a big jackpot has ruined more than just bank accounts. Jason Berg, a 19-year-old from the little Iowa town of Elkander, ended his life in June after running up a big gambling loss, leaving a note that read simply, "I'm out of control."
Philip Marshall, 51, shot himself in August after losing a bundle at the Catfish Bend riverboat casino in Fort Madison. And in Illinois, a 41-year-old suburban salesman, Howard Russell, shot himself in the parking lot of the Grand Victoria Casino in Elgin last fall, after losing more than $50,000. When the police found him, he had $13 in his pockets.
Gambling is a $40 billion business that draws more customers than baseball parks or movie theaters. Besides providing an estimated 1 million jobs, gambling has also been a politically painless way to raise tax revenue: casinos alone paid $1.4 billion in state and local taxes last year.
The cost in human misery -- the lost homes, the broken marriages, the neglected children -- are difficult to calculate. But with gambling growing at a breakneck pace, experts say, the problems are surely keeping pace.
John Kindt, a professor of commerce at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana, who has studied gambling, estimates that for every dollar that states take in from gambling, they pay three dollars in costs, for social agencies and the criminal justice system.
By the most conservative estimates, he said, a problem gambler costs society an average of $13,000 a year in lost work, incarceration, neglected children and other problems.
Bills have been sponsored in both houses of Congress to establish a commission that would study the impact of gambling. One sponsor, Senator Richard G. Lugar, a Republican who is seeking the Presidential nomination, told the Christian Coalition in a recent speech that gambling was having a corrosive effect on the nation's fabric.
Senator Paul Simon, an Illinois Democrat who is also a sponsor of the bill, told his colleagues recently, "What should not be ignored by Congress and the American people is that we have a problem on our hands."
The move for a commission has been strongly opposed by gambling interests. Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., the former Republican Party chairman who is now the chief lobbyist for the nation's casinos, wrote a letter to Mr. Simon in which he acknowledged problem gambling but said the industry was already "taking aggressive steps to deal with this problem."
Here in the Quad Cities, an area that has been called the "Detroit of the Farm Belt" for the presence of John Deere and other farm machinery companies, gambling was seen as a way to revive an economy devastated by the loss of 20,000 jobs during the collapse of the farm economy in the 1980's. Unemployment had soared into the upper teens, and some idled workers who were unable to pay mortgages simply left town.
Today, unemployment is down around 3 percent, but it is unclear how much of that is attributable to gambling. The riverboat casinos were promoted to voters here, in large part, as a way to bring money in from other regions. At first, busloads of Chicagoans came to the boats to gamble. Later, there was competition from casinos on Indian land.
But now that casino boats have opened in the Chicago suburbs, gamblers there no longer need to come all the way to Iowa, and few do.
The typical gambler now is not a tourist but someone like Sue Jackson, a 50-year-old Davenport housewife, who sat before a $1 slot machine the other day and lamented that she was "not having any darned luck at all."
Mrs. Jackson, who started on the nickel slots and then moved up to the quarter machines before graduating to the dollar slots, said she had initially opposed riverboat gambling because she believed that it would cause problems for some people.
And for her? "Oh yeah," she said, "it sure could."
Mr. Fennelly, the gambling counselor, went to prison in the 1970's for running a sports betting operation. He said most people finally went for help when they did something their conscience could not abide, like stealing or lying to get money. He told of one woman who had resorted to prostitution to get money for gambling.
In some ways, gamblers are even more reluctant to seek help than people with alcohol or drug problems, fearful that they will lose their jobs if they are found out, experts say.
"You can imagine having a job with access to money, say, as an accountant," Mr. Fennelly said, "and the boss finds out you've got a gambling problem."
A decade ago, he said, men outnumbered women at least 20 to 1 among problem gamblers. "Women tend to find the racetracks a bit seedy, and they don't usually get into sports betting with a bookie," he said.
But the emergence of casinos, which tend to be pleasant, upbeat places, has changed all that. Now, women make up about half of the people in the Gamblers Anonymous meetings here.
One of them is Mrs. Edwards, the woman who gambled away $75,000. "I've been clean since March," she said.

HEADLINE: Congressman Heads to Trial In California

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE 

DATELINE: COMPTON, Calif., Sept. 24

 BODY:
In an unusual prelude to the extortion trial of Representative Walter R. Tucker 3d, lawyers asked prospective jurors whether they believed black politicians were targets for "takedown" by the Federal Government more often than their white counterparts.
The question is at the heart of Mr. Tucker's contention that as a black man representing a Congressional district with one of the largest black populations in the nation, he is the victim of overzealous white prosecutors. Jury selection was completed last week, and the trial is expected to begin in earnest on Monday. 
 Prosecutors have said they have thousands of documents and many hours of clandestine videotape and audiotape evidence that show the 38-year-old, second-term Democrat taking $37,500 in bribes and soliciting another $250,000 in kickbacks from two waste disposal companies while he was the Mayor of Compton. Compton is the largest city in Mr. Tucker's district, which encompasses industrial suburbs south of Los Angeles.
If convicted on all counts, he could be sent to prison for up to 246 years and fined as much as $2.7 million.
The often technical financial aspects of the case have been overshadowed by emotionally fraught legal, political and racial issues. Mr. Tucker, a lawyer and Baptist minister trained at Princeton and Georgetown Universities, is the youngest member of a powerful political dynasty, a family that has been described as the "Kennedys of Compton."
From the start, he has said the prosecution was the result of bias.
"Look at the list," Mr. Tucker told reporters recently on the front steps of the Federal courthouse in Los Angeles. "There was Marion Barry before me. There was O. J. Simpson before me. There was Mike Tyson and Mike Jackson. You may as well call me Mike Tucker."
In response to questions suggesting that some people might interpret the Government's efforts as an attempt to bring down a black official, the chief prosecutor in the case, Nora M. Manella, recently told reporters that her office was "an equal opportunity prosecutor."
In any event, Mr. Tucker's statement that black politicians are targets of unfair prosecution resonates powerfully in this predominantly black city of about 92,000, where he and his family have long commanded respect for championing black causes and for building a potent political machine. Mr. Tucker's father was a former school board member and Councilman who served as Mayor until his death in 1990.
The extent of that power was evident earlier this month outside the courthouse, where Tucker supporters, who include local businessmen and ministers, carried placards saying "Stop Racism" and "Witch Hunt."
The case has attracted not only local but also national attention because of what some blacks see as a pattern of the predominantly white Federal law-enforcement establishment spending time and money prosecuting cases against blacks and members of other minority groups that it might not have pursued against white leaders.
Going back to Adam Clayton Powell Jr., the revered Harlem Congressman who was indicted on charges of tax evasion more than three decades ago, there have been 6 blacks among the 70 members of Congress indicted, according to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington research organization. In other words, about 9 percent of those indicted have been black.
And when Hispanic members of Congress are included, the figure rises to about 15 percent -- in a period when the number of black and Hispanic members of Congress accounted for less than 5 percent of all lawmakers.
Of the black Congressmen, Charles Diggs of Michigan and Mel Reynolds of Chicago were convicted, but the other three, Representatives Harold Ford of Tennessee, Floyd H. Flake of New York and Mr. Powell, were either acquitted or set free after a hung jury.
"Historically, African-Americans have had reason to question the criminal justice system," said Leo Terrell, a black civil rights lawyer in Beverly Hills, Calif. "So it is always reasonable to at least raise the racism issue."
Royce W. Esters, president of the Compton chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, agreed. "They are targeting Compton because there are a lot of black people here," he said. "Every time there is a black person in a high place they try to get them."
Prosecutors will not comment on the evidence they plan to present. But court documents indicate that the investigation videotaped meetings in which Mr. Tucker appeared to take money from an undercover agent with the understanding that he would put certain items on the Compton City Council agenda.
Mr. Tucker and his lawyer have yet to offer any evidence that Federal officials are motivated by racism, except to loudly and repeatedly declare that they know it is true.
"I think that the case will show that I have been targeted, and I am obviously an African-American," Mr. Tucker said in an interview, kneading the air with his fingers. "I can tell you that based on the information I have, the city of Compton, over the years, over the last decade, has been targeted, and the city obviously is one associated with African-American leadership."
He talked at a table in his spacious office in a shopping center here. Hanging on the crowded walls were plaques from civic and political groups praising his community spirit and achievements. Renowned locally as an animated, charismatic speaker, Mr. Tucker was uncharacteristically subdued.
And then, lapsing into the language of the pulpit, Mr. Tucker added: "Even though my enemies have meant this for evil, God has used it for good, and it has strengthened me, it has made me stronger in the Lord. It's made me stronger in my resolve about what my life has meant."
This is not the first time Mr. Tucker has been charged with a crime while in government. An assistant district attorney from 1984 to 1986, he was dismissed after changing the date on a photograph being used as evidence in a narcotics case, reportedly in an attempt to cover up the fact that he had withheld the pictures from the defense. Accused of altering an official document and lying to a judge, he pleaded no contest to misdemeanor charges and did not serve any time in prison.
Despite the tampering charge, Mr. Tucker's political career flourished. In 1991 he was elected Mayor of Compton, succeeding his father. A year later Mr. Tucker survived a bitter Democratic primary fight and was easily elected to Congress. He was re-elected last year.
But Mr. Tucker's rise coincided with a series of scandals. In 1993, Compton became the only school district ever certified by the state as an academic and financial disaster. At about the same time, Patricia Moore, a Tucker family ally and one of the city's most prominent politicians, was indicted on Federal bribery charges.
In recent weeks, the United States Attorney's office appears to have intensified its investigation of city politics. On Aug. 29, Joseph Scraggins, a former owner of a Compton-based construction company, pleaded guilty to conspiring with Mr. Tucker to extort money from a business trying to build a waste-to-energy plant in Compton. Mr. Scraggins also pleaded guilty to filing a false Federal income tax return. Lawyers for Mr. Scraggins have said he would testify at the Tucker trial if subpoenaed.
Three days later, in a potentially even bigger blow to Mr. Tucker's case, Ms. Moore was charged again with bribery. One company from which Ms. Moore is charged with extorting money is Compton Energy Systems, the same business named in Mr. Tucker's case.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST ACCORD: THE OVERVIEW;
ISRAEL AND P.L.O. REACH ACCORD TO TRANSFER WEST BANK AREAS

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Sept. 24

 BODY:
After months of arduous negotiations and a tense last-minute flurry of crises and walkouts, Israel and the Palestinians concluded a major agreement today on transferring control of much of the occupied West Bank to its Arab residents.
With only two and a half hours left before Israel shut down for the celebration of Rosh ha-Shanah, the Jewish New Year, the Israeli Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, and the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Yasir Arafat, finally initialed the 400-page document. The major obstacle they had ovecome was the security arrangements for Hebron, where Jewish settlers live surrounded by Arab residents. 
 Mr. Peres and Mr. Arafat approved the agreement in a brief ceremony this afternoon in Taba, Egypt, a Red Sea resort where the final negotiations took place.
The initialing cleared the way for the agreement to be approved by the Israeli Cabinet on Wednesday, and to be formally signed in a much-postponed ceremony at the White House on Thursday with President Clinton and the leaders of Egypt and Jordan in attendance.
The accord, which capped marathon and often tempestuous negotiations, spells out in detail, step by step and town by town, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from much of the territory Israel has occupied since the 1967 war and the transfer of extensive governing authority to an elected Palestinian Council until a final separation is negotiated by the turn of the century.
Mr. Peres, his voice breaking at moments, said at the ceremony today: "Ladies and gentlemen, let's face it, what we are doing today is not a normal political or economic enterprise; it is history in the real meaning of the word.
"On our side there are many mothers and fathers and children who suffered tremendously, and on the Palestinian side, too, there are many people who paid with their lives, their fortunes, their freedom, and I really feel the Lord has offered us a real opportunity to change the course of hopelessness and desperation and bloodshed into something more promising, more noble, more humane."
Mr. Arafat was somewhat less conciliatory, saying: "On this occasion and from this place I would like to speak to our prisoners, to those who were injured, with greetings, and I assure them that the dawn of freedom is coming. I also greet the families of our martyrs."
His comments were certain to raise the hackles of the Israeli right, since the people the Palestinians call "martyrs" the Israelis call "terrorists."
But the P.L.O. leader, whose name and trademark head covering were synonymous with terrorism only a scant two years ago, also wished the Israelis a happy New Year in Hebrew, "Shanah Tovah," and expressed the hope that the coming year would be a time of real peace between "people of the area."
The agreement came under almost immediate attack from opposition forces on both sides.
"This is a bad agreement for which Israel will pay a heavy price," the conservative Likud Party bloc said in Israel.
In Hebron, which had caused so much strife for negotiators, the Palestinian Mayor, Mustafa Natshe, said the agreement "does not meet the expectations of the people."
Militant Israeli settlers in Hebron vowed to block the agreement from being put into effect.
Inside Israel, the two-day observance of the High Holy Days precluded mass protests. But after that, warned a longtime political commentator, "fasten your seat belt."
Mr. Peres and Mr. Arafat, however, were obviously elated and even emotional at the 20-minute televised ceremony. They had put in about 80 hours of direct negotiations, and spent almost every night of the last week working together in an atmosphere of crisis and suspense.
Hours before the initialing, Mr. Arafat stormed out, shouting, "We are not slaves!" It was the second time he erupted and walked out, and once again he was enticed back to the bargaining table by telephoned appeals from President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and the chief American mediator, Dennis B. Ross.
The accord is the second stage of the process that began when Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Mr. Arafat shook hands on the White House lawn on Sept. 13, 1993. The "Declaration of Principles" they issued then ended 26 years of total estrangement and set a timetable for a permanent disengagement of Arabs and Israelis in the Palestinian lands by the end of the century.
The first stage, initiated in May 1994, established Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and in Jericho in the West Bank. The final stage, which is to begin in May 1996, will be the "permanent-status negotiations" over the fate of Jerusalem, Arab refugees, Jewish settlements and security arrangements.
In many respects, today's agreement was far more complex and politically volatile than the Declaration of Principles, which established only broad and often contradictory guidelines for disengaging two peoples with competing religious, legal and historic claims to the same small patch of land and a history of bloodshed, terror and humiliation.
Immediately after the ceremony, Mr. Arafat departed for Cairo and a tour of Arab capitals, presumably to discuss the agreement, which will not be made public in full until it gets the expected stamp of approval from the Israeli Cabinet.
Within 10 days of the signing, the Israeli Army will begin withdrawing from the population centers of the West Bank -- Jenin, Nablus, Tulkarm, Qalqilya, Ramallah and Bethlehem, as well as 450 towns and villages -- and turning security over to a 12,000-member Palestinian police force.
Arrangements for Hebron, the only West Bank city with Israeli settlements, proved to be the most difficult. The Palestinians demanded that it be treated like all the other cities, while Israel insisted on provisions to protect the 450 Israeli settlers, who believe their presence is biblically ordained.
The compromise was an elaborate plan dividing the city into three zones: one patrolled by Israelis, a second patrolled jointly and the third patrolled by Palestinians, but with Palestinians in overall control of security.
The arrangement also calls for the construction of a special road connecting the Jewish enclaves in the city to a larger settlement outside Hebron.
While the Palestinians will have exclusive control over populated areas, the rest of the West Bank was divided into two more categories: villages and towns where Palestinians will maintain public order and the Israelis will have overall security authority; and Israeli settlements, unpopulated lands and military zones where Israel will have sole control.
According to the agreement, internationally monitored elections for the Palestinian Council will take place 22 days after the Israeli Army finishes withdrawing from populated areas. But since the road in Hebron will take at least six months to build, the elections are not expected until spring.
The Council will have 82 members, but separate elections will be held for the "head of the executive authority," which insures that Mr. Arafat will remain at the head of the interim government.
After the elections, Israeli withdrawal from rural areas would continue at six-month intervals. The Council would remain in power until May 1999, when a final-status agreement is supposed to be ready.
The overlapping security responsibilities and the staged withdrawal enabled both sides to claim major gains. The Palestinians declared that they would gain control over 90 percent of their land within two years, while Mr. Rabin said Israel was immediately surrendering only 30 percent of the territories.
The Israeli right sees the entire process as a surrender of the biblical heritage of the Jews and as a concession to terrorists. Militant West Bank settlers vowed to obstruct the accords at every step, and with Israeli elections now 14 months off, every step of withdrawal is certain to be scrutinized.
Mr. Peres and Mr. Arafat approached the talks with urgency, hoping to secure as much as possible before elections, which could bring a Likud government into power, and presumably halt the process.
Opposition to the peace effort has spread in the last two years because the original agreement in 1993 did not stem terrorist attacks in Israel, as many Israelis had hoped.
Binyamin Netanyahu, the opposition leader, turned on the agreement immediately. "This Government has crossed every red line that it has set for itself and has been blackmailed in a hurried, timid and irresponsible negotiation," he declared. But he stopped short of saying he would not honor the agreements if he came to power, as some colleagues have said.
The National Religious Party accused the Government of "surrendering the land of our forefathers."
Benjamin Begin, a Likud member of Parliament and son of the late Prime Minister Menachem Begin, said: "This is a difficult day for the people of Israel. There's only one word: This is a tragedy."
A statement issued by the "Jewish Community of Hebron" declared that the only armed force it would recognize was the Israeli Army, and that "any foreign armed force within Hebron," Palestinians included, would be regarded "as an enemy force, and will be reacted to accordingly."
In a news conference today, Mr. Rabin seemed more intent on defusing criticism than on hailing the agreement. He reiterated the Labor Party's policy that the final settlement would not return to 1967 boundaries, that Jerusalem would remain united and part of Israel, and that Israel's "security border" would stay at the Jordan River.
"I think we made the right step in the direction of our final goal, which is not 'Greater Israel' as a binational state, but the state of Israel as a Jewish state," he said.
Mr. Arafat also endured considerable pressure during the negotiations, especially from radical Islamic movements and militant Arab opponents.
Within the West Bank, Palestinians feared the effects of the continued presence of settlers and soldiers in Hebron. "No matter how many soldiers are stationed there, they will be seen as a basic injustice and a source of constant friction and violence," said Hanan Ashrawi, one of the early Palestinian negotiators.
In Hebron, Tayfeer Tamimi, a member of the court of sharia or Islamic law, with ties to Hamas, described the settlers as a "time bomb which can explode at any minute."

Chart: "The Peace Accord"
 Main points of the interim Israel-P.L.O. agreement reached yesterday
 
ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL: The West Bank will be divided into three zones: populated areas, from which Israeli troops will withdraw entirely; rural areas, where Palestinians and Israelis will share authority, and exclusively Israeli areas, which include Jewish settlements, military bases and unpopulated areas. Israeli troops are to start withdrawing from populated areas within 10 days of the signing and complete the pullout in about six months.
 
ELECTIONS: The agreement calls for internationally monitored elections to choose an 82-member Palestinian Council from the West Bank and Gaza to be held 22 days after the troops withdraw from populated areas.
 
HEBRON: An Israeli force will remain in the center of Hebron to protect the 450 Israeli settlers there, but the Palestinian police will have overall responsibility for security.
 
PRISONERS: Immediately upon the signing of the agreement, Israel agreed to free all women as well as men who were sick, young, elderly or had completed two-thirds of their sentence. Others would be set free on the eve of elections. Further releases will be discussed later.
 
PALESTINIAN COVENANT: The Palestinians agreed to revoke within two years articles of the Palestinian Covenant calling for the destruction of Israel.
 
NATURAL RESOURCES: Israel pledged to increase the Palestinians' share of West Bank water and to join a search for new resources.
 
SACRED SITES: Jews will be guaranteed freedom of access to Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem and Joseph's Tomb in Nablus, while the the Tomb of Abraham in Hebron, which is also sacred to Muslims as the Ibrahimi Mosque, will remain as is, with separate times of worship enforced by Israeli forces. (pg. A6)
 
Chronology: Major dates in moves toward Palestinian autonomy:
 
June 5-11, 1967 -- In a war with its Arab neighbors, Israel seizes the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinian-populated areas held by Jordan and Egypt, respectively, since 1948. The Arab sector of Jerusalem is annexed.

HEADLINE: Tidy Up a Wilderness, or Leave It in Natural Tatters?

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: WANAKENA, N.Y., Sept. 21

 BODY:
On July 15, the sky fell on a large swatch of the Adirondack Park -- almost literally.
A 20-mile-wide wave of thundering black clouds and hurricane gusts roared from the west. In a few minutes, the freak storm steamrolled a Rhode Island-sized triangle of the vast mosaic of wilderness and private land, focusing its power on the Five Ponds Wilderness Area south of this hamlet. Microbursts like great fists of air punched down forests and houses, killing four campers and a motorist. 
 Two months later, the dead are long buried and houses repaired. But state officials, environmentalists, timber companies and landowners are locked in debate over what to do, or not do, with the tens of millions of toppled or tottering trees across 125,000 acres, an area six times the size of Manhattan.
Do you cut the risk of forest fire by sending in timber companies to harvest the fallen trees and sell them? Or do you leave the logs to rot and nourish new forest growth?
Answering these questions poses a subtle political test for Gov. George E. Pataki, who finds himself caught between Adirondacks environmentalists and members of his own administration.
State officials, with memories of the Long Island wildfire still fresh, fear the fallen timber could fuel another huge forest fire. But forest ecologists counter that bringing chain saws and logging trucks onto public parkland would threaten a century-old, constitutionally guaranteed effort to restore the forest to its primeval splendor.
Whatever the Pataki administration decides, the debate has drawn outsiders' attention to the extraordinary extent of the destruction.
Bernard Siskavich, a state forest ranger based here, saw the wilderness from a helicopter after the storm and was one of the first to grasp the almost supernatural scope of what had happened.
"It went on and on, everything was flattened," he said. In 21 years as a ranger, he said, he'd seen blowdowns in "isolated spots, 30 or 40 yards, once in a while, but I've never seen anything like this."
Since then, it has become clear that the storm's destruction dwarfed anything since Hurricane Hazel swept inland in November 1950, knocking down more than 400,000 acres of Adirondack trees.
The 900,000 acres affected far exceed the scale of the state's more recent -- and widely reported -- natural disaster, the wildfire that scorched 6,000 acres of pitch pine on Long Island.
There are arguments about what to do about the damage on private timber holdings within the park, but the most intense debate is focused on the blowdowns in state-owned forest preserves like the Five Ponds Wilderness.
These tracts were deemed forever wild under the State Constitution a century ago, in the hope they would recover from voracious logging in the 1800's.
As a result, some forest ecologists are saying that any salvage effort would be unconstitutional.
"The state lands were set aside specifically to let the landscape return to primeval forest after the devastating logging of yesteryear," said Dr. Edward Ketchledge, an ecologist who has studied the Adirondack wilderness for 50 years and is on a panel of scientists advising state environmental officials. "This essential concept cannot be lost in the immediacy of our public concern for all this timber that's down."
This week, after several public meetings, the State Department of Environmental Conservation convened a group of environmentalists, scientists, timber industry representatives and spokesmen for private landowners to plan a response to the damage.
In one indication of the passions at work, the gathering was told that the department had just received an anonymous phone call warning that some of the old trees in the Five Ponds region had been spiked -- the radical environmentalists' practice of driving spikes or other material into tree trunks so that chain saws or mill blades biting into them would be destroyed.
Michael D. Zagata, the department's Commissioner, said in an interview that by the end of October the state would have a plan that protects the public from fire and preserves the sanctity of the park. He said that salvage of timber remains an option, and that the fire risk is serious.
But even if state officials decided that timber salvage was warranted, and even if the Attorney General's office determined that such an emergency harvest did not violate the Constitution, some environmentalists said they would challenge it in court.
"If they start up a chain saw, this is a potential nightmare for the administration," said William Cook, a lobbyist in Albany for the Citizens Campaign for the Environment. "This all comes back to Governor Pataki."
The debate over how to handle damaged trees on private land is only slightly less intense. Within the 6 million-acre park, 3.5 million acres, including many commercial timber stands, are privately owned.
After surveying the landowners, the Empire State Forest Products Association estimated that $2.7 million worth of timber was damaged or felled by the storm and should be quickly harvested. Kevin King, executive vice president of the association, a lobbying group, said, "Mother Nature has done quite a bit of clearcutting."
Several environmentalists said they understood the landowners' need to salvage the downed wood before rot, staining or insect damage spoiled its value. What some environmental groups have objected to is a state plan to issue a blanket permit that would allow landowners with damaged forest to clearcut large holdings -- damaged and healthy trees alike -- without any direct oversight.
If approved by the Adirondack Park Agency's commissioners, as environmentalists expect, the permits would sanction what amounts to "mail-order clearcutting," said John F. Sheehan, a spokesman for the Adirondack Council, a private environmental group.
The draft permit says a property owner may harvest "all trees, whether damaged or not," where he finds that one out of three trees is damaged. The owner would be able to start cutting immediately and could send in a map and other paperwork as late as next February. No inspection by state workers would take place unless a damaged area was in wetlands, and then a permit could be issued on the spot.
The 11 commissioners, 3 of whom are new appointees of Gov. George E. Pataki, are to return any final comments to agency staff by Monday.
Mr. Cook, the environmental lobbyist, said that if the commissioners did not make the permit more restrictive, it would be a clear sign that the new appointments had shifted the Park Agency to a markedly pro-development stance.
"The primary goal here is to maintain the integrity of the forest," Mr. Cook said. "We're talking about tens of thousands of acres that are potentially going to go under the saw."
Overall, though, he and other environmentalists agreed, their primary concern remained areas like the Five Ponds Wilderness.
Five Ponds is prized by scientists because its heart, a 50,000-acre melange of beech, sugar maple, white pine, hemlock and red spruce trees, has never felt the bite of ax or saw.
This is thought to be the largest remaining tract of old-growth forest in the Northeast, said Dr. Charles D. Canham, a plant ecologist at the Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y., who has been conducting research in the Five Ponds area for more than a decade.
It is a unique living laboratory, Dr. Canham said. The idea that the state would sanction salvage there, he said, was appalling. "I'm just flabbergasted that we're even having to go through this debate," Dr. Canham said. "It is no less wild a wilderness because some of the trees blew down."
In interviews, several Adirondack residents from various spheres suggested finding a middle course: salvaging some fallen trees to create a buffer against wildfire, but letting the rest lie where it is.
The timber industry appears to be leery of harvesting the windfall on state preserve land because timber prices, already low, would be further depressed by the glut of wood. Addressing the issue, a recent editorial in a logging-industry magazine, Northern Logger and Timber Processor, was simply titled, "Let It Rot."
From a logger's point of view, it is danger, not economics, that would make such a salvage operation unwise. Lawrence Goodyear, a logger for Dumac Forestry Services with 25 years of experience cutting trees, said his main concern in a full-scale salvage operation would be the extreme hazard to workers.
Standing next to a small hill of stumps and shattered trunks that had been hauled out to the roadside from around Star Lake, Mr. Goodyear described how trees that are bent but still rooted can suddenly spring up, flinging a chain saw back at the cutter.
Trees leaning on others never fall where you want them, he said, adding, "Us guys shudder at that kind of stuff. It's just not worth it."
Among state forestry officials, the fear of fire dominates other considerations. Lieut. Daniel Walsh, a spokesman for the Environmental Conservation Department's Bureau of Fire, said the chaotic piles of tree trunks and branches amount to as much as 150 tons of fuel per acre in some places. The Long Island blazes last summer fed on a fifth as much fuel.
Calling the moist woods of the Adirondacks "asbestos forests" for their fire-resistant qualities, several conservationists pointed out that few fires followed the great blowdown of 1950.
But the conservationists ultimately all fall back on the original intent of Article 14 of the State Constitution. "It couldn't be any clearer," said Mr. Sheehan, who recited an excerpt: "The lands of the state... shall be forever kept as wild forest lands... Nor shall the timber thereon be sold, removed or destroyed."
Any interference in the short term would prove to be a mistake in the long run, said Bill McKibben, an Adirondack resident whose new book, "Hope, Human and Wild," describes the recovery of the region after more than a century of clearcutting.
"The forest preserves here are the longest running experiment anywhere in the world in the idea of ecosystem recovery," Mr. McKibben said. "It would be very sad to mess with that experiment, especially since it's working so well."

Russian Economy May Be On the Verge of Growth
For the first time since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the Russian economy may be on the brink of growing. All the signs point this way: inflation is down, the country's budget deficit is under control -- and its central bank has ceased the practice of printing rubles whenever it needed to prop up factories and farms, meaning that the ruble is for the most part holding its value.
While all these signs are encouraging, the economic and political atmospheres remain volatile, threatening stability -- and economists report a growing gap between the rich and poor. [Page A1.]
 
At NBC, Generation X Generates $
While the president of NBC Entertainment would have you believe that the network wants to appeal to all segments -- read, ages -- of the population, his actions tell otherwise. NBC has annointed three young programmers, including 31-year-old Jamie McDermott, left, to run mini-networks of their own. Shepherding such shows as "Friends," "E.R." and "Hope and Gloria," the programmers have been a blessing to the network, which leads all three networks by a wide margin in ratings among relatively young adults with household incomes greater than $60,000 -- a segment that advertisers are willing to pay a premium to reach. [D7.]
 
A Force to Contend With, Again
Ken Olsen, the founder of the Digital Equipment Corporation, is back. At 69, Mr. Olsen, who was forced to resign from Digital in 1992 after the company suffered heavy losses, is competing with Andersen Consulting, E.D.S., and I.B.M. to help businesses modernize their computer systems. He believes corporations would do well to impose the same discipline on networks of PC's that they reserve for their mainframe and minicomputers. [D5.]
 
Janet Jackson Does the Impossible
Thanks to video technology, the singer finds herself running across the arms of the statue of Christ in Rio de Janeiro and sitting on top of the Easter Island monuments -- even though she never left the airplane hangar in California where she taped the video for her latest single, "Runaway." By imposing Ms. Jackson's image into two-dimensional photographs of the locales, the production studio Hollywood Digital spent one-fourth of what it would have spent traveling to the locations shown in the video. And those savings don't even take into consideration the idea of hoisting the pop rock star to the heavenly heights she appears to roam in Rio. [D7.]
 
San Francisco Examiner in Flux
The Hearst Corporation, which owns the 108-year-old evening paper in San Francisco, is reportedly in talks to close The Examiner and take over management of The San Francisco Chronicle -- the city's bigger, morning newspaper. Since 1965, the papers have operated jointly, sharing printing, distribution and other business operations. But they have maintained separate editorial staffs. They have split profits, or losses, too. For the current year, losses are estimated to be $10 million to $12 million. Both newspapers have been losing circulation, with The Chronicle down to 110,000. [D8.]
 
Former Intel Engineer Arrested
The F.B.I. arrested William Gaede, charging the former Intel software engineer with mail fraud and interstate transportation of stolen property. The Federal crimes of which Mr. Gaede is accused are related to the theft of millions of dollars worth of production secrets for Intel's Pentium microprocessor. [D2.]

HEADLINE: In Hungary,Pataki Gets Treatment Of a Star

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: NYIRBATOR, Hungary, Sept. 24

 BODY:
The 14-car motorcade that raced through the narrow streets of this rural village today, blocking traffic and forcing cars off the road, signaled the arrival of a foreign dignitary. And in this case, the lanky and slightly rumpled man who alighted from the black limousine was indeed a chief of state, namely New York's Gov. George E. Pataki.
Wearing a blue blazer and white pants and looking like a candidate primed for the campaign trail, Mr. Pataki beamed broadly as he strode toward a whitewashed 17th-century church for morning mass, shaking hands and greeting parishioners in his halting Hungarian. 
 Mr. Pataki is perhaps more revered in his ancestor's homeland than in New York State, where to some constituents he remains an elusive and, according to polls, not entirely beloved figure. Today, his first full day in Hungary, showed how popular he had become in parts of this nation of 10 million.
As he watched Mr. Pataki sign prayer books here, one admiring parishioner, Hernadi Istvan, said: "All Hungarian people watched him during the campaign last year. Here, people are very proud. He is Governor, after all, of the biggest state in America."
The official pomp and lavish news coverage that greeted him here contrasts sharply with his low-keyed and often-low-profiled style of Governorship. Often overshadowed at home by New York City's combative Mayor and New Jersey's popular Governor, Mr. Pataki has been accorded all the attention of a rising political and media star in Hungary, where his father's parents were born.
He is scheduled to hold private meetings with the Foreign Minister, the Prime Minister and the President. He will address Parliament. On his first two nights here, he has been the subject of two documentaries shown on national television, was the lead item on Budapest evening newscasts and made the front pages of several major newspapers.
And as he has toured the eastern farming region near the Ukrainian border where many of his relatives still live, an entourage of 20 Hungarian security officers, drivers, Foreign Ministry officials and translators has attended his every need while being trailed by a gaggle of local and American reporters.
All this for someone who has limited power to do the many things that Hungarians want of him, specifically, increase foreign aid, improve trade with the West, spur investment by American companies and help Hungary win a place in NATO.
Asked about the nation's interest in Mr. Pataki, which began during last year's Gubernatorial campaign, Hungarians talk of the Governor as a symbol of emigre political success for a nation that, as Mr. Pataki himself put it, has "lost every single political enterprise they've been involved in" for the last 1,000 years.
Krisztina Wiedemann, a teacher and radio reporter from Budapest, said: "I don't know why it is. Maybe because it's very strange to us that somebody of Hungarian origin can get such good status in America."
Mr. Pataki, 50, is visiting Hungary for four days with his wife, Libby; their eldest son, Theodore; his mother, Margaret, and six aides on a trip financed by the Hungarian Government and Hungarian-American businessmen. Mr. Pataki, who is a quarter Italian, also plans to visit Italy for three days later this week.
Though he will be meeting with Hungarian officials and business leaders to talk about increasing business with New York, Mr. Pataki acknowledged that his main goal was to find the birthplaces of his grandparents and long-lost relatives.
Throughout northeastern Hungary, a poor agricultural region, officials have spent recent weeks poring through archives searching for evidence of the Governor's ancestors, hoping that he would show greater interest in them if they did. In two towns, Debrecen and Kisvarda, the mayors sadly presented Mr. Pataki elaborately researched family trees that came up blank with Pataki ancestors. Both vowed to keep searching.
But in Aranyosapati, a rural village of 2,100 where his father's parents lived, Mr. Pataki hit a gold mine of cousins. Several hundred people lined the streets and climbed fences to get a glimpse of him this morning. And as Mr. Pataki strode into the throng, one after another announced that he or she was a relative.
A man in a lavender shirt said they were second cousins. An old woman with no top teeth proclaimed herself a Pataki. An elegantly dressed 81-year-old man in a black fedora said he was a distant cousin, adding, "We have the same nose." Mr. Pataki bear hugged them all.
After receiving a wooden box containing a vial of water from the Tisza River and soil from a farm, Mr. Pataki told the gathering: "It's just extremely moving to look around at the crowd and see the faces and know so many of you are relatives of mine. I can tell because the women are all beautiful and the men are all handsome."
It was neither the first nor last time the Governor sounded as if he was schmoozing on the stump. When local officials complained he was spending too little time with them, he pledged, as he constantly did on last year's campaign, "I will be back." And when Hungarian reporters asked him what he would specifically do to help the local economy, he artfully dodged the question by saying, "I have some ideas that we'll be talking to Hungarian officials about. But nothing we can discuss now."
Indeed, much of the trip has had a hurly-burly campaign quality to it. He visited a Bosnian refugee camp in Debrecen for all of 15 minutes. Even at his grandparents' village of Aranyosapati, he was scheduled to stay only 35 minutes. When Mr. Pataki insisted on walking along the Tisza River where his grandfather liked to swim, an argument ensued with his time-conscious hosts. Finally, Zenia Mucha, Mr. Pataki's press spokeswoman, shouted, "The Governor wants to go, O.K.?" They drove Mr. Pataki to the river.
Mr. Pataki said the apple orchards of Aranyosapati, the distinctive regional dialect and even the way the farmers piled their hay reminded him of the Peekskill farm where he grew up. "This is where I want to be," he said, looking at sunflower fields. "Budapest is not where I want to be."
Asked whether he would stay in touch with his newly discovered cousins, Mr. Pataki jokingly suggested that some could come to America and work for the state. "We might be able to hire more people in my family than in Joe Bruno's," he said, referring to the Senate majority leader who has put several relatives on the state payroll.
Like their American counterparts, Hungarian reporters have pressed Mr. Pataki to reveal details about his life. One asked how he got to be so tall (he is 6-foot-4). "Magyar blood and good American food," Mr. Pataki replied. Another wondered whether he had favorite Hungarian dishes. Stuffed cabbage, he said. And several asked him to say something in Hungarian.
To one, Mr. Pataki answered in Hungarian, "I can speak only a little in Hungarian, and I'm very sorry about that. I'm quite tired right now and can remember that when I was young I could speak more Hungarian, but it is a big effort to do right now."
Asked to translate, a Hungarian radio reporter said, "I'll have to listen to my tape. His grammar is, um, not perfect."

HEADLINE: Staking Claim in Alternative Software on the Internet

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif.

 BODY:
James Gosling wants to make the computer software world safe for diversity.
In his view, and in the view of many other people in the industry, the software giant Microsoft is close to crowding out all its competition. 
 "As far as the software business goes, Microsoft has become like death and taxes," said Mr. Gosling, the 40-year-old software wizard who is the mastermind behind the Java language. He contends that Sun Microsystems, by distributing Java freely over the Internet, will create an alternative software world that Microsoft will be unable to dominate.
A Canadian who came to the United States to attend graduate school at Carnegie Mellon University in the late 1970's, Mr. Gosling had been a hacker from the days he discovered computers while hanging around at the University of Calgary at age 13.
He had always been an electronics tinkerer. "I was always interested in building things, but in order to build things you have to have parts," he said. Software, whose parts are just digital ones and zeros, liberated him.
The Java programming language is Mr. Gosling's second effort at transforming computing with a software design that permits programs to operate over computer networks. The first project, which he began shortly after arriving at Sun in 1984, was known as NEWS, or Network Extensible Windowing System. The idea -- radical at the time -- was to enable any computer screen on a network to display a program running on any other computer on the network.
While NEWS never caught on as a commercial product, it did demonstrate the potential for distributing computer-processing power across a network. And it helped pave the way for today's so-called client/server computer networks, in which a network of desktop client computers can share programs that run on centrally located server machines.
"He has skills of making code very compact and very fast," said David Rosenthal, a software designer who joined Mr. Gosling's NEWS project after initial skepticism.
Despite its technical success, the commercial failure of NEWS taught Mr. Gosling some valuable lessons. So did the near-failure of Java, which Mr. Gosling began working on as a secret project in 1991. Conceived as a programming language for interactive television and the consumer electronics industry, the Java project was originally called Oak and was at the heart of Sun's attempt to create software for set-top television controllers.
"We got seduced by the dark side of interactive television," he said.
But by mid-1994, as the industry hype over interactive television was deflated by economic realities and a realization that neither the audiences nor the technology was ready for prime time, Sun and Mr. Gosling steered Java toward the Internet's World Wide Web -- where most of the real "information highway" action was starting to take place.
Even if Java takes off and becomes an Internet standard, Sun Microsystems may receive little direct financial benefit, Mr. Gosling acknowledges, since most people will be getting it free. But indirectly, the overall growth of the Internet is a boon for Sun, whose network server computers are the most popular way for companies, agencies and universities to connect to the global computing web. "Anything that contributes to the health of the Internet contributes to Sun's health as well," Mr. Gosling said.

HEADLINE: Argentine Economic Chief Seems Safe in Job, for Now

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Sept. 24

 BODY:
After weeks of mounting speculation that dismissal was imminent for Finance Minister Domingo Cavallo, the architect of this country's economic stability, it appears that he is keeping his job, at least for now.
Mr. Cavallo, whose bright star has dimmed lately as Argentina endures a stubborn recession and record unemployment, departed on Friday on a mission to Europe and the United States to convince international investors that he is still at the helm of Argentina's economy, which he maintains is fundamentally strong, despite current hard times. He will be visiting bankers and investors in New York on Wednesday. 
 "I will continue as Finance Minister because the President wants me to stay and because we still have a lot of unfinished work to do in reforming this economy," Mr. Cavallo said in an interview recently. "Those who want to take me out of office want to change the policies that we are pursuing, but the financial markets understand that and have reacted accordingly."
Indeed, there have been widespread calls in recent weeks within the administration of President Carlos Saul Menem and his Peronist party for Mr. Cavallo's ouster, particularly after his public accusation that a "mafia" was working inside and outside the Government to undermine his economic policies.
As rumors spread that Mr. Cavallo was on his way out, financial markets here took a beating, with investors assuming that the Menem Government was shifting away from the policies that have brought growth and stability to an economy once plagued by hyperinflation, corruption and inefficiencies. After several days of silence, Mr. Menem publicly endorsed Mr. Cavallo, saying that there would be no change in finance ministers.
But for many economists and bankers here, the issue is not whether Mr. Cavallo will step down, but rather when he will depart and under what circumstances.
"We do not discard the possibility that Cavallo could resign in the immediate future, but we think that it's very unlikely," said Raul H. Buonuome, an economist for Baring Securities Argentina S.A. "We believe that Cavallo will leave his post in an agreement with Menem sometime before 1997."
Most economists and bankers interviewed here said they doubted that Mr. Cavallo would step down soon because such a move would cause havoc in the financial markets and lead to a flight of foreign capital similar to the one after the Mexican currency crisis in December.
Indeed, Mr. Cavallo, a former economics professor, has a good rapport with foreign investors, and through road shows like the one he began over the weekend, the minister has almost singlehandedly convinced investors that Argentina is not another Mexico.
"The feelings of the market is that it's difficult to find a qualified substitute for Cavallo because you need a very strong and capable person to keep the economic policies on schedule," said Mario Vicens, an economist for Macroeconomica, a firm that advises international investors.
Mr. Vicens said investors were generally pleased with Mr. Cavallo's initial policy moves, including opening markets to foreign competition, privatizing state businesses and instituting a currency exchange system that pegs the peso tightly to the dollar on a one-to-one basis.
These policies have reduced inflation to 4 percent from more than 5,000 percent in 1989, while fostering economic and industrial growth of 6 to 9 percent, until a sudden recession this year after the Mexico crisis.
Despite his introduction of policies that have stabilized the economy, Mr. Cavallo has remained unpopular within the Peronist movement, especially among old-liners, perhaps because he has been mentioned as a presidential candidate in 1999.
Eduardo Duhalde, the Governor of Buenos Aires province and a leading candidate to succeed Mr. Menem, and Jorge Blance Villegas, head of the Argentine Industrial Union, have accused Mr. Cavallo of opening the economy too quickly to international competition and blamed the minister's policies for the country's record 18.6 percent unemployment.
As Mr. Cavallo tries to institute the next round of changes in the banking and health care systems, among provincial governments, in labor laws and in the judiciary, he is encountering broad opposition from Peronists who say he is going too far.
Investors and economists said that the new round of changes isnecessary to continue to attract foreign investment; Argentina desperately needs foreign capital to spur growth and meet its debt payments.
Meanwhile, Argentina continues to suffer through a recession, set off by the Mexico crisis. Many economists expect there will be no growth this year. The Economy Ministry, which initially forecast 3 percent growth for 1995, now says that growth will be about 1 percent, compared with 6.5 percent last year.
The ministry says unemployment is not expected to improve until the second quarter of 1996, after changes that reduce the cost of labor are expected to take effect.
But Argentina's trade balance is improving: in the first seven months of the year there was a surplus of $1.2 billion, compared with a deficit of $3.2 billion in the similar 1994period. Exports were up 42 percent, to $12.5 billion, and imports were down 6 percent, to $11.3 billion.
"If I have to leave for health reasons or because I am tired or sick or have to accept another responsibility, there should be no problem at all with somebody else coming in and taking over my office," Mr. Cavallo said. "But the question is not whether only Cavallo can do these reforms. The question is what is the interpretation in the markets of Cavallo leaving."

HEADLINE: Patents;
An inventor sees a future in which energy will be generated by turbines sitting on the ocean floor.

BYLINE: By Sabra Chartrand 

 BODY:
FOR thousands of years, inventive farmers and merchants have harnessed nature's energy to help ease their workload. Greek poetry from 85 B.C. praised the water wheel for freeing women from grinding corn by hand. Ninth-century Arabic writings described wind-driven grain mills; records referred to similar designs at work in 13th-century China. Those early power plants led to the tower windmills that sprung up across Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries.
Windmills and water wheels eventually gave way to steam engines. But now a New York City inventor says he has patented machinery that will harness currents of a different kind. Bogumil Kumbatovic says flexible turbines submerged offshore will extract cheap, clean energy from ocean waves. 
 Mr. Kumbatovic imagines America's coasts dotted with his design for a turbine mounted on four hydraulic legs embedded in the ocean floor. The hydraulics are used to maneuver the turbine so it can adapt to the waves as they change direction. Each turbine consists of a tank surrounded by paddle boards, belts and rollers. A turning drum at the front of the tank acts as a pulley. A set of belts connects it to an electric generator. Electricity is produced when a wave hits the paddles and rotates the turning drum and the pulleys.
Mr. Kumbatovic believes that flexibility sets his design apart from other water "mills."
"The equipment has a slideable base which moves forward and backward by means of hydraulic cylinders," he said. "This allows the system to keep individual waves circulating within the power generating system for a longer period of time, extracting maximum energy from each wave."
And that, he said, also makes his design more durable than other inventions that used the ocean to generate power.
"Previous attempts failed because they couldn't withstand the ocean's destructive waves," Mr. Kumbatovic added. "This system's hydraulics allow the entire equipment to be moved up and down with the changing tides and the height of oncoming waves."
Though he has not tested his design with a working prototype, Mr. Kumbatovic is convinced that a turbine sitting in waves that are at least three feet high and traveling at 6.6 feet a second would produce 420 kilowatts of power. But huge numbers of his invention would have to be deployed to replace just a part of existing power sources.
"The U.S. utilities currently have 109 nuclear power plants in operation, which supply about 21 percent of the nation's electricity," Mr. Kumbatovic wrote in a report describing his invention's impact on energy use. "To replace this power capacity with ocean-power units would require installation of 129,762 units, and the cost of all of these units would be approximately $73 billion."
That would still be less, Mr. Kumbatovic said, than the total for nuclear plants, which cost several billion dollars each.
"The economical advantage of these ocean-power units could be perfectly utilized on an island such as Maui, Hawaii," Mr. Kumbatovic said. In addition to its coastal uses, he said his machinery could be adapted for installation on the side of a ship, where it could produce energy from waves rolling by. Mr. Kumbatovic received patent 5,311,064.

A Hardware System For Added Security
Hackers, clumsy children or insidious viruses may be stymied by a newly patented security system that uses the idle programming power in a hard-drive controller to limit or deny access to computer files. Owners can program the security system to make files "read only" or inaccessible. The only way to change the security instructions is with a key.
David Reardon, a founder of Kinetic Enterprises in Springfield, Ill., says his invention means parents can allow children to play computer games without worrying that business files will be erased, or colleagues can exchange software without fear of introducing computer viruses into a hard drive.
"Every computer has a main processor," Mr. Reardon said. "One of the present security problems is that all programming and decision-making emanates from there. But there is another programming device, the hard-drive controller. We can use the intelligence of that device and make a separate program for security."
Controllers are programmed by the manufacturer to regulate access to the tracks in a hard drive. Mr. Reardon's invention adds programming that tells the controller to restrict certain tracks -- so that they can be viewed but not manipulated.
"Kids can run games," Mr. Reardon said. But not they cannot "delete, erase or write on the files," he added.
"The security parameters are fixed in the controller and it will ignore commands in the central processing unit which violate the security parameters," he said.
Those security instructions can only be changed after a key or magnetic card has been inserted into a lock on the computer. He admitted that his system might be cumbersome for large companies with numerous computers where someone would have to be responsible for a lot of keys. But he said the key would keep hackers from defeating the controller's programming.
"All software-based security functions that operate through the central processing unit can be defeated by more clever software designers or programmers," Mr. Reardon said. "Software can defeat software. So we created a physical hardware device that cannot be emulated by software or outsmarted.
"This would not replace a security shell," he added, "but would become the bedrock which protects that security shell from being altered, challenged or spied on."
He said the system might also be used to detect viruses, or to determine if someone was trying to break into restricted files.
"If you ran a program with a computer virus on it and the hard drive was instructed to read only, the computer would refuse the program and flag it," he said. "It can also lock up the system completely and refuse to respond to requests to look at the hard drive."
Mr. Reardon hopes to license his patent, 5,434,562, to a computer hardware manufacturer.

Don't Call It Welfare Reform

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
I keep wondering who would be helped by the so-called welfare reform legislation that has so much support in Congress and with the public.
I keep coming up with the same answer. No one. 
 The bill that passed the Senate last week (even harsher legislation has been approved by the House) would hurt many people, would kill some and would help no one.
Robin Toner, reporting in The Times on passage of the Senate bill, said that a "shaken and sad" Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Democratic floor leader during the debate and one of the very few senators to vote against the bill, had "pleaded for order as the voting was under way, but a celebratory atmosphere took hold."
Millionaires celebrating the stomping of the poor.
Joel F. Handler, a professor at the U.C.L.A. School of Law and one of the country's foremost experts on welfare, spoke last week about the potential consequences of "reform."
"You can deny welfare for childless adults, the homeless, people like that. They'll drift around and die slowly under the bridges, out of sight. But if you become too drastic in cutting welfare for families, if you do it too suddenly, then they will begin showing up at shelters, and then you have no choice but to do something about the children."
Believe it or not, that's the good news. At least the homeless and hungry children will be visible. The bad news is that the remedies for destitute families tend to be public shelters, hotels, foster care -- a mix of programs that is more degrading and much more expensive than welfare.
The politicians who are so hot for this "reform" insist that it is all about making people responsible for themselves, making them work. The insufferable Phil Gramm likes to talk about people riding in the wagon while others do all the pulling. I refer the Senator to page 85 of Professor Handler's new book, "The Poverty of Welfare Reform."
Mr. Handler writes: "The evidence over time is both consistent and persuasive that the vast majority of welfare recipients do not lack a work ethic. Empirical work demonstrates, as we have seen, that, against considerable odds, the majority of welfare recipients work while they are on welfare, trying over and over to find and keep jobs, and that, in fact, the majority do leave welfare through work."
He quotes the sociologist Kathleen Harris: "Parents rely on welfare simply because they cannot find jobs that pay enough to support their families."
That is the problem in a nutshell. But year after year, in a chronic denial of reality, legislators insist on attaching meaningless work requirements to welfare bills. The Senate bill passed last week has a provision that requires 50 percent of welfare recipients to be working by the year 2000.
"Well, that's nonsense," said Mr. Handler. "The jobs aren't there."
In his book, he cited a 1989 analysis of job opportunities in New York City that focused on needy people who wanted living-wage jobs. The study found that there were 770,000 economically disadvantaged adults and only 57,000 job vacancies.
The problem is not welfare; it's poverty. It's the absence of work, not the refusal to work. It's the growing inability of this society to provide meaningful employment for those citizens who want to work -- as the middle class is finding out through harsh experience.
That is the problem, and neither the legislators nor the citizens who are so anxious to punish the poor for being poor have a clue as to what to do about it. To get a sense of just how clueless the politicians are, consider that the Republicans in Congress are trying to reverse President Clinton's expansion of the earned-income tax credit for the working poor.
This program helps keep working people off welfare. If President Clinton's expansion of the earned-income tax credit were allowed to remain in place, it would result by 1996 in moving about 1.4 million families -- working families -- above the poverty level.
But no. That would make too much sense. The effort now is to scale it back. The current Congress is loath to resist any effort to whack the poor. It's for their own good, you know. Suffering builds character. And if there's anything politicians know about, it's character.

HEADLINE: Lessons From California

 BODY:
California, that harbinger of so many fads and fashions, is now a laboratory for the hardship that can result from years of refusing to face up to fiscal realities. Los Angeles County faces enormous cutbacks in health and other services, although the immediate threat that dozens of health clinics would be shut down was eased last week with President Clinton's announcement of an emergency aid package.
Orange County, the wealthy neighbor to the south, is in actual bankruptcy, and is trying to bail itself out by raiding funds vital to preserving its bus system and infrastructure. The state government, itself awash in debt and deficits, is unable to help southern Californians avoid shredding the social safety net. 
 The disastrous economic recession of the last several years has been a major factor in California's troubles. But heedless tax-cutting without corresponding service cuts has greatly magnified the budget problems. Since the tax revolt of the 1970's that led to Proposition 13, which arbitrarily froze real estate tax rates, the state has nurtured the lethal idea that public services could be maintained without anyone paying for them. This mentality plunged the state and many of its local governments into debt, some of it covert, as they borrowed from various government reserve and pension funds or issued bonds, notes, warrants and other debt instruments to pay operating bills.
Like New York and many other states, California and its localities have been strangled in recent years by the soaring costs of health and welfare programs and prisons (as a result of tough new crime laws). Education costs have gone up as well because, in the late 1980's, voters approved an amendment to the state's Constitution requiring the state to spend a fixed portion of its budget on education and protect local school districts from the increased costs of enrollment growth and inflation.
As budget deficits deepened, Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature borrowed to meet expenses and raided various reserve funds set aside for special purposes. Since Proposition 13, for instance, the state has taken over the collection of property taxes from all local governments and districts. Pressed to meet the new requirements on school spending, state officials simply siphoned money away from funds that had been earmarked for counties. Such actions have compounded the problems facing Orange and Los Angeles Counties now.
Since declaring bankruptcy earlier this year, Orange County has faced the extraordinary problem of paying off $1.7 billion it lost gambling in the high-risk derivatives market. After county voters rejected a tax increase, the Legislature helped it assemble a package of cuts in bus service and spending to maintain harbors, parks, flood control and other infrastructure. Such steps will produce the money, but at a potentially large cost for repairs down the road.
Los Angeles County asked Sacramento for the right to raise taxes on cigarettes and to be freed from some costly state mandates. But the county is widely seen among Republicans in Sacramento as a den of wasteful spending. Governor Wilson, anxious to cover his conservative flank as he runs for President, rejected the idea of any tax hike, or even authorizing the county to carry out the deed.
At a time when the call in Washington is for cutting budgets, California offers a cautionary tale. No one is denying the need for making economies in government spending. But Californians are entering a new era of reductions in the entire scope of government that poses a genuine peril to public safety and well-being. Harsh limits on government spending will carry consequences that must be documented and debated in the years to come.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. in Michigan Basks In the Spotlight of Success

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: MACKINAC ISLAND, Mich., Sept. 24

 BODY:
As he rode the ferry over here shortly after dawn on Saturday, Senator Arlen Specter, a candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, fumed over rumors that he had been denied a room at the island's Grand Hotel, packed this weekend with Michigan Republicans attending their biennial conference and auditioning five Presidential aspirants.
"We didn't even try," Mr. Specter said, offering an explanation for staying at a mainland Best Western that he would make later in his speech to the Republicans. "We got in too late for the last ferry." 
 That the tale of the stiff-arming of the Pennsylvania Senator was widely and somewhat proudly exchanged by Republicans here testifies to the state party's delighted sense of its surging power.
Seven years ago, Michigan's Republicans were in disarray, with one leader predicting no statewide victories for 20 years. But this weekend, a record number of Republican leaders -- almost 2,000 district chairmen, state legislators, members of Congress and other party faithful -- turned out for the 21st Biennial Republican Leadership Conference on this resort island at the confluence of Lakes Huron and Michigan. They soaked up praise from candidates who fell over one another lauding the state organization and its chief, Gov. John Engler, for showing Washington the way on tax cuts, welfare changes and budgetary prudence.
Michigan Republicans find their organization taking center stage at a time when Republicans nationwide, having increased their majorities in legislatures and statehouses, are determined to win back the White House in 1996. So Michigan was thrilled to take the Presidential candidates, if not the campaign spotlight, away from New Hampshire for a weekend.
"They are pandering, aren't they?" Mark VandenBerge, a Republican from Grand Rapids, said with glee of the visiting candidates. "It's a real courtship thing that's going on." The reason, he said, was clear: with a few exceptions at the top of the state party, "Everyone else is still on the fence."
Many here would prefer Governor Engler to the declared candidates, who repeatedly promised to do little more than what they said he had done. "I want to do for America what John Engler has done for Michigan," Senator Phil Gramm of Texas said in his speech to the conference.
Among the visitors here, Speaker Newt Gingrich drew the most passionate response from the crowd. And though he was not among the announced candidates, the Georgia Congressman enthusiastically joined the hallelujah chorus today. "We really are the Engler Revolution in the U.S. House of Representatives," he said.
In independent polls, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas has a commanding lead in Michigan over his closest rivals, Mr. Gramm and Patrick J. Buchanan, with the others in the crowded field barely registering. And Mr. Dole was acting like a front-runner this weekend. "I've been reading, you know, past inaugural speeches, just to sort of get the feel for them," he told supporters at the Grand Hotel.
But with the primary six months off, support even at the party's core has not firmed up.
As Mr. Dole observed in his speech on Saturday, "I see all these 'Engler '96' stickers." The Governor has said he was not interested in running for President, but he had not ruled out a Vice-Presidential bid, a possibility that has been floated by the front-runner from Kansas.
Besides Mr. Dole, Mr. Gramm and Mr. Specter, the other candidates here were Gov. Pete Wilson of California and Morry Taylor, an auto-parts executive from Grosse Pointe.
Independent polls show President Clinton, who carried Michigan in 1992, narrowly leading Mr. Dole here. Among Republicans who have said they are likely to vote in the primary next year, the survey showed Mr. Dole leading with 43 percent, followed by Mr. Gramm at 9 percent and Mr. Buchanan at 8 percent. The poll was taken late last month by EPIC/MRA, a polling firm based in Lansing.
Mr. Engler's popularity also conceals fissures among Michigan's Republicans, particularly between the party's religious right wing and its moderate core.
"The central theme of Michigan politics now is the religious right," said Robert Andrews, a Republican lawyer from Luddington, as he strolled along the Grand Hotel's 660-foot southern porch. "I've had people, frankly, ask me why I'm involved in Republican politics, and the reason I'm involved is that I want to be a moderating influence."
Last year Michigan's Republicans won control of the Legislature for the first time since 1968, and elected the first Republican Senator, Spencer Abraham, since 1972. With the economy booming along with the auto industry, Governor Engler, who won a second term last year, has approval ratings of more than 60 percent.
But it is far from certain that the popularity of Mr. Engler -- who says he will not endorse a candidate in the primary -- will rub off on the eventual nominee. While Reagan Democrats may be happy with the Governor, deep ties between organized labor and the Democrats may make them reluctant to break with the party. Only slightly more Michigan residents call themselves Republicans than Democrats.
"This is still a toss-up state," said Thomas H. Shields, president of the Marketing Resource Group, a Republican polling firm in Lansing. "It's not a Republican state yet. The Republican Party seems to be the party of choice, not necessarily the party they're wedded to."

CORRECTION-DATE: September 30, 1995, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about a Republican conference in Michigan referred incorrectly to the employer of Morry Taylor, a candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination. He is chief executive of a company that makes wheels and tires for heavy machinery and golf carts, not for automobiles.

HEADLINE: A Small College's Tax-Exempt Status Challenged

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Washington and Jefferson College is a small liberal arts college tucked away in a corner of southwestern Pennsylvania. But it has become the focus of a growing nationwide struggle by governments to tax colleges and other nonprofit institutions.
Founded in 1781, Washington and Jefferson, like other colleges and nonprofit groups, has always been tax exempt. But two years ago, after watching other cities win payments in lieu of taxes from nonprofit organizations, the City of Washington, Pa., where Washington and Jefferson is located, asked the college to make such payments. The college refused, and the case is now in the courts. 
 A smattering of colleges and universities make voluntary payments to their local governments. Harvard gives Boston and Cambridge about $6 million a year, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology gives Cambridge about $1 million.And in recent years, financially squeezed municipalities across the country have begun to look at nonprofit groups -- especially health and private educational institutions -- as potential sources of revenue.
The tax exemption was grounded in the belief that institutions that benefited the public, rather than private shareholders, should be encouraged and helped to survive. But in an era in which nonprofit groups are under growing scrutiny, the exemption is being called into question.
Cities argue that the nonprofit groups own substantial property that is taken off the tax roles, even as these groups benefit from services like fire and police protection. The groups pay taxes on income that is not directly related to their public mission.
The stakes are high. Although recent data are hard to come by, a United States Treasury commission reported in 1977 that about one-tenth of all property was held by nonprofit groups and was tax exempt. The report estimated that taxing this property would raise $5 billion.
For the most part, municipalities and other government bodies have not changed the laws exempting nonprofit institutions from taxes, but have negotiated voluntary sums at levels lower than taxes would be.
The District of Columbia, for example, has been looking at organizations like the Federal National Mortgage Association, George Washington University and the World Bank, which city officials say could help ease their financial burden. In Pennsylvania, cities like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh have won annual payments from colleges, hospitals and other nonprofit groups.
Washington, Pa., won an agreement for payments from a local hospital and then turned its attention to Washington and Jefferson, which has 1,100 students and 100 faculty members. When a college trustee said Washington and Jefferson would not consider a payment, the city asked the college to provide services to the city, like mowing a nearby park lawn and opening its athletic facilities to the public.
"We just felt that it was time for them to pay their fair share," said Mayor Francis L. King. "They use a lot of our services."
But Howard Burnett, the college president, sees it differently. "The power to tax is the power to destroy, and this would have been the first step toward the government destroying private higher education," he said last week.
The local tax board backed the college. But after the city took the case to court -- and despite briefs from colleges, universities and other nonprofit organizations throughout the country supporting the Washington and Jefferson position -- the Court of Common Pleas ruled last year that Washington and Jefferson must pay local property taxes, saying the college did not meet the state's five tests for a "purely public charity."
Within days, the college, which has an annual budget of $29 million and an endowment of $60 million, received tax bills of almost $500,000, from the city, the county and the local board of education.
On Sept. 15, however, the college won a reprieve. In a 4-to-3 ruling, the state appeals court, the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, reversed the decision. The City Council voted last week to appeal.
The roots of the action in Pennsylvania come from a 1985 ruling by the State Supreme Court. The ruling seemed to open the door for challenges to tax exemption by setting five tests for charitable organizations. They are that an institution advances a charitable purpose, gives a substantial portion of its services gratuitously, benefits people who are legitimate subjects of charity, relieves government of some of its burden, and operates free of a private profit motive.
In the meantime, advocates of tax exemption for nonprofit groups hope that the appeals court decision will hold and that it will forestall efforts to tax nonprofit groups.
"There is a need for local tax reform," said Brian Mitchell, president of the Commission for Independent Colleges and Universities in Pennsylvania. "But we don't think they should find short-term solutions on the backs of private colleges and universities and other nonprofits."

HEADLINE: Farm Bill in Congress Offers Kansan Visions of Choice for His Open Fields

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, Kan., Sept. 21

 BODY:
The table-flat fields of wheat on Randal Loder's farm stretch to the horizon, but Mr. Loder believes he could make more money if Washington would allow him to plant that land in corn instead.
Showing that markets move faster than bureaucrats, corn sells at a premium here, largely because the world's largest beef-packing plant operates five miles down the road from Mr. Loder's farm. 
 "I'm locked into wheat because the Government won't let me change," said Mr. Loder, who last year received $32,500 in subsidies, out of a total revenue of $531,000. "The corn could go from my combine here, one mile down the road to the feed lot -- and the manager would love to have it."
If Mr. Loder has his way, Congress will soon approve legislation that will allow him to plant all the corn he wants. By Sept 29, the House Agriculture Committee is expected to vote on what could be the greatest shift in farm policies since subsidy payments started in 1933.
Offering a 1990's style of New Deal to the nation's commodity farmers, the bill held most likely to succeed would give farmers freedom to choose their crops in return for a gradual weaning from Federal subsidy checks.
Representative Pat Roberts, the Kansas Republican who is chairman of the committee, said his bill, the Freedom to Farm Act, has "an excellent chance." And if the bill is approved by the House committee, the Senate Agriculture Committee is likely to pass a similar measure. This week Republicans worked to win to their side the votes of Southern Congressmen opposed to subsidy cuts for cotton farmers.
With Republican support strong for easing away from this American-style central planning, the Roberts bill would cut subsidy payments roughly in half over seven years, counting for inflation. Reducing projected crop payments by $13.4 billion, the bill is intended to help meet a Congressional goal of balancing the national budget by the year 2002.
"Annual set-asides would be eliminated," a bill document said, referring to longstanding farm land reserve policy. "Critics could no longer charge that the Government pays farmers not to farm."
The future of farm subsidies after 2002 would be studied by a new Government committee, the Commission on 21st-Century Production Agriculture.
Hardly the work of urban liberals, the attack on the long sacrosanct farm subsidies is being led by Mr. Roberts, a 59-year-old conservative who for 15 years has represented the state's First Congressional District. Known here as the "Big First," the western Kansas district encompasses 640,000 people scattered over an expanse of the Great Plains that is larger than New York, New Jersey and Connecticut combined.
It is this prosaic landscape of long horizons and endless skies that makes Kansas the nation's largest beef processor and largest producer of wheat and sorghum. Last year the state's highly efficient farmers produced a Missouri River of grain: slightly more than one billion bushels of wheat, corn, sorghum and soy.
Partly because of Mr. Roberts's power in Congress, the Big First is the nation's champion district for crop subsidies, receiving $5.45 billion over the last decade.
And it is here in this farming town of 24,600 people in southwestern Kansas where farmers say they are willing to take smaller subsidy checks as long as they are allowed to pursue market trends in deciding what they want to grow.
"It makes us better farmers to have to sit down and to decide what to grow on our own land," Marc Miller said over coffee today as an early snow sifted over his fields. "A lot of other businesses are not subsidized. On Main Street, it's the battle of the fittest."
Government planning does not keep pace with the local economy's dynamism. Offering mild weather, low wages and abundant supplies of alfalfa and corn, this corner of Kansas is becoming a magnet for dairies, slaughterhouses and hog farms. Potatoes can be harvested here two weeks before the Idaho crop.
But farmers cannot leave and then re-enter the subsidy program from year to year. To remain in the crop subsidy program, Mr. Loder, for example, must surrender his freedom to choose what he can grow on 75 percent of his land. On this land, covered by the subsidy program, the apportioning of crops must be maintained year after year.
Farmers like Mr. Loder, no longer content to follow Washington's crop quotas, say they want the flexibility to pick and choose among high-paying crops.
"I'd rather get my money from the market than from a subsidy," Terry Gigot said at the Agriculture Department office here before hoisting his tall frame into his pickup truck. "When you receive subsidies, you feel like you are taking welfare."
Hardly an isolated opinion. Of nearly 10,000 farmers who responded last year to an Agriculture Department poll, 41 percent wanted to phase out subsidies and 37 percent said they wanted subsidies to continue. In the last month, the Freedom to Farm bill has been endorsed by state and regional newspapers ranging from The Garden City Telegram to The Kansas City Star.
The farmers' confidence that they can make it on their own stems from a variety of factors.
Until 1960, American farm incomes averaged about half that of the nation as a whole. Since 1970, despite some wild fluctuations, farm incomes have roughly kept pace with national levels.
Here in Kansas over the last 40 years, wheat yields have doubled and corn yields have increased sixfold. In the same period, the number of Kansas farms declined by half, and the average size doubled. But in a land of $110,000 harvest combines, profit margins can be razor thin.
"Producers are going to get steadily larger, more sophisticated and more corporate," Ernest A. Yake, executive vice president of Bank IV, predicted of farm life after subsidies. "The individual might get lucky for a few years. But when it goes bad, he's going to be hit right between the eyes."
With farmers in better financial shape, subsidies have already started to fall. Target prices -- the prices that trigger subsidy payments -- have been frozen since 1990 for corn, wheat and sorghum.
Over the last decade, crop payments to Kansas farmers dropped by half, to $467 million last year. Here in Finney County, where 90 percent of the county's 480 farms are in the subsidy program, crop payments last year hit their lowest level in a decade -- $7 million.
"This year, all advance payments for barley, wheat and corn will have to be paid back," predicted Thais E. Frieouf, county director for the Agriculture Department's Farm Service Agency. Wheat is selling here for $4.30 a bushel, well over the $4 subsidy trigger price. Corn is selling for $3.19 a bushel, also over the $2.75 trigger price.
With payments falling, some critics maintain that the new farm bill is merely a ploy to keep subsidies before they vanish.
"Freedom to Farm locks in a lot of spending for commodity programs which wouldn't have to be made," said Kenneth A. Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, a Washington-based research group that is critical of the program.
Dan Glickman, a former Kansas Congressman who is now Secretary of Agriculture, warned last week in Washington: "Providing yearly payments to producers, regardless of how much they are receiving from the marketplace, is not reform, it's a windfall."
Democrats in the House Agriculture Committee have opposed the Freedom to Farm measure, offering instead a bill to maintain production quotas and to cut subsidies by only $4.2 billion over seven years.
Farmers scalded by previous price cycles fear that a lifting of Government production controls could unleash megaharvests and subsequent price collapses.
"We definitely have the ability to produce more," said Mr. Gigot, a third-generation wheat and corn farmer. "But when we turn it loose, the prices inevitably will crash."
Many farmers, citing their fear of overproduction, said the Freedom to Farm plan would be successful only if it was linked to an aggressive export promotion program and to a Congressional guarantee against export embargoes. This year the nation's farm exports are expected to increase by 12 percent, to $49 billion.
Believing that the world should become one large duty- and subsidy-free supermarket, many Kansas farmers are convinced that a growing world demand can swallow up the nation's growing production. Over the last 15 years, world grain consumption increased by about 20 percent. But with production controls curbing American harvests, most of the new demand was met by plantings outside the United States.
Conjuring up visions of booming Asian markets, several farmers here cited a projection that if each resident of China were to eat two more eggs a week, the grain needed to feed the extra chickens would be equal to Australia's entire harvest.
But Kansas farmers complain that while European governments heavily subsidize food production and exports, the United States cuts subsidies and uses food exports as a foreign policy weapon.
"If we are going to take a hit on the guaranteed income side, then the Government should take a hit on one of its best foreign policy tools," Mr. Loder said. "What difference does it make if we don't sell grain to China, when they can buy grain from the Australians, the Europeans?"
If the State Department were to move to Kansas City, one farmer predicted, American food exports would flow a lot faster.
"It's been years and years since we have sold wheat to Cuba -- and the Canadians love that," complained Vance Ehmke, president of the Kansas Association of Wheat Growers.
Mr. Ehmke, who farms near here, also asserted that farmers wanted freedom from export embargoes. He bitterly recalled an embargo imposed by President Richard M. Nixon after international soy prices rose to record heights in the 1970's.
"We sent a signal to Japan that we were not a reliable soy producer," the wheat farmer recalled. "The Japanese encouraged the Brazilians to plant soy. Now Brazil is the world's largest soy producer."
Indeed, with only 2 percent of the nation's population living on farms, Mr. Ehmke feared that an overwhelmingly urban and suburban Congress would not have the stomach to deal with one possible corollary of free markets: rising food prices for consumers.
Low, stable grain prices contribute to low supermarket prices for milk, meat and bread. Americans spend about 12 percent of their household budgets on food, the lowest percentage of any major industrialized nation in the world.
"In a market-oriented economy, there will be more volatility in food prices," Mr. Ehmke said. "In China and Asia, those economies are going to come on stream and compete with American consumers."
He added: "We are being sold a market economy. American consumers better stay out of it and not whine when it happens."

BUDGET CUTS IMPERIL MILITARY SCHOOL
The military's prep school at Fort Monmouth, N.J., is the main way for black applicants to reach West Point: half of all black cadets currently at West Point came from the school. But although blacks in the United States Armed Services account for barely 11 percent of the officer corps -- despite making up 30 percent of the enlisted ranks -- Congressional budget cutters may eliminate or severely reduce enrollment at the prep school and those from which the other military branches draw many of their minority officer candidates.

But acknowledging that there is a problem and solving it are two vastly different things, particularly when the State Legislature is involved. News analysis. [B3.]
 
Highly sensitive metal detectors, newly deployed at 34 schools this year, are one part of the school system's response to repeated calls for a Police Department takeover of the school system's safety division. [B3.]

Once upon a time, there was a Transit Authority that cried, "New Token!" It most recently cried "New Token!" when it planned to raise fares in 1991. But the Transit Authority (heh! heh!) was only fooling. The fares went up, but the tokens did not change. Now subway and bus riders are facing another fare increase. And once again, the Transit Authority is crying, "New Token!" [B3.]
 
PENALTY UPHELD ON OFF-DUTY OFFICERS
A Federal appeals court in Manhattan upheld a lower-court ruling that the Police Department can discipline off-duty officers who blocked traffic during a rowdy demonstration at City Hall in 1992 without violating their First Amendment rights.

HEADLINE: New Tactic Is Tested on Illegal Immigrants

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Sept. 25

 BODY:
In the first major sweep of illegal workers in non-border states, Federal immigration officials have arrested or deported 4,044 illegal immigrants and replaced about 2,400 of them with legal workers, the authorities said today.
The raids, termed Operation South P.A.W. (Protecting American Workers), focused on assembly plants, food processing operations, restaurants and construction sites in six Southeastern states in the last three months. 
 This first "interior enforcement" effort -- as opposed to those on the nation's borders -- only skimmed the surface of the problem of illegal immigrant workers in the region, said Thomas P. Fischer, district director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service here. He estimated that the permanent population of illegal workers in the region approached 100,000; they are drawn to the area by the same vibrant economy, jobs and relatively low living costs that attract millions of legal workers every year.
"The illegal-worker problem is no longer a border-state problem only," Mr. Fischer said. "The border states are becoming pass-through areas for immigrants being drawn to jobs in other areas."
In the operation, 20 employers were arrested or investigated for "a willful pattern" of immigration-law violations in their hiring, immigration officials said, and 10 others were fined up to $15,000 each. I.N.S. officials did not provide the names of specific businesses today.
After illegal workers were found, the officials helped legal residents get those jobs, the officials said. The immigration officials got the names of legal residents looking for work from local employment services. After a raid, they met with the employer and offered to use those lists to help fill the gaps in the employer's depleted work force. As a result, some 2,400 legal workers were hired, Mr. Fischer said.
News of the operation caught many advocates for immigrants and immigration reform by surprise. They said such raids were discredited tactics in immigration enforcement because they created more fear in communities than deterrence among employers. The Clinton Administration, said Frank Sharry, executive director of the Immigration Forum, had received high marks for stepping up border enforcement and the monitoring of employers, which his group and others contend are more effective tactics.
"After excellent progress and progress greater than the two previous administrations in immigration enforcement, the Clinton Administration seems to be resorting to methods that have long been discredited," Mr. Sharry said. "Do they have a better way of doing this, or are they just trying to get headlines as we head into an election year?"
But the I.N.S. Commissioner, Doris M. Meissner, defended the effort, saying it was consistent with efforts to keep illegal workers from crossing the borders and to find abusive employers and sweatshops using illegal workers. The raids were not the kind of infamous sweeps in which immigration officials descended upon immigrant neighborhoods and social events to pick up people randomly, generating fear, she said. The raids were based on solid investigative leads and aimed at businesses that appeared to be willfully violating the law, she added.
"This operation was very carefully put together," Ms. Meissner said, "and we believe that such interior enforcement relieves pressure on the border. We are saying, 'If we find you at the border, we will send you home, and if we find you at the workplace in the interior, we will send you home.' "
Of the six states affected, Georgia had the largest number of illegal immigrants arrested and detained or deported: 1,351. David Poythress, the state's Labor Commissioner, suggested that Georgia had a high number of illegal workers because migrant workers from other countries came to the state to plant or pick crops and then remained. With the bustling economy of the state, and as it prepares for the 1996 Summer Olympics, many illegal workers have been attracted to the state to fill jobs that American citizens and other legal residents will not fill, he said.
The immigration service began its sweeps in June, hitting businesses in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and Tennessee. Illegal workers from 45 countries were found, and the operation turned up a range of violations, officials said.
In a Chinese restaurant in Jackson, Miss., officials found a 13-year-old Mexican boy working 12 hours a day, seven days a week for $21 a day. In Atlanta, they found illegal immigrants working for $15 an hour as skilled carpenters at local construction sites.
"Now there is an African-American, who didn't have a job, working on that construction site, making more than $30,000 a year," Mr. Fischer said.
In some places, employers learned of the raids before they were carried out, officials said. At a assembly plant in west Tennessee, the entire work force of 268 was "out sick" when investigators showed up.
Mr. Fischer said the average wage paid to the illegal workers had been $7 an hour. When agency officials factored in the illegal workers who they believe slipped through their net, they projected that they had "redirected to America's workers" about $55 million in gross salaries. The entire cost of the operation was $750,000, Mr. Fischer said.
But the operation was criticized by Gail Hoffman, director of an immigrant assistance program called Bridging The Gap in Atlanta. She said the agency's depiction of its efforts as saving American jobs had the effect of "demonizing" immigrants in general.
"It makes them look like terrible people," she said, "and not mothers and fathers and families, which they are."

HEADLINE: Gambling Fuels Louisiana Voter Anger

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 20

 BODY:
From the days of Huey P. Long through the era of Edwin W. Edwards, the voters of Louisiana have shown a remarkable tolerance for political corruption. This year, they may finally have had enough.
The reason is gambling. Since the last gubernatorial election, four years ago, Louisiana has become a 52,000-square-mile casino. There is gambling on the land, gambling on the rivers, gambling on the lakes, gambling in bars and restaurants, gambling at truck stops, even gambling in doughnut bakeries and barber shops. 
 And, to the surprise of few, with the arrival of slots, craps and video poker has come the enrichment of politicians and their cronies. First it was revealed that Governor Edwards's son Stephen and several of the Governor's closest allies had secured profitable contracts to represent gambling companies regulated by the state. Then last month, the Federal Bureau of Investigation disclosed that it was investigating whether top legislators took all manner of bribes to kill bills that would have allowed Louisianians to vote on repealing video poker in their communities.
The voters' disgust, both with the corruption and with the Legislature's approval of gambling without a referendum, is palpable at any gathering of the men and women now running to succeed Mr. Edwards. Sixteen candidates -- seven of them considered serious contenders -- are on the ballot for the Oct. 21 nonpartisan primary, and their contest has been thoroughly dominated by the need to clean up state government.
While corruption in Louisiana is seemingly on the rise, the state remains at the bottom of almost every ranking of quality of life and government: last in teacher salaries and bond ratings, first in poverty, fourth in unemployment and violent crime. Polls show that voters are furious that their politicians seem to be the greatest beneficiaries of state government, and the gubernatorial campaign has been become a race to tap that anger.
In a recent televised debate, Phil Preis, a 45-year-old Democratic lawyer from Baton Rouge who is running as an outsider, asserted that "the only growth industry we've got in Louisiana right now is the F.B.I."
Reacting to public-opinion polls, all of the major candidates have proposed some restrictions on gambling. Typical proposals have been to allow Louisianians to vote on whether to repeal various forms of gambling or to ban campaign contributions from gambling interests. All of the candidates have sworn off contributions from lobbyists and businesses involved with gambling, although newspapers have discovered that some have accepted them anyway.
The front-runner in the race, former Gov. Buddy Roemer, a Democrat-turned-Republican who lost his re-election bid to Mr. Edwards in 1991, is being attacked by his opponents for signing the 1991 legislation that allowed the state to license 15 riverboat casinos and for failing to veto a bill that allowed video poker at truck stops, restaurants and taverns. Mr. Roemer acknowledges that permitting video poker, the focus of the F.B.I.'s bribery investigation, was a mistake.
Although most of the subjects of the F.B.I.'s investigation are Democratic legislators, Democratic Party officials have blamed Mr. Roemer for the scandal, calling him "the godfather of gambling in Louisiana." Some candidates have even criticized Mr. Roemer for playing host to weekly poker games in the Governor's Mansion.
"Everybody's on television with ads talking about corruption, talking about gambling contributions," said Bernie R. Pinsonat, a Baton Rouge pollster. "As one legislator told me, anything coming over my desk next year with ethics on it, I'm voting for it."
The heightened moral outrage over corruption is only one of the ways this year's race may reflect the end of an era in Louisiana politics.
For only the second time in 24 years, Mr. Edwards is not on the gubernatorial ballot, having chosen not to run for a fifth term. Although all but one of the governors elected this century have been white Democratic men, none of the five leading contenders this year fit that description.
Two of the candidates -- Mr. Roemer, 51, and State Senator Mike Foster, 65 -- have switched to the Republican Party. Two Democrats are women, State Treasurer Mary L. Landrieu, the 39-year-old daughter of former New Orleans Mayor Moon Landrieu, and Lieut. Gov. Melinda Schwegmann, 48, whose family owns New Orleans's largest grocery chain. The company has plastered Ms. Schwegmann's face on the 2.5 million grocery bags, both paper and plastic, that leave its Schwegmann Giant Super Markets each week.
Another top contender is Representative Cleo Fields, 32, a black Democrat from Baton Rouge whose chances improved recently when another black Congressman, William J. Jefferson of New Orleans, withdrew from the race.
If Mr. Fields is able to consolidate his support among black voters, who represent 28 percent of Louisiana's 2.26 million registered voters, he could become the first black candidate to make a statewide runoff, held between the top two candidates if none wins more than 50 percent of the primary vote. But in the scheduled Nov. 18 runoff, Mr. Fields would be considered a heavy underdog against Mr. Roemer, who would win between 25 and 30 percent of the primary vote, according to recent polls.
That dynamic has created a migraine headache for the mayor of New Orleans, Marc H. Morial, a Democrat and perhaps the most popular black elected official in the state. If he endorses Mr. Fields, he could contribute to the victory of a Republican governor. But he may offend his black supporters if he endorses one of the white Democrats, presumably Ms. Landrieu on the theory that she could beat Mr. Roemer.
Mr. Roemer, the Harvard-educated former Governor, once a liberal by Louisiana standards, is running hard to the right. In 1991, Mr. Roemer became a Republican, but was outflanked by the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and finished third. Mr. Duke then took more than half of the white vote in losing the runoff to Governor Edwards.
Recognizing Mr. Duke's appeal, Mr. Roemer is now calling for chain gangs for prisoners, the death penalty for drug dealers, drug testing for welfare recipients, a statewide curfew for juveniles, and term limits for lawmakers.
Opponents have criticized him for acting out of mere expediency.
"I remember him saying four years ago, 'I'll never let anyone get to the right of me again,' " said State Representative Quentin Dastugue, a conservative Republican who dropped out of the race last month. "Roemer will do anything and be anybody you want him to be to be Governor."
But Mr. Roemer and his supporters see his evolution as a matter of maturity.
Like Bill Clinton and Michael S. Dukakis, two other young governors who mounted comebacks after being bounced out of office, Mr. Roemer is using his speeches and advertising to apologize for the arrogance and ineffectiveness that typified his first term. He was known then for his bullheaded fights with the Legislature, his refusal to return telephone calls, even his decision to wear blue jeans to a meeting with the Japanese ambassador.
"I'm older, slower, not nearly as smart as I thought I was, but I might be a little wiser," Mr. Roemer, now graying, says at every turn.
If he can sell his more conservative message in Louisiana, a state won by Mr. Clinton in 1992, it will only reinforce the sense that the President cannot win in the Deep South in 1996.
In the only other gubernatorial races this year, the Governor of Mississippi, Kirk Fordice, a Republican, is favored for re-election, and a conservative lawyer, Larry Forgy, is running a strong race to become the first Republican elected governor of Kentucky in almost 30 years.
Some political analysts do not discount the possibility that Louisiana, where 69 percent of all voters are registered as Democrats, is now conservative enough to put two Republicans -- Mr. Roemer and Mr. Foster -- in the runoff. "That would be bubba heaven," said John Maginnis, editor of the Louisiana Political Review.

HEADLINE: Clerk Is Charged in Killing of 7-Year-Old

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: KINGSTON, N.Y., Sept. 25

 BODY:
In what may become the first case tried under New York State's new death penalty law, an unemployed grocery clerk was charged today with the kidnapping and murder of a 7-year-old girl who disappeared on Thursday while playing in front of her house here.
The authorities said that after several days of questioning, the 25-year-old clerk, Lawrence Whitehurst, led the police to woods on the outskirts of town before dawn today, to a pile of twigs and debris that covered all but a foot of the girl, Rickel Knox. The Ulster County District Attorney said he won Mr. Whitehurst's cooperation by agreeing to sign a plea bargain that was actually a ruse to find the victim. 
 "We would never have found that child without him leading us to her," the District Attorney, E. Michael Kavanaugh, said.
Mr. Kavanaugh said that he would ask a grand jury, probably this week, to indict Mr. Whitehurst for first-degree murder, a capital offense, and that he would seek the death penalty if he won a conviction.
Rickel, a second grader, had just taken off her roller skates and was expecting her mother home from work on Thursday afternoon when Mr. Whitehurst lured her into his car, the authorities said today.
They said they suspect that she was already dead when the police first interviewed Mr. Whitehurst two and a half hours after she was reported missing. He was questioned because Rickel's baby sitter was Mr. Whitehurst's father, Lawrence Miller, who was also watching Mr. Whitehurst's two children that day.
"This was not a situation where you can warn a child to stay away from strangers," said Chief James K. Riggins of the Kingston police. "The child knew him, she knew her parents knew him, she knew his children. It wasn't unnatural for her to get in his car."
Under the new capital punishment law, which went into effect on Sept. 1, the death penalty may be sought for first-degree murder if a defendant intended to kill the victim while committing another felony crime, like kidnapping or rape.
Mr. Kavanaugh would not say whether Rickel was sexually assaulted until the results of forensic tests were available.
Because of the rigorous court challenge that is likely to meet the state's first capital punishment case, Mr. Kavanaugh said he asked for help from forensics experts from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who came from Boston to work with the New York State Police and the local police to insure that the evidence would withstand scrutiny.
The police first questioned Mr. Whitehurst two and a half hours after Rickel was reported missing because he had been at his father's house and left his children there, Mr. Kavanaugh said. He made some inconsistent statements, he said, but despite more questioning on Friday and Saturday, there was not enough cause to arrest him until early Sunday morning, after the police found a witness who saw Rickel get into Mr. Whitehurst's car.
Mr. Whitehurst, who the authorities said they believe was using crack cocaine on Thursday, was arrested a few years ago on a misdemeanor drug charge. That is his only arrest record, the police said.
Because Mr. Whitehurst indicated that Rickel could still be alive, Mr. Kavanaugh agreed late Sunday night to enter into a plea bargain. The arrangement would have limited Mr. Whitehurst's possible sentence to 10 years to life if Rickel were found alive and 15 years to life if she were found dead.
Mr. Kavanaugh said he might have taken the contract, which both sides signed, into account if Rickel had been found alive but that he knew all along that if the child was dead, he would not honor it.
"By 10 o'clock Sunday night, we were not even close to solving this crime," Mr. Kavanaugh said. "The agreement is not something I'm comfortable with, but I would have done a deal with the devil to get that child back safely to her parents. I would be very surprised if under these circumstances, any court would uphold that contract. It is not an enforceable agreement."
Because Mr. Whitehurst may be charged with a capital murder, he is being represented by Jeremiah Flaherty, a lawyer with the state's Capital Defender Office. Under New York's death penalty law, a lawyer from that office is assigned to every person facing indictment for first-degree murder until a district attorney formally announces that the death penalty will not be sought.
In Kingston, a working-class city of 23,000, people are outraged. Dozens of residents came to court today to hear Mr. Whitehurst mumble a not-guilty plea at his arraignment.
Rickel's parents, Rickie Knox, an automobile detailer at a local car dealership, and Margaret Marable, who works for Family of Woodstock, a community services organization, declined to talk to reporters.
The Rev. Willie Hardin of the Riverview Baptist Church said he was speaking for the family.
"We were holding out all kinds of hope," he said. "But God is on the throne through it all. Rickel sang in the choir at church. She was a little songbird. She was a very happy child."

HEADLINE: 'New Media' Experts Debate Proposals to Reduce Immigration

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
A Congressional proposal for strict new limits on immigration, which critics say would undermine the ability of high technology companies to recruit foreign workers, may not create severe barriers to a growing new entertainment industry in New York City, economists and business executives said yesterday.
The "new media" industry has in recent years grown out of the dense concentration of entertainment companies operating out of Manhattan lofts and inexpensive offices. Hundreds of start-up companies have sprung up to find new markets for software, interactive video programs and other high technology products in publishing, television and advertising. 
 Unlike larger, more mature computer companies, executives say these new media companies haven't recruited many high technology professionals from abroad.
"These companies are so culturally based, I don't think new immigration rules will make a difference," said Gail Kleinberg-Koch, president of C A/S Comsearch, a Manhattan company that recruits workers for new media companies.
Because companies in the field concentrate on entertainment, she said their workers must combine technical expertise with an intimate knowledge of American popular culture -- from Wheel of Fortune to professional wrestling -- that few immigrants can offer.
But her view was not shared uniformly.
"That sounds ethnocentric to me," said Daniel Stechow, 32, the founder and president of Brainstorm Interactive, a Manhattan company that makes interactive video products. "What is American culture if not derivative of other cultures?"
Although Mr. Stechow's products, including a video of the Grateful Dead, are now marketed only to United States companies, he said two of his technical executives are immigrants, a computer artist from Japan and a programmer from India. He said he hoped to sponsor both for American citizenship, enabling them to become permanent employees.
But that might run headlong into immigration bills in Congress. Among other changes, they would cut the annual number of immigrants to 535,000 from 800,000 a year, and the annual number who could obtain citizenship for professional reasons to 75,000 from 140,000.
The Congressional proposal may be welcomed by many people in the New York region who have been laid off from large technology companies, including I.B.M. in Westchester County, Grumman on Long Island and Electric Boat in Connecticut.
"There are several categories of high-tech jobs where foreign recruitment would only add to a surplus of workers in the region," said Emmanuel Tobier, a professor of economics and urban planning at New York University and an expert on immigration.
But some new media companies were critical of the Congressional proposals.
"In my case, these rules would mean one less entrepreneur," said Yee Ping Wu, 40, a classical pianist and computer expert who formed Music Pen, a new media company in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, in 1988. The company makes CD-ROM's and multimedia programs. It employs 600 people.
Ms. Wu immigrated to New York in the 1970's and stayed on, she said, as an illegal alien until she obtained citizenship under the amnesty program of the late 1980's.
"What makes New York interesting is its cultural diversity," she said. If the rules now proposed in Congress had been enacted a decade ago, she added, "I'd be in trouble."

HEADLINE: Ethics on Vacation

 BODY:
Gov. George Pataki is in Europe this week, searching for his roots. New Yorkers will understand his desire to visit his family homeland. Indeed, many of them have made similar trips themselves. Most of them, however, managed to do it without bringing along their own press spokeswoman. Most also paid their own way.
The Governor and his party, which includes his wife, mother and son as well as four aides and two state troopers, are visiting Hungary as guests of the Hungarian-American Chamber of Commerce. Later they will move on to Italy, where the Italian-American Chamber of Commerce is picking up the tab. 
 Mr. Pataki's staff says the point of the trip is to encourage trade between New York and the two countries from which his family emigrated. Desirable as that goal may be, it is hardly at the top of the state's present list of priorities. If Mr. Pataki is planning his schedule on a business basis, he might be better employed lobbying Washington on the Medicaid formula he has opposed.
The visit to Hungary is clearly a mixture of politics and pleasure, a family vacation plus a chance to remind the voters back home that the Patakis are not far removed from their immigrant heritage. By letting private business groups pay for this outing, the Governor has yet again shown himself tone-deaf to questions of conflict of interest.
Mr. Pataki, who came to office with a mandate to shake up state government, seems more than willing to accept the status quo when it comes to ethical standards. At a time when even Congress is showing a long-overdue interest in lobbying and campaign reform, New York remains a land of opportunity for lobbyists, fund-raisers and influence peddlers. Mr. Pataki has made no attempt to clamp down on gifts from lobbyists, set reasonable limits on campaign contributions or sell a reform agenda to the Republican majority in the State Senate, which seems to make a sport of killing ethics legislation.
Moreover, he has been setting a terrible example. He spent his first months as Governor on a fund-raising binge for a re-election campaign that is still three years away. His Economic Development Commissioner, Charles Gargano, is doing double duty as a key political fund-raiser.
Two senior members of his administration were discovered heading a Saratoga Race Course event that collected contributions from people doing business with their state offices. After that embarrassment, the Governor contended he was cleaning up his fund-raising procedures. But it turns out that his reform policy will still permit officials like Mr. Gargano to raise political contributions from people who do business with the state, provided they do not solicit those who conduct business with their own agencies.
This is mere cosmetics. Mr. Gargano, who this week is one of Mr. Pataki's fellow vacationers in Hungary, has influence within the administration that stretches well beyond the office he heads. The real road to reform is clear: The Governor should tell his officials that as long as they work for the taxpayers, they are out of the political fund-raising business, period.
The Hungarian trip is symptomatic of a much larger problem. Mr. Pataki should be setting a new tone, but he is operating like a champion of business as usual. His aides say he is not the first governor to let private interests underwrite his travel. But if the voters were satisfied with the way things were, they would not have elected him.

HEADLINE: Fall in Mortgage Rates Increased House Resales for August

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
Low mortgage rates drew more buyers into the market in August, raising sales of previously owned homes to a 15-month high, a real estate group said today.
The Mortgage Bankers Association reported today that sales in August of previously owned single-family homes rose to a seasonally adjusted annualzed rate of 4.11 million, the highest since a similar rate in May 1994. 
 August sales were 3 percent above July's 3.99 million rate and 5.1 percent higher than the 3.91 million pace a year ago. Every region contributed to the increase, with the Midwest registering the biggest gain.
Sales in the Northeast gained 3.4 percent, to a 600,000 annual rate. However, the median price for a used home in that region was $142,300, down from $145,000 in August 1994. The median is the midpoint, meaning half the homes cost more and half cost less.
David Lereah, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association, noted that interest rates were dropping again and leading to further shrinkage in housing inventories.
"You take the interest rate environment and combine it with the supply coming down and you have a very favorable backdrop for future housing construction," he said.
Edmund G. Woods Jr., president of the National Association of Realtors, agreed. "Buyers have taken advantage of the low mortgage rates and will continue to do so through the end of the year," he said.
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation has reported that fixed-rate 30-year mortgages averaged 7.85 percent in August, up from 7.61 percent in July but well below the 9.15 percent in January.
They had fallen back to 7.57 percent last week, representing a considerable saving since the year began. The monthly payment on a $100,000 mortgage with a 7.5 percent interest rate is $699, while the payment on the same loan with a 9 percent rate is $805 -- a difference of $106. The mortgage rate stimulus to sales has shrunk the monthly supply of existing homes on the market to 5.1 months in August, down from 6.7 months in April, according to the real estate survey.
The Government reported earlier that the supply of new homes had fallen to a six-month supply in July, down from 7.2 months in February. It reports August sales on Friday.
"With the monthly supply coming down, it tells me that housing starts for September will be pretty good, that we will be able to sustain a healthy pace of construction and home sales," Mr. Lereah said.
Housing starts totaled 1.398 million at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in August, the highest level so far this year.
But offsetting some of the savings from lower mortgage rates was the national median price of a used home, which rose in every region except the Northeast. Nationally, it was $117,600, up 4.1 percent from $113,000 a year earlier.
Sales in the Midwest advanced 3.9 percent from July to a 1.06 million annual rate. The median price there was $97,600, compared with $89,700 in August 1994. Sales in the West rose 3.4 percent, to a 900,000 rate. The median price was $151,700, up from $149,100 a year earlier.
In the South, sales advanced 1.3 percent, to a 1.54 million rate. The median price was $102,900, compared with $98,100 a year earlier.

30-Year Bond Up in Price On Light Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices were little changed yesterday in light trading ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting on interest-rate policy today.
Prices of Treasury securities were generally lower, except for the long bond, which edged up 2/32 , to 10328/32 . Its yield was unchanged from 6.58 percent on Friday. 
 Trading volume was light, with many traders on the sidelines awaiting the Fed meeting or absent because of Rosh ha-Shanah.
Technical factors kept futures trading inside Friday's range, as the December Treasury bond futures contract closed at 113, with the high at 1132/32 and the low at the closing price.
Treasury prices felt pressure after a stronger-than-expected housing report raised inflationary concerns. The National Association of Realtors said yesterday that the number of home resales during August rose by 3 percent, to an annual rate of 4.11 million. Analysts had expected home resales to drop 1.3 percent, to an annual rate of 3.94 million.
Economists noted that the larger number suggested that despite the apparent sluggish pace of the economy, the housing sector was still doing well. Also fresh in traders' minds was last week's report on housing construction, which rose unexpectedly in August to the year's highest level.
William Gamba, senior vice president in charge of the government trading desk at Cowen & Company, said the housing report was a little "on the strong side."
Few market participants expect a change in interest-rate policy to come out of the Fed's policy-making committee meeting today. "But that doesn't mean we can't have another cut in interest rates down the road," Mr. Gamba said. "I think the Fed will wait until it sees something concrete from Washington regarding the budget.'
But a small minority in the market say there is an outside chance of some Fed action today.
Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said a strong case could be made for an easing.
" Although recent data have, on balance, been more upbeat than was evident prior to the July 6 easing," she said, "the data still indicate some significant pockets of weakness and subdued inflation. Since the current 5.75 percent Federal funds rate is seemingly still restrictive, a policy easing at this juncture should be the appropriate course of action."
The Treasury note auctions this week are not likely to present a problem for the market, Mr. Gamba of Cowen said, particularly after watching the backup in yields that have occured in the last three trading sessions.
Today, the Government will sell $17.75 billion of two-year notes, and tomorrow $11.5 billion of notes with a five-year maturity. In when-issued trading ahead of the auctions, the two-year note was selling at a price to yield 5.85 percent and the five-year note at a price to yield 6.06 percent.
At yesterday's auction of new three- and six-month bills, interest rates were mixed as the market awaited the outcome of today's Fed policy meeting. The average rate for a new three-month maturity fell 11 basis points, to 5.14 percent, while the rate on a six-month issue rose 5 basis points, to 5.27 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
In the municipal bond market yields were little changed amid concern that that the combination of slow investor demand and $3 billion in supply of new issues this week could cause dealers to raise interest rates in order to lure buyers into the market.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Regains Some Ground Vs. Mark, Swiss Franc and Yen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar gained against the German mark and the Swiss franc in thin trading yesterday as currency dealers took profits on the two European currencies.
The mark and the Swiss franc surged last week as doubts about the prospects for monetary union spurred a flight to the haven of Europe's two most stable currencies. That flight stalled today, letting the dollar and other currencies recoup some of their losses. 
 "It looks like a softer mark against Europe, and that's helping the dollar," said Dennis Pettit, foreign exchange manager at the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan.
The French franc, Italian lira, British pound and other European currencies also made gains against the mark.
The dollar also benefited from expectations that the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee would leave interest rates unchanged when it meets today. Lower rates tend to hurt the dollar by making United States deposits less attractive.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.4345 marks from 1.4247 marks on Friday and to 1.1565 Swiss francs from 1.1471. The dollar edged up to 100.52 Japanese yen from 100.1 yen. The British pound rose to $1.5702 from $1.5685.
On Thursday, the mark and Swiss franc soared against most other major currencies after senior German officials raised doubts about whether Italy, Sweden and other European countries would be able to meet the stringent economic criteria for monetary union laid out in the Maastricht treaty.
While the prospects for monetary union remain murky, the initial surprise caused by the remarks has largely been priced into exchange rates, traders said.
"There's a clearer picture now of what Germany and France think about E.M.U.," said Belal Khan, chief of foreign exchange sales at Bank of Tokyo referring to European monetary union. Still, Mr. Khan and other traders said they did not expect the mark to give back all its gains any time soon.
The dollar's rebound against the mark helped lift it higher against the yen as well, traders said.
Expectations that the Bundesbank will participate in a coordinated bout of dollar-buying, meantime, were damped by a speech by its president, Hans Tietmeyer. "Only in special situations and with good timing can coordinated interventions" make an impression on the markets, Mr. Tietmeyer said.
He acknowledged that the dollar's recent slump was "exaggerated." But ultimately, he said, the strength of the dollar depends on American efforts to reduce its budget deficit.

HEADLINE: Out of a Crisis, an Opportunity

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: TULTITLAN, Mexico

 BODY:
When Hugh D. Pace, Goodyear's manager here, heard on his car radio last December that the peso had crashed, dragging the nation's economy with it, he immediately met with his managers to assess the damage. Within days, he figured that domestic demand for their tires would plunge more than 20 percent, or 3,000 a day. His choices: lay off workers or find new export markets -- right away, before his warehouse overflowed.
Mr. Pace turned his office into a war room. On his walls, members of what he called Team 3,000 pinned outlines and diagrams of strategies to capture new foreign customers, especially in the United States. 
 Among the goals: sell 120 more truck tires a day to the United States. And 40 to 48 for mobile homes. Plus another 400 a day to a Chrysler plant in Mexico for new Neons headed north. And why not hawk a few tires in Venezuela? Or Switzerland?
His team members, aided by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company headquarters in Akron, Ohio, not only found enough buyers to make up for what turned out to be a 3,500-tire drop in domestic sales. They also found spots to sell 1,600 more, setting an output record at the plant, some 15 miles north of Mexico City. A factory that had imported supplies but exported not a single tire in 1992 now ships away half its production, mostly to the United States but also to South America and Europe. "From one day to another we passed from being an importer company to an exporter company," said Marcel Miota, Mr. Pace's production chief.
Goodyear is just one of many big American companies here that have compensated for the collapse of domestic demand by sending goods abroad, to the United States most of all. As the peso shriveled in value, these companies saw their labor costs, in dollars, fall by more than a third. The resulting flood into the United States of cheaper autos, televisions and other products, including tires, is turning last year's $1.4 billion trade surplus with Mexico into a $15 billion deficit.
The imbalance has revived the debate over whether the United States should have welcomed Mexico into a new North American free trade zone last year. Several Presidential contenders have already featured opposition to free trade with Mexico in their campaigns. Some economists predict that the deficit, reflecting slower Mexican demand for United States goods but mostly higher Mexican exports, will cost more than 100,000 American jobs this year.
Calculating the ultimate effects of Goodyear's turnaround and the wider trade deficit with Mexico is far from simple, though. In trade, unlike football, one side's gains are not always the other side's losses. Increased trade can benefit consumers and create jobs in both countries.
Herminio Blanco, Mexico's Commerce Secretary, noted that although Mexican exports to the United States have risen almost 30 percent this year, United States exports to Mexico are off less than 10 percent. "As soon as this crisis passes, this is going to be an excellent market," he said in an interview. "Mexico is an excellent source of jobs for the United States."
Mr. Blanco believes, however, that this year's export gains will be permanent, even a base for further advances. What is more, Mr. Blanco is pressing American companies to substitute local supplies for American parts at their Mexican plants.
Goodyear says that because its United States factories are already running flat out, it is merely adding production in Mexico. But many other companies have shifted jobs to Mexico this year -- mostly under long-range plans that have, if anything, accelerated since the peso's collapse lowered their labor costs. According to Labor Department records, Allied Signal, Mattel, General Electric and Zenith are some of the companies that have laid off American workers and moved production south. (Even so, Mexico's overall job losses from the economic crisis far exceed the worst projections for the United States' loss.)
Most unions say that Mexico's economic woes and the draining of jobs from the United States bear out their arguments against the trade pact. "Here's one of those situations where I wish we were wrong," said Mark A. Anderson, director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. task force on trade.
For all its new activity, Goodyear's tire plant here, the nation's largest, still seems like a mile-long relic of the industrial past. Outside, 48 years of grime have turned the plant the same color as its products. Inside, the darkness is punctuated by the hissing and clanking of hulking machines and the twinkling lights of small shrines, mounted on columns, to the Virgin of Guadalupe.
Goodyear commands a leading 30 percent of the Mexican tire market. But the plant's plodding ways under a hidebound union long discouraged renovations and ruled out exports.
By 1992, however, Mr. Pace saw how a pending North American Free Trade Agreement would eventually remove the 20 percent tariff that had protected Mexican plants from more efficient American competition. Mr. Pace called in the union to explain that Mexico could be swamped by imports. With grudging union cooperation, he cut more than 500 of the plant's 2,500 workers, who in 1992 produced 12,500 tires a day.
Mr. Pace, a lanky, slouching sloganeer -- "profit is not a dirty word," he lectured his workers, "it's why we're here" -- invited suggestions about improving productivity. Despite the cutbacks, output rose to 13,500 tires a day in 1993 and 14,700 in 1994. In gratitude, Mr. Pace renovated the fetid bathrooms, installing tile floors, marble counters and new showers.
Higher output required higher sales, mostly in the United States. In 1993, the plant began shipping tires north, although only 7 percent of output. Last year, after the trade pact took effect on Jan. 1, removing a 4 percent United States tire tariff, the plant exported about 20 percent of production.
The peso's December collapse threatened all the trust that Mr. Pace had painfully won. He called union leaders into his office for a message he soon repeated in letters to every worker. "We cannot promise you anything," Mr. Pace told the union chiefs. "But we will work 24 hours a day to find export business to substitute for domestic demand."
The United States topped his managers' target list, but Chile, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Western Europe, East Asia, even Russia, also came up. In his office, managers translated their discussions into task lists and diagrams at a flip chart on an easel, then pinned the pages to the walls. "The only thing not in the scenario was a square tire," said Mr. Miota, the production chief.
The managers then worked the phones, calling former bosses, colleagues and employees in Goodyear's global organization, reminding them of favors owed. With plants in 30 countries and a crisis always breaking out somewhere, Goodyear has become expert at moving tires to stronger markets, as long as they can be profitably sold.
Mr. Pace, at 43 one of the company's top foreign trouble-shooters, worked on his Goodyear friends from previous assignments in South America. He persuaded them to stock and sell some tire types from Mexico that they did not make themselves and some that they did.
The plant desperately needed molds from headquarters in Akron to make seven new tire models for the United States and more for South America. The reduced labor costs were a clincher. Since December, the peso has lost nearly half its value against the dollar -- tumbling to about 16 cents, from about 29 -- but union wages at this plant and many others have risen just 8 percent. "That devaluation helped us to be competitive," said Pablo M. Ross, Goodyear's logistics director here.
Goodyear will not disclose overall production costs. But Mr. Pace says supply costs are similar in the United States and Mexico. And for every dollar Goodyear spends in the United States on labor, it can get the same output for 62 cents in Mexico -- down from 90 cents before the devaluation.
Tire plants in the United States pay $17 an hour in wages alone. Mr. Miota says workers here average $10.50 an hour in wages and benefits, or more than $15 before the peso's plunge. While they are generally paid well enough to buy cars, own houses and earn the envy of friends and relatives, none of several workers interviewed said they were compensated nearly as well as Mr. Miota said. Nicolas Martinez Martinez, a senior power technician and one of the plant's best-paid workers, earns about 4,000 pesos a month, or roughly $3 an hour. Mr. Pace says that benefits more than double wages.
The workers bemoan the loss of purchasing power from inflation, which this year has run at an annual rate of about 50 percent. Mr. Martinez, used to vacations in Acapulco and other resorts, is staying home this year, citing the higher costs of everything from shoes to gasoline.
Still, employees are glad they work for a company that can export to preserve their jobs. "It's a very strong international company," said Juan Jimenez Salinas, glancing down from his forklift. He earns about $80 a week.
In Mr. Pace's office, export deals for new tires soon found their way from the sheets pinned on the walls to a central tally on the easel.
The Chrysler Corporation, which started using the plant's tires last year, agreed to take another 400 as its own exports rose. Next to the "Mobile Home 40-48 tires a day" entry, Mr. Pace marked "Done. Jan. 13, 1995." He also found new markets north of the border for Unisteel radial truck tires, high-performance Eagle car tires and private label tires. By midyear, exports to the United States more than doubled, to at least 5,200 a day.
The plant got far more help from other markets than managers anticipated. They were soon able to sell 2,600 tires a day to Latin America. Though sales there have slowed, beginning this month they have been selling 900 tires a day to Europe and about 100 a day to Japan.
All told, the plant is turning out 16,300 tires a day, 11 percent more than the year before. Mr. Pace plans to maintain or increase exports even when the local market picks up, as it is just starting to do.
By increasing productivity two-thirds in the last three years, he added, the factory has become a candidate for a major expansion.
In the long run, the plant will stop trying to make every type of tire the Mexican market needs and instead concentrate efficiently, like American plants, on a few models. Just watch what happens to his exports then, Mr. Pace said. "We've got this magnificent opportunity now, and we cannot let go of it," he said.

HEADLINE: Bessie Delany Dies at 104; Co-Wrote 'Having Our Say'

BYLINE: By CHARISSE JONES 

 BODY:
Annie Elizabeth (Bessie) Delany, the younger of the two sisters whose wisdom and triumphs have been celebrated in a best-selling book and in the Broadway play "Having Our Say," died yesterday at her home in Mt. Vernon, N.Y. She was 104.
"She just took a couple of deep breaths and passed away," said Amy Hill Hearth, co-author of "Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 years," the 1993 best-selling oral history. "And it's an important thing she died at home, in her bed, with her sister there. That's all she wanted." 
 Her 106-year-old sister, Sarah, known as Sadie, with whom she had lived for more than 100 years, seemed to handle her sister's death with the same strength that had carried her through a century.
"I'll just do the best I can," Sarah Delany told Ms. Hearth in an interview at her home. "I'll continue right on as if Bessie were here."
She added that for her sister, whose life was filled with many achievements, the last few years had been particularly special. "Bessie lived to be 104, and she lived her life the way she wanted to," she said. "And especially the last couple of years, she has been having a ball. Between the play and books, she has been having the time of her life. And she said you really couldn't ask for anything more."
The two sisters had lived so long and seen so much that to some it seemed they might live forever. Born a generation after the Civil War, they had triumphed over Jim Crow, worked in Harlem during its renaissance, borne witness to the feminist and civil rights movements and in recent years, become national celebrities.
Their award-winning memoir has been on the New York Times best-seller list for 19 months, sold more than 900,000 copies and been translated into four foreign languages. They were co-authors of a second book, "The Delany Sisters' Book of Everyday Wisdom" (Kodansha America, 1994) which has sold 160,000 copies. And in April their Mt. Vernon parlor was re-created on Broadway, in a dramatization that earned three Tony nominations.
Bessie Delany often marveled that the nation would be interested in what two elderly black women had to say. She wanted her life seen not so much as a story of blacks or of women, but of America.
The sisters' lives remained simple despite their celebrity. They rose early to eat a breakfast of oatmeal, went to bed after watching the MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour on a black-and-white television and had no telephone. They relied mostly on each other for comfort and company. In more than a century, they lived apart for only a few months. And Sarah Delany said many times that it was for her baby sister that she had lived so long.
Annie Elizabeth Delany was born on Sept. 3, 1891, in Raleigh, N.C., the third child of a former slave who became the country's first black Episcopal bishop. Raised on the campus of St. Augustine's College, she and her siblings were well-educated, nurtured and sheltered from the harsher edges of American racism.
But she and her sister often spoke of the first time they were told to go to the back of the trolley car. And they remembered how the staff at the drugstore refused to serve them. Still, Bessie Delany was undaunted. Known as the feistier of the sisters, she was once almost lynched for speaking rudely to a "rebby boy." And she often told tales of how as a child she would sneak a sip from the forbidden side of the water fountain. 'I'd just take a drink of the white water," she said. "It didn't taste any different."
She graduated from St. Augustine's in 1911 and worked as a teacher in North Carolina and Georgia to earn the money she needed to continue her education. The few months in 1912 that she and Sadie taught in different parts of the South was the only time they did not live together.
In 1917, the two sisters made their way to New York City. Bessie had planned to become a doctor but ultimately decided to go to dental school. She graduated from Columbia University in 1923 and became the second black woman to work as a dentist in New York.
Known as "Dr. Bessie, Harlem's colored woman dentist," Dr. Delany socialized with Cab Calloway, W. E. B. Du Bois and the doyennes of the Harlem Renaissance. But she treated many of Harlem's poor, and in 27 years of practice never raised her rates. It was $2 for a cleaning and $5 for a silver filling, from 1923 until the day she retired, in 1950.
Like her sister Sarah, the first black home economics teacher in a New York City high school, she never married or had children. They referred to themselves as "Negro maiden ladies" and lived together in a Harlem apartment, in a Bronx cottage and finally in the Mt. Vernon home they bought in 1957.
With the death of their youngest sister, Laura, in 1993, they were the last survivors among their parents' children. When asked in a 1993 interview if she could account for her and her sister's longevity, Dr. Delany replied, "Honey, we never married; we never had husbands to worry us to death." As for mortality, she said, "I haven't been afraid to live, and I won't be afraid to die."
Recently Dr. Delany had become more frail, Ms. Hearth said. And in the time the two women knew each other, she often spoke about death, though with characteristic sass and humor. "She was worried she was too mean to get into heaven," Ms. Hearth remembered, laughing.
A funeral service is to be held on Thursday at 10:30 A.M. at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. And before the curtain rises on "Having Our Say" tonight, there will be a brief tribute at the Booth Theater.
In addition to her sister, Dr. Delany is survived by 14 nieces and nephews.

HEADLINE: Rock Promoters Vie for Manhattan

BYLINE: By NEIL STRAUSS 

 BODY:
Ron Delsener didn't become king of the rock-concert scene in New York City by accident: it was through a series of strategic moves. By negotiating exclusive contracts to promote concerts at halls like the Academy and Roseland, he encouraged new bands to remain loyal to his company. Thus did Mr. Delsener take over Manhattan several years ago from John Scher, his only significant rival. Mr. Scher continued to promote regularly at other places on the East Coast, including the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J., with an occasional foray into Madison Square Garden with the Grateful Dead or the Beacon with a smaller band. But for rock, Manhattan became essentially a one-promoter game.
Until today, that is, when promoter wars returned.
The crucial pawn was Irving Plaza, at 17 Irving Place, the smallest of Mr. Delsener's holdings. With a capacity of 900, Irving Plaza was the perfect place for Mr. Delsener to start young bands on his club circuit, moving them up to bigger venues: the Academy, Roseland, Jones Beach and, if their popularity continued to grow, Madison Square Garden. But Mr. Delsener didn't count on Irving Plaza's having a mind of its own. 
 "I was making no money, living hand to mouth," said Andrew Rasiej, one of the owners of Irving Plaza, about the club's exclusive contract with Mr. Delsener. Under this deal, which began in 1992, Irving Plaza received $500 a month in rent and was allowed to keep its revenue at the bar. All money made in ticket sales went to Delsener/Slater Enterprises, Mr. Delsener's company, which used it to pay the band and to cover advertising, insurance and other costs.
"When we initially signed on with Delsener/Slater, we were told by them that there were no profits to be made from a club this size, and that the only reason a promoter produces shows of this size is to establish a relationship with a band," Mr. Rasiej said. "But earlier this year we started doing our own research, and we discovered that the economics weren't what we were told they were. Delsener had made $250,000 since the beginning of our relationship, while we had lost exactly that much. We realized that we had to become promoters ourselves in order for the room to survive."
Mr. Delsener and his partner, Mitch Slater, both declined to be interviewed or to comment on Irving Plaza.
In April, when Delsener/Slater approached Irving Plaza about renewing its contract, Mr. Rasiej said, the club tried unsuccessfully to negotiate a deal in which it could cover its costs, thereby breaking even.
In the meantime, Mr. Scher's company, Metropolitan Entertainment, had been looking for just such an opportunity. "In September of 1993, I was given the mission of getting Metropolitan Entertainment back into New York City," said Carl Freed, who is in charge of the company's marketing and special projects. "It soon became clear that it was too difficult to open a new room in New York. The only way we could gain market share was for Ron and Mitch to lose a room. And with that mission, I went to help them do that."
Metropolitan Entertainment offered Irving Plaza a deal in which the club could promote all of its own shows and keep and distribute its box-office receipts, as well as have an equal share in the profits Metropolitan makes if a band that first performs at Irving Plaza moves on to a larger concert hall in the area. Irving Plaza's first concert under its new contract with Metropolitan, by the band Del Amitri, is to take place tonight, followed by 20 more concerts over the next month, ranging from the funk of Maceo Parker to the punk of Mike Watt to the dance music of the Chemical Brothers, a slightly more varied fare than in the past.
Unseating a promoter can have consequences. One concert-industry executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Mr. Delsener and Mr. Slater were "doing everything they can to shut Irving Plaza down."
Mr. Rasiej said: "They maintained a monopoly. I broke the monopoly, and they're upset. I wish them well."
Mr. Scher said he had decided to return to Manhattan because of a change in the musical climate. "We dominated the stepping-stone club level when we ran the uptown and downtown Ritz in the late 1980's," Mr. Scher said. "But, candidly, we found two harsh economic realities: Promoting clubs is a losing proposition and, when we looked back over 10 years of doing clubs, we found that only about three or four artists out of thousands had graduated to the arena level."
With the recent popularity of alternative rock, however, more and more bands are experiencing rapid success, enabling a promoter to shepherd them quickly from a small club to large arenas and big profits. All things equal, a band will generally remain loyal to the promoter who first took a chance on it. Green Day, for example, which performed a Delsener/Slater concert at Irving Plaza in March 1994, became successful enough to perform at the Nassau Coliseum by the end of the year.
For concert audiences, the fallout from battling promoters can be good and bad. "The concertgoer, for the most part, doesn't know or care who the promoters are," said Bob Grossweiner, the New York bureau chief of Performance, a concert-industry magazine. "But the booking agents are going to start aggressively offering their acts to both promoters to see who gives them the highest bids. The result might be that when the promoters are paying more for the acts, there will be a little bit of an increase in ticket prices. On the other hand, in the case of Irving Plaza, at least they're improving the sound system and the lights."
Irving Plaza isn't the only club shifting the balance of power between Mr. Scher and Mr. Delsener. Livent Inc., a Toronto-based company run by Garth Drabinsky, who has produced "Showboat" and "Kiss of the Spider Woman" on Broadway, recently announced that next year it would begin renovating the Academy on West 43d Street, turning it into a Broadway theater and thus depriving Mr. Delsener of the second step on his concert-hall ladder.
Metropolitan Entertainment, in the meantime, has been growing. Mr. Scher, who is producing "Victor/Victoria" on Broadway, said that in the next three or four months he would announce the opening of a new Manhattan concert space that holds 3,000 to 6,000 people. More significantly, Metropolitan Entertainment began a multimillion-dollar joint venture on Sept. 8 with the Ogden Corporation, among other things a concert site operator, which, Mr. Scher said, will enable him to "develop concert halls both large and small in the principle markets we're promoting."
Where promoter wars in Manhattan once meant races for bands, they have now become races for venues as well. It is impossible to promote a concert without a place to hold it, and with rising real estate costs and increasing community-board opposition to clubs, it is getting harder to do that. Mr. Delsener and Mr. Scher have been scrambling for a foot in the door of existing clubs. They both have their first concerts at the Westbeth Theater in Greenwich Village coming up this fall, and Mr. Delsener recently helped promote his first concert at Tramps, in Chelsea. But representatives of Tramps and the Westbeth Theater said they were not considering an exclusive contract with either promoter.
"I've been competing with Ronnie Delsener for a long, long time," Mr. Scher said. "When the Meadowlands first got built, Ronnie took me out to lunch and thought we should be partners on promoting shows there. I said, 'Let's see how much money you made at Madison Square Garden on artists I broke in metropolitan New York, and we'll split that money, then we'll talk.' He looked me in the eye and told me he was sorry he'd have to put me out of business.
"Clearly, he didn't succeed. This is a big enough city for two major promoters, and we're here to stay."

Cussle on Sixth
Young Innovators, a new showcase series planned as a low-cost alternative to Seventh on Sixth in Bryant Park, has found itself locked in battle with Seventh on Sixth organizers.
Darnell Brewster, the producer of Young Innovators, which is to take place Oct. 28 to Nov. 3, said relations had been smooth with Seventh on Sixth and the New York Fashion Calendar, which traditionally acts as a clearinghouse and referee for the scheduling of fashion events, until last week, when Seventh on Sixth learned that the designers Donald Deal and Violeta Villacorta were switching from the tents to Young Innovators. To Seventh on Sixth, the shift means a loss of $27,000. 
 Mr. Brewster said that Seventh on Sixth, in phone conversations and by letter, had tried to dictate when Young Innovator shows could be held, even though times had already been allotted by Ruth Finley, publisher of the calender. Conflicting times can mean press and retailer attention, or lack of it, to a designer.
In a letter to Mr. Brewster, Bruce Rayvid, the producer of Seventh on Sixth, laid out times and dates for Young Innovators shows. A copy of the letter was routed to Swerdlin & Hassid, Seventh on Sixth's lawyers.
Mr. Brewster said that among other things, the times given (on the last day of show week for example) were undesirable. He added that Mr. Rayvid also called designers participating in Young Innovators to pressure them to change their dates.
Charles Short, a producer and publicity agent, said he had recommended that his client Ms. Villacorta participate in Young Innovators.
"It's been very difficult," he said. "Ruth Finley told me something could be worked out." He added that the sense he got from the Council of Fashion Designers of America was "It's our week, we own the time slots."
Mr. Rayvid did not respond to requests for comment left with his office yesterday. Fern Mallis, the executive director of the C.F.D.A. and Seventh on Sixth, said the organization did not endorse strong-arm tactics to elicit cooperation from designers who may not want to show under the tents. She said she could not explain why Mr. Rayvid had routed a copy of his letter to the lawyers.
"It's just not the way we do business," she said. "I have many, many different groups all over town calling me trying to do alternative fashion events and I've said, 'Fine.' We work with everybody."
She admitted that Seventh on Sixth had asked Ms. Finley to hold slots open for undetermined Seventh on Sixth shows because it was financially necessary to fill the tents in every time slot.
As Seventh on Sixth has become established, its hold on the show week calendar has grown. But each season, some designers elect to show elsewhere, whether for economic or creative reasons, and report feeling pressure from the organization.
Last season, Marc Jacobs and his partner Robert Duffy clashed with Seventh on Sixth when they held a Monday night show that coincided with the C.F.D.A.'s press party.
 
Ghost Puts Men in Velvet
After several false starts over the last few years, Tanya Sarne, the British designer who creates under the much-followed Ghost label, has found the perfect moment to inaugurate a men's wear collection. The clothes, which are made from the same soft velvets and stretch fabrics that she uses in her women's line, reflect the new "playboy" element in men's fashion. "I quite like men to wear pretty, frilly clothes," she said. "Throughout history some of the most masculine have -- not just frilly clothes, but makeup, too. It's clothes for rock stars." The clothes will be in stores in December.
 
A Minimalist Collection
Ron Shamask, whose rich, understated designs were emblematic of SoHo's moneyed artists and intellectuals in the 80's, is reintroducing his women's collection for spring 1996. For the first few seasons, the line will be sold exclusively at Barneys New York, which licenses and sells Mr. Shamask's men's wear. "I'm trying to create a collection that's about shape and form," Mr. Shamask said. "It's purity and a Minimalist approach -- but I really didn't dig in the closet to rework the past, though."

HEADLINE: THE DOCTOR'S WORLD;
Why Many Trailblazing Scientists Must Wait Many Years for Awards

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D. 

 BODY:
MANY landmark scientific discoveries win prizes only years, even decades, later. Sometimes the lag reflects the time it takes to verify unorthodox findings or overcome long-held beliefs. Sometimes a discovery is so far ahead of its time that years pass before its significance is understood. In other instances, the delay reflects an establishment's habitual resistance to new ideas and endless foot-dragging by the scientists who nominate and serve on the award juries.
Consider Dr. Barry J. Marshall, who was among the winners of this year's Albert Lasker Awards, which were announced yesterday. Dr. Marshall was honored for finding that a bacterium, not stress, causes inflammation of the stomach and ulcers. The research was partly based on experiments he did on himself in the early 1980's. 
 More recently, other scientists have linked the bacterium, known as Helicobacter pylori, to cancer of the stomach. And scientific reports say that antibiotics appear to cure one rare form of stomach cancer.
Dr. Marshall is a brash Australian whose original findings were dismissed outright by many of the world's leading gastroenterologists and other specialists when they were published in The Medical Journal of Australia and in The Lancet. In 1986, he moved to the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.
It was only last year that a consensus meeting held by the National Institutes of Health said that antibiotics should be added to conventional treatments for ulcers, and the Lasker prize is one of the few awards that Dr. Marshall has received. Why was it so long in coming?
Human nature is one reason, said Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, the heart surgeon from Baylor University in Houston who has served as chairman of the Lasker jury for 30 years.
When scientists come up with a bold new idea, "there is usually a certain amount of reservation," Dr. DeBakey said in an interview. "Almost everybody is against it right away, and it takes a certain amount of time for the new idea to be validated. Then, five years later you cannot find anybody who objected to it!"
Science is inherently cautious. "It is inevitable that a certain amount of time passes before a good idea is recognized by one's peers, and while we may bemoan the length of the gap, there is some protection in having it," Dr. DeBakey said.
Nominations for Lasker Awards are made by officials of medical schools and research institutes and by former winners, independent of the voting jury. Members of the jury are assigned to review the work of nominees in preparation for the discussion that precedes the voting. It is a system similar to that used by the Nobel committee in Stockholm.
A delay of "10 to 15 years is about average," Dr. DeBakey said. "Sometimes it is much longer, and you feel badly about that."
Often there is a delay in recognition after a seminal finding until "people begin to realize that so many current findings are based on an original finding 30 years ago," Dr. DeBakey said.
Dr. Marshall's wait is short compared with some others.
Dr. Peyton Rous waited 48 years to receive his Lasker and 55 years for his Nobel Prize for cancer research. Dr. Joseph Murray waited 36 years before receiving his Nobel Prize after performing a pioneering kidney transplant operation.
Dr. Rosalyn S. Yalow won a Lasker Award in 1976 and a Nobel Prize in 1977, many years after she and Dr. Solomon A. Berson at the Bronx Veterans Administration Hospital developed the radioimmunoassay technique to detect tiny amounts of hormones and other substances. By 1976, Dr. Berson had died, an illustration that prize-worthy scientists need the good fortune to survive until their work is recognized. Posthumous Nobel Prizes and Lasker awards are not given.
Most award juries and sponsors play to safety, in no small part because of the embarrassment many have suffered after the findings that led to an award fell apart.
A Nobel committee, for example, awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1926 to Dr. Johannes Fibiger, a Dane, for the discovery that stomach cancer in rats was caused by a nematode parasite. Committee members believed that a similar parasite might cause stomach cancer in humans.
Though severe doubts soon arose about Dr. Fibiger's research, it was not until 1952 that other researchers could conclusively refute it, in part because Dr. Fibiger used strains of wild rats that others could not obtain.
Despite such errors, some science prize committees do reward scientists for controversial research.
Last year, for example, the Lasker committee gave an award to Dr. Stanley B. Prusiner, a neurologist at the University of California at San Francisco, for his research inferring the existence of a new class of disease agents called prions, even though he has not proved their existence to everyone's satisfaction.
The Nobel awards were created by the will of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish chemist and inventor of dynamite. Yet the prizes almost did not come into being. The King of Sweden and the Prime Minister went to court to fight Nobel's will in part because they believed that his wealth would be scattered around the world, to Sweden's loss.
Despite the Swedish Government's concerns, the Nobels have brought enormous political, economic and cultural benefits to Sweden. The Nobels are now considered the gold standard of scientific prizes, despite richer prizes from other groups.
The Nobels are considered a critical factor in keeping Sweden in the forefront of science. Committee members come from the ranks of that country's leading research centers and universities. They write extensive reports on the nominees' scientific contributions that help keep Swedish researchers continually aware of the cutting edge of science.
The Lasker Awards have often been called the American Nobels, largely because 52 of 275 winners have gone on to win Nobels.
Although the Lasker Awards for medical research are celebrating their 50th anniversary this year, they are nearly a half century younger than the Nobels, which were first awarded in 1901 and are due to be awarded next month.
In his will, Nobel said that the awards should be given for discoveries made the previous year. But Nobel committees have become much more conservative.
One reason that the Lasker and Nobel prizes have had continuing impact is that they are awarded by independent groups that generally have not succumbed to making the type of self-serving awards made by so many industrial or private interest group sponsors.
The Lasker Awards have reflected a mixture of politics and science.
In 1942, Mary W. Lasker, who died at age 93 in 1994, and her husband Albert, an advertising pioneer, created the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation to raise public awareness about major diseases and the need for increased research funding to conquer them. Though substantial, the foundation's $20 million assets are smaller than many others.
Yet Mrs. Lasker's influence was far greater than the amount of money she spent. She recognized that the nature of medicine was changing after World War II from a private system to a public institution. She contributed to the growth of Government support for research and helped direct where those funds would be spent by lobbying Congress and Presidents. Although the research benefited scientists and medical schools, many often resented her efforts as an intrusion on their independence and expertise.
"Her lobbying was even more effective than lobbyists who went with large amounts of money," Dr. DeBakey said. "She went with ideas and with what might be called humanitarian concerns, and it was very difficult to oppose that. After a while she gained the confidence of political leaders, and she was treated like royalty when she visited their office.'
Mrs. Lasker traded on the station that the Lasker awards gave her. "While she was lobbying for science, she was also achieving a certain prestige in science with her awards," Dr. DeBakey said.

HEADLINE: Geochemist Says Oil FieldsMay Be Refilled Naturally

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE 

 BODY:
COULD it be that many of the world's oil fields are refilling themselves at nearly the same rate they are being drained by an energy-hungry world?
A geochemist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts says she believes that hitherto undetected gas and oil reservoirs lying at very great depths within the earth's crust could stave off the inevitable oil depletion much longer than many experts have estimated. 
The scientist, Dr. Jean K. Whelan, whose research is part of a $2 million Department of Energy exploration program in the Gulf of Mexico south of New Orleans, has found evidence of differences in the composition of oil over periods of time as it flows from greater to shallower depths. By gauging degradative chemical changes in the oil resulting from action by oil-eating bacteria, she infers that oil is moving in quite rapid spurts from great depths to reservoirs closer to the surface.
Skeptics of Dr. Whelan's hypothesis acknowledge that oil is almost certainly flowing into certain reservoirs from somewhere, but say her explanation remains to be proved, as does the exact extent of the phenomenon.
A site in the gulf of particular interest to the Pennzoil Exploration and Production Company and several independent scientific teams, including Dr. Whelan's group, is Eugene Island Block 330, which is not an island but a patch of sea floor 700 feet beneath the water's surface. Discovered in 1972, an oil reservoir some 6,000 feet beneath Eugene Island 330 is one of the world's most productive oil sources; it has yielded more than one billion barrels, or 42 billion gallons, and is still going strong.
But Eugene Island 330 is remarkable for another reason: Its estimated reserves have declined much less than experts had predicted on the basis of its production rate.
Dr. Whelan's somewhat controversial hypothesis is a possible explanation.
Although the reservoir from which Pennzoil is pumping oil was formed at the time of the Pleistocene epoch less than two million years ago, oil now being recovered from the reservoir has a chemical signature characteristic of the Jurassic period, which ended more than 150 million years ago, Dr. Whelan said. The implication, she believes, is that highly pressurized oil from lower levels of "stacked" reservoirs is frequently breaking through geological barriers and "burping" upward, eventually reaching the reservoir from which oil is being pumped. The source of the pressurized gas Dr. Whelan believes to be powering the process is a bed of Jurassic period "source rocks," more than 30,000 feet deep, which are rich in very hot hydrocarbons.
Oil created during the Jurassic period from the decayed bodies of plants and animals that lived during the age of dinosaurs would initially have been a liquid, but in some cases, geological processes are believed to have gradually dragged oil reservoirs downward to great depths, where pressures are enormous and temperatures are greater than 700 degrees Fahrenheit. Under these conditions, oil is "cooked," decomposing into hydrocarbon gases consisting mainly of methane.
The methane, however, cannot exist in its normal gaseous form at such pressures and temperatures, but is transformed into a "supercritical fluid" -- neither a gas nor a liquid but something in between. Large amounts of oil can be dissolved in supercritical methane, and the oil-and-methane mixture is probably capable of flowing upward from deep reservoirs through faults, cracks and geological "plumbing" to higher reservoirs. At the higher levels where temperatures and pressures are lower, methane can no longer remain in its supercritical state, and the mixture of gas and oil separates into its respective components.
"It could be," Dr. Whelan said, "that at some sites, particularly where there is a lot of faulting in the rock, a reservoir from which oil is being pumped might be a steady-state system -- one that is replenished by deeper reserves as fast as oil is pumped out." Extensive fault systems like those along the California coast might offer such a geological environment, she said.
The discovery that oil seepage is continuous and extensive from many ocean vents lying above fault zones has convinced many scientists that oil is making its way up through the faults from much deeper deposits. Faulting associated with such seepage is common along the Pacific Coast, in parts of the North Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico, among other areas, Dr. Whelan said.
The amounts and types of hydrocarbons lying at great depths are highly uncertain, because oil companies have had little incentive to sink exploratory wells to depths of 20,000 feet or greater. The cost of drilling increases exponentially with depth, and there are still ample supplies of oil in relatively shallow reservoirs.
Dr. K. K. Bissada, a geochemist at Texaco Inc. in Houston, is doubtful that a true steady state exists in reservoirs that seem to be refilling themselves.
"I think we pump oil out much faster than oil can come in," he said. "But from a long-term perspective, I believe that hydrocarbons are coming in from great depths and are filling the newer reservoirs at shallower depths.
"It's impossible to put a number on the rate at which this goes on," Dr. Bissada said, "but I could imagine that this kind of stacked reservoir system, with favorable geologic plumbing between the reservoirs, might refill the upper reservoirs in, say, 10 or 20 years. If we were to go back to some old oil field that had been abandoned 50 years ago, we might drill a test well, and we might find fresh oil. The trouble is that that kind of experiment is too expensive in the present economic climate."
A recent report from the Department of Energy Task Force on Strategic Energy Research and Development concluded from the Woods Hole project that "these new data and interpretations strongly suggest that the oil and gas in the Eugene Island field could be treated as a steady-state rather than a fixed resource."
The report added, "Preliminary analysis also suggests that similar phenomena may be taking place in other producing areas, including the deep-water Gulf of Mexico and the Alaskan North Slope."
Dr. Thomas Ahlbrandt, chief of the United States Geological Survey's Petroleum Geology Branch in Denver, is among many skeptics who believe that the Woods Hole hypothesis has not been demonstrated, although experts appear to agree that an increase in estimated reserves is occurring at many sites.
"I have the impression that although the people who drilled at Eugene Island encountered a fault plane," Dr. Ahlbrandt said, "they did not find oil coming up through it. On the other hand, drilling is a high-risk proposition, and the fact that it didn't produce oil doesn't necessarily make the hypothesis wrong."
There is much evidence that deep reserves of hydrocarbon fuels remain to be tapped. A recent estimate by the Geological Survey of "conventional" oil resources within the 48 states and state waters offshore has doubled America's estimated oil reserves since the last estimate was prepared in 1989. Dr. Ahlbrandt said that the estimate of continental American oil resources was 60 billion barrels, up from 30 billion in 1989.
But Dr. Ahlbrandt hastens to add that this does not mean that prospectors are finding large new oil fields; it means that "people are becoming more clever at finding and extracting hydrocarbons from previously overlooked resources."
This results from a trend oil experts call "field growth."
In some cases, he said, an oil company may discover an oil field, pump it almost dry, and then, using new seismic techniques that produce three-dimensional images of the fine details of deep geological structures, discover that an unsuspected and untapped extension of the field exists in some new direction.
In other cases, Dr. Ahlbrandt said, prospectors may find new reservoirs by drilling beneath old ones, penetrating salt barriers that had obstructed seismic probes. Finally, oil companies sometimes unknowingly drill right through oil-rich deposits on their way to reservoirs they had identified at greater depths. From such drill holes, oil is sometimes discovered simply by piercing the drill casing with a few holes at relatively shallow depths and analyzing the fluid that flows into the pipe.
But petroleum experts agree that no one has more than a vague notion of how much gas and oil remain in the world, or how long it will last.
The Geological Survey recently estimated that the world has about 1.7 trillion barrels of oil from conventional sources, enough for about 75 years at current production rates. However, if the consumption of oil should increase at a modest 3 percent annually, the survey estimates, production could be maintained for only about 31 years.
But Dr. Edward D. Porter, senior economist at the American Petroleum Institute, says that the uncertainties are so large that the implied precision of such calculations should not be taken seriously. "The estimate of world oil resources could be off by as much as 700 billion barrels," he said.
Many past predictions have been wildly inaccurate. One of the better forecasts was made in the early 1970's by M. King Hubbard, a geologist, who predicted a peak in petroleum production in 1972, followed by a slow decline.
"Hubbard was pretty much correct about the trend of United States production, which has been declining during the last two decades," Dr. Ahlbrandt said, "but he extended that forecast to the world, and that was wrong. World production has not yet peaked, although many experts believe it will start declining in about 2015 or 2020."
The United States, he said, "is still the world's leading oil producer, although the Persian Gulf states own about two-thirds of the world's oil supply."
"They just curb their production rate," he added.
Possible improvements in technology could make a big difference, Dr. Porter said. New seismic techniques, in which sound waves are reflected or bent by geological structures, can now be interpreted to reveal very small oil reservoirs and other details of deep geological formations. Three-dimensional seismic technology, as well as measurements of the electrical conductivity of rock and other methods developed during the last decade "are as much better than old methods than is clinical magnetic resonance imaging better than conventional X-rays," he said.
Another imponderable is the future rate of oil and gas consumption, he said.
To some extent, consumption depends on the price of oil, but this, Dr. Porter said, is impossible to predict. Production curbs by oil-producing nations have effects on price that can be easily calculated, he said, but in the absence of such constraints, "the price of oil fluctuates chaotically."
Future prices will affect not only consumption but the willingness of oil companies to invest in the extraction of petroleum products from nonconventional sources -- tar sands, heavy oil and perhaps even shale. Experts estimate that 10 times as much petroleum is tied up in such sources than in conventional reservoirs, but the cost of recovering it is high.
The research needed to develop new sources is also expensive, and oil companies, together with many American industries, are reducing such expenditures.
"Everyone is scaling back research," said Dr. Bissada of Texaco.

HEADLINE: Seeking to Avoid Carter Comparisons, President Refines Comments

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
President Clinton wants to make one thing perfectly clear.
"Malaise is a state of mind," he said today, touching his finger to his tanned temple. "Funk is something you can bounce out of." 
 Worried about the parallels that have been drawn between his promise on Friday night to lead the nation out of its funk and Jimmy Carter's promise to lead America out of malaise, a vow that did much to sour Mr. Carter's re-election campaign, Mr. Clinton took pains today to make sure that his campaign does not get off on a downbeat.
At a press lunch in the White House, he said he had made a poor choice of words, and stressed, over and over again, that he was "very optimistic" and "feeling good" and that the country was not in a funk.
"I think if you were betting on which country is likely to be in the strongest shape 20, 30 years from now in the 21st century," he said, "you'd have to bet on the United States because of the strength and diversity of our economy and our society."
Mr. Clinton told reporters on Air Force One on Friday night that he was trying to lead people away from their "funk," which he described as anger about government, unease with the pace of technological change and fears for their jobs. To do that, he said, he wanted to talk more, explaining that he had not been talking to voters enough about "the big picture."
But after two days of unflattering comparisons in television reports with Mr. Carter, another Southern President, Mr. Clinton wanted to refine his comments a bit. He said he had been talking about how Americans felt in 1994, not 1995.
"I think it would be difficult to convince people that I am advocating a politics of national funk," he said. He warned reporters not to distort his words, while Vice President Al Gore walked behind him, pointed to their notebooks and jokingly spelled: "F-U-N-K."
Mr. Clinton is clearly into his campaign talking mode. He spent more than an hour at the lunch discoursing on Gen. Colin L. Powell, Speaker Newt Gingrich and President George Bush; his mistakes in office; the things that were perceived as mistakes but that he says were not; the things for which he thinks he does not get enough credit, and his "marketing" strategy for 1996.
When his spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, tried to get the President to leave right away for a national security meeting on Bosnia, Mr. Clinton testily brushed him off. He said: "That meeting's at 2:15. That's when I called it for."
Mr. Clinton stayed so much longer to talk that Mr. McCurry desperately tried again, saying, "Let's go, boss." Mr. Clinton, who had moved on to family values, still ignored him.
The President made his remarks at a session of that most peculiar Washington institution: a meal, usually breakfast, arranged between newsmakers and journalists by Godfrey Sperling Jr., a columnist for The Christian Science Monitor.
The White House presented Mr. Sperling, who was celebrating his 80th birthday, with a cake decorated with a replica of one of the high-cholesterol meals served at the breakfasts: coffee, Danish pastries, eggs, bacon and potatoes. Then, as the official White House transcript put it rather drily: "(Happy Birthday is sung to Mr. Sperling.) (Applause.) End. 1:47 P.M. E.D.T."
Like other Presidential candidates, Mr. Clinton at first tried to ignore the issue of Mr. Powell as a potential challenger for the White House. He refused to answer one question about Mr. Powell's strong popularity and deflected another about whether a black man could win the White House.
But he eagerly responded to a question about the "defining differences" between himself and Mr. Powell -- by listing all the things on which he and Mr. Powell agree. As he spoke, it was apparent that Mr. Clinton had studied Mr. Powell's public words in great detail.
"I was grateful for what he said about abortion, that he didn't want to criminalize it but that we should reduce it and emphasize adoption more because that's what I've worked very hard to do," Mr. Clinton said.
He said, "And I was grateful for what he said about affirmative action." He added, "All I can say to you is that on those statements that he has made, I am profoundly appreciative. I think it's helped America to kind of stay in the sensible center."
Mr. Clinton bristled when he was asked about Mr. Gingrich, denouncing the House Speaker's threat to have the Government default on its debts if there is no agreement on other issues like welfare and Medicare. "I'm not going to be blackmailed," he said.
But, for the most part, as he tries to make headway against the Republican domination of Washington, Mr. Clinton was eager to keep the tone positive. He took credit for the new Palestinian-Israeli agreement and progress in Bosnia as "examples of the imperative for United States leadership."
Mr. Clinton said he was determined not to repeat the mistakes of Mr. Bush, on which Mr. Clinton, as a candidate, had pounced so eagerly in 1992. "George Bush never got anyone to associate him with any achievement besides Desert Storm," Mr. Clinton said.
So at the first invitation, he rattled off what he considers his accomplishments. "The economy is in better shape," he said. "We passed the toughest crime bill in American history, and it's plainly playing a role in driving the crime rate down throughout the country. When there was no action on welfare reform, we gave two-thirds of the states, I think more than two-thirds now, the right to pursue their own reforms. And we have lowered the cost and increased the availability of a college education."
Mr. Clinton took exception to the suggestion that he needed to produce fresh ideas to compete with the Republicans in Congress. Echoing the convictions of other incumbent Presidents in trouble, including Mr. Bush, he said he had to do a better job of getting his words across.
"I may have a marketing problem," he said. "I do not have a substantive problem." If George Bush had made smarter choices about buying 30-second spots in 1992, he could have received credit for the Clean Air Act and other achievements, Mr. Clinton said.
The President said he had made mistakes in his first years in office, including "making a lot of people mad" at first. But he insisted that the issue he had made one of his first priorities in office -- allowing gay men and women to serve openly in the military -- had been forced on him by the Republicans.
Mr. Clinton, who has often seemed to enjoy campaigning more than the gritty reality of governing, spoke openly of his eagerness to return to the stump. He even noted with relish that he had lost weight.
"Ten more pounds to go," he said.

HEADLINE: Safety Plan Too Little For Mayor

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
Students at Adlai E. Stevenson High School in the South Bronx call the hallway outside the school cafeteria Belt Alley.
It got that name because students stop there every morning to put their belts back on after removing them so they can walk through the school's new metal detectors. 
 While belt buckles rarely set off metal detectors at airports, they do at Stevenson because the school's detectors are set to ferret out not only guns and knives. They must also find the student weapon of choice: box cutters.
These highly sensitive metal detectors, newly deployed at 34 schools this year, are part of the school system's response to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's repeated calls for a Police Department takeover of the school system's safety division. The Board of Education has begun implementing a range of changes intended to reduce crime and violence in schools and to upgrade a division that the Mayor has targeted with unrelenting criticism.
Mr. Giuliani set his sights on the 3,000-employee school safety division last spring, after a number of incidents involving officers charged with sexually abusing students. The scandal prompted the Mayor to create a commission to investigate school security and to demand that the Police Department be allowed to screen school security applicants, train them at the Police Academy and supervise them on the job.
And despite the changes the school board has made, Mr. Giuliani repeated his attacks on the Board of Education at a news conference yesterday while also offering several initiatives of his own. Although most of them have been in place for some time, he proposed one new program that would increase the presence of undercover police officers outside 40 schools throughout the city. The officers would look for students buying or selling drugs.
Even as he discussed that idea, the Mayor derided the school board's commitment to school safety once again.
"The current situation regarding crime in New York City schools is unacceptable," he said.
But board members insist that school security should remain under their jurisdiction, and they have begun their own safety overhaul.
Stevenson is one of 34 high schools and junior high schools in New York City that were given walk-through metal detectors and X-ray machines for bags this year. The equipment scans everyone who enters a school. Last year, the school system installed walk-through detectors in about 20 schools. Before that, the schools used hand-held metal scanners, which allow guards to conduct random checks of only about 10 to 20 percent of a school's students each day. .
Two weeks after installation, the metal detectors and X-ray conveyor belts have already become a humdrum part of the morning routine for Stevenson's 4,000 students.
"I guess it's good for my safety," Luis A. Sanchez, a junior at Stevenson, said while slipping a leather belt back around his waist.
"They got to get it together, though," he added, complaining that backups at the door, as students took off their belts and got ready to walk through the metal detector, had made him late for his first-period class.
The introduction of the metal detectors is just one of several innovations that Philip Tama, the school safety division's interim director, has introduced this year, these among them:
*The division's borough chiefs make unannounced visits to the schools to increase supervision of the security officers.
*Job candidates will be given psychological tests as part of the standard evaluation.
*New officers will receive 12 weeks of training instead of 10.
*For the next class of safety officers, who will enter the division's training academy in November, the minimum age has been raised to 23 from 21.
*Preference will be given to job candidates with college degrees, military experience and knowledge of a foreign language. Previously, a high school diploma was the only requirement, and other education or experience was not taken into account.
Mr. Tama also is negotiating with union officials to turn 300 senior security officers at high schools and junior high schools into mid-level supervisors by giving them the power to evaluate and discipline other officers in their schools.
"I have to improve the integrity and the perception of professionalism of this division," Mr. Tama said. "Everybody says it's broken and it can't stay the way it is. I hope I can fix enough of it before it disappears."
But despite these recent changes and others that are proposed, Mayor Giuliani has become increasingly impatient with the board's progress. He renewed his criticism of the division when the board recently released statistics showing a 16 percent increase in the number of reported incidents at public schools -- an increase board officials attribute largely to improved reporting.
"The school system has a level of crime that is unacceptable," the Mayor complained last week. "We are perilously close, in some communities, to the schools' being the most dangerous place in the community, and that has to change."
When part-time guards were first placed in schools in the late 1960's, largely in response to disruptions at schools caused by civil rights sit-ins and riots, candidate screening was minimal and many of the guards came from the ranks of the chronically unemployed. But board and safety officials say the force has come a long way since then.
Dressed uniformly in white shirts and gray slacks, safety officers now patrol all but a handful of the city's more than 1,000 schools. Elementary schools usually have an officer who primarily sits at the main entrance to screen visitors. High schools have 10 to 20 regular officers who patrol halls and look for weapons. They all wear the gold badges of "peace officers," a police designation that legally authorizes them to make arrests, confiscate firearms, and conduct warrantless searches. Although they carry handcuffs and radios, they do not carry weapons.
School officials say keeping school guards unarmed is the main reason they oppose having police officers patrol school halls.
"Only a noneducator would suggest having police officers assigned to schools," said Alan Weiner, the principal of Stevenson High School. He said armed officers could easily be jostled and lose their weapons in the controlled chaos that breaks out seven times a day when several hundred teen-agers jam the school's halls during a change in periods.
Having armed officers would also undercut efforts to rid the school of all weapons, he argued. That is a goal that the new metal detectors already seem to have accomplished. In the week since the detectors were installed at Stevenson, guards found only one box cutter, and it was discarded in the school yard. The only other weapons found were carried by parents visiting the school.
"Unfortunately, this is no way to go to school," Stephen P. Kam, a school safety supervisor, said as he pointed to the more than $80,000 in weapons detection equipment at Stevenson and the hundreds of students marching indifferently through the metal detectors."But it's reality," he said. "And at least now they know that while they're in the building, they're safe."

HEADLINE: Global Warming, Unfortunately, Is All Too Real;
Wood Replenishes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Sept. 10 front-page article on global warming couples burning of wood with burning of coal and oil as the culprits, a mistake repeated in your Sept. 18 front-page article. 
 Burning fossil fuels -- coal, oil and natural gas -- all contribute carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, but wood is constantly being replenished, removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and replenishing our oxygen supply in the process of photosynthesis, thereby offsetting carbon dioxide production and oxygen depletion in the burning process.
But wood growth and burning are not simply a zero sum if we adopt enlightened social policies and economic incentives to increase tree growth. Aside from the global impact on climate, trees afford enormous local benefits of esthetics, shade, of habitat for wildlife, and of wood for use in our country's 25 million fireplaces.
Woodburning with modern technology can provide a supplement of 125,000 megawatts to the country's power supply. That is the power rating of 12 Grand Coulee dams or of all the nuclear power stations in the country. That supplement can enable fossil-fuel-burning utilities with winter power peaks to shave those peaks, and if tree production is encouraged, can reduce carbon buildup in the atmosphere at no cost to utilities but with substantial fuel savings to them and to customers with a cheap source of wood.
And the benefits are of indefinite duration.

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
During the 1970's, ANGELA DAVIS, the black power advocate, was imprisoned in California on kidnapping and murder charges in connection with the invasion of a San Rafael, Calif., courthouse to free black prisoners. At that time, social and political advocates in Cuba joined the international movement to secure her release.
Last week, Ms. Davis returned to Cuba for the first time in 20 years, as part of a delegation from the United States-Cuba Medical Project to deliver a $5 million shipment of medicines and medical supplies. It was the single largest donation from the project, said LESLIE CAGEN, its director. 
 "The United States Government's continued embargo against Cuba seems to have no purpose, except that of making a difficult economic situation in Cuba much worse," Ms. Davis said yesterday from Vassar College, where she is a visiting professor of philosophy. "The people of America should know that people are dying as a result of their inability to purchase medicines to heal them."
The delegation, which returned to the United States on Sunday, included ALICE WALKER, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author; PRATIBA PARMA, the British film maker; KATHY ENGEL, the president of Riptide Communications, a New York company active in social causes, and Ms. Cagen. Founded three years ago, the project raises money to send medicines and medical supplies to Cuba.
Ms. Cagen said that Ms. Davis was considered "a bit of a folk hero" in Cuba and that many Cubans recognized Ms. Walker, not by sight but by her work.
"Her books have been translated into Spanish, and 'The Color Purple' has been shown in Cuba," she said.

HEADLINE: Prosecutor Eager to Present Capital Case in Girl's Death

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Even before the body of a 7-year-old girl was removed from a shallow grave outside Kingston on Monday, the Ulster County District Attorney, E. Michael Kavanaugh, confidently declared that he had the state's first capital case on his hands.
Mr. Kavanaugh, an outspoken supporter of the death penalty, moved quickly to build what he believes is an airtight case. Forensic experts from the F.B.I. were called in. And the prosecutor said the girl had been killed during a kidnapping, a scenario that would meet New York State's narrow definitions of first-degree murder under its new death penalty law. 
 Despite the painstaking groundwork, a capital prosecution of the 25-year-old suspect, Lawrence Whitehurst, will be complicated, lengthy and far from certain in its outcome, as has been the case in other states that have written laws carefully guarding against the misuse of the death penalty, defense lawyers and other legal experts said today.
Indeed, prosecutors across New York say they have come to realize that the state's first death penalty law in more than two decades, which took effect Sept. 1, is written so narrowly that it will be difficult to prosecute even the most shocking of murders as capital cases.
"I think he's going to have his work cut out in this case," said James Catterson, the chairman of the New York Prosecutors Training Institute, which has been providing instruction on the new law.
"He may well not have the facts to support murder in the first," Mr. Catterson added, noting that Mr. Kavanaugh will have to prove that Mr. Whitehurst intended to kill the girl, Rickel Knox, while committing another crime, like rape or kidnapping.
For example, a defense lawyer could argue that there was no kidnapping because the girl knew Mr. Whitehurst and may have entered his car voluntarily, said Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. "Kidnapping will have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and if someone saw her get into his car, that might not be sufficient in and of itself," he said.
Mr. Kavanaugh is apparently satisfied with the evidence that he already has, saying that he plans to ask a grand jury for a first-degree murder indictment next week, even though the law allows prosecutors up to 45 days to present a case before a grand jury and a further 120 days after an indictment to investigateand formally declare that they will seek the death penalty.
This case "clearly qualifies" as a first-degree case, Mr. Kavanaugh said, declining to discuss the evidence beyond saying that he believes Rickel Knox, a second grader, had been kidnapped by Mr. Whitehurst, an unemployed grocery clerk who knew the girl's family in Kingston, a town about 100 miles north of New York City. "This, in my view, is not close," he said.
Rickel disappeared on Thursday afternoon while playing in front of her house. Mr. Whitehurst, who was questioned by investigators for several days, eventually led investigators to a wooded area on the outskirts of Kingston where the girl was buried under a pile of twigs and debris that covered all but a foot.
Mr. Kavanaugh said he won Mr. Whitehurst's cooperation by agreeing to sign a plea bargain that he never felt obligated to uphold. "It's as though someone put a gun to my head and asked me to sign a promissory note," he said. "We knew time was running out and we knew that he knew where she was."
Since his arrest early Sunday, Mr. Whitehurst has tried twice to hang himself in his cell in Ulster County Jail, Police Chief James Riggins of Kingston told The Associated Press. Both times, the police stopped him, Chief Riggins said.
Mr. Kavanaugh's swift decision to seek the death penalty has been criticized by civil liberties lawyers who said that he may have acted prematurely.
Several lawyers noted that the law attempts to avoid hasty conclusions by prosecutors through the provision that gives them 120 days after an indictment to decide whether the evidence supports capital prosecution.
"You would hope that district attorneys would approach these cases as coolly and dispassionately as they can," said Russell Neufeld, director of the New York City Legal Aid Society's Capital Defense Unit.
Mr. Kavanaugh himself acknowledged that he decided that the case was eligible under the new law even before the girl's body had been removed and forensic tests had been completed. But he said the evidence -- including a witness who saw the girl enter Mr. Whitehurst's car -- pointed to kidnapping.
Legal experts also said that another potential problem in the case might be the ruse of a plea-bargain agreement with the suspect. In the agreement, prosecutors offered him a sentence of 10 years to life if Rickel were found alive and 15 years to life if she were found dead, in return for his leading them to her.
But Mr. Kavanaugh said on Monday, after the girl was found dead, that he would have made a deal with anyone as long there was a chance of finding the girl alive.

HEADLINE: PLAN FOR SAVINGS IN SOCIAL SECURITY

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Senators from both parties suggested today that the Government could solve some of its budget problems by slowing the growth of Social Security benefits paid to 43 million people.
President Clinton has threatened to veto any bill that carries out Republican plans to help balance the budget by cutting projected spending on Medicare and Medicaid by $452 billion, or 16 percent, in the next seven years. As a possible alternative, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said the Government could reduce the annual cost-of-living adjustment in Social Security benefits. The current formula overstates inflation, he said. 
 Mr. Moynihan's comments came on a day of fast-paced maneuvering on Capitol Hill, as lawmakers said it might be necessary to scale back the tax cut and the Medicare savings initially demanded by Republicans. Some Republican senators expressed doubts about the wisdom of cutting taxes at the same time they were exacting big savings in Medicare and Medicaid.
Senator Moynihan said the Consumer Price Index, now used to compute annual increases in Social Security benefits, invariably overstated the rise in the cost of living. He said the Government could save $281 billion during seven years if the cost-of-living adjustment were based on the Consumer Price Index minus one percentage point, as a panel of economists recommended earlier this month.
"The money is sitting there, asking to be picked up," Mr. Moynihan said in an interview.
Lawmakers from both parties leapt at his suggestion, which may offer a way for them to wriggle out of a confrontation with Mr. Clinton and to reduce the large sums that must otherwise be squeezed from Medicare and Medicaid.
On the other hand, it is a legislative truism that Social Security is a program politicians touch at their peril. Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, said Mr. Clinton must be involved in any effort to change Social Security. "If this is going to work, we've got to be in it together," said Mr. Dole, who hopes to take Mr. Clinton's job after the 1996 Presidential election. "It will happen only if everybody sort of joins hands."
The White House did not dismiss the idea. "Many economists believe that the Consumer Price Index somewhat overstates increases in the cost of living," Gene B. Sperling, deputy assistant to the President for economic policy, said today. "But there is significant disagreement as to the degree of the overestimation." Mr. Clinton's press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, said the revision suggested by Mr. Moynihan was "too large."
John C. Rother, chief lobbyist at the American Association of Retired Persons, said: "The effort to make the Consumer Price Index a more accurate measure of inflation is laudable. But a reduction of one percentage point a year -- one-third of the likely cost-of-living adjustment -- probably goes beyond what is truly justified according to Government experts."
Mr. Rother said that it would be hard for elderly people to accept higher Medicare premiums, as proposed by Republicans in Congress, if the purchasing power of their Social Security benefits was going down.
Senator Moynihan did not give details of his proposal. The figure he cited, $281 billion, reflects the amounts that would be saved by altering the cost-of-living formula for several benefit programs, including Social Security, Civil Service retirement and military pensions. It also includes $98 billion of additional tax revenue that would be collected because changes in the Consumer Price Index imply changes in income tax brackets and the personal exemption.
There was much talk of Social Security at today's meeting of the Senate Finance Committee, which was called to deal with Medicare and Medicaid, the health programs for more than 70 million people who are elderly, disabled or poor.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, said that Mr. Moynihan, in proposing to slow the growth of Social Security benefits, "has pointed to something that required some courage, and offers some hope and opportunity" to members of Congress.
Mr. D'Amato, like other senators, seemed to assume that squeezing money out of the giant Social Security program would allow Congress to reduce the amount that must be extracted from Medicare and Medicaid. "The President is going to veto this," he said, referring to Republican proposals as they stand now. "The best effort we make, it's going to be vetoed."
If Republicans can find some of the budget savings they seek in Social Security, Mr. D'Amato said, then states like New York will have some time to cut back their Medicaid programs without forcing a sudden disruption. New York has an unusually generous Medicaid program, he said. But he added: "We can't just stop the stretch limousine, throw out the poor people and replace it with a Volkswagen. We need time for a transition."
On Friday, the House Commerce Committee approved legislation that would dismantle the current Medicaid program and give each state a lump sum, or "block grant," to finance health care for the poor. A private research institute, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said that under that bill, New York State would lose $25 billion, or 21 percent, of the money it could expect to receive under current law in the next seven years.
Senators John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming and Don Nickles of Oklahoma, all Republicans, said they supported Mr. Moynihan's proposal to change the formula for computing cost-of-living adjustments in Social Security. (One problem with the Consumer Price Index is that it uses a standard market basket of goods and services that do not change as quickly as people's buying habits. Many people, for example, buy pork or poultry if beef becomes too expensive, but the shift is not immediately reflected in the index.)
Economists have argued for years that the Consumer Price Index exaggerates inflation. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said in January that the Government could save billions by "correcting" this bias. The panel of economists that recommended such changes on Sept. 14 was appointed by Mr. Moynihan and Senator Bob Packwood, the Oregon Republican who was chairman of the Finance Committee but resigned after accusations of official and sexual misconduct.
The targets for Medicare and Medicaid savings were set in a budget blueprint adopted by Congress in June. That document is for the guidance of Congress but is not a law and did not have to be submitted to the President for his signature. By sufficient votes in each chamber, Congress can override parts of the budget resolution.
The Senate Finance Committee has jurisdiction over Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security and could try to reallocate money among those programs. But any change in Social Security would require delicate negotiations, and the Senate would need to waive rules intended to protect the program.
Three Republican Senators -- Mr. Simpson, Mr. D'Amato and Orrin G. Hatch of Utah -- expressed reservations about the Republican plan to cut Federal taxes by $245 billion during seven years. Mr. Hatch tried to inject a note of political realism, saying: "I don't think we're going to have $245 billion in tax cuts. I don't think anybody thinks that."
The Senate Republican whip, Trent Lott of Mississippi, said "we might come down a little bit," toward $200 billion of tax cuts.
The Ways and Means Committee, which is dealing with Medicare legislation on the House side of the Capitol, said today that it would delay its votes on the proposal, originally scheduled to begin on Wednesday. The panel is still trying to work out detailed legislative language and has not received the necessary fiscal analysis of its proposals from the Congressional Budget Office.
The budget office said today that the Senate bill would achieve the goal of saving $270 billion in Medicare over seven years. Beneficiaries would contribute $71 billion through higher premiums and deductibles. Doctors, hospitals and other health care providers would give up $152 billion. And $47.5 billion would be saved through use of health maintenance organizations, "medical savings accounts" and other alternatives to the standard Medicare program, the budget office said.

HEADLINE: Stocks Slip as the Fed Holds Steady on Interest Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks failed to sustain an advance yesterday and finished mostly lower after news that Federal Reserve policy makers had decided to keep interest rates at current levels.
Although the outcome of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting was expected, some traders had apparently hoped for a pleasant surprise in the form of a rate cut. 
 "You can characterize the session as a day of modest anticipation and modest disappointment surrounding the Fed's meeting," said Charles G. Crane, senior vice president and director of research at Spears, Benzak, Salomon & Farrell Inc. "The reality of that nonaction kindled a little disappointment and profit taking among investors."
Blue chips and the broader market started the session by moving decisively higher but reversed course in the afternoon as bonds temporarily weakened. The Dow Jones industrial average ended at 4,765.60 points after a modest loss of 4.33 points.
Losers nosed past gainers by about 11 to 10 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume expanded to 363.6 million shares.
Among other popular stock market indicators, the New York Stock Exchange composite index inched 0.06 point higher to 311.82 points while the Standard & Poor's 500 slipped 0.40 point, to 581.41 points. The American Stock Exchange market value index dropped 1.85, to 542.53.
Technology has been one of the sectors hit hardest lately by investors' concerns over profits. That has depressed the Nasdaq stock market, where many semiconductor, software and computer-related issues are listed. Nasdaq's composite index shed 8.10 points to close at 1,038.05.
Wall Street's positive opening was supported by rising markets in Japan and Europe, but that favorable influence faded as traders faced the possibility that interest rates would probably remain at current levels indefinitely.
The BellSouth Corporation rose 1 1/4, to 72 7/8, after raising its quarterly cash dividend by 4 percent, to 72 cents a share, and declaring a 2-for-1 stock split.
The SCOR U.S. Corporation rose 3 7/8 to 15 after its French parent company, SCOR S.A., a large reinsurer, said it was buying the 20 percent of its American unit that it did not already own for $50.6 million.
Micron Technology Inc. lost 3 1/4, to 78 3/4, in Big Board-leading volume of more than 7 million shares. Concerns about quarterly earnings bedeviled certain technology issues. Among other active Big Board stocks, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. fell 1 3/8, to 29 3/4. Active Nasdaq stocks included several technology losers, like the Dell Computer Corporation, which fell 4 3/4, to 82 1/4.
Silicon Graphics Inc., however, rose5/8, to 35 1/2 in heavy New York Stock Exchange volume of more than 3.4 million shares. Investors were encouraged that the company is shipping its new Indigo2 Impact work stations and that it had introduced a new World Wide Web publishing tool.
Shoney's Inc. lost 1 1/4, to 10 5/8, in response to reports that the restaurant operator would be included in an ABC report airing today on unsanitary conditions at food chains.
The Glaxo Wellcome Company was up 1/2, to 23 7/8, in heavy Big Board volume of more than 5 million shares, as investors reacted to reports that a Glaxo Wellcome drug to treat H.I.V. was involved in a promising trial. In other news that supported the stock, a Food and Drug Administration panel recommended approval of Flovent, a dry-powder device for asthma treatment.

HEADLINE: Fed Passes Again on Cutting Short-Term Rates

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve today left short-term interest rates unchanged, apparently believing that the economy was showing adequate growth again after a swoon in the spring.
This was the second straight meeting at which the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's main policy arm, passed up a chance to cut rates further since it reversed course in early July and lowered them for the first time since 1992. 
 "The Federal Open Market Committee meeting ended at 1:20 P.M. There is no further announcement," Joseph R. Coyne, the Fed's chief spokesman, said in a statement that has become standard for occasions of no change in monetary policy.
Since only a small minority of analysts had expected the Fed to ease further today, there was little reaction in the bond or stock markets.
The latest deliberations of the committee, which at full strength has 19 members, of whom 12 vote at a given time, leaves the rate for Federal funds at 5.75 percent and the largely symbolic discount rate at the 5.25 percent level to which it was raised in February. The Federal funds rate covers overnight loans that banks make among themselves but that are strongly influenced by the Fed; the discount rate is the rate the Fed offers banks for overnight loans from the Fed's own reserves.
Since decelerating to a 1.1 percent rate of expansion in the second quarter, the economy has revived, although unevenly, with the interest-rate-sensitive housing sector among the most solid performers and industrial output finally posting a significant rise in August.
Inflation, meanwhile, has remained in check. Consumer price inflation in the first eight months of the year was running at a 2.9 percent yearly pace, compared with 2.7 percent for all of 1994.
This favorable combination of stepped-up growth and low inflation prompted an upbeat assessment by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, in an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee on Friday.
"Near-term prospects for the U.S. economy have improved in recent months," he said at that time.
The 52 economists who are polled monthly by Blue Chip Economic Indicators now forecast a growth rate of 2 percent for the quarter that ends Saturday and 2.8 percent for the October-December period.
If achieved, this would be a highly satisfactory result for Fed policy makers, who last winter faced the challenge of restraining an economy surging at an annual pace of 5.1 percent without pushing the economy into recession.
With the Fed continuing a yearlong raising of the Federal funds rate, the economy throttled back to a 2.7 percent growth rate in the first quarter. By midyear, fears grew that the restraint that led to a doubling of the funds rate to 6 percent might be overdone.
Sharing this concern, the Fed cut rates in early July and expectations grew that more reductions would be needed in the second half of the year to sustain renewed growth and bring about the so-called economic soft landing that has so often proved elusive.
But with the recent upticks in various indicators, including in employment in the nation's factories last month after four straight monthly declines, it may be that borrowers -- the prime rate tends to move in step with the Federal funds rate -- will get just the single dose of rate relief.
Opinion today was divided about the prospects for a rate reduction at the committee's remaining 1995 meetings on Nov. 15 and Dec. 19.
Among the optimists was Kathleen Stephansen, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, who had expected a cut today.
"The consumer sector remains very sluggish," she said, contending that the Federal funds rate will need to be trimmed if the Fed policy is to be neutral rather than mildly restrictive.
Indeed, James E. Annable, chief economist at the First National Bank of Chicago, said he and others had begun to wonder whether the Fed had become "too unambitious" for today's restructured economy in which unemployment has declined to about 5.5 percent without putting significant upward pressure on wages.
This, Mr. Annable said, suggested that the Fed had maneuvering room to be "more tolerant of growth" even if it was unwilling to risk leading the way to a higher level.

HEADLINE: To Pay Some Debts, U.N. Will Try Borrowing From World Bank

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 26

 BODY:
The United Nations, facing its most severe financial crisis in half a century, will try for the first time to borrow money from the World Bank to pay some of its debts, the organization's highest-ranking financial officer said today.
Joseph Connor, a former chief executive of Price Waterhouse who is now United Nations Under Secretary General for Administration and Management, said today that a World Bank loan was only one of many ideas being explored "to lift from our shoulders the burden of debt." 
 Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said in an interview on Saturday that he planned to meet the World Bank president, James D. Wolfensohn, this weekend to discuss the proposal.
In the past, the United Nations has borrowed small amounts for specific development projects, Mr. Connor said, but there is no precedent for a loan of this kind, which would go to paying off some of the organization's growing general indebtedness.
"This crisis cannot be solved unless we can borrow money," the Secretary General said.
The United States, which is at least $1.2 billion in arrears in its dues to the United Nations, is expected to challenge the plan, an American diplomat said.
The American opposition to any new idea for raising money surprised diplomats from Europe and elsewhere, whose governments pay their bills regularly. A Western diplomat said today that with the United States the largest defaulter in assessments, it seemed inexplicable that the Clinton Administration would make things worse behind the scenes.
An American diplomat said today that the Administration had "two basic problems" with the loan plan.
"The United Nations and the Secretary General have no authority to borrow externally," the diplomat said. "And borrowing from the World Bank is restricted to sovereign governments."
The World Bank is technically part of the United Nations system, although the bank and the International Monetary Fund, both based in Washington, operate with considerable independence.
The United Nations, which has no capital base and cannot borrow commercially, is owed $3.4 billion in unpaid assessments, of which the United States owes roughly half.
The organization is $900 million in arrears in payments to countries that have provided peacekeeping troops and $400 million for purchases of various kinds. Half of the tens of millions of dollars awarded in contracts each year go to American companies.
"Our inability to pay is impacting the willingness of countries to participate in peacekeeping," Mr. Connor said. The operation in Bosnia alone is costing nearly $5 million daily, according to the Secretary General.
In a speech today to the General Assembly, the British Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, proposed charging interest on late payments as one way of tightening penalties against member nations in arrears. He said 39 nations failed to pay anything at all last year.
In June at the meeting of the Group of Seven major industrial nations, Mr. Boutros-Ghali proposed that the United Nations would take bonds from nations owing money and use them to settle debts with other member countries. That idea was also opposed by the United States.
Mr. Connor said today that the bulk of the money owed by the United Nations for peacekeeping is in debts to Western European nations, Australia, Canada and other countries close to the United States.

HEADLINE: Panel Backs New Fees on Student Loans

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
As one Republican stayed away, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee voted 8 to 7 on party lines today to charge colleges for every loan their students take out as part of a $10.8 billion cut in the Federal student loan program.
The missing Republican, Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont, said later that he would fight the proposal on the Senate floor. Asked why he had stayed away from the committee meeting, where he could have killed the plan, he said he was "steadfast against any cuts in education" but had promised the panel's chairman, Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas, that he would not block her efforts to get the proposal to the Senate as part of Republican efforts to balance the budget. 
 Senator Kassebaum, after sharp protests from colleges, last week scaled down her original proposal for a fee of 2 percent on all Federal loans a college's students received. But the opposition remains almost as intense to the plan she proposed Friday and the committee adopted today. It calls for a charge of $85 on every $10,000 of loans, or less than 1 percent of the loan total.
Democrats argued that the charge would fall most heavily on those institutions that had the highest number of students taking out loans. They said that the State University of New York, for example, with student loans of about $470 million in a year, would be charged $4 million under the new fee. Rutgers University, the state university in New Jersey, with $83 million in loans, would be charged $706,000.
They said that the changes would make it harder for low-income students to go to college and that the Republican priorities were wrong. Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, said the Senate should have attacked corporate tax breaks and excessive arms spending: "I think the students come before the oil companies, the tobacco companies, the pharmaceutical companies and the military contractors."
After students at the hearing applauded, Senator Kassebaum replied, somewhat testily: "The students are not going to be hurt in this. We care just as deeply as anybody else about education."
Mr. Jeffords, who earlier had voted for an amendment that would have imposed $4.4 billion in new charges on lenders and no charges for the five million student borrowers, was the only one of the committee's nine Republicans who did not vote, though some who were absent left proxies for the fee proposal. All seven Democrats voted against it.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the committee's senior Democrat, denounced the proposal as a "student loan tax," saying Republicans wanted "to raid $10.8 billion from student aid to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy."
Senator Kassebaum denied that the fee was a tax. She said it was a reasonable charge to impose on "institutions which clearly benefit from the availability of Federal student loan programs," and argued that the charges would not necessarily be passed on to students. "There is room for postsecondary institutions to take a hard look at their own costs," she said, "just as we are asking everyone else to do."
The House Educational and Economic Opportunities Committee will meet on Thursday to vote on a different plan to cut the loan program by $1.8 billion. Its plan cannot be amended on the House floor. Amendments will be allowed in the Senate, but will be hard to pass as Republicans stand behind the overall plan.
The fee would raise $2 billion over seven years. These are other elements of the Kassebaum package:
*Require $4 billion in added charges and cut payments to lenders and guarantee agencies.
*End the six-month post-graduation grace period during which no interest is charged on loans, saving $2.7 billion.
*Raise interest rates on the PLUS program of subsidized loans to parents, saving $694 million.
*Reduce direct Government loans to colleges and universities to no more than 20 percent of loan volume, down from a current total of nearly 30 percent. Banks that get Federal guarantees would see their share of loans grow instead of declining as they have been. Under new accounting rules adopted by the Republicans this year, $1.5 billion would be saved.
Senator Kassebaum's plan did not say how the Administration was to choose which institutions could continue on the direct loan program, which most who use it say is more efficient than the guaranteed bank loan program. Senator Paul Simon, the Illinois Democrat who was an early advocate of direct loans, demanded, "Are we in the business of helping banks and guarantee agencies, or are we in the business of helping students?"
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, tried to amend the Kassebaum proposal to allow colleges to choose between direct or bank loans, instead of having the committee set any limit. He lost on an 8-to-7 party-line vote with Mr. Jeffords absent.
Mr. Dodd also attacked the plan as "the largest cut in the history of higher education."
Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Indiana, scoffed at the Kassebaum assertion that the cuts were small and would not have much impact. He said six of the last seven reconciliation bills had also reduced student loans, leading to "death by a thousand small cuts."
Senator Kassebaum said the committee had a duty to come up with the $10.8 billion in cuts set out in the budget resolution passed this summer, even though "it is undoubtedly easier to vote in favor of a balanced budget than to support the steps necessary to achieve it."

HEADLINE: Nuns to Leave Cloister for Papal Visit

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Sept. 25

 BODY:
The white-robed nuns of the Monastery of St. Dominic arise in the darkness of their simple cells to begin their daily ritual of devotion to God and prayer for His world. Voices echoing in choral prayer or eyes closed in private meditations, they reflect on the lives that lie just beyond their thick, stone walls: people desperately ill, unemployed or lonely.
In the tradition of mystics and monks, the 21 cloistered Dominican nuns have set themselves apart from the world, which in their case is a down-at-the-heels neighborhood where young men spend hours standing on corners and where stolen cars speed crazily through the night. But on Oct. 4, these nuns and some 100 other cloistered religious will be allowed to venture into the city and pray with Pope John Paul II at Sacred Heart Cathedral. 
 The chance to pray with the Pope is a special occasion for any Roman Catholic, but it is especially sweet, and rare, for the nuns of St. Dominic's, who leave their cloister only for medical visits and annual meetings of their order and with the approval of Newark's Archbishop, Theodore McCarrick. Even in death, they remain with their sisters, buried in plain wooden coffins in a crypt beneath the chapel.
The nuns see the prayer service as an exciting reaffirmation of their decision to embrace a radical life style removed from the comforts and routines that others take for granted.
"This is a milestone for us," said Sister Marie of the Incarnation. "Our life is something that is always seeking a depth and rootedness in the fact that I gave my life to Christ. It never wears out, but it needs to be renewed. God provides times of renewal."
Like with many moments in their spiritual journey, the nuns think of the papal visit as a gift bestowed on those who have given totally of themselves.
"It's a love gift from our Lord," said Sister Mary Mannis. "He said He would give a hundredfold to those who left their mother and father for Him."
When the Newark monastery was founded in 1880 by members of a French religious order, it was one of the few places in the United States where women led monastic lives of contemplation. The stone buildings, whose street-side windows are frosted, are built around grassy courtyards decorated with flowers and religious statues. By tradition, the nuns pray seven times a day as a group, spending the other hours in meditation, reading and household chores.
They are self-supporting, relying on donations and the income from the sale of memorial cards and a small business they run packaging and distributing altar breads.
"There is an intensity in our constant striving to focus on God," said Sister Catherine Mary, the group's prioress. "To live in His presence. That's the purpose of our life, the rhythms, the sameness and uncomplicated work. Our spirits are free to be for the Lord."
Guided by their vows of chastity, poverty and obedience, they talk of their daily routine with ease and happiness, enjoying a relaxed spirit of community.
"I could walk out the door any time I want," said Sister Mary Joseph. "I'm not locked in. There is a freedom to our life."
Now there is a bit more joy as they anticipate the papal visit. One nun posted a daily countdown near the door to their community room.
"It's a real privilege" said Sister Mary St. John. "He is a representative of Christ to us. It's like our Lord Himself visited us in person."
Their daily conversations are filled with questions and talk about their much traveled spiritual leader. They know he has affection for their way of life, noting how he established a contemplative community on the Vatican grounds.
"You see him on TV -- we don't usually see TV -- and you feel acquainted with him," said Sister Mary Magdalen. "The gifts of the man are just awesome. His personal rapport. His gift of touching and empathizing with all sorts of people. His whole life has prepared him for this."
Sister Mary Joseph, who keeps tabs on the group's bills and donations, said she was pleasantly surprised by the Pope's choice of Newark, an archdiocese overshadowed by its neighbors.
"Newark is considered an inner city," she said. "It's not terribly famous like New York."
And though the nuns live behind walls, they are aware of what city life means, for better and for worse.
"In the early hours of the morning, you can hear all kinds of sounds in the city," said Sister Mary Christine, whose first contact with the monastery came as a teen-ager when she attended a party across the street. A few years later, in 1964, she converted and strode through the gate whose arch inscription reads in Latin, "Come Let Us Adore Him."
"Maybe someone's sick, a stolen car with its squealing tires," she said. "You lift those people up in prayer. But you also hear the good side. On Sunday morning, singing across the street. You know they're going to worship. They know God is still here."
Sister Catherine Mary said she and the other nuns see opportunities for prayer and understanding even in their infrequent trips into the city. It's a chance to see the world with different eyes.
"You can see in people's faces the burden or the loneliness they experience," she said. "If we're in a traffic jam, we see how many people have to live every day in a traffic jam just to go to work. How many women have to get their children home. It's really trying to bring the Lord into these situations, which is where I think He'd want to be."

HEADLINE: Save West Point Prep

 BODY:
Congressional plans for scaling back or eliminating the prep school that supplies many of the Army's minority officers are wrongheaded. The U.S. Military Academy Preparatory School at Fort Monmouth, N.J., is doing a yeoman job integrating the officer corps, making the Army more representative of America -- and a model of how an integrated enterprise ought to work. Tampering could undo two decades of progress and destroy a vital source of opportunity for minority youths.
The prep schools were created in 1916, when Congress authorized the Army to nominate enlisted men as cadets for West Point. The Air Force and Navy have the schools as well, but the Army's has clearly been the most successful. In recent years the Army prep school became a finishing program for West Point applicants who barely missed getting in. A favorable evaluation of its efforts appears in the forthcoming Twentieth Century Fund book "Overcoming Race: Army Lessons for American Society," by Charles Moskos and John S. Butler. 
 The 10-month Army prep school is grueling, and nearly a third of those who enter drop out. Those who complete the program show dramatic improvement. S.A.T. scores rise by an average of 100 points for whites and 120 points for blacks. About 40 percent of blacks who attend West Point enter through the prep program. Without it, minority enrollment at West Point would be lower still than its current, dismal 6 percent.
True, the prep school costs are steep -- between $40,000 and $60,000 per student, depending on who does the calculation. But repairing the damage done by a ghastly education is inevitably costly. A better way to evaluate the Army school is in terms of social costs and benefits. The dramatic increases in S.A.T. scores achieved by the prep school show what can be accomplished if sufficient resources are put into educating disadvantaged youths. Given that young black men are five times as likely as whites to be unemployed -- and many more times as likely to be incarcerated -- the prep school trade-off seems more than cost-effective.
Plans for scaling back the prep schools and farming out the students to private military academies will very likely result in the best students being admitted and the riskiest students left out. Congress is right to cut costs, economize and eliminate abuses, such as the alleged focus at the Air Force Academy's prep school on preparing athletes for admission. But keep the prep schools. They pay for themselves many times over.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar's Value Rises Broadly Amid Profit Taking on the Mark

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar ended slightly higher against most leading currencies yesterday as traders sold German marks to take profits after a run-up last week.
"We started to see some unwinding of long mark positions Monday, and we're continuing to see more of the same," said Dave Glowacki, senior trader at NBD Bank in Detroit. 
 In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar edged up to 1.4373 marks from 1.4345 marks on Monday. It rose to 1.1625 Swiss francs from 1.1565 francs and to 100.90 Japanese yen from 100.52 yen. The British pound fell to $1.5665 from $1.5702.
The dollar declined last week as the mark and the Swiss franc surged as concern about the future of Europe's drive toward monetary union prompted flight into the two currencies. The mark and the Swiss franc are considered safe-haven currencies in times of uncertainty.
But battered European currencies, including the Italian lira and the Swedish krona, recouped some of their losses against the mark yesterday, indirectly bolstering the dollar.
"The French franc and the lira are clawing back territory versus the mark," said Amy Smith, senior currency strategist at IDEA Inc. "That has given the dollar strength."
Further lending support to the dollar was the Federal Reserve's expected decision to leave interest rates unchanged amid signs that the economy was recovering from a second-quarter slump, traders said.
Though the dollar had a muted response to the news, traders said the currency was likely to remain buoyant as American interest rates remained higher than those in Germany and Japan. "There was a slight risk that the Fed was going to cut rates, but their decision to hold rates steady maintains the interest-rate differential, and that's good news for the dollar," said Ron Leven, currency analyst at J. P. Morgan.
Though the dollar has recovered somewhat, traders wonder if central banks will again buy dollars in a concerted effort to push the dollar's value higher. "The dollar needs some kind of an impetus to push it higher," said Jim Blackwelder of National Westminster Bank.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices End Mixed As Fed Holds Line on Rates

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged at its policy meeting.
Bonds were initially higher in early trading after the Conference Board reported its consumer confidence reading had fallen in September to 97.4, below the average trade forecast of 100. In August it was 102.4. Analysts said the report suggested signs of waning consumer optimism that could restrain growth. People buy things when they feel confident; when they do not, manufacturing slows and inventories rise. 
 The 30-year Treasury issue gained 2/32 of a percentage point, to 103 30/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, slipped to 6.57 percent, from 6.58 percent on Monday. But shorter-maturity bills, because they are more sensitive to monetary policy, were down sharply. The rate for a three-month bill was up 10 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.27 percent.
Anthony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said he was sure that some of the early price gains were tied to the hopes of some who still believed that there was an outside chance the Fed would ease rates. "But those hopes did not come to fruition, and bonds relinquished those gains," he said.
"I expect the bond market to remain in a narrow trading range over the short term until more evidence regarding the strength of the economy comes forth," Mr. Dwyer continued. "Longer-term bond yields should continue to stay stable to lower over the longer term. It's my opinion that given the favorable inflation outlook, bonds will retain their long-term appeal."
Mr. Dwyer said yesterday's Treasury auction of two-year notes did not go as well as it might have, but that it should not affect the favorable long-term outlook for bonds, as the inflation picture remains the fundamental key to rates.
Nor did the disclosure that Daiwa Bank had lost $1.1 billion because of unauthorized bond trading in its New York office have any impact on the market yesterday because the bank has had a month since the executive involved turned himself in to bank officials to correct any imbalances.
Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors, Columbus, Ohio, said he thought the Fed acted according to plan by leaving interest rates unchanged.
"Although F.O.M.C. participants had enough time to digest a plunging level of consumer confidence, as proxied by the Conference Board's latest reading, it was apparent that in the end they paid more attention to the marked turnaround in the housing and manufacturing sectors," Mr. Chan said.
"We believe that the Fed adopted a directive with a bias toward easing. It appears that Nov. 15 is likely to be the last chance for the Fed to act this year. If they acted, it would be with the intention of stimulating retail sales activity in 1995. And given the fact that most stores record close to 50 percent of all retail sales during the Christmas season, one can see why an easing at the last F.O.M.C. meeting of the year on Dec. 19 is certain to fall short of having much effect."
Mr. Chan said the uncertainty of the Fed committee's meeting caused yesterday's two-year note auction to suffer from lack of interests as the bid-to-cover ratio -- the number of bids to actual sales -- came in at 2.04 to 1, which is considerably below its average historical level of 2.65.
The high yield at auction yesterday was 5.86 percent, down from 6.08 percent in August and the lowest since June 27, when it was 5.69 percent.
Today, the Treasury will auction a new five-year note. Yesterday in when-issued trading the new notes were offered at a price to yield 6.09 percent, up from 6.06 percent on Monday.
Some economists said that market participants came away with the feeling that the balance of data remained in a state that was weighing more heavily in favor of moderate to firmer growth. "Nonetheless," Mr. Chan said, "it is clear that market players are now likely to shift their attention to watching movements in the labor market, especially the weekly unemployment claims prior to next month's nonfarm payroll employment report, to see if the Fed will finally pull the trigger next month."
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new two-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Yield . . . 5.860%
Low Yield . . . 5.790%
Median Yield . . . 5.820%

POLITICAL FIGHT LOOMS OVER CHANCELLOR
 The president of New York City's Board of Education, Carol A. Gresser, said she would oppose Mayor Giuliani's latest choice to be schools chancellor, Leon M. Goldstein, the president of Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn. Her announcement set the stage for an intense political fight. Mrs. Gresser cited the questions that have been raised about Mr. Goldstein's political ties to Democrats in Brooklyn and his conflicting answers about his age, marriages and health, among other concerns. [Page A1.] 
 A dispute has arisen over whether Leon M. Goldstein attended New York University in 1965, as he asserts. [B3.]
 
ARE THE 'NICE PANTS' ADS A MORALITY TEST?
 In a new advertising campaign promoting Dockers brand pants, Levi Strauss hung khakis usually priced up to $55 under plastic shields in 40 Manhattan bus shelters. Any New Yorker might expect that covetous vandals would pry open or shatter the shields and make off with the pants. Levi Strauss expected it, too: When the pants were stolen, an outline of them would remain, along with a message: "Apparently they were very nice pants." [A1.]

 Mayor Giuliani and city fire officials went to Brooklyn to announce that a private company had donated more than $500,000 worth of smoke detectors to residents of a neighborhood where the city started deactivating fire-alarm call boxes last week. [B3.]
 
CUNY BOARD TO VOTE ON AID INCREASE
 Trying to recoup some of the losses it suffered in this year's austerity budget, the City University board plans to vote on a request for $94.6 million more in state aid. The money would not be used to restore academic programs but to help replace senior faculty members and to expand support programs for students. [B8.]

CONFIDENCE ON CAPITAL CASE
 Even before the body of a 7-year-old girl was removed from a shallow grave outside Kingston, N.Y., the Ulster County District Attorney, E. Michael Kavanaugh, confidently said he had the state's first capital case on his hands. [B6.]
 
EVERY DROP HELPS, BUT MORE IS NEEDED
 Voices of cheer and gloom were heard under gray skies that delivered rain to a region that sorely needs it. Both moods made sense, depending on the answer to the question, "Are the reservoirs half full or half empty?" More than an inch fell over parts of the New York metropolitan region. [B6.]
 
CHINESE GANG TRIAL OPENS IN NEW JERSEY
 A bloody rivalry within a Chinese gang and a lust for riches from smuggling illegal Chinese immigrants into the United States led to the killing of four gang leaders on a quiet street in Teaneck, N.J., in 1993, a jury was told. [B6.]
 
LUNCHTIME ROBBERS HIT IN NASSAU COUNTY
 In less than an hour, armed robbers struck at parking lots at Fortunoff's, Bloomingdale's, Macy's and an office building at lunchtime in Garden City, L.I., succeeding in three robberies and failing at a fourth, the Nassau County police reported. [B6.]

S.E.C. Seeks to Assure Investors of Benefits
The S.E.C., 20 years after Congress mandated competition in securities markets, is seeking to make it work for investors' benefit. The commission would require that stock markets give investors a reasonable chance of getting better prices than they often have.
One aim is to make sure that orders can be seen by other investors who might want to take the other side. With today's fragmented markets that does not always happen. Floyd Norris: Market Place. [Page D8.]
 
Time Warner to Shed Rap Label
Time Warner will sell its 50 percent stake in Interscope Records, the Los Angeles label whose violent and sexually degrading gangsta rap lyrics have stirred political controversy. But executives said the company expected to recoup its $100 million investment. [D20.]

By waiting nearly two months to tell regulators about a $1.1 billion loss from unauthorized trading, Daiwa Bank apparently violated Federal and New York State regulations, banking lawyers say. [D6.]
 
Durable Goods Orders Rise 4.9%
Durable goods orders jumped 4.9 percent in August, the largest increase in a year, as some auto plants resumed production after a shutdown to retool for 1996 models. [D4.]

HEADLINE: Shift at Top: Du Pont Gets A New Chief

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
The Du Pont Company said yesterday that John A. Krol will become its chief executive at the end of the year, replacing Edgar S. Woolard Jr., who will remain as chairman.
Mr. Woolard, 61, said he was stepping down as chief executive because he had fulfilled his goals of revamping E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, the nation's largest chemical concern, and because he felt the time was right to pass the baton to Mr. Krol, who is 58 and has been vice chairman for three years. Mr. Woolard said his health was fine and had nothing to do with his decision. 
 Because the two executives have worked together closely and have known each other for more than 20 years, the company "will not skip a beat," Mr. Krol said. The only difference between the two executives, Mr. Woolard added, is that Mr. Krol is the better golfer.
Analysts said the transition had not been expected for another year or so. William R. Young, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said that Mr. Krol "is really going to follow in Ed's footsteps," adding that they shared a penchant for controlling costs and improving productivity while Du Pont pursued growth in new markets.
Mr. Woolard said his role as chairman would be a part-time job in which he helped shape strategy and pondered long-range goals for Du Pont.
Analysts credit Mr. Woolard, who has been chief executive since 1989, with making the $40 billion company leaner and more responsive to customers and new markets while shedding its historical culture, which tended to be stodgy and, at times, arrogant. He had ordered division heads to meet profitability targets, and they, in turn, had laid off thousands of workers to meet those goals. The company now employs 107,000 worldwide.
"He has turned the Titanic around," said James F. Hickman, an analyst at CS First Boston.
Mr. Krol, a native of Massachusetts, joined Du Pont in 1963 as a chemist in Wilmington, Del., and held various marketing, manufacturing and management positions in its fibers and agricultural products divisions until 1992, when he was named vice chairman.
In the most recent quarter, Du Pont reported net income of $938 million on revenue of $11.3 billion. The results, a 15 percent increase over the comparable quarter in the previous year, reflected higher prices in its plastics, fibers and chemicals business. In addition, the company cited strong growth in Europe and Asia for the rise.
However, the company warned that its automotive and construction-related sales were showing signs of a softening economy in the United States.

HEADLINE: Threat Is Seen in Pension Shift

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Escalating its opposition to a Republican plan to allow companies to use money from pension plans that have a minimum cushion of funds, the Clinton Administration contended today that passage of the measure would reduce the retirement security of millions of Americans, endanger the economy and inspire predatory corporate takeovers.
"We are going to see raids on pension assets that will make the train robberies during the days of Jesse James pale in comparison," said Robert B. Reich, the Labor Secretary who also serves as chairman of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, insurer of 58,000 private-sector pension plans. 
 Mr. Reich was joined at a news conference by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, the other members of the pension agency board, to announce adoption today of a resolution urging Congress to reject liberalization of the law governing pension assets.
The Republican-dominated House Ways and Means Committee approved a measure last week to let companies transfer an estimated $30 billion to $40 billion from their pension plans over the next five years and use the money for other purposes.
Proponents contend this would raise more than $10 billion in tax revenue and free underutilized capital for investment while preserving an adequate cushion for meeting obligations to retirees. To be tapped, a fund would be required to have at least 25 percent more assets than needed to meet current liabilities.
In July 1996, a 6.5 percent excise tax would apply to removals.
In denouncing the idea, the three Cabinet members cited a study the pension agency published today stating that many plans could be left with "insufficient resources" to protect retirees. Among other things, it said that funds deemed more than sufficient now "can quickly become underfunded" with a market shift of as little as a one percentage point reduction in interest rates combined with a 10 percent decline in asset values.
The officials also raised the specter of pension assets as a lure, as Mr. Brown put it, "for corporate raiders to use reversions to finance takeovers." He said pension funds were used in two-thirds of the largest buyouts of the 1980's. Beginning in 1986, the Government sought to curb pension reversions by imposing a series of taxes that eventually ranged as high as 50 percent.
Republicans immediately responded to the Administration attack.
"The Administration's attempt today to mislead and scare people is deeply regrettable and extremely misguided," the Ways and Means Committee said a statement. "The real culprit when it comes to protecting pensions is the Administration's ongoing effort to compel public pension funds to invest in so-called economically targeted investments."

HEADLINE: Stock Prices Take a Wild Ride Down but Rebound at Close

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Led by technology issues, stock prices tumbled sharply enough yesterday to set off the New York Stock Exchange's 50-point "circuit breaker" rule, but bounced back before the close.
Nevertheless, the three major market indicators all finished on the downside. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.25 points, to 4,762.35; the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 0.37 point, to 581.04, and the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index declined 11.51 points, to 1,026.54. 
 The stock and bond markets dropped at the opening in response to a Commerce Department report that August durable goods orders soared almost 5 percent -- the largest advance in a year. Later in the day, the Dow fell as much as 53.11 points, which set off the Big Board's circuit breakers. The 50-point collar, established after the 1987 market crash, is meant to curb excess market volatility from computer-guided sales and purchases. In a down market, once the circuit breaker is set off, a stock may only be sold when its price is unchanged or rising slightly.
After the Treasury's $11.5 billion five-year note auction went better than expected, bonds and stocks turned away from their lows. The trend of both markets was positive when trading concluded. Thus the 30-year Treasury bond -- which at one point was down a full percentage point -- fell just 1/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, was unchanged at 6.57 percent.
"Bonds led stocks down and then bonds led stocks up," said Edwin D. Walczak, chief investment officer of Vontobel U.S.A. "The day ended uneventfully."
Declining issues exceeded advancers on the Big Board by 1,469 to 842. Volume was heavy, with 411.3 million shares changing hands, compared with 363.6 million shares on Tuesday and the three-month daily average of 340 million shares.
Technology stocks, which have had one of the most powerful upward runs in the market this year, were most vulnerable yesterday to the currently clouded outlook for third-quarter earnings. Cisco Systems dropped 1 5/8, to 68; 3Com fell 1 1/4, to 44 1/4; Bay Networks slid 2 3/8, to 52, and Intel declined 7/16 , to 595/16 .
Some capital-goods stocks also declined, following a decision Tuesday by Federal Reserve policy makers not to lower interest rates. Caterpillar closed at 56 1/8, down 2; Harnischfeger finished at 33 3/8, down 3/8, and Boeing ended at 67 3/4, down 7/8.
In contrast to the overall market, the high-dividend utility sector was strong yesterday and the Dow Jones utility index gained 1.19 points, to 212.50 -- its highest level in more than a year and a half. Duke Power rose 1/8, to 42 3/4; Wisconsin Energy gained 1/8, to 28; Southern Company climbed 1/2, to 23, and Houston Industries rose 1/4, to 44 1/2.
Banking issues advanced on traders' expectations that profit margins would not narrow in the months ahead. Chemical Banking increased 1, to 60; Citicorp jumped 2, to 70 7/8; BankAmerica gained 3/4, to 59 1/2, and J. P. Morgan rose 3/8, to 77 1/8.
Among other gainers, Hayes Wheels soared 5 5/8, to 26 1/2, after Varity agreed to acquire the 54 percent of the company it does not already own for $25 a share. And Morrison Restaurants advanced 2 1/2, to 20 1/4, after announcing that it will split into three separate companies.
Among the declining issues was Egghead, which said late Tuesday that it expected a wider loss in its second fiscal quarter than it had in the comparable period last year; its share price slipped 1 3/8, to 7 7/8. Midland Financial, which projected a loss for the third quarter, plummeted 8 1/4, to 10 1/2.

HEADLINE: Midpriced Hotels Look Abroad

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
For decades, American luxury hotel chains like Hilton and Hyatt have been familiar sights in foreign capitals and resorts, homes away from home for top business executives and well-heeled travelers.
But now, a second foreign invasion by American hotel and motel chains is under way, carrying decidedly middle-brow names like Comfort Inn, Days Inn and Holiday Inn Express -- and with prices that are midrange or even lower. 
 The new chains, often found in smaller cities and away from traditional downtowns, are aimed at local business travelers and regional tourists who value comfort and familiarity but are willing to do without frills. And while the original beachhead was the capitals and provinces of Europe, the new invaders have lately been going farther and farther off the beaten path, to virtually all corners of the developing world.
From Argentina to Zimbabwe, hundreds of new hotels bearing American chain names have been built in the last year or two, and a couple of thousand more are scheduled to rise in such countries as China, Costa Rica, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Panama and Thailand.
In Chile, for example, a Holiday Inn Express opened in January in Temuco, a commercial and agricultural center some 300 miles south of Santiago, the capital. It is the first of eight hotels in the Express chain -- which offer fewer services and amenities than regular Holiday Inns -- that are planned for Chile over the next three years. There are also plans to build 10 Howard Johnson hotels in the country.
A prime motivation for the relentless push abroad is the dim outlook for hotel growth in the United States, which is largely a mature market. By contrast, the Asia-Pacific region alone will need 1.2 million more rooms by 2005, according to a recent estimate by the Economist magazine's Intelligence Unit.
The larger world stage clearly is where the action is. "The difference between operating successfully in the United States and in the world economy is the difference between operating successfully in Minnesota and in the United States economy," said Curtis Nelson, president of the Minneapolis-based Country Hospitality Corporation, a unit of the Carlson Companies.
Last fall, Mr. Nelson's Country Inns agreed with local partners to develop about 20 hotels in Malaysia over the next 10 years -- part of the 60 it expects to have throughout Asia by 2000. This year it agreed to develop 37 hotels in India and 5 in Panama.
The American invasion has been made easier by a number of big changes abroad.
The fall of Communism removed many restrictions on travel and investment. That change, together with the spread of democracy, has resulted in a world on the move, with new highways and airports spurring the need for more hotels.
And thanks to the widespread availability of the latest technology, hoteliers in the undeveloped world are hardly in the hinterlands when it comes to day-to-day operations. To book reservations, for example, "Bombay talks to Phoenix in its computer, not New Delhi," said Werner Braum, director of international development of the Phoenix-based Best Western chain.
To be sure, American chains do not have the midpriced field entirely to themselves. In Europe and the Pacific, for example, they face formidable competition from Accor, the giant French chain that owns Motel 6, Sofitel and Novotel.
But the Americans are far ahead in many places, proliferating with much the same frequency as American fast-food companies did in recent years. And the approach is similar, whether the Americans are going into Europe or Asia: develop a big presence in the core markets, then fan out into the provinces once the economies of scale are in place.
"In the past, Hilton or Sheraton would put a hotel in Paris, then say they've done Paris," said Gerald Petitt, co-chairman of Choice Hotels International of Silver Spring, Md., parent of Comfort Inns and Quality Inns. "We have 33 Quality or Comfort Inns in and around Paris and more than 150 throughout France."
With some 300 foreign properties already, and a recent agreement to develop 210 hotels in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, Choice plans on having more than 3,000 properties abroad in 10 years.
The need for all these new economy and midpriced hotels in the developing world parallels the growth of the middle class there -- business and leisure travelers unwilling or unable to pay top dollar for a luxury hotel yet no longer content to stay in the fleabags or guest homes that were often their only other options.
Now, even budget hotels usually offer continental breakfast, television, air-conditioning and wake-up calls. Some new properties are resorts complete with swimming pools and other amenities, but with prices for rooms and local fare geared to attract middle-class guests.
"It took me a while to get used to the local food night after night, but after all, this is an Indonesian hotel," said Marty Busbee, in a recent telephone interview from the Quality Inn resort in Mambruk, Indonesia.
A native of Tyler, Tex., Mrs. Busbee, whose husband works in the oil industry in Indonesia, said she had been apprehensive about staying at a midrange, or three-star, hotel. "But the staff is gracious and the property is lovely," she said.
Rates at the midpriced chains vary widely. There are some real bargains, compared with prices in the United States. The Quality Inn properties in India, for example, average $15 a night in smaller cities and $30 in the big markets. But the rule of thumb, according to Best Western's Mr. Braum, is that rates in comparable South American properties are the same as in the United States, are 20 percent higher in Japan and at least 60 percent higher in Western Europe.
In Mexico, a large and growing class of middle and upper-middle managers is willing to pay a premium for the new hotels. At the recently opened Holiday Inn Express in Leon, an agricultural city in the country's center, rates average about $60, $10 or so more than at a Holiday Inn Express in the United States. (While the 43-year-old Holiday Inn chain has been owned since 1990 by Bass P.L.C., the British brewer, it is based in Atlanta and is still widely regarded as an American company.)
In 14 years of plying the backroads of Mexico, Jorge Fernandez de Miguel says he has been in almost every city in the country. What many have in common, said Mr. Fernandez, director of a training center in Mexico City that is a joint venture between Coca-Cola and its Mexican bottlers, are inadequate hotels. Some are overpriced, some are hovels, some are both, he said. And, of course, there are the guest houses, whose level of comfort and sanitation reflect the owner's whim.
"Now when I travel I often stay in a Holiday Inn Express, a Comfort Inn or some other chain hotel," Mr. Fernandez said. "They're clean, comfortable, air-conditioned and everything functions as it should."
Except for Best Western, which is an association of member hotels, the expanding midpriced chains are franchise operations. The "hotel company" owns few if any hotels. Instead, it franchises its name and reservations network, and provides training for the franchisees' employees, in return for about 7 percent of gross room revenue.
"The fast-food companies helped hotel chains all over the world by doing a good job of explaining the concept and value of franchising," said Ed Ansbro, vice president of development for Latin America for the Promus Company's Hampton Inns and Suites. Hampton properties are currently going up in Chile, Costa Rica and Mexico, and the company eventually is looking to have 150 properties in Latin America.
Most franchisors align themselves with a builder or hotel management company, which in Latin America is often family run. A "master franchise" is given exclusively in a country or region, usually for 10 to 15 years, although the franchisor still has the right to approve development plans and to impose standards of service.
"The absolutely critical key is to align with a partner with hospitality experience and with good ties to the government," said John Russell, president of Days Inn. Days Inn, a unit of Hospitality Franchise Systems, is in nine countries, including India, where it recently signed an agreement to build about 60 inns. It expects to add at least two countries a year -- including Malaysia, South Africa and Thailand -- for the next 10 years.
But not every franchisor is anxious to jump in. Marriott, for example, has no immediate plans to franchise its lower-priced operations, including Courtyard and Fairfield.
"We are just in the process of establishing our four- and five-star brands in key cities outside the U.S.," said June Farrell, a company spokeswoman. "Once we establish who we are there, we'll probably go into the secondary and tertiary markets with three-star properties."
And expansion already has been a mixed blessing for some. Many American mid-priced operations in Europe reportedly have not yet turned a profit, and Mexico's peso problems have proved disastrous for hotels along with other industries.
"It will be 6 to 12 months before hotels get back to break-even, and maybe three years before they get back to profitability," said Howard Willis, head of Holiday Inn's operations in Latin America, including Mexico, where the chain has 28 hotels.
But those putting down roots abroad say there are long-term benefits that outweigh the uncertainties. For hotel operators, they say, all roads eventually lead to home.
"Expanding abroad is a big help to our business in the U.S.," said Mr. Russell of Days Inn. "More than 20 percent of our business in America is coming from abroad, and we need to know how to service them better, so by the year 2000 we'll have 50 percent of our guests coming from abroad."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Sells Off With Bonds, But Regains Some of Its Losses

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most leading currencies yesterday, dragged down by an early selloff in the United States bond market.
The dollar was also weakened by continued monetary uncertainty in Europe. 
 Bonds fell early in the day after a report showing a greater-than-expected rise of 4.9 percent in durable-goods orders for August, which revived concerns that the American economy might be robust enough to accelerate inflation.
"After durable goods, bonds went considerably lower and the dollar linked up with them," said Kevin Lawrie, foreign exchange manager at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
Bonds later rebounded, buoyed by better-than-expected demand at the Treasury's auction for five-year notes. That helped the dollar pare its losses, traders said.
After falling as low as 97.75 Japanese yen, the dollar recovered to settle in New York at 100.45 yen, down from 100.90 yen on Tuesday. The dollar was quoted at 1.4253 German marks, down from 1.4373 marks, but up from its intraday low of 1.4200 marks. The dollar fell to 1.1530 Swiss francs from 1.1625 Swiss francs. The British pound rose to $1.5755 from $1.5665.
Contributing to the dollar's fall against the mark were doubts about the prospects for the European monetary union, which prompted investors to sell the currencies of some countries, like Italy, for marks.
Although many of those trades can be done directly, traders sometimes sell Italian lire and other currencies for dollars first, then sell the dollars for marks, traders said. As a result, the dollar often suffers when economic or political turmoil in Europe leads investors to seek the security of Europe's most stable currencies, the mark and Swiss franc.
"The on-again, off-again turmoil in Europe over the E.M.U. is a negative for the dollar," said Steve Flanagan, currency trader at Credit Agricole in New York. "The mark rebounded sharply overnight."
The shift to marks and Swiss francs began last Thursday after senior German officials questioned whether Italy, France and other European countries would be able to meet the strict economic criteria for monetary union laid out in the Maastricht treaty. The dollar fell 2.6 percent versus the mark that day.
"The dollar's going to have a tough time going up until they resolve the E.M.U. situation," said Earl Johnson, foreign exchange adviser at the Bank of Montreal/Harris Bank in Chicago.

Japan Panel Urges Reform Of Nation's Bank System

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 27

 BODY:
In an effort to clear up the bad-loan problem that is threatening Japan's financial system, the Government moved today toward establishing an institution similar to the Resolution Trust Corporation, which was used to deal with the savings and loan crisis in the United States.
The recommendation to form an institution to take over and dispose of the bad debts held by home mortgage companies was contained in a blueprint for reform of Japan's banking system that was released today by an advisory committee to the Ministry of Finance. The committee also recommended the use of public money to help shore up the financial system in limited cases. 
 Today's report is an interim one that is expected to be finished by the end of the year. If the Ministry of Finance adopts the recommendations, as is expected, legislation would be introduced next year to put the plan into effect. Today, the Finance Ministry said it would seriously consider many of the proposals.
The Financial System Stabilization Committee, however, offered virtually no details about how a new debt-disposal institution would be structured. Indeed, analysts criticized the blueprint for being too vague and for failing to address the most pressing problem -- disposal of the bad loans of the home mortgage companies that are now virtually insolvent.
The report's significance is that it "is clearly showing the direction of the policy," said Mineko Sasaki-Smith, senior economist for Morgan Stanley & Company in Tokyo. "But specificity still has to wait." She added that the Government was "reluctant to take an extremely aggressive, surgical approach to the problem" of bad-loan disposal.
The report came only a day after Japan's financial system was jolted anew by the announcement that Daiwa Bank, a major commercial bank, had suffered a loss of $1.1 billion from unauthorized bond trading by an employee in its New York branch. The release of the banking reform proposals today was planned long ago and was not in response to the Daiwa incident.
The report represents another step toward building a consensus to use taxpayer money to pay for some of the bad-loan disposal, as was done in the United States. Many analysts say public financing is needed to resolve the problem and therefore help end Japan's economic slump. But the public is thought to be opposed to bailing out shady operators of failed credit unions.
The report says that for five years some public money might be needed to pay depositors after an institution fails. The report also says that taxpayer money might be needed to help dispose of bad loans but it notes that there is still opposition to this idea on the committee.
The Finance Ministry says Japanese financial institutions are carrying about $400 billion in bad loans, largely because of the collapse of real estate prices in recent years. Independent analysts say the figure is probably twice as high. Using the official figures, the ratio of nonperforming loans to total outstanding loans in Japan is about the same as it was in the United States at the peak of its bad-loan problem in 1991, the committee report says.
The document partly blames mismanagement at the Finance Ministry for the current problems..
The report recommends several regulatory changes to strengthen the financial system in the long run. These are among the proposals:
*Revamping the deposit insurance system and replenishing the insurance fund by raising the premiums banks must pay. The fund, analogous to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the United States, was wiped out by the recent failures of a bank and two large credit unions.
*Increasing inspections so that regulators can shut down ailing financial institutions more rapidly.
*Shifting more regulatory responsibility for credit unions, four of which have failed in the last year, to the Finance Ministry and away from prefectural governments, which lack the necessary expertise.
*Requiring banks to disclose their bad-loan situation more completely. With better disclosure, depositors would be expected to exercise their own responsibility in choosing where to put their money. That way, the Government would not feel obligated to reimburse every depositor if a bank failed.
But on the most pressing issue, that of the home mortgage companies, the report basically punts, other than to call for the formation of an organization like the Resolution Trust Corporation to take over problem loans.
The eight home mortgage companies, known in Japanese as jusen, together have about $84 billion in bad loans, of which up to $63 billion is unrecoverable. The jusen issue has become "symbolic" of Japan's bad-loan situation and therefore should be "urgently addressed," the committee says.
The jusen were set up in the 1970's by large banks and other financial companies to provide loans for home purchases, a business the big banks did not want to be in themselves. But in the 1980's, the banks changed their minds and muscled their way into the home mortgage business.
"By the mid-80's the jusen got their legs cut off by the city banks," said David Threadgold, analyst with BZW Securities in Tokyo. Searching for new business, the jusen began lending heavily to real estate developers. Big banks "introduced clients to the jusen, especially people they didn't want to lend to directly because they were too shady," Mr. Threadgold said.
Now, most of the jusen are expected to be liquidated. The problem is who will swallow such huge losses -- the larger banks that created them, the agriculture cooperatives, which lent money to the jusen, or the Government. The issue is likely to be discussed in Parliament, where farmers have far greater support than banks.
The advisory committee report does not decide this issue. It merely calls on all parties to try to reach a consensus on a bad-debt disposal plan by the end of this year.
 
Putting Japan's Finances in Order
The Finance Ministry released a plan to aid troubled banks and to help restore confidence in the banking system. It is the first plan to propose using tax money to ball out failing financial institutions.
 
What the plan recommends
 
-- Use public funds to finance losses from failed banks.
 
-- Use public funds to stabilize banks before they fail.
 
-- Give authorities power to force the closure of financially troubled banks as soon as they become insolvent.
 
-- Replenish the depleted deposit insurance system through higher premiums and greater borrowing authority.
 
-- Encourage thrifts to become commercial banks.
 
-- Prohibit executives at thrifts from holding senior posts elsewhere.
 
-- Step up supervision of banks; require disclosure of bad loans; require independent review of credit cooperative' books.
 
-- Establish a temporary institution to take over failed thrifts, much like the Resolution Trust Corporation in the United States.

Bond Prices Are Steadied By a Strong Note Auction

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices recovered in late trading yesterday, paring losses after an auction of new five-year notes turned out better than expected.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond slipped 1/32 , to 10329/32 , leaving its yield unchanged at 6.57 percent. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, had risen as high as 6.64 percent in trading yesterday. 
 Treasury securities initially stumbled after the Commerce Department reported yesterday that orders for durable goods jumped 4.9 percent in August, the largest increase in a year.
The increase was larger than what the market had expected, suggesting that spending on big-ticket items would pick up and reviving fears that inflation might start to accelerate.
Ken McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, a market research and analysis firm, said that "the increase in durable goods orders signals healthy, steady growth for the balance of 1995."
But Mr. McCarthy and other analysts noted that the sharp increase in August was largely a result of two developments: auto plants reopened in August after shutdowns in July and the Microsoft Corporation introducted its Windows 95 operating system for personal computers.
"When auto plants shut in July, orders plunge, and when they're re-opened in August, orders increase," Mr. McCarthy said. In addition the introduction of Windows 95, he said, "caused a 4.6 percent jump in orders for nonelectrical machinery, the third increase in the past four months."
"Given the distortion in this data -- a fact the Fed is well aware of -- the key question for the financial markets is, does this increase represent the start of a new upward trend, or is it an anomaly in an otherwise flat trend?" he said. "I think it's an upward trend but a moderate one."
Mr. McCarthy said that he expected a steady increase in durable-good orders -- that is, orders for goods from washing machines to aircraft -- would not keep the Federal Reserve from lowering short-term interest rates this year.
Treasury prices were also under pressure from weakness in the dollar yesterday. A weaker dollar makes imports more expensive, raising prices and inflation pressures as a result.
But a well-subscribed note auction helped bring buyers back into the market. The Treasury auctioned $11.5 billion of new five-year notes yesterday at a high yield of 6.141 percent, down from 6.370 percent last month and the lowest auction yield since June 28, when it was 5.905 percent.
Matthew F. Alexy, the chief market strategist at the CS First Boston Corporation, said the difference between the better-than-expected auction yesterday and the disappointing two-year note auction on Tuesday was that the two-year had been priced in a great deal of uncertainty. "It was coming on the day the Federal Open Market Committee was meeting," he said, referring to the Fed committee that sets short-term interest rates, "and in front of the durable-goods data."
Additionally, the price of the five-year notes was more attractive "and investors felt it had finally reached a price that even they thought was a fair value for the amount of current risk," Mr. Alexy said. "Much of the premium that had been built into the price on expectations that the Fed will cut rates was removed," he added.
Debt futures ended the session lower, with the December bond futures contract dipping early to the low of 11131/32 , before finishing at 11230/32 in the afternoon, one tick off the high set near the close.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new five-year notes:

The S.E.C. tries to insure that investors get better stock prices.

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
TWENTY years after Congress mandated competition among securities markets, the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday made its most determined effort yet to make that competition work to the benefit of investors.
The S.E.C. voted to issue a proposal to require that the various markets that trade stocks in this country act to assure that investors have a reasonable chance of getting better prices than they have often gotten. A principal aim is to make sure that orders from investors can be seen by other investors who might want to take the other side. 
 "The issue is how do you make sure all buying and selling interest is reflected in the market," said Brandon Becker, the director of the S.E.C.'s division of market regulation.
A few decades ago, that goal would have seemed absurd. Nearly all major stocks were traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and for all practical purposes nowhere else. But the Congressional mandate for competition led to the revival of regional exchanges and the growth of other markets. And the Nasdaq market, which was in its infancy 20 years ago, grew to become a major market using competing market makers.
That competition has served to force down the costs of executing a trade, but at the cost of fragmenting markets. An order to sell a stock at a given price ought to meet an order to buy at the same price, but that does not always happen.
"Part of this is to address the fragmentation of the markets without forcing them together," said Richard R. Lindsay, the commission's chief economist. While commission rules have long required brokers to seek "best execution" for all customers, in practice that execution has not been very good, something the S.E.C. hopes to change.
The S.E.C. proposal, which had been leaked last week, calls for all markets to take the following steps:
*Assure that limit orders -- that is orders to buy or sell at a specified price -- are advertised to the market, so that someone willing to take the opposite side can be found.
*Require that brokers who quote prices on stocks quote the same price in all markets. Currently, brokers sometimes quote better prices on Instinet, a proprietary system used by many institutions, than they do on Nasdaq.
*Require that all orders to buy or sell at the market be given a chance for improvement. In practice, it appears that would include only stocks with a spread between the bid and asked prices of at least 25 cents. The bid price is the price at which someone stands ready to buy the stock; the asked price is the price at which someone is willing to sell it. For many liquid stocks, the spread is only 12.5 cents -- one-eighth of a dollar -- and the S.E.C. is unsure what to do in such cases.
*Require that any market maker who accounts for a significant part of trading volume in a stock maintain a published quote in the stock.
Arthur Levitt Jr., the commission chairman, said the rules would "represent a kind of culture change" for markets, but added that the S.E.C. hoped to begin a dialogue with markets and brokerage firms.
The S.E.C. action was taken by Mr. Levitt and Stephen M. H. Wallman, the only other sitting commissioner. Three seats are now vacant, although two nominations are pending.
That actual proposal is vague in many areas, with "hundreds of questions" that brokerage firms and others are asked to comment on, Mr. Wallman said. Details of the proposal will not be disclosed until later this week.
Although it appears that the Nasdaq market would be most affected, the rule is likely to have implications for all markets, including the stock exchanges and the so-called third-market traders who trade away from the primary markets.
Reaction from markets was generally restrained. Spokesmen for both Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange said they needed more details to comment, but added that their markets already met many of the criteria. On Monday, Nasdaq formally introduced its own plan, called Naqcess, to get better prices for traders.
Bernard L. Madoff, whose firm is one of the oldest of the third-market traders, praised the commission's action as "a major step in the right direction." It would, he added, not affect his company's operations.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
An argument that big ego is behind a lot of mergers.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
FIRST they put them together and then, most notably in the cases of ITT, Sears and AT&T, they take them apart. Is there more behind the recent frenzy of corporate coupling and uncoupling than the restless ambition of managers and their investment bankers?
That's what Mathew L.A. Hayward and Donald C. Hambrick of Columbia University seem to think. They argue that simple megalomania is a common disease in the executive suite. In a recent paper presented to the Academy of Management, they found statistical evidence that the premiums paid above market price to acquire new companies were tied to what the two researchers labeled the hubris of the bosses. 
 The conventional wisdom sees the situation differently. Corporate restructuring in the 1980's -- mostly leveraged buyouts -- was initially the result of the stock market's low valuation of corporate assets and Wall Street's new-found ability to peddle junk bonds to banks and insurance companies. By the same token, the current merger mania is apparently driven by an urge to do something -- anything -- to reduce risk or to exploit opportunities in a very rapidly changing business environment.
With profits squeezed in traditional areas of lending, banks have responded by seeking economies of scale. With both Washington and big employers howling to cut medical costs, pharmaceutical makers sought to guarantee market share by swallowing health care providers. With technology breaking the lock on delivering information and entertainment, the big purveyors are covering their bets by purchasing everything in sight. If General Motors and I.B.M. could fall, the thinking goes, why not us?
"They're confronting a profound level of ignorance" about how to adapt old companies to new environments, suggests Oliver E. Williamson of the University of California at Berkeley. And while Mr. Williamson thinks that growth through mergers "is the organizational form of last resort" because it tends to undermine market efficiency and adds to the costs of bureaucracy, he is basically sympathetic with the impulse.
Lawrence J. White, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business, agrees. He sees a common motive in the spate of mergers in banking, medical care, information processing, electric utilities, telecommunications and entertainment. "All are responding to radical changes in technology or public policy," he says. In banking, Mr. White notes, roughly half the mergers seem to have increased efficiency while the other half decreased it. That's pretty much a wash. "These guys aren't as smart as they think they are," he concludes, but they all know they are vulnerable and see mergers and acquisitions as a way to stay ahead of the curve.
Still, means may easily be confused with ends, especially if the boss knows deep in his heart that the cure for what ails the corporation is more of his own august leadership. Executive hubris, Mr. Hayward and Mr. Hambrick argue, leads acquiring companies to pay too much.
They tested the idea by identifying various measures of hubris, among them an index of media praise for the acquiring company's chief executive and the sense of his own self-importance as measured by the ratio of the chief executive's pay to that of his second in command. And they found that the higher on the scale the chief executive happened to be, the larger the premium he was likely to pay over the pre-merger market value. In the 106 mergers in which the target company was bought for more than $100 million in the years 1989 and 1992, both measures were statistically linked to the price paid for the target company. Statisically, each highly favorable article about a chief executive in the national press added 5.4 percent to the premium over market price.
Jaundiced views of corporate mergers are nothing new. In fact, this research leads to a more forgiving perspective than the cynic's presumption that the real motive for most mergers is to generate fees for the investment bankers who do the matchmaking, or simply to give the chief executive a bigger jet to play with or to increase his invitations to White House dinners.
Whether the offending chief executives fall into the fool or knave category, shouldn't someone do something about it? That sentiment stirs memories of the 1960's, when big was equated with bad and the prevailing theory of antitrust put the burden of proof on corporations wishing to merge. Odd though it seems today, Washington spent a decade trying to cut I.B.M. down to size before Apple, Intel and Microsoft showed how fleeting power really was in the computer industry.
The issue for public policy is not whether corporate managers are overdoing the merger thing, but whether somebody is in a position to second-guess them with much hope of success. That somebody is more likely to be the shareholders than a government official. "All we can do," Mr. White concludes, "is try to get the managers' egos aligned with the stockholders' interests."

HEADLINE: Religious Differences Aside, 2 Men Await Pope's Soup Kitchen Visit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, Sept. 27

 BODY:
For two years now, they have eaten breakfast together each morning at Our Daily Bread, this city's largest soup kitchen, and most days, the hour passes with only the mildest of chitchat. Once in a while, though, Douglas Tillery and his friend Alphonso Alvarez Jr. start talking religion. Then look out.
Mr. Alvarez is a Buddhist, Mr. Tillery a Baptist who would like to convert him. 
 "Buddha's nothing but a statue," Mr. Tillery said this morning, as they went at it again.
Mr. Alvarez laughed and said, "It's a wonderful thing."
"It's all bunk," Mr. Tillery huffed.
"Got to be yourself," Mr. Alvarez replied.
It has become their endless conversation, and they talked on for another few minutes today with the usual result of Mr. Alvarez promising to consider change and Mr. Tillery doubting his sincerity.
But recently, their debate has taken a new and, for them, quite unexpected turn. Of the hundreds of men and women who eat each day at the soup kitchen, Mr. Alvarez and Mr. Tillery are among 20 participants in local Roman Catholic charity programs invited to join Pope John Paul II and William Cardinal Keeler of Baltimore for lunch at the soup kitchen on Oct. 8.
The Pope's five-day trip to the United States, which includes four busy days in Newark and New York, is scheduled to end with a 10-hour visit to Baltimore.
With huge crowds expected at highlight events of the trip, Masses at Giants Stadium, Aqueduct Racetrack, Central Park and Oriole Park at Camden Yards here, the soup kitchen lunch of chicken-and-rice casserole and chocolate cake is one of the few small-scale events on the Pope's schedule. But it underscores a major theme of his visits to wealthier countries, that more should be done to help the poor and homeless.
By choosing Our Daily Bread, a 14-year-old institution on the same downtown block as the Basilica of the Assumption, the oldest Catholic cathedral in the country, the visit highlights not only the Pope's concerns but also the local archdiocese's.
"Being right there on that site shows our commitment to helping those less fortunate than we," said Bill Blaul, a spokesman for the Pope's Baltimore visit. "People are not stuffed away into some corner somewhere."
Vatican officials and archdiocese representatives have been planning the soup kitchen lunch for more than a year, to follow the stadium Mass and an afternoon parade from the stadium to the Basilica.
But the lunch guests, who include a mother with three children in a Head Start program and a couple who adopted two children from South Korea, were invited only last week, after officials from the charity programs settled on candidates whose lives had stabilized as a result of the services offered. Meals at Our Daily Bread are offered to elderly and disabled people of any religion.
Both Mr. Alvarez, 57, an employee of Goodwill Industries who has been disabled most of his life because of polio, and Mr. Tillery, a 45-year-old unemployed and disabled former marine and police officer, said in an interview after breakfast that they were surprised to learn they were selected. But only Mr. Alvarez, the more talkative of the two, could imagine what he might say to the Pope if given the chance to speak freely.
"With all the dope and drugs and people robbing people, I'd talk about trying to help other people the best you know how," said Mr. Alvarez, who was robbed but unhurt just last week in an incident near his downtown apartment.
Mr. Tillery said he would "try to be quiet and let the Holy Spirit speak to me and see what He has to say."
Mr. Tillery, who describes himself as a "spiritual Christian," said that anything he might say to John Paul would also come from the Holy Spirit.
But Mr. Tillery needed no apparent guidance in advising Mr. Alvarez to temper his enthusiasm for Buddhism, at least on Oct. 8.
"Don't tell the Pope," he said.

HEADLINE: Clampdown at Border Is Hailed as Success

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Sept. 23

 BODY:
Border Patrol agents call it squeezing the balloon. For the past year, aided by a big infusion of Federal money, manpower and technology, they have been squeezing as never before, choking off illegal crossings from Mexico at the busiest section of the border.
The immediate effects are unmistakable at the five-mile Imperial Beach section of the border that has historically been the scene of one-quarter of all illegal land entries into the United States and a symbol of the nation's difficulties in controlling its frontiers. 
 Once the nights were filled with chaos and violence, as both immigrants and the bandits who preyed on them clashed with American border guards. Now an ugly 10-foot-high welded-steel wall snakes up hillsides and down ravines, bathed in the orange glare of high-intensity stadium lights. Scores of Border Patrol agents keep watch from newly purchased vans, their work made easier by new night-vision scopes, ground motion sensors and computers.
This new equipment has given the agents the edge, but has not ended their cat-and-mouse game with border-crossers. As soon as the steel barricade was erected, replacing a sagging and torn chicken-wire fence, immigrants began tunneling beneath it, working holes into it and building ramps on the southern side to help them leap across. In response, agents began reinforcing the wall struts, anchoring its base in concrete and extending the sheeting as much as 10 feet underground in some areas.
The battle along the border here, part of a $500 million immigration initiative begun last year by the Clinton Administration, has as its target not only illegal aliens but also political opponents. Next August, the Republicans, who have made a campaign issue of illegal immigration, will hold their national convention here in San Diego, within a 15-minute drive of the border.
The one-year anniversary of the crackdown, Operation Gatekeeper, falls on Sunday. Academics who monitor the border say it is too soon to conclude whether this experiment in intensive border enforcement has been effective and worth its expense. But the Administration claims a measure of initial success.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service puts the cost for the first year of Operation Gatekeeper at $46 million, covering fencing, lights, vehicles, equipment, new agents and overtime.
"It is wonderful progress in an area where, frankly, most of us never really believed that government intervention like this would work," said Robert Bach, the top policy and planning official for the immigration agency, which oversees the Border Patrol. "This is historic. These are routes of travel that Mexicans have been using for decades. We have broken that up."
Along the Imperial Beach section of the border, which runs from the surf of the Pacific Ocean to the checkpoint in San Diego's San Ysidro section, the initial results were startling: apprehensions of illegal border-crossers, the main yardstick used to determine success, were reduced by 40 percent, to 114,460, over the past year. The Imperial Beach section covers the first 5 miles of a 24-mile wall along what is known as the San Diego Sector. The wall is in three sections, built where crossings have been most prevalent.
But as Border Patrol agents and planners like Mr. Bach have learned from long experience, when the balloon is squeezed in one place, it bulges in another. While apprehensions have dropped along the Imperial Beach section, they have skyrocketed farther east. Indeed, the total number of apprehensions along the San Diego Sector have actually risen by 14 percent over the past year, to 512,000.
Mr. Bach and other officials say they were prepared for the eastern bulge, calling it proof of their rapid success to the west, and insist that it is only a matter of time before these sections are also brought under control. Their plan is to push illegal border-crossers still farther to the east where they will face the obstacles of mountains and deserts and be forced to travel farther to reach the sanctuaries of cities.
But after a year of the most expensive and determined effort ever mounted by the Federal Government to bring the Mexican border under control, the fundamental question remains open: Is it possible to squeeze the entire balloon and to halt illegal immigration by force?
Is it possible, in the words of Johnny N. Williams, chief patrol agent of the San Diego Sector, to send the message to people in the poor villages of Mexico: "Stay home. If you try to cross over, you are going to get caught."
Wayne Cornelius, director of the Center for United States-Mexican Studies at the University of California at San Diego, said his visits to such villages suggested that the impetus of poverty was stronger than the deterrent effect of a more difficult border crossing.
"There is no evidence," Mr. Cornelius said, "that pushing illegal migrants into areas where there are more physical obstacles to crossing will deter more than a small minority from trying repeatedly to gain entry until they succeed.
"When you consider the economic return from even a short period of employment in the United States, the cost-benefit ratio still strongly favors illegal entry."
Thus, while Operation Gatekeeper sharply reduced the number of apprehensions in the Imperial Beach section, those along all other areas of the San Diego Sector rose. They were the Chula Vista area, up 27 percent, to 133,710; Brown Field, up 90 percent, to 129,326; El Cajon, up 439 percent, to 46,089; Campo, up 1,752 percent, to 24,111, and the Boulevard area, up 889 percent to 10,361.
"The movement eastward has occurred faster than I had predicted," Mr. Bach said, "and our ability to respond to that traffic in the east has strained our resources."
But he said the people crossing to the east, with a longer and more difficult trip to the cities, would be easier to apprehend once the Border Patrol increased its resources there.
And he said the immigration service was augmenting its border enforcement with other deterrents, including expedited deportation of criminal aliens and tighter enforcement of sanctions against employers who hire undocumented workers.
The Gatekeeper crackdown is part of a $540 million immigration initiative announced by Attorney General Janet Reno in February 1994. Since then, the Administration has nearly doubled the size of the Border Patrol, to more than 4,500 agents. It has asked Congress to approve the addition of hundreds more agents each year, with the goal of fielding about 7,000 agents by the end of 1998.
Statistics on apprehensions are notoriously difficult to analyze because they can be interpreted to reflect either improved enforcement or a surge in immigration. Mr. Williams, the San Diego Sector's chief patrol agent, said several factors complicated the current picture.
One is Mexico's economic crisis, after the devaluation of the peso last December, which most analysts believe has increased the number of Mexicans seeking employment in the United States. "They turned on the faucet," Mr. Williams said. "Absent Gatekeeper, we would have had a tidal wave."
A second is the phenomenon of repeat efforts to cross. Once a would-be migrant reaches the frontier from the interior of Mexico, is caught and sent back across the border, studies have shown, he or she is likely to try again and again rather than return home.
"We are apprehending fewer people more often," Mr. Williams said. "We have more fishermen in the sea, if you will."

Chart/Map: "A CLOSER LOOK: A Steel Wall on the Border"
 The Immigration and Naturalization service has built a 10-foot high steel wall along 24 miles of the southern Californian border with Mexico and 340 feet into the Pacific Ocean. The move has forced illegal crossings to take place futher to the east. The wall is in three sections of 14 miles, 7 miles and 3 miles.

Surge in Ad Revenue For TV Predicted

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
The Television Bureau of Advertising said yesterday that it expected significant increases for television advertising revenue in 1996, citing the Summer Olympics, the Presidential election and a "a reasonably healthy" economy. 
 According to the association in New York, which represents broadcast television stations, network ad revenue is expected to grow 9 to 11 percent above that in 1995; national syndication, 8 to 10 percent; cable, 12 to 14 percent, and spot television, 7 to 9 percent. Harold Simpson, vice president for research and development, listed among categories expected to perform "exceptionally well" personal computers, home electronics, retailing and telecommunications.

HEADLINE: Pataki, a Son of Hungary, Is Embraced as Its Rich Uncle

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: BUDAPEST, Sept. 27

 BODY:
The Prime Minister suggested on Monday that the Governor could help create an American Marshall Plan for Hungary. The Interior Minister asked him on Tuesday to help the nation fight organized crime. The mayor of one small town asked him for help in getting an airport, while the mayor of another thought Mr. Pataki might drum up investors for a riverside resort project.
Gov. George E. Pataki spent the final hours of his visit to the country of his ancestors today much the way he spent the previous four days: listening to petitioners. 
 A college official asked him to prevent the Hungarian Government from cutting his school's budget -- not realizing, perhaps, that Mr. Pataki himself cut spending on New York State colleges earlier this year. Business leaders implored him to open a Budapest trade office. And human-rights activists urged him to speak out on the treatment of Hungarians overseas.
So it has gone for much of the Governor's Hungarian trip, which ended today as Mr. Pataki flew to Italy for a five-day visit. Having come here to help New York's economy by building commerce with Hungary, Mr. Pataki instead found himself inundated with appeals to help Hungary first.
"He's like the rich American uncle," said Bulcsu Veress, a Hungarian-American who has been accompanying Mr. Pataki for much of the trip.
The tenor of the trip has raised questions about just what Mr. Pataki can achieve here to help New York's economy, and whether, if his aim was to help the state, he would have been better off staying home to fight proposed Federal spending cuts that could devastate New York's budget.
Mr. Pataki has answered by saying that he will lobby hard in Washington against budget cuts as soon as he returns home next week. And he argued that the trip would benefit New York's economy in the long run by pushing the state faster into an emerging Central and Eastern European market.
"If I.B.M. is successful in marketing computers in Eastern Europe, where there should be an exploding market over the course of the next decade, it should allow us to create chip-manufacturing jobs in the Hudson Valley," Mr. Pataki explained to reporters today. "I think to the extent we can see better market penetration by New York companies, it can only help us."
But greater market penetration did not seem to be much on the minds of Hungarian officials the Governor met.
Asked if Hungarians expected more of him than he could possibly deliver, Mr. Pataki said: "I don't think there is any great belief that the visit of the Governor of New York is going to change the economic circumstances of Hungary. I think there is the hope that I will take back the message that these vast potential markets on the new global marketplace exist."
But among Hungarians, Mr. Pataki is clearly viewed as a walking promotion for Hungarians, and his trip is seen as a public-relations coup for the entire country.
"Every Hungarian thinks that George Pataki can raise awareness about Hungary in America," said George Lang, the New York restaurateur who is co-owner of Gundel Restaurant in Budapest. "The fact that he did this trip already is a kind of public relations wave you couldn't buy for any amount of money."
Laszlo R. Czirjak, general manager of Bankers Trust's Hungary office, said Mr. Pataki could help convince American investors that Hungary, despite its large debt, high inflation rate and fitful attempts to privatize state industries, can be a safe haven for American investments.
"Hungary suffers from an image problem," he said. "The Governor has access to a lot of people and in informal meetings with companies he can say, 'Hey, look at Hungary instead of the Far East.' "
American-based companies with operations in Hungary also seem to think that Mr. Pataki will help them deal with Hungarian Government officials, even after he returns to New York.
Amid the high expectations of him, Mr. Pataki has already disappointed on one front. Many Hungarian business leaders hoped that he would announce the opening of a state trade office in Budapest. But Mr. Pataki, who has closed four of the state's overseas offices as part of budget cuts this year, today said no.
Instead, he said that the state's last remaining European trade office, in London, would create a Central and Eastern European desk to find business opportunities for New York State companies.
Some East European experts said that the high expectations of Mr. Pataki are sure to lead to more disappointments.
"Unfortunately, I think they expect too much from this trip," said Ronald P. Oppen, director of the State University of New York's international programs for Eastern Europe. "It's because their needs are so great."

HEADLINE: Reform of the U.N. Is Overdue

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who can be diplomatic to a fault, cut quickly to the point in his address before the 50th anniversary session of the United Nations General Assembly this week. To win back the ebbing trust and support of Americans, he told the delegates, the U.N. must reform its financial ways.
Mr. Christopher urged the U.N. to eliminate outdated or duplicative agencies and programs, streamline its patronage-swollen headquarters bureaucracy and subject all parts of the organization to the scrutiny of inspectors general with the authority to end financial waste. 
 Dozens of agencies, he pointed out, now share overlapping responsibilities in the areas of economic development, emergency relief and statistical reporting. Some of the functions of the venerable U.N. Conference on Trade and Development may more appropriately belong to the new World Trade Organization. Despite some modestly successful efforts at improved financial oversight in recent years, the U.N. has been repeatedly embarrassed by procurement scandals, excessive personnel costs and the waste of scarce resources.
Mr. Christopher called, as President Clinton did last year, for a far more selective approach to peacekeeping operations and a reapportionment of contributions to reduce the American share and to reflect the rise of new economic powers like Japan.
The United States is asked to contribute 31 percent of the peacekeeping budget in addition to valuable support in equipment and people. That is only partly offset by U.N. contracts for peacekeeping purchases that go to American companies.
Mr. Christopher was right on every point. The U.N., despite its many shortcomings as an international forum, can play an important role in making the world safer and more secure, but it badly needs to fix its internal problems and funding inequities. There is little chance Congress will provide more than $1 billion in overdue assessments until it does.
In other areas, Mr. Christopher rightly reiterated American support for making Germany and Japan permanent members of the Security Council, although he failed to address how this could be accomplished without further increasing the disproportionate power already exercised by the developed world or making the council unwieldy. The U.N. cannot dodge these questions any longer.
Mr. Christopher has provided the U.N. with a timely and necessary program of reform that it would be wise to act on promptly.

New Evil Empire

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Security will be especially tight at the House Judiciary Committee's hearing room tomorrow morning, as a former Chicago mobster testifies about the penetration of organized crime into the booming world of "legitimate" gambling.
William Jahoda, under Federal protection, will get the camera attention, but the story will be the Federal Government's first step toward focusing the nation's attention on gambling, the new evil empire 
 Gambling is a $40-billion-a-year industry that is inherently immoral, corrupting public officials, enriching criminals, addicting and impoverishing the young and vulnerable.
But the gambling racket -- whether in state-licensed casinos, state-sponsored lotteries or on glitzy reservations of phony Indian tribes -- has been promoted by public officials as a great way of painlessly raising revenues, with state voters acting as suckers. As a result, officially endorsed and government-advertised gambling now has America by the throat.
Last week in this space, I wrote about a bill presented by Representative Frank Wolf, Republican of Virginia, to establish a national commission to investigate gambling's economic and social effects. The word was that the bill would get a hearing and then be shelved
But a phenomenon is under way. Senator Richard Lugar challenged the Christian Coalition and other family-values groups to get behind the movement to root out this state-sponsored immorality.
They did. "We'll have a couple of representatives present at the hearing," Ralph Reed of the Coalition tells me, "and we'll underwrite the work of a full-time lobbyist." He joined a half-dozen family groups warning, in a letter to Speaker Newt Gingrich, that "teenagers are gambling in record numbers."
Reed notes how the alliance worked in defeating gambling in Virginia: "The combination of black preachers and white family groups can be a powerful force in politics. They freeze the Democrats, we freeze the Republicans."
Meanwhile, Tom Grey, a Methodist minister from Galena, Ill., who heads the grass-roots National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling, got busy with his fax machine. At the hearing, Mr. Grey will fade the bet of Frank Fahrenkopf, the former Republican National Committee Chairman hired by the gamblers.
A member of the House Republican leadership called me in wonderment: "There's more mustard on this issue than I thought." He now expects Judiciary will mark up the bill and make it available for a floor vote next month.
Who stands for the forces of darkness at the House hearing? Representative Barbara Vucanovich, Republican of Nevada, says: "This bill is the nose under the tent of Federal interference with the right of states to regulate gambling." She admits that "gaming is kind of wasting your money" and is "not something the people of Nevada do," but clings to that decentralizing principle.
As a card-carrying devolutionary, I'm for providing states with national information to help them make local decisions. This is a national nose we have to get under the state tents in a hurry, as gambling on riverboats and Indian lands undermines jurisdictions, and as on-line gambling turns computers into interstate casinos.
Gamblers like Steve Wynn of Las Vegas, who just raised $500,000 for Bob Dole at a lunch, think they have the Senate majority leader in their pocket; they may be surprised.
For the first time in years of wailing in the wilderness, I see hope for turning the gambling trend around. We need no laws against a friendly poker game or church fund-raising by Bingo; we do need the facts that will disabuse local voters of the notion that skimming gambling profits helps local education. That's a hoax: the truth is that lottery proceeds soon substitute for, and do not augment, education funds.
"We've been taking them on and beating them," reports Tom Grey, who claims 16 state victories against 2 defeats in two years, on next to no money. His group (1-800-664-2680, E-mail ncalgwave.park.wy.us) meets with like-minded moralists in Orlando, Fla., on Oct. 27 for a national strategy session.
Odds are this bill to investigate gambling will pass. And the truth will make us free.

HEADLINE: Hidden Change in Foreign Aid Bill Sets G.O.P. Against G.O.P.

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
A disagreement has broken out among Senate Republicans over an amendment quietly stuck into the foreign aid bill that would withdraw most-favored-nation trading status to any country that does not back sanctions against the Burmese military Government.
While floor managers of bills often insert amendments that have unanimous support, several lawmakers criticized Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who managed the foreign aid bill, for inserting an amendment, without unanimous backing, that could have huge repercussions. 
 Several lawmakers said the bill could, for instance, cut off China's most-favored trade status because Beijing does not honor sanctions against Myanmar, formerly Burma.
As the flap heated up, Senator McConnell said he would withdraw the amendment.
After the Senate approved the bill last Thursday, John McCain of Arizona, a Republican leader on foreign policy, took to the Senate floor to attack the way the amendment on Myanmar was inserted.
"I was quite upset about it and thought it was highly inappropriate to do it," Mr. McCain said in an interview. "I have a special concern about Burma -- 60 percent of the heroin coming to the United States comes through Burma -- and if there was an amendment on the issue, I wanted to be involved in the debate."
Joining this unusual intraparty feud, Senator William Roth, the Delaware Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee, wrote a letter to Mr. McConnell expressing great disappointment with the amendment. He complained not only that the provision involved matters that were the jurisdiction of his committee, but also that its call for withdrawing most-favored-nation trade status would violate treaties.
In an interview today, Mr. McConnell said he inserted the amendment without a vote to apply some quick pressure on the Burmese military dictatorship. The foreign aid bill, approved 91 to 9, would cut overseas assistance by 10 percent.
Mr. McConnell's amendment also calls for banning travel to Myanmar, barring Burmese imports and withholding money to the International Monetary Fund if it provides aid to Myanmar.
"I do think there is some urgency about this," Mr. McConnell said. "The situation there is quite terrible. I thought it would be helpful to the situation in Burma to have some language in the bill."
He called Senator McCain late today to say he would move to delete the amendment when House and Senate lawmakers meet to rework the bill in conference. Nonetheless, Mr. McConnell vowed to continue trying to pressure Myanmar and "fight this another day and soon."
Several Republican Senate aides said they had been reassured by Robin Cleveland, a top aide to Mr. McConnell, that no Myanmar amendment would be put into the foreign aid bill. Several Republican aides said they were stunned to learn that a Myanmar amendment had been inserted into the overall bill, especially since several senators had expressed reservations about a bill on Myanmar that Mr. McConnell had been floating for several months.
Mr. McConnell defended his decision to insert the amendment. Speaking about Senator McCain, he said, "What was unusual was that John wanted to clear every amendment we handled," he said. "That's just not possible. You can't manage a bill that way."
But a senior Republican aide said, "It violates all Senate rules of tradition and comity to surreptitiously insert an important amendment that does not have unanimous consent."

HEADLINE: China Cancels A Sale to Iran, Pleasing U.S.

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 27

 BODY:
In a move that is likely to speed up the recovery in the troubled relationship between Washington and Beijing, China told the United States today that it had decided to cancel its contract to sell two nuclear power reactors to Iran.
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told Secretary of State Warren Christopher of his Government's decision during a nearly two-hour meeting at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, a senior Administration official told reporters after the meeting. 
 Just five months ago, in a similar meeting in New York, Mr. Qian told Mr. Christopher that despite fierce objections by the United States, which wants to keep nuclear technologies out of the hands of the militant Iranian Government, his country intended to go forward with the deal.
But also today, in a clear rebuff to the United States, the Chinese declined an invitation from President Clinton for President Jiang Zemin to come to Washington for a meeting next month.
The unwillingness to accept the invitation was based not on any substantive disagreement, but on China's insistence that Mr. Jiang deserved a formal state visit -- complete with an arrival ceremony with 21-gun salute, dozens of Chinese flags flying along Pennsylvania Avenue and a formal dinner at the White House, other senior Administration officials said.
Mr. Christopher and his team had expected Mr. Qian to accept eagerly -- and express gratitude for -- an invitation to the White House, and the American side had been expected to announce a summit meeting after the session.
Senior Administration officials do not rule out the possibility of a summit meeting in Washington, and Chinese and American officials will continue talks on how to make it happen in the days after the two leaders address the General Assembly next month during ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the United Nations.
But a formal state visit may be more problematic. Mr. Clinton has said he does not like state visits and he has presided over only seven -- for the leaders of Japan, South Africa, Ukraine, Russia, Brazil, South Korea and Morocco. President Jacques Chirac of France has been invited for a state visit in November.
In addition, elevating a meeting with the Chinese President to a state visit might open Mr. Clinton to criticism from conservative Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill that he is being too nice to Beijing, particularly since only weeks ago the United States-China relationship was in the worst state since China crushed its democracy movement in 1989.
"A summit remains a goal of both sides," said the official. But he added that in the current Administration, "It's still very rare to have official state visits."
In recent weeks a number of events have helped pull both countries back from the brink: the release by Beijing of Harry Wu, the American human rights advocate convicted of stealing state secrets; the visit by Hillary Rodham Clinton to Beijing to address the international women's conference; the decision of the Chinese to return their Ambassador to Washington and approve an American Ambassador for Beijing, and an easing of Capitol Hill's China-bashing.
In another sign of China's determination to get the relationship back on track, the thorny issue of Taiwan was barely discussed in today's meeting, and Mr. Qian did not repeat his country's persistent demand that the United States pledge never again to allow a Taiwanese leader to visit the United States.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Jiang, who is Secretary General of the Communist Party and Commander in Chief of China's three-million-member Army, have met twice before: in Seattle in 1993 and in Jakarta, Indonesia, last year. Although Mr. Clinton has a gift for disarming his guests, the two men have never hit it off.
But the Chinese rejection of the summit meeting invitation could not obscure the much more important development involving Iran.
A senior Administration official suggested China did not make the decision in deference to Washington but for its own internal reasons.
"The Secretary raised our well-known concerns," he said, but added, "It was their own unilateral decision."
The head of Iran's nuclear agency, Reza Amrollahi, said in an interview last May that he had signed a formal contract last year and had made a down payment on two 300-megawatt pressurized water reactors to be built in southern Iran. But China is believed to have become increasingly resigned to the fact that the deal would fail, both because of Iran's increasingly difficult economic situation and its nuclear cooperation with Russia, which has begun a $780 million project to complete a much-larger reactor at Bushehr on the Persian Gulf.
In addition, the United States had doubts that China could build the reactors on its own because the original model included parts from Germany and Japan.
Today's meeting between Mr. Christopher and Mr. Qian also went a long way to setting aside the thorny issue of Taiwan, which China considers a renegade province.
The relationship between the two countries has been deteriorating since the beginning of the year, but it worsened considerably last spring, after the United States decided to change 16 years of official policy and allow President Lee Deng Hui of Taiwan to visit the United States.
After months of trying, the Administration has apparently convinced Beijing that it has no intention of abandoning its one-China policy, although it has refused to pledge never to allow future visits by Taiwanese officials.
In remarks to reporters before today's meeting, Mr. Qian seemed to accept that, saying the United States has "stated that it fully understands the seriousness and sensitivity of the question of the visit to the United States by Tawian leaders." He added, "The U.S. side will handle this question with great prudence in the future."
For his part, Mr. Christopher also sounded a conciliatory note, saying before the meeting: "Sometimes we've had differences, Sometimes we've had quite profound disagreements on issues like human rights. But both of our countries accept that the best way to address those problems is through positive and regular dialogue."

Clinton and Yeltsin to Meet
 WASHINGTON, Sept. 27 (AP) -- President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia agreed today to get together of an abbreviated meeting on Oct. 23 in Hyde Park, N.Y., the White House announced today.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin spoke for 20 minutes today, discussing the coming meeting -- to be held in conjunction with the United Nations session in New York -- and recent peace developments in Bosnia, a White House spokesman, Mike McCurry, said.
Mr. McCurry said Hyde Park, the home of Franklin D. Roosevelt, was chosen as the site because "that would evoke the spirit of cooperation between the United States and Russia that existed during World War II."

HEADLINE: Orders for Durable Goods Surged by 4.9% in August

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Orders for big-ticket manufactured goods jumped 4.9 percent in August, the largest increase in a year, as some auto plants resumed production after a shutdown to retool for 1996 models, the Commerce Department said today.
"It's a strong number," said Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York. "It's a good-sized gain despite the monthly volatility. It points to better manufacturing ahead." 
 August's increase in orders for durable goods -- among the most volatile of the monthly economic indicators -- was the first since May. The Commerce Department also revised July's decline to show a drop of 1.8 percent, smaller than the 2.7 percent originally reported.
The August increase was well above analysts' forecasts, which had ranged from about 2.4 percent to 3.1 percent. It brought fears that inflation might accelerate and investors concluded that the latest data would give the Federal Reserve little need to cut interest rates soon.
"There's no risk of a recession in 1995," said Anthony Chan, chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation, in Columbus, Ohio. "The economy will probably hum along" at an annual rate of 2.5 percent to 3 percent, he said.
August's increase in orders was broad. Excluding orders for transportation equipment, durable goods orders rose 2 percent. Excluding military hardware, orders rose 3.8 percent.
The breadth of August's increase suggests that the gain was not a fluke, Mr. Chan said.
Over all, "the risks of recession have receded since early this summer," analysts at the Nationsbank Corporation wrote before the release of today's report, citing a surge in housing sales and construction.
Still, analysts took note of the data's volatility, which stems from an erratic pattern of orders for aircraft and military hardware. The seasonal shutdown of auto plants in July added more volatility to orders this summer, analysts said.
If August's surge in manufacturing orders does prove to be an aberration, continued sluggishness on the industrial side of the economy could give the Federal Reserve reason to lower interest rates.
Unfilled orders, a gauge of pent-up demand, rose two-tenths of 1 percent in August, the ninth increase in the last year. Shipments, a gauge of current demand, increased 4.7 percent, the third gain in four months.

HEADLINE: In Schools Crisis, Union's Opportunity

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
Sandra Feldman, the canny and powerful president of the New York City teachers' union, has been complaining more than usual this fall: about Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's epic battle with the Board of Education over the choice of a new chancellor, about overcrowded classrooms, about having to negotiate a teachers' contract during the worst education budget cuts since 1975.
"This is a horrible, horrible situation," she said. 
 In truth, this may be Ms. Feldman's season of triumph. While Mr. Giuliani and Carol A. Gresser, the president of the Board of Education, have warred for months about hegemony over the school system, Ms. Feldman has quietly maneuvered herself into a position in which the union will have considerable say in how that system is run.
"She is using this dysfunctional situation to her advantage," Mrs. Gresser said.
Last week, in conversations with board members, Ms. Feldman spoke warmly of the Mayor's latest choice for chancellor, Leon M. Goldstein, the president of Kingsborough Community College. Mr. Goldstein is opposed by Mrs. Gresser, and has been criticized for his close ties to the Brooklyn Democratic machine. "I think his political savvy is a plus," said Ms. Feldman, echoing the Mayor.
Next month, Ms. Feldman will try to finish negotiating a new union contract with City Hall, which pays the teachers, and the school board and the new chancellor, who set policy. Ms. Feldman wants higher salaries, and also a sweeping transfer of power in budget and hiring decisions from the Board of Education to individual schools -- and teachers. If the chancellor is Mr. Goldstein, both he and Mr. Giuliani will owe favors to Ms. Feldman at an opportune time.
"What we're watching here is a superb union leader and tactician coming in for the kill," said Edward I. Koch, the former Mayor, who said he only recently forgave Ms. Feldman for supporting his successful opponent, David N. Dinkins, six years ago.
Two weeks ago, working with Mr. Giuliani, her new ally, Ms. Feldman used her political leverage over the Board of Education to secure a promise of no teacher layoffs. City Hall was impressed. "She's got an incredible political and legislative lobbying organization over there," said Randy Levine, the Mayor's chief labor negotiator.
Ms. Feldman has long been one of the most important power brokers in the city, a union boss with the votes and influence from her 120,000-member United Federation of Teachers to make or break candidates for mayor, City Council, borough president and the Legislature. She is unapologetic about her maneuverings.
"I think if I were not looked upon as a formidable political force," she said, "I would not be doing my job."
Sandra Feldman is 55, a tall, angular, well-dressed worrier who wakes up in the middle of the night and makes lists. Friends say she does lighten up -- she has a good torch-singer voice after a glass of wine -- but it takes time.
"If you walk up to Sandy in a social setting and ask, 'Did you have a good summer?' " said Richard I. Beattie, a lawyer and founder of the Fund for New York City Public Education, "she'll say, 'Oh, things have been terrible, the Mayor's been fighting with the Board of Ed.' And you have to say, 'No, no, Sandy, did you have a good vacation?' "
Ms. Feldman, who has no children and spent only three years as a classroom teacher, has always looked upon the teachers' union as her personal cause and the New York City public school system as her salvation. In a conversation with a teacher at New Dorp High School in Staten Island the other day, she recalled how her first home economics class in junior high school had made a small, but important, change in her life.
"It was the first time I understood there was a difference between a kitchen dish towel and a regular towel," she said, smiling. "I learned something about how to live in the world that I wouldn't have known."
Ms. Feldman grew up in the back three rooms of a condemned house on Neptune Avenue in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn, the unhappy daughter of a milkman and a mother who was so often ill that Ms. Feldman, the eldest, was left to care for her two younger siblings. "What we both got at home was no comfort and not much love and no recognition for our intelligence," said Ms. Feldman's friend, Rachelle Horowitz, a consultant to the American Federation of Teachers.
Public School 188 in Coney Island and a beloved second-grade teacher, Miss Bezman, opened her life. "I had no idea this world existed," said Ms. Feldman, who has spoken time and again of Miss Bezman as a kind of guardian angel. "There were paints and pictures and books and musical instruments. I loved school."
Ms. Feldman still gets misty-eyed during visits to schools like P.S. 19 in Corona, Queens, which immigration in recent years has swelled to 2,500 pupils with 25 languages from 47 countries. The students include some fifth graders who had never been in a classroom before. Ms. Feldman, whose grandparents arrived in Brooklyn from Eastern Europe during the great wave of immigration at the turn of the century, finds in schools the memories of the best days of her youth.
"This looks just like the school I went to," she said. "You know, they made those cookie-cutter buildings," she added, with feeling in her eyes, looking at the hopeful new paint in the P.S. 19 auditorium.
Ms. Feldman's background is also that of a traditional union organizer, schooled as she was by the civil rights leader Bayard Rustin and her even more powerful predecessor at the union, Albert Shanker. Her political education began in the late 1950's as a student at Brooklyn College, where Ms. Feldman fell comfortably into the socialist politics of a small group of campus bohemians. "We all came from working class, emotionally deprived backgrounds," said Ms. Horowitz, who became friends with Ms. Feldman when the two began passing notes complaining of a professor's "simple behavioral stuff" in a psychology course.
"Partly we were interested in psychology for selfish reasons," Ms. Horowitz said. "You know, 'When will we be happy?' So a lot of that was channeled into our activism. We had this belief that our personal happiness would come from making the world better."
Ms. Feldman was married after her freshman year to Paul Feldman, whom she met on the literary magazine. "We were both drawn to tortured men," Ms. Horowitz said. The couple were divorced 17 years later, and Ms. Feldman is now married to Arthur Barnes, the former president of the New York Urban Coalition.
Two of Ms. Feldman's proudest moments were her arrest for trying to integrate restaurants on Route 40 in Maryland in 1963, and her work in Harlem helping with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s march on Washington in August of that year. That fall, she began her only regular job as a teacher at P.S. 34 on the Lower East Side, where she taught first and fourth grades and was one of only two members of the union.
Within a year, Ms. Feldman had helped organize the entire teaching staff. By 1966, on the recommendation of Mr. Rustin, Mr. Shanker hired her as a full-time field representative.
"I said to myself, 'Well, I can always go back to teaching,' " Ms. Feldman said. She laughed. "Here I am."
Ms. Feldman became president of the union in 1986, and has been re-elected five times by increasing majorities. Mr. Shanker, now president of the American Federation of Teachers in Washington, has recently cast less of a shadow over her life. "As the years went on I got more and more confident," Ms. Feldman said. "But it was very difficult."
One of the more absorbing developments of the chancellor battle has been Ms. Feldman's newfound relationship with Mr. Giuliani. "Personally, he's different from the way he comes across," Ms. Feldman said. "He's very charming. He's funny. He's nice. And there are things I agree with him about. He really cares about the schools."
The Mayor and the largely Democratic teachers' union found common purpose this summer, when Ms. Feldman made a deal, as part of a citywide agreement, with Mr. Giuliani: no layoffs in exchange for the union's forfeiture of $160 million in health and pension benefits. The Board of Education then announced it was not a party to the deal, and all summer threatened to defy the Mayor with layoffs. By the time school started, 1,000 unassigned teachers did not know if they could keep their jobs, but under pressure from City Hall and Ms. Feldman, the board agreed to keep the teachers for now.
Given the circumstances, Ms. Feldman said it is not surprising she has sided with the Mayor, but denied that she made a deal with him to remain neutral, or even support him, in the next election. (The union was neutral in 1993, which helped Mr. Giuliani defeat Mr. Dinkins.)
"The mayor is the mayor," said Ms. Feldman. "The mayor holds the purse strings. And when it's time to enter the political fray, if that's helpful to my members, I've never been shy about it. I've been in it, and I will be in it, when I need to be."
She said she does not favor giving Mr. Giuliani line-by-line control of the school budget, as he wants, but that "if he had confidence in the person running the budget end of things, that might not be the issue that it is."
Few things make Ms. Feldman angrier than critics who say that her union, with its seniority rules, opposition to merit pay and restrictions on dismissing teachers for incompetence, is not only inconsistent with her goals for children but also an impediment to improving schools. "There is nothing I have ever done as a union leader which has not been good for kids," Ms. Feldman said, adding that the union, "despite popular myth, does not want incompetent teachers in the classroom."
In contract talks, Ms. Feldman is asking for salaries that will be more competitive with surrounding districts. Top pay in New York City is $60,000, compared with $74,000 in White Plains and more than $80,000 in some districts on Long Island. Ms. Feldman makes $156,963 a year.
She says she will have to be "in an oxygen tent" before she gives up a much-criticized benefit, the $20 million a year spent on sabbaticals, available to teachers after 14 years at up to 70 percent pay.
"Having teachers with high morale who have self-respect and dignity is good for kids," Ms. Feldman said. "Just because kids are poor, and maybe come from uneducated parents, and live in an urban setting, doesn't mean they shouldn't have teachers who are paid as well, and whose lives are as comfortable professionally, as teachers from the richest suburbs. It is so emotionally and intellectually exhausting teaching in the classrooms of New York City. You have to be mother and father and social worker and psychologist and baby sitter."
Ms. Feldman says passionately that a child can get "the best education in the country" at some New York City public schools, and that if she had children she would never consider private school.
"I mean, I would want my child to grow up to be something like me," she said, laughing. "They'd have to go to public school. They wouldn't get to be me in private school."

HEADLINE: New Toll Road Offers Glimpse at Future

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: STERLING, Va., Sept. 28

 BODY:
After a gala celebration on Friday, the first privately financed toll road built in this century will open on Saturday here in northern Virginia, offering commuters a speedier link between rural surburbs and Washington.
But the new highway, the 14.1-mile Dulles Greenway, is viewed as more than a quicker alternative to a stuttering trip through a dozen traffic lights along nearby state roads. It is, government officials and transportation experts say, a prime example of the way big public construction projects will be built in the future. 
 Those experts say that with fewer tax dollars available, with a reluctance by elected officials to impose new taxes and with increasing demands on existing structures, capital improvements and new projects may be possible only with at least some private financing.
"The continuum of traditional, purely public involvement, the way the Interstate highway system was built, has swung to the other end with the Dulles Greenway," said Stephen Martin, director of financial development for the United States Department of Transportation. "But there is a lot going on in between."
Indeed, as many as a dozen states are either considering or already building projects with significant private investment. One, expected to open later this year, is a 10-mile toll road built between existing lanes of Interstate 91 in Southern California, from the densely populated areas of Anaheim in Orange County eastward to Riverside County.
"The public sector is just tapped out," said Gerald Pfeffer, senior vice president of United Infrastructure, the Chicago company building the California project. "Increasingly, public facilities that deliver a service, even arenas, are going to be built through public-private partnerships."
Charles E. Williams, the chief operating officer of the Dulles Greenway and a former general in the Army Corps of Engineers, said representatives of at least six states and a dozen countries had visited him to learn the advantages of private financing.. Those benefits, he said, include fewer bureaucratic hurdles, simpler financing schemes and smaller administrative staffs.
Mr. Williams also said the project had won the support of local environmental groups. Two of the largest environmental problems were solved by a one-for-one tree replacement program and by creating 150 acres of wetlands elsewhere to replace the 64 acres of federally protected wetlands needed for the project.
Indeed, since Virginia enacted legislation in 1988 allowing a private company to build the road, only a few voices have been raised in protest here in Loudoun County.
"It's a win-win situation," Mr. Williams said, referring to benefits for both motorists and the state, which will inherit ownership of the road in 42 1/2 years.
The new road offers motorists the ease of nonstop toll collection through an electronic system that deducts the amount from a driver's account -- up to $1.75 per trip for now, $2 after Jan. 1.
"It's a great benefit to us out here," said Christine Wilde, a worker at a day care center in nearby Leesburg, echoing the prevailing view. "Most people I've talked to are pretty pleased. It's going to reduce a lot of the headaches of traffic and open up a lot of retail opportunities."
Private toll roads are hardly new to the American landscape. The first, opened in 1794, was in Pennsylvania, a 62-mile link between Philadelphia and Lancaster that was financed in part by the sale of stock. As the country grew, so did enthusiasm for more private roads.
But as the railroads expanded, offering travelers a faster route to distant points, private roads began going out of business, and they had virtually passed into obsolescence by the early years of this century. When the popularity of automobiles led to a new wave of toll-road construction in the 1940's, the roads were built by state authorities with public money.
Interest in rapid automotive links between Washington and distant suburbs began in the early 1980's, when construction started on a Virginia toll road in Fairfax County. That road connected Dulles International Airport with highways leading downtown, and high-technology companies began putting new offices along it.
Officials in Loudoun County, which had grown steadily as a bedroom community, were eager for the kind of economic development that Fairfax enjoyed.
So in 1993 the state granted a group of investors, the Toll Road Investors Partnership II, authority to build the private road for $326 million. Construction was completed this month, six months ahead of schedule.

HEADLINE: With Congress Slowed to a Crawl, G.O.P. Pushes Stopgap Spending

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Conceding that the last four weeks have reflected a slower legislative pace than the hectic early days of the 104th Congress, Republicans hurried today to push stopgap spending into place so the lawmakers could leave for a 10-day recess.
The House passed the temporary spending bill without even a roll-call vote this morning. There was no visible opposition anticipated in the Senate. But the Senate leaders kept the bill on the shelf, waiting for a Friday vote. They wanted to keep the senators in Washington to work on other legislation. 
 The temporary measure will cut the Government's spending significantly below this year's level. But it would also keep programs that Republicans want to kill from being shut down, at least for the first six weeks of the fiscal year that begins on Sunday.
Republicans acknowledged the diminished rate of lawmaking in the four weeks since Congress returned from its August break. Representative Robert L. Livingston, the Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said he had known all along that the early focus on the Contract With America carried with it a "built-in delay of four to five weeks" that was now being felt.
"We have talked a better game of dramatically changing the American Government than we have practiced," said Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican seeking his party's Presidential nomination.
The most visible delay is that only two of the 13 basic spending bills that pay for everything from space shuttle fuel to combat boots and salaries for press spokesmen have been sent to President Clinton to sign or veto. And one of them, which finances Congress itself, was ready in August but was held back to deny the President a chance for a showy veto. Last year, when action was unusually fast, all 13 bills had reached his desk before the fiscal year began.
Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, said Congress was still working hard but its work was just "less visible." There was some delay, he acknowledged, but he said that was because the new Congress was cutting spending, and "the toughest thing to do in Washington is to cut spending."
Some of the legislation is tied up less by disputes over money than by arguments over Republican attempts to use spending bills to make policy, such as trying to bar recipients of Federal grants from lobbying Congress. Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, said that tendency was the real cause of delay.
"Very little has been done, and I think in part it is because the extreme right has dominated the agenda in the Republican caucus," Senator Daschle said. "Progress has almost been at a standstill on a number of pieces of legislation because of the pressure put on the Republican caucus by the extreme right wing."
The recess, expected to begin on Friday and last until Oct. 10, is occasioned by the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, and extends through Columbus Day. But even without these days, Congress needed time off so that the Congressional Budget Office could have a little time to analyze the pieces of the massive budget reconciliation bill that will cut such programs as Medicare, Medicaid and student loans.
On the biggest of those issues, Medicare, both houses of Congress are well behind schedule. The Senate Finance Committee has more than 100 amendments before it, and the House Ways and Means Committee does not yet even have a printed bill to consider. The Finance Committee may finish this week, but the Ways and Means Committee will not even begin voting before Oct. 10. The first deadline for both committees was last Friday, and then this Friday.
The most serious deadlock is over the measure that provides for the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services. A dispute over a provision designed to undo Mr. Clinton's order prohibiting the Federal Government from doing business with companies that use permanent replacements for strikers prevented the Senate from debating it today.
This bill is the biggest of all the domestic spending bills, with $62.8 billion in the Senate version and $61 billion in the bill the House passed last month.
But there is a dispute of almost equal passion surrounding efforts by Representative Ernest J. Istook Jr., Republican of Oklahoma, to bar lobbying by recipients of government grants. That provision has tied up the $23.2 billion bill financing the Treasury Department, the Postal Service and various other agencies, including the White House. Some Senate Republican conferees have joined Democrats in opposing this effort as unconstitutional.
Other bills are in various stages of consideration. Some have yet to go into House-Senate conferences, including the bills covering energy and water development and the one for the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and other agencies.
Three bills are nearly ready; they pay for the Department of Defense, the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture, and have been approved by House-Senate conferences but have not been voted on in either house.
A continuing air of unreality hung over much of the debate today. Senator Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican who heads the subcommittee that deals with Labor and Health and Human Services spending, acknowledged that even if the bill was passed by the Senate, agreed on in conference and then passed again by both houses, it would face a certain veto. "This is all Confederate money," he said.
But if the Senate was relaxed, the House was caustic. Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said that passing only 2 of 13 spending bills was equivalent to batting .154. "A .154 batting average for the champs is pretty weak," he said. "But if they could reduce the deficit to be as low as their batting average, they could really claim victory."
His ridicule was mild in comparison to the anger of Representative Randy (Duke) Cunningham, Republican of California. In a meeting of the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities dealing with cuts in student loans, Mr. Cunningham said his party was really fighting "the Socialist tendencies of the Democrats, including "Communist supporters" like Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich.
"He goes along with Karl Marx in many of his writings," Mr. Cunningham said of Secretary Reich.
"There you have it!" yelled Representative Pat Williams, Democrat of Montana. "If you think the far right is now running this joint, there you have it!"
After Mr. Williams was gaveled into silence by Representative Bill Goodling, the Pennsylvania Republican who is chairman of the committee, the panel voted to eliminate the program of direct Federal student loans that was adopted two years ago.
Then it voted to charge higher fees to the banks and other lenders who will profit from the elimination of their competition. It also voted to eliminate the six-month interest-free grace period that loan recipients now have after finishing college.
 
PRIMER
The Budget: What Remains
 
APPROPRIATIONS
 
There are thirteen individual spending bills setting the amount of money agencies and programs will get for the coming fiscal year.
 
Individual houses: Senate and House (13 versions in each)
House-Senate Conference: Must make versions agree.
President: Many bills face vetoes. Absent compromise, Federal offices could run out of money in six weeks.
 
Where it stands today: The House has passed 12 of 13 bills; the Senate has approved 11. Final versions of two bills have been sent to the President, who has yet to sign ot veto them. Congress may pass two more final versions on Friday.
 
TAXES AND ENTITLEMENTS
 
Individual houses: Welfare, Tax rates and Medicare and Medicaid
House-Senate Conference: Republicans in both houses will struggle to enact curbs on health and welfare beneifts, along with deep tax cuts. If they succeed, a veto seems certain.
President: A veto would maintain current benefit levels until the two sides reach a compromise. But Republicans could force the issue by attaching their proposals to vital legislation that allows the Government to borrow more money.
 
Where it stands today: The House has approved major tax cuts and sweeping changes in welfare and Medicaid. The Senate is working on similar curbs on Medicaid but has passed only modest changes on welfare. It is working on a tax cut. Neither has enacted promised curbs on Medicare.

HEADLINE: Commerce Official to Head Yale Management School

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
Jeffrey E. Garten, the Under Secretary of Commerce for international trade and one of the chief architects of the Clinton Administration's strategy on emerging markets, said yesterday that he was resigning to become dean of Yale University's School of Management.
In two years in his post, Mr. Garten spearheaded the Administration's effort to use the country's political power to support American efforts to win contracts and business opportunities abroad. 
 Down the hall from his office, the Commerce Department built what came to be known as "the war room," where more than 150 major contracts around the world are tracked daily. From that room, Mr. Garten and other Commerce officials called on American officials from President Clinton to ambassadors to promote the business interests of the United States, much the way Japanese and German officials have done for their nations.
The agency that Mr. Garten directed, the International Trade Administration, has been at the center of the debate over the role of commercial considerations in foreign policy -- and he is leaving before that argument is over.
It is unclear whether he will be replaced: The Republican-dominated Congress is considering several plans to break up the Commerce Department, and some would relegate the department's trade operations to a proposed United States Trade Administration.
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown has fought those efforts but Mr. Garten's departure removes the leader of one of the department's most successful operations.
"What I hope we began is a shifting in weight of our commercial interests to the center of our national interests abroad," Mr. Garten said yesterday.
"We have weighed in -- not always successfully -- arguing for more and more consideration of commercial considerations in the development of our foreign policy. But it will be a number of years before the balance is right."
Achieving that balance has often put the Commerce Department at odds with other Government agencies, particularly when trade disputes affected broader military and political relationships with allies.
Mr. Garten was active in negotiations with Japan and was one of the two lead negotiators in the automobile dispute that ended in an accord in Geneva in June.
But Mr. Garten concentrated on encouraging both Washington and American business executives to switch their focus from traditional markets to faster-growing economies like China, India, Brazil and the countries that make up the Association of South East Asian Nations.
Mr. Garten said in a telephone interview that he was leaving primarily to be closer to his wife, Ida, who runs the Barefoot Contessa, a gourmet food store and caterer in East Hampton, L.I. But he also said that the chance to direct the Yale School of Management was "a very rare opportunity." The school, since its founding, has had trouble balancing its dual objectives of turning out managers for both the public and private sector.
"Jeffrey Garten brings outstanding ideas and achievements, an exceptional breadth of top-level experience in both business and government, and a global perspective to the leadership of Yale's School of Management," Richard C. Levin, the president of Yale, said yesterday. "He personifies the school's management ideal."
Before joining the Administration, Mr. Garten was an investment banker at both Shearson Lehman Brothers and at the Blackstone Group. He worked for Henry A. Kissinger in the Nixon Administration and is the author of "A Cold Peace: America, Japan, Germany and the Struggle for Supremacy." He is a graduate of Dartmouth College and holds a Ph.D. from the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.
Mr. Garten said that he hoped to turn Yale's management school into an equivalent of Yale's law school, "a small place that produces leaders with a sense of business but also with a sense of society."

College tuition and fees have risen by about 6 percent in this school year, according to an annual survey released yesterday by the College Board. As a result, the annual cost at elite colleges and universities is approaching $30,000.
"When taken together with the expectation that Congress will reduce student grant and loan programs, many young people in our society face a deeply mortgaged future," said Donald M. Stewart, president of the College Board, a nonprofit association of 3,000 schools, colleges and universities. 
 Undergraduates must pay about 6 percent more this year than last for tuition and fees at four-year institutions, and 4 percent to 6 percent more at two-year institutions. The cost of room and board is also rising 2 percent to 4 percent, the survey says.
"Despite these increases, the fact remains that college is still affordable for most students," Mr. Stewart said. "Students and families must keep college costs in perspective and not focus on the relatively small number of high-priced institutions."
That view was seconded by Terry Hartle, a vice president of the American Council on Education, a research and lobbying association.
"I don't want to say that college costs aren't a tremendous strain for many people," Mr. Hartle said, "but we should remember that in 1993-94, 61 percent of all American college students spent less than $3,000 in tuition and fees. There are some tremendous bargains out there."
In fact, Mr. Hartle said, college costs have averaged two percentage points above inflation throughout this century. "It was an aberration when college costs were less than that rate during the 70's and when they were higher than that rate in the 80's. What we're seeing today is a growth rate that's back to normal."
Among the colleges that Mr. Hartle singled out as relative bargains is the University of Texas system, which enrolls 118,000 students and charges $1,623 for tuition and fees.
Another example, he said, is the State University of New York system, which enrolls 156,000 students in its four-year colleges. SUNY increased its tuition this year by $750, but an in-state student could still pay, on average, $3,900 for tuition and fees.
Among private institutions, he cited Rice University, where the full tuition is $17,013, but various discounts are offered; the average Rice student pays $9,855. In contrast, tuition and fees this year at Yale University can total nearly $28,000, without financial assistance.
Experts point to several reasons for the inexorable rise of college costs.
The first is what economists call the productivity problem. Although the salaries of professors and administrators continue to rise, the number of students does not.
Second, advanced laboratories and scholarly materials that many students need have become surprisingly costly. A subscription to Chemical Abstracts, for example, would cost a college $16,800 a year, and it is not uncommon for other journals to cost $3,000 annually.
Third, as state legislatures cut their budgets and devote more of their resources to building prisons and coping with the steady increase in the cost of programs like Medicaid, they reduce their contributions to higher education -- which mostly go to public institutions -- and pass an ever-larger share of college costs on to students and their families.
Finally, in pursuit of an increasingly diverse student body, colleges are devoting more resources to student aid based on need.

Market Rally Eases Gloom Of Mexicans

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Mexico's peso and stock market rebounded slightly today after a four-day slide, but investors remained worried, expecting low third-quarter company earnings and fearing social unrest.
The main stock index here closed at 2,381.49, up 38.43 points, or 1.64 percent. The peso held steady at 6.385 to the dollar, making one peso worth 15.66 cents. 
 In the four sessions before today, the market dropped 8.4 percent, its biggest decline since some of the dismal days of the Mexican economic crisis in February. Analysts said the dip was based on edginess, mainly among Mexican investors who worry that a recent spate of minor political events could signal an onset of turmoil.
Fidel Velazquez, the powerful 95-year-old leader of the principal labor federation, had indicated on Sunday that he might break with the terms of an anti-inflation pact arranged by the Government and seek substantial wage increases. At the National Autonomous University, Mexico's largest, several hundred students have occupied the rector's office since last Friday to demand an increase in admissions.
A job fair by a private small-business association turned into a street melee on Tuesday between white-collar job seekers and the police when only a handful of companies showed up to offer employment to more than 60,000 applicants.
The same day, a rise in interest rates on bellwether short-term Treasury bonds raised fear that economic recovery would take longer than the Government has predicted. President Ernesto Zedillo had said that the economy might stop shrinking before the end of this year.
"There's a feeling that something is bound to happen," said Jaime Campbell, a broker for CBI Securities in Mexico City. "We're going through turbulence, but I don't think we have a change of course."
Analysts said the peso had weakened in part because companies with foreign debts were buying dollars to make quarterly interest payments and avoid foreign-exchange losses. Third-quarter earnings are expected to show dismal results for most companies except export producers.
Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz said today that Mexico was suffering an "outbreak of nervousness and market volatility," which he hoped would be brief.
The market rally came after officials said that when President Zedillo meets with President Clinton in Washington on Oct. 11, he will confirm that Mexico would repay a $12.5 billion American loan on schedule. Mexico is considering making its first payment on the financial-aid package by returning some unused reserve funds in coming weeks. But no decisions have been made, Government officials said.
The Clinton Administration provided the loans to shore up the Mexican economy after a botched December 1994 peso devaluation unleashed crippling recession in this country. The Zedillo Government in time adopted a tough fiscal package to replenish foreign reserves and limit inflation. Until now, there has been surprisingly little popular unrest despite widespread unemployment and other hardship.

HEADLINE: Buenos Aires Journal;
Will Tofu Replace the T-Bone as a National Dish?

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Sept. 28

 BODY:
It is lunchtime at the downtown Yin Yang restaurant, and the owner, Perla Palacci de Jacobowitz, is carrying trays of microbiotic salads with tofu, vegetable-stuffed empanadas and fruit-sweetened breads to the tables of dozens of hungry customers.
"Opening a natural foods restaurant in a country of meat-eaters did not seem like the wisest thing to do, but it will pay off," Mrs. Palacci said. "People are more health-conscious these days, so there are more people coming in the doors." 
 Across town at Parrilla Parana, a traditional outdoor barbecue, the pungent smoke of roasting beef billows from open grills, eliciting smiles from passersby. But the restaurant's tables and counter stools remain empty, waiting for the throng of patrons who once occupied them.
On Corrientes Avenue, a main thoroughfare, construction crews can be seen eating sandwiches and salads, when several years ago the typical laborer's lunch was beef cooked on a makeshift grill.
Could this be the same land where people once considered it almost a national duty to eat a thick steak, grilled sweetbreads and spicy sausages at least once a day?
Argentina, known the world over for its beef, is eating less red meat these days and more poultry, pasta, and salads.
Concerned about their health and beset by a stubborn recession and record unemployment, Argentines are exercising more and eating lighter and cheaper. For the first time in recent memory the price of chicken, driven by cheap imports, has dropped below the price of beef in Argentina: a two-pound broiler costs about $2, or 30 percent less than two pounds of beef.
To meet the new demand, a growing number of inexpensive vegetarian restaurants, natural food markets and salad bars have opened. As Argentines try new foods, the national palate, traditionally very bland, is expanding, and ethnic restaurants are opening in large numbers for the first time in Buenos Aires, which now has Chinese, Thai, Japanese, Indian and African eateries.
To be sure, vegetarians are still considered odd in Argentina. "It's difficult to live here as a vegetarian," said Carlos Figoli, a 40-year-old cab driver, who parked to eat his meatless pasta lunch. "Most of my friends look at me funny and think I'm crazy. They always question why I don't eat meat in Argentina, the country with the best meat in the world."
Argentines still eat more beef than people in any other country, and most families continue to have a weekend asado, a mixture of beef cuts and innards grilled over charcoal. But they are eating beef less often than they used to.
According to statistics released by the Ministry of Agriculture, beef consumption in Argentina fell 12.3 percent to 140 pounds a person in 1994 from 157 pounds a person in 1990.
By comparison, beef consumption in the United States was 67.5 pounds per person in 1994, virtually unchanged from 67.8 pounds in 1990, according to United States Department of Agriculture statistics.
Felipe Sola, Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fishing, said that while beef remains a source of national pride in Argentina, the country's eating habits are changing.
"We held out for a long time," Mr. Sola said. "But as a nation we have become more concerned about our health and that has meant rethinking our diet."
Mr. Sola said that he believes the slump in the economy has also played a role in Argentina's declining beef consumption. Hit hard by a sudden recession last December and a record 18.6 percent unemployment, Argentines have less money to spend eating in steak houses, a favorite pastime.
Of course, Argentina is not allowing beef -- a $4 billion industry as well as an important national symbol -- to fade away silently. President Carlos Saul Menem recently urged Argentines to eat even more red meat, vowing, "the green fad is on the way out." And the Rural Society of Argentina has promised an advertising campaign to promote the "unique" virtues of Argentine beef.
Luciano Miguens, vice president of the Rural Society of Argentina, said that Argentine beef is leaner and lower in cholesterol because it comes from cattle that are grass fed. Grain forms a large part of the diet of most beef cattle in the United States and Europe.
Mr. Miguens said that beef producers had not been hurt by the decline in local consumption because they are selling more beef abroad, especially now that Argentina has undertaken a vaccination program to eliminate hoof-and-mouth disease.
Meanwhile, Sara Hueyo, a 69-year-old anthropologist, who says she eats meat maybe once a month, lamented the decline of the wonderful smells of grilling steak that used to permeate the streets of Buenos Aires coming from the entrances to construction sites.
"It would catch you mid-step, and you would say, 'How delicious, that smell,' " she said. "I guess this is a sign that Argentina is changing."

HEADLINE: Rockefeller Center Trust Gets New Plan

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
Gotham Partners L.P., an investment firm that holds a 5.6 percent stake in Rockefeller Center Properties Inc., proposed a plan yesterday to recapitalize the real estate investment trust as it prepares to take ownership of Rockefeller Center.
Gotham's proposal, which has the support of several of the trust's other large shareholders, would use a rights offering to raise at least $105 million and combine that with a senior loan of at least $350 million to replace some of the trust's high-cost debt and give it the financial wherewithal to operate the property. 
 The Gotham proposal is competing with a deal the REIT has already signed with an investor group led by Sam Zell, the Chicago financier, which includes the General Electric Company and the Walt Disney Company. Under that deal, the Zell group would pay $5.50 a share, or $250 million, for a 50 percent stake in a company that would own Rockefeller Center jointly with the REIT's existing shareholders.
The Leucadia National Corporation, an insurance and real estate company that owns more than 7 percent of the REIT's shares; Goodman & Company, a Canadian investment manager that owns a 5 percent stake, and O Hill Partners, a real estate firm that holds 2 percent of the REIT's stock and owns $50 million of its bonds, all support a rights offering. Such an offering essentially gives shareholders an option to buy additional shares at a discount.
"We believe this proposal is the most equitable and least expensive way to recapitalize the REIT," said William A. Ackman, a principal of Gotham, which manages money for, among others, the Ziff family, which has dismantled its publishing empire. "It raises the money the REIT needs without diluting its existing shareholders, many of whom have already seen the value of their investments fall."
Joseph S. Steinberg, president of Leucadia, said, "It's a very constructive proposal."
The REIT's shares rose 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $7.50 before the deal was announced.
Several large shareholders, including Gotham, have vowed to vote down the Zell deal because it would dilute the existing shareholders' stake in the company by 50 percent. They also say that in exchange for G.E.'s participation, the REIT would have to grant NBC a sharp reduction in its rent, and therefore the REIT's income would fall. The television network is owned by G.E. and is the center's largest tenant.
These shareholders have repeatedly suggested that before allowing outsiders like Mr. Zell and his investors to buy into the REIT at a discount to the stock's market price, the REIT should allow its shareholders to find a way to raise money. "I welcome this proposal because I have believed all along that the shareholders should have first crack at investing on very favorable terms," said Tom Tisch, whose family owns a stake in the REIT.
A spokesman for the Zell group declined to comment, saying the group had not had time to review the proposal.
Stephanie Leggett-Young, a spokeswoman for the REIT, said the board would consider Gotham's proposal "in due course."
The REIT is preparing a joint plan of reorganization with the owners of Rockefeller Center, the Mitsubishi Estate Company and the Rockefeller family trusts, that will bring Rockefeller Center out of bankruptcy protection by handing over ownership to the REIT, which holds the $1.3 billion mortgage on the property. The plan is scheduled to be presented in bankruptcy court on Tuesday.
In the rights offering that Gotham has proposed, shareholders would receive rights on a pro rata basis to buy additional shares in the REIT at $5.50 a share, for a total of $105 million. If they chose not to exercise those rights, they could sell them in the open market.
Arnold Kastenbaum, an analyst who follows the REIT at M. J. Whitman Inc., valued the deal at $8 to $9 a share. He estimated that the rights would immediately be worth 80 cents a share in the open market.
The REIT, with Gotham's assistance, would obtain at least $350 million more from a lender like a bank or insurance company, which would be used to repay $116 million it owes to the Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company, an affiliate of Goldman, Sachs & Company, and buy back $213 million of convertible bonds.
The proposal asks for two concessions from Goldman, which previously made a bid for control of the REIT that the board rejected. Gotham wants Goldman's Whitehall Street Real Estate L.P. to exercise warrants and rights that entitle it to buy a 19.9 percent stake in the REIT at $5 a share, which would raise an additional $47.5 million.
Whitehall would then be able to participate on a pro rata basis in the rights offering.
And Gotham wants to subordinate a $75 million loan that the REIT took from Whitehall last year to the new $350 million loan it plans. As part of its own bid for control of the REIT, Whitehall suggested that it would be willing to subordinate that loan, which carries an expensive 14 percent interest rate.
If it agreed to subordinate its loan, Whitehall would stand in line to be repaid after the new lender and the holders of the REIT's zero-coupon bonds.
A person involved in the Zell deal raised several questions about Gotham's proposal. He said that leaving the $75 million loan in place would raise the price of the new financing the REIT would seek under the Gotham proposal. He also questioned whether the rights offering would raise enough money for the REIT. And he noted that his group had previously tried to work out a subordination agreement with Goldman.
"We spent three weeks talking about it, and ultimately their definition of subordination would have left the REIT with an economically inferior deal," the person said. "Ackman is falling victim to the same thing."
But in its letter to the REIT's board yesterday, Gotham, which is represented by Leonard Rosen, a lawyer at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, hinted that it could get around Goldman if need be. "We would welcome the participation of Whitehall and Goldman, Sachs & Company in our transaction on the terms described above," the letter said. "However, if Goldman's consent it not obtained, we believe an alternative structure exists" that would "enable the transaction to be consummated without the consent of Goldman and without breaching their contractual arrangements."
A spokesman for Goldman and Whitehall declined comment.
Gotham may be contemplating a strategy -- similar to one the Zell group has planned to use -- for reducing Goldman's influence in the situation, obtained as part of the terms of its loans. Both Gotham and the Zell group contend that although Whitehall's loan says it cannot be prepaid before 2000, a provision in the loan requiring the REIT to hand over to Whitehall all cash it does not need for operations creates a loophole that would permit prepayment.
Once that loan is prepaid, its prohibition against the REIT's merging into a new company, which is part of Gotham's proposal, would no longer be in force.
But Goldman contends that there is no loophole. It has hired Arthur L. Liman, the noted defense lawyer and a partner in Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, to represent it should anyone challenge its rights under the loan agreement.

HEADLINE: Could This Be You?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
In the business of selling life insurance, death is making a comeback.
Since the 1980's, when talk about mortality was supplanted by charts showing high interest rates, insurers have focused their sales pitches on the value of policies as an investment that can grow without being taxed. 
 But as they packaged policies primarily as investments, some insurers fell into bad sales habits, including overstating returns, that eventually led to a deluge of customer complaints and lawsuits and a falloff in sales. Now, agents and some large insurers have joined to spend millions on an advertising campaign to repair their image. The linchpin is a return to the simple, old-fashioned way of selling insurance: pushing the death benefit.
The advertisements, to appear in newspapers and on radio and perhaps on television, range from a stark warning -- "It's 1998. You're Dead" -- to more gentle reminders of mortality, including "Before you see the light . . . see the light."
Other proposed ads are aimed at women, a market that many insurance executives say they have not served as well as they should. One ad, picturing five women at various stages of life, will advise: "All the women who won't outlive their husbands don't need to read any further."
But with the campaign not even begun -- there was a test run two weeks ago but there is no formal start-up date -- the grumbling can already be heard.
Some insurance executives see the program as only an exercise to make the industry feel good about itself. They say the campaign does nothing to address the key problem, which is an outmoded product.
And others say the campaign is at odds with demographic trends. People are living longer, they say, and consumers' concerns have shifted from death at a young age to death at such an old age that savings might be exhausted. Thus sales of annuities, which promise a stream of future payments as long as you live, are growing rapidly while sales of new life policies with an investment feature are stagnant.
"The objective is good, but the industry is still trying to make an old product look more attractive than it really is," said Robert W. MacDonald, chief executive at Life USA, a Minneapolis-based insurer specializing in annuities. The campaign is relying on some old industry favorites -- guilt and fear -- to spur sales, he added.
But the campaign's backers say they are on the right track.
"The death benefit is what makes life insurance unique," said David Woods, an agent in Springfield, Mass., for the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company and the president of the agents' group that organized the new campaign. Insurers paid about $30 billion in death benefits last year.
That focus got lost in the go-go 1980's, he said, when the sales gurus of the industry decided that most people were put off by talk about their own deaths -- and were more likely to buy life insurance if it was described as a way to accumulate money for their continued life in retirement.
"We can all blame ourselves for kicking away our birthright," said Mr. Woods, who recalls that as a new agent, 30 years ago, "part of our training was to hand-deliver death benefit checks to widows." It was, he says, "a way for agents to learn an appreciation of the best that life insurance can do."
Last year, to remind consumers about the death benefit -- and the usefulness of life insurance agents in financial planning -- Mr. Woods and other agents created the Life and Health Insurance Foundation for Education, with the convenient acronym of LIFE.
The group received $1.5 million of seed money from organizations representing 165,000 agents, including the Million Dollar Round Table, an organization for the most successful agents. It then turned to a New York public relations firm, Robinson Lake Sawyer Miller. With a combination of advertising, seminars and training materials for agents, executives at Robinson Lake hope to "move the needle" on public opinion of life insurance, in much the same way that they succeeded with earlier efforts to promote milk and pork.
"We are running this along the lines of a political-style campaign," said Carter A. Eskew, head of Bozell/Eskew, the advertising arm of Robinson Lake.
The strongest financial support for the campaign, which has raised $14 million so far, comes from companies that have suffered steep declines in sales recently, and have faced the most complaints from regulators and customers:
*The Prudential Insurance Company, whose $2 million contribution was the first by an insurer and was a catalyst for others. Prudential's sales practices are being investigated by regulators from 27 states. The company also faces many lawsuits by customers.
*The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, which was fined $20 million last year by a different multistate task force and spent over $80 million more in payments to customers and legal fees. It has contributed $1 million to the campaign.
*New York Life, which earlier this year agreed to settle class-action suits by offering added benefits to three million clients who bought policies from 1982 to 1994, costing the company $65 million. It has given $1 million to the campaign.
Other contributors, like Guardian in New York, Northwestern Mutual in Milwaukee and Principal Financial in Des Moines, avoided the worst sales mistakes but recognize that they, too, are being harmed by the industry's image.
"The industry has definitely suffered from the public's negative feelings," said Ted Athanassiades, the second-ranking executive at Met Life. "This idea came from the agents themselves, and it was important to us to support their effort."
Agents have become increasingly restless lately as their incomes have fallen. At Met Life, for example, the number of agents has dropped to about 8,700 from 14,000 several years ago, while Prudential is down to 14,000, from 20,000.
In the best of times, selling insurance is a tough business, with fewer than one of every five agents still active after four years. Now that commissions on new sales have also dropped, companies have become worried about losing their most experienced agents, either to another insurer or another line of work.
Agents attending a conference in Minneapolis two weeks ago got a taste of the campaign when the first full-page ads appeared in a local newspaper. "You could almost hear the sigh of relief," Mr. Woods said.
For more than 20 years, he said, the industry spent millions annually on trade groups that would lobby in the political arena, "but we did not have any group whose only objective was to educate the public about the value of life insurance."
Barry M. Roth, head of Roth Associates, a New York sales agency that represents Equitable Life Assurance, said he favored any effort to "improve the public's perception of the average agent." But, he added, he is unsure how much can be gained by emphasizing the death benefit and de-emphasizing policies' investment component.
"Life insurance does not sell as easily these days when all you are selling is the death benefit," he said, adding that "life insurance as a long-term investment plan is still a great product."
Mr. Woods and others handling the program say that in stressing death benefits, the campaign will not favor one product or company over others.
Despite that goal of neutrality, the campaign's emphasis on the death benefit as a key element in a financial plan could turn up the heat on a long-simmering industry dispute -- whether a client is better off buying low-cost term insurance than whole-life or some other investment-related policy. Term policies, now a fast-growing type of life insurance, have no investment component.
Consumers who are convinced by the ads that the death benefit is important will find that term insurance is the cheapest way to go, assuming their insurance needs decline in their later years, when the cost of a term policy rises sharply.
Unfortunately for agents, the low premiums on term insurance produce commissions that are only a small fraction of those earned on policies with an investment feature. That financial incentive, many say, is the root cause of many of the improper sales practices that have hurt the industry in recent years.
Traditional life insurance, with or withoutinvestment features, "was a great product for the past 100 years, when the greatest fear was of dying young," said Mr. MacDonald of Life USA. Now that people are living longer, though, there are more two-income families and there is a sharper awareness of investment choices, he said. That has led to a greater need to develop products promising more income during retirement.
"Most of the old companies are slow to do that," he added, "for fear that their customers will want to replace their existing products with something new."

HEADLINE: MIDEAST ACCORD;
From Clinton, Arafat and Rabin: Hope, Dreams and Now Peace

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks by President Bill Clinton; Yasir Arafat, Chairman of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel at the signing of the peace accord at the White House, as transcribed by The Associated Press:
 
PRESIDENT CLINTON
The agreement that now will be signed means that Israel's mothers and fathers need no longer worry that their sons will face the dangers of patrolling Nablus or confronting the hostile streets of Ramallah. And it means that Palestinians will be able to decide for themselves what their schools teach, how their houses should be built, and who they will choose to govern. . . . . 
 Mr. Prime Minister and Mr. Chairman, you are showing that it is not by weapons but by will and by word that dreams best become reality. Your achievement shines as an inspiration to others all around this world who seek to overcome their own conflicts and to secure for themselves the blessings of peace.
Chapter by chapter Jews and Arabs are writing a new history for their ancient lands. Camp David, the declaration of principles signed here two years ago, the peace last year between Jordan and Israel: with each of these the truth of this book has become clear to the world as courageous leaders step beyond the bounds of convention.
They build for their peoples a new world of hope and peace. Now, as this new chapter begins, it is fitting that we are joined by so many from the camp of peace.
 
YASIR ARAFAT
We are gathered today under the sponsorship of President Clinton, who has generously offered to host the signing of this agreement.
It has been two years since we met at the White House to sign the Declaration of Principles, to which we and our Israeli partners have agreed to in Oslo. We meet again today to make new headway in giving hope to this historic process, the process of realizing a credible peace, reconciliation, and coexistence between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples, and the peace of the brave, which we achieved on Egyptian land at Taba, under President Mubarak's auspices.
A significant portion of Palestinian national rights reverts today to the Palestinian people through their control of the cities, villages, and populated areas. Recovery of this portion is a step in the implementation of the interim agreement, which we are gathered here to witness its signing.
There is also a step which paves the way to free and democratic Palestinian elections, capping thereby the political components required for the establishment of an independent Palestinian national entity on the Palestinian territories. . . .
The permanent status negotiations will deal with such issues as settlements, the delineation of the borders, the rights of Palestinian refugees as determined by the international legitimacy, and the fundamental issue concerning the status of Jerusalem, which our people, irrespective of their faith -- Moslems, Christians or Jews -- consider Jerusalem to be the heart and soul of their entity and the center of their cultural, spiritual and economic life.
I would say that the sanctity of Jerusalem for us all dictates that we make it the joint cornerstone and the capital of peace between the Palestinian and the Israeli peoples inasmuch as it is a beacon for believers all over the world.
We urge you all to recognize the importance of this historic interim step that demonstrates the irreversibility of the peace process. Its distinct significance lies in the verdict passed by history, the international community, and human civilization at the turn of the century; that a just and comprehensive peace be established on this sacred land whereby the Israeli and Palestinian peoples would coexist on the basis of mutual recognition of the rights, while enjoying equality and self-determination without occupation or repeated wars, and without terrorism.
At this point, I must tell our Israeli partners, from this solemn rostrum, and in the presence of our brethren and friends who have come here from the region and from all of the world, particularly those who contributed to the realization of this agreement, that our past experience underscores the need to be more credible and committed to our steps in the future.
And the commitment should be precise, honest, and mutual.
For our part, we will honor our commitments. That's why the continuation and expansion of the settlement drive, as the situation in the city of Hebron and elsewhere shows, lead to the persistence of tensions. Likewise, continued qualms about a new independent Palestinian birth convey to each and every Palestinian the feeling that his or her life shall remain in jeopardy.
Today, standing before you, I tell you with courage and a sense of responsibility that our participation in the great peace process means that we are betting everything on the future.
Therefore we must condemn and foreswear violence totally, not only because the use of violence is morally reprehensible, but because it undermines Palestinian aspirations to the realization of peace, the exercise of our political and national options, and the achievement of economic and cultural progress in Palestine and in the region.
From this day on we do not want to see any waste of or threat to any innocent Palestinian life or any innocent Israeli life. Enough killing and enough killing of innocent people. . . .
For us to succeed on both fronts, we are bound to base the emerging Palestinian political system on the principles of liberty, democracy, separation of powers, freedom of expression, and national initiative. We are also bound to continue building Palestinian institutions and the Palestinian national economy.
But this enterprise is still in its early stages and our institutions have yet to mature. The road ahead remains long, indeed. We look forward to your continued support of our people, and we thank all friendly and brotherly donors for their assistance.
 
YITZHAK RABIN
The sight you see -- you see before you at this moment was impossible, was unthinkable just two years ago. Only poets dreamt of it. And to our great pain, soldier and civilians went to their death to make this moment possible. Here we stand before you, men who fate and history have sent on a mission of peace to end once and for all 100 years of bloodshed.
Our dream is also your dream, King Hussein, President Mubarak, Chairman Arafat, all the others, and above, assisting us, President Bill Clinton, a president who is working in the service of peace. We all love the same children, weep the same tears, hate the same enmity, and pray for reconciliation. Peace has no borders.
Yes, I know; our speeches are already repeating themselves. Perhaps this picture has already become routine. The handshakes no longer set your pulse racing. Your loving hearts no longer pound with emotion as they did then. . . .
We have matured in the two years since we first shook hands here. The handshake: that was the sign and symbol of the start of reconciliation. Today we are more sober. We are gladdened by the potential for reconciliation, but we are also wary of the dangers that lurk on every side.
The enemies of yesterday share a common enemy of today and in the future: the terrorism that sows death in our homes and on the busses that ply the streets. The sounds of celebration here cannot drown out the cries of innocent citizens who traveled those buses to their death.
And new eyes shining here cannot erase for a single moment of the sight of the lifeless eyes of the students who were going to their classes and housewives who were on their way to market when hatred struck them down. We are pained by their death and remember them with love.
I want to say to you, Chairman Arafat, the leader of the Palestinians, together we should not let the land that flows with milk and honey become a land flowing with blood and tears. Don't let it happen. If all the partners to the peace making do not unite against the evil angels of death by terrorism, all that will remain of this ceremony are color snapshots, empty momentos.
Rivers of hatred will overflow again and swamp the Middle East.
We, gentlemen, will not permit terrorism to defeat peace. We will not allow it. If we don't have partners in this bitter, difficult war we will fight it alone. We know how to fight, and we know how to win.
My brother Jews speak through the media to you. Thousands of years of exile and the dream of generations have returned us to our historic home in the land of Israel, the land of the prophets. Etched on every vineyard, every field, every olive tree, every flower is the deep imprint of the Jewish history, of the Book of the Books that we have bequeathed to the entire world, of the values of morality and of justice. Every place in the land of the prophets, every name is an integral part of our heritage, of thousands of years, neighbor.
Ladies and gentlemen, this week the Jewish people in its thousands of places of dispersion has marked a new year, and in their Holy Day prayers, Jews everywhere are saying -- May we -- I'm translating it to the best of my capability.
May we be remembered and inscribed before you in the Book of Life and of blessing and peace and prosperity, of deliverance and comfort and opportunity, we and all who people the House of Israel, for a good life and peace. These are my wishes to all the Jewish people. These are my wishes to all the citizens of Israel: a good life and a peace. These are also our wishes to our neighbors, to all the world peoples: a good life and peace.
Ladies and gentlemen, look at us again. Look at the scene on the stage, here in the White House. You are not excited anymore. You have grown up accustomed to it. But in order for peace to be completed, in order for this picture to be completed and for the Middle East to become a jewel in the world crown, it still lacks two people -- the president of Syria and the president of Lebanon. I call upon them to come and join us, to come to the platform of peace.

HEADLINE: Stocks Gain, With Dow Up by 25.29

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
The stock market leaped forward yesterday, as buyers returned in force after Wednesday's early selloff and late rebound.
"Institutions did some end-of-the-quarter portfolio adjusting, and there was some program trading at the close," said Robert Ritter, chief technical analyst of Ladenburg Thalmann & Company. "That led to gains almost across the board." 
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 25.29 points to close at 4,787.64, its high for the session. Among the broader indicators, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.83 points, to 585.87, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index soared 20.51 points, to 1,047.05.
After the Labor Department reported a sign of economic vigor in a larger-than-expected drop in the number of workers filing first-time jobless claims last week, the market opened on the upside, and it remained there for most of the day. The 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/32 and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, increased to 6.59 percent from 6.57 percent.
Advances far exceeded declines on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,467 issues rising and 806 falling. Big Board volume eased to 367.8 million shares, from 411.3 million shares on Wednesday.
Technology stocks were once more the day's standout, as bargain hunters continued to search for depressed values in issues that they believed to be oversold. Hewlett-Packard rose 2 7/8, to 85 5/8; Micron gained 4 1/8, to 82 5/8; Microsoft increased 2 7/8, to 91 1/2; Intel advanced 2 9/16, to 61 7/8, and Cisco Systems spurted 2 7/8, to 70 7/8. After a recommendation from Bear, Stearns, Compaq broke out of its recent trading range and its price at the bell was 49 5/8, up 3 1/8.
Insurance issues were up in the wake of an unconfirmed report from Sanford C. Bernstein & Company that Aetna Life and Casualty would spin off its troubled property and casualty unit. Aetna itself closed at a 52-week high of 74 3/8, up 2 3/8; Allstate closed at 35 5/8, up 1 3/8; American International Group closed at 86 1/2, up 2 1/8; Cigna closed at 105 7/8, up 6 1/8, and Chubb closed at 96 7/8, up 1 3/8. Caremark International Inc. agreed to acquire the Cigna Medical Group, which operates 29 clinics in Los Angeles, from Cigna Health Care of California, a managed health care subsidiary of Cigna.
The Dow Jones utilities average, which has been rising all week, increased 2.24 points, to 214.74. Consolidated Edison increased3/8, to 30 1/2; Delmarva rose 1/8, to 22 7/8; Detroit Edison advanced 5/8, to 32 1/4, and Duke Power spurted 1, to 43 3/4.
Defensive stocks retreated in keeping with yesterday's renewed optimism regarding economic growth. For example, major drug issues closing on the downside included Schering-Plough, off 5/8, to 51 7/8; Merck, off 1/2, to 56 3/8, and Bristol-Myers, off 7/8, to 72 3/8.
Similarly, food stocks also slipped. Campbell Soup closed at 50 5/8, down 1/2; General Mills wound up at 55 3/4, down 1; Kellogg finished at 72 3/8, down 5/8, and Sara Lee ended at 29 7/8, down 1/8.
Nashua dropped 2 3/8, to 15 1/4, after stating that it expects a third-quarter loss of $300,000 to $1 million. And the American depository receipts of Alcatel Alsthom declined 3 1/8, to 17 3/8, after the company announced a first-half loss.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off Again on Uncertainty Over European Monetary Union

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell further against most leading currencies yesterday as continued uncertainty about European monetary union strengthened the German mark and the Swiss franc.
The dollar was held to a small loss against the mark as traders awaited a weekend European summit meeting aimed at resolving doubts about the future of a single currency. 
 Japanese investors, meanwhile, faced a weekend of reconciling the quarter's books and had little reason to buy dollars, allowing the dollar to slip.
In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 99.22 Japanese yen, from 100.45 yen on Wednesday. It also fell to 1.4200 German marks from 1.4253 marks and to 1.1433 Swiss francs from 1.1530 Swiss francs. The British pound rose to $1.5792 from $1.5755.
In European and Asian trading, the dollar dropped against European currencies, but recovered toward the end of European trading and into the session in New York. Against the yen, it was a slow slide from the start of Asian trading.
"It was more of a day where the news was predominantly European and less focused on domestic issues in the United States," said Wayne Grigull, director of foreign exchange sales at Merrill Lynch & Company.
In Europe, investors moved to the mark from the Italian lira partly because of disappointment with Italy's budget, which fell short of requirements for a common European currency.
The Italian budget called for a deficit that amounted to 5.8 percent of the country's gross domestic product. The maximum deficit under rules for attaining monetary union by 1999 is 3 percent of G.D.P.
While some traders sold lire and bought marks, others moved into Swiss bonds and francs.
The attention to Italy's budget follows remarks last week by German monetary officials who said Italy and France were among the countries that might not meet the criteria for a single currency.
The remarks caused an uproar in currency markets and the dollar has seesawed since then as politicians have tried to right the foundering ship of monetary union.
The European finance ministers and central bankers meet this weekend to map out their plans for the single currency,
"We are riding a lot on the seriousness building in Europe," said Dan Ascani, editor and publisher of Global Market Strategist, an advisory firm in Gainesville, Ga. "If the solution is not accepted by the market, the magnitude of the crisis developing in Europe would increase dramatically,"

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Jobless Data Push Down Bond Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday, following a report that suggests the labor market is improving and provides more evidence that the Federal Reserve need not cut interest rates.
Weekly first-time jobless claims were down 31,000, to 335,000, from 366,000 the previous week. The decline was much stronger than the expected drop of 7,000, to 358,000. The four-week average, which is considered a better gauge, subject to less volatility, fell to 351,750 from a revised 355,000. 
 Cautious trading was the rule yesterday, some market participants said, as sellers and buyers engaged in a tug-of-war, with prices whipsawing throughout the session.
The 30-year bellwether issue was down 5/32 in the cash market to a price of 10324/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.59 percent, from 6.57 percent on Wednesday.
Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York, said: "Today's numbers provided more evidence that the economy has picked up steam as the third quarter is ending. In particular, the initial claims data and Conference Board's help-wanted index show that the labor market is still in good shape." Mr. Palash expects an increase of 175,000 in next week's nonfarm payroll numbers.
In bond futures trading, which affects trading in the cash market, "prices were range-bound," Robin Mesch, fixed-income analyst at Thomson Research in Portland, Ore., said. "The market is in a period of equilibrium betweeen buyers and sellers," she added, "as the price of the December bond contract moves between 11218/32 and 1139/32 ."
She said that as the market comes into the end of a month and the end of a quarter, traders are a bit jittery trying to position themselves. "We think next quarter is going to play the role of a transitional quarter," Ms. Mesch said, "from a strong uptrend to a period of consolidation."
Ms. Mesch said that would translate to a market range of 114 to 116 at the top, and 10821/32 on the downside, which would be a retest of last quarter's low. Yesterday the December bond contract hit a high of 1139/32 , with a low of 11218/32 , to finish at 113.
"Which end the market is going to put in first is what all this choppy trading has been about for the last three days," she said.
The market today will be subjected to another dose of strong economic data, with the key number being the September Chicago Purchasing Managers index.
"I think the risk is that if it jumps to about 55 percent, from 49.3 in August, this will put it in the range that signals a significant improvement in manfacturing," Mr. Palash said. That, he added, "raises the specter of stronger growth in the fourth quarter and along with it increasing fears about inflation accelerating and little or no chance of a Fed increase this year."
Data on August new-home sales today are likely to show an increase, and that in turn helps explain why the manufacturing sector is doing better.
"Basically, the market is going to be weighed down by strong economic numbers going into next week," Mr. Palash said.
James Hale, a fixed-income analyst at MMS International, said the market had not been giving the economy the credit it deserved. "The market has been underestimating its strength, and we are finally starting to get proof of that from recent data," he said. "Today's examples were the initial claims report and a couple of regional manufacturing surveys."
Traders had been pricing a premium into bonds in the conviction that the Fed would cut rates. Now, that premium "is being priced out as the strong data continues to mount," Mr. Hale said.

HEADLINE: The Missing Man

 BODY:
With one conspicuous exception, the key players in the long, painful search for peace in the Middle East gathered yesterday in the White House East Room to celebrate the biggest and boldest step so far toward coexistence between Israel and the Palestinians.
This historic assemblage included President Clinton and, flanking him, Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli Prime Minister; Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman; President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, and King Hussein of Jordan. They were the most prominent witnesses to the signing of a new agreement transferring essential military and political control over most Arab residents of the West Bank into Palestinian hands. If this agreement works, it will lay the foundation for a settlement between the two peoples at the heart of the Middle East conflict. 
 But as Mr. Rabin noted in his remarks, one vitally important leader was not on hand -- President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, who controls Lebanon's foreign policy too. Syria and Lebanon, alone among Israel's neighbors, stand aloof from the growing regional dynamic of peace. Though formally committed to a negotiated solution, Mr. Assad resists the kind of compromises that make agreements possible. Yet until he accepts Mr. Rabin's invitation to "come to the platform of peace," the Middle East's promising diplomatic and economic transformation will not be complete.
That situation should concern Syria at least as much as it does Israel. Through their peace agreements with Egypt, Jordan and the P.L.O., Israeli leaders have dramatically improved Israel's prospects for security and prosperity. Syria is doing well enough on both counts for the time being. But it cannot afford to isolate itself too much longer from a region increasingly turning its attention to economic development and cross-border cooperation.
Mr. Assad's priorities right now are maintaining political dominance at home, preparing the way for a loyal successor and guarding against any adverse consequences for Syria should Saddam Hussein finally lose his grip over Iraq. Making peace with Israel ranks well behind those concerns.
Mr. Assad does just enough to keep peace talks alive. But he prefers to deal with Israel through low-level intermediaries or America rather than engage his own prestige in the process. Progress therefore has been glacial and intermittent. Talks between military officials on both sides, broken off in recent months, may now be about to resume.
But Israel and Syria remain far apart on the extent and timing of any Israeli military withdrawal from the Golan Heights, monitoring arrangements and the quality of diplomatic normalization Syria is willing to offer in exchange for Israeli withdrawal.
Israel hints at flexibility on all these issues if Syria will engage in high-level direct talks, insisting only on assuring the security of its citizens in northern border areas and continued access to local water resources. But with a momentous West Bank agreement to digest, Israel can wait a bit for Syria to come around. Even if the opposition Likud Party comes to power in next year's Israeli elections, talks with Syria will continue.
At the signing ceremony President Clinton reaffirmed America's commitment to keeping up its diplomatic efforts "until the circle of peace is closed" around all of Israel's borders. How long that may take hinges largely on the choices of yesterday's missing man.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
On Another Planet?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Do the members of the Republican majority in Congress want to swim at beaches polluted by raw sewage? Do they want to live in a country with forests stripped bare, birds disappearing, trout and salmon gone? Do they want toxic wastes draining into sources of the water they drink?
Those would be some of the results of environmental legislation that the Republicans are pressing toward enactment. And one has to wonder why they want to do such things to themselves. For in this area, unlike others, they would be among the victims of their own policy -- unless they plan to live on another planet. 
 They are not likely to be affected by other revolutionary changes they are trying to make in our society. They will not have to go without health care because of changes in Medicaid or Medicare. Their children will not be deprived of welfare. They are not among the working poor whose taxes will rise.
But they breathe the same air as the rest of us, profit from the same beauty and serenity of nature, rely on the same protections against environmental hazards. As Shakespeare might have said, hath not a Congressman senses? If you poison him, does he not die?
The House, under Speaker Newt Gingrich's leadership, voted to cut the Environmental Protection Agency's spending by a third. But the two Houses and their committees have gone far beyond that, writing dozens of ripper provisions into pending appropriation bills. The effect would be to gut our environmental laws.
These are some of the things the bills would do:
* Open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, which may be America's greatest unspoiled ecosystem, to oil and gas drilling.
* Prevent the E.P.A. from keeping possibly toxic fill out of lakes and harbors.
* Deprive the E.P.A. of funds to keep raw sewage out of rivers and away from beaches.
* Prohibit for a year the listing of new endangered species for protection and kill most of the funding to carry out the Endangered Species Act.
* Cut by two-thirds, from 300,000 to 100,000 acres, the wetlands to be bought from farmers by the Agriculture Department for a reserve.
* Increase logging in the Tongass National Forest, a remarkable rain forest in Alaska.
"Congress has set up a virtual environmental exemption bazaar," Gov. John Kitzhaber of Oregon said the other day, "granting special interest after special interest exemption." Serving those special interests must matter more to the Republicans in Congress than the integrity of the environment in which they, too, will live.
The way the Republicans are carrying out their Operation Plunder is revealing. They are making policy in riders attached to appropriation bills, usually without hearings, without debate or votes on the floor, or indeed sometimes in defiance of floor votes.
Last week, for example, the House rejected by a vote of 231 to 180 a bill creating a commission to consider privatizing the management of some national parks. Later the same day the defeated provision was attached to a spending bill.
Several of the exemptions from environmental law are attached to the giant budget reconciliation bill. One of those is the provision for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
Legislation destroying our established and increasingly effective system of protecting the environment is far more important, I think, than the revolutionary changes being made in welfare, Medicaid and other such programs. Particular economic arrangements can always be changed, but the environment is forever. When oil has polluted the Arctic refuge, all the king's horses and all the king's men cannot put it back together again.
Most Americans understand that. They would not be for pollution and the degradation of nature if the issues were put squarely to them. No doubt that is why the Congressional Republicans are trying to slip their ripper provisions through in silence.
President Clinton has said he will veto legislation damaging to the environment, even the budget reconciliation bill. If he keeps that promise, and explains what is at stake, the public will support him.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Listening To Arafat

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
The first time Yasir Arafat went to Washington to sign an agreement with Israel he made two speeches. The first was the formal address, heard around the world. The second was to the Palestinian people, broadcast through Jordanian TV and neither heard nor noted in the West.
In that second speech, he said that the Oslo declaration of peace principles, signed a few hours earlier, was the first step "in the 1974" plan. Every Arab in the Mideast knew what that meant. The Arab strategy drawn up in 1974 called for the "phased" destruction of Israel. 
 But two years later, Mr. Arafat and Israel have signed an even more important agreement -- not a declaration of principle but the actual institution of Israeli withdrawal and Palestinian self-government on the West Bank. That changes the Mideast picture politically and militarily, and is meant to do so irrevocably.
This should be said: Mr. Arafat has become one of the most successful modern leaders of national movements, certainly in the Arab Mideast. He turned the Palestine Liberation Organization from a running feud into a near-state, acknowledged as such around the world. And he did it with the help of the Israeli Government and the U.S., once his designated Satans.
When he is addressed as Mr. President, nobody smirks. He has won from the Israelis most of the conditions of independence: control over territory, an armed force, a legislature, the power of taxation, passports, courts.
Now it is a matter of time before an independent Palestine is recognized. Even foreigners afraid that such a state would be a threat to Israel will find it difficult to make a rational case against independence since the Israeli Government itself created the conditions for it.
Mr. Arafat was near the political end when Oslo was signed. He has given up virtually nothing for the gains he won for Palestinians. But the Israeli Government has profited too. It would be destructive and deceptive to deny that -- particularly by those of us who still worry that the accords can weaken Israeli security.
Jordan and Israel are officially at peace. Near-peace exists with other Arab nations in the Mideast. That means a great deal to every human being -- to begin to feel at home in your own neighborhood.
If Likud wins the next election it will strengthen security controls but is not likely to scrap the accords. Done is done.
Why do so many Israelis fear these agreements, enough to threaten the Labor Government? Some Israelis oppose them for religious reasons. The Rabin Government and its foreign supporters make a political and ethical mistake by treating these Israelis as fanatical idiots. If Israel's security is compromised, there will be no way to tell the difference between the blood of religious or non-observant Jews, or between Labor's and Likud's.
Most Israelis who oppose the agreements are driven not by religion but fear about the area where they believe Israel is losing -- the safety of their nation. That's not strange; the agreements involve land transfers that Labor as well as Likud once said could destroy Israeli security.
That takes us back to the "phases" speech of Mr. Arafat in 1993. It was not an exception then -- nor is it now.
On my desk is a pile of transcripts, tapes and intelligent material about passages of Arafat speeches in the two years since Oslo: jihad, jihad via death, via sacrifices, the "weapons" of jihad and martyrdom. They are violations of his promises to end incitement and hostile propaganda.
Israelis know too well that holy war propaganda brings wars, one after another. How can they trust a man who used it against them when he was on the fringe of power and uses it now that he has achieved it?
The U.S. and Israel have consistently played down jihad rhetoric by Mr. Arafat and the P.L.O. His use of international funds for political purposes and the P.L.O.'s slippery attitude about terrorism are also ignored, covered up or rationalized. Israel and the U.S. became not simply his negotiating partner but his shield.
The time for that should be over. Mr. Arafat must be held politically and economically accountable for holy war incitements to violence. Unless his promises are fulfilled, away from the microphones and cameras, there will be no trust. The accords and their fruit can become not a garden in the desert but one more patch of sand.
